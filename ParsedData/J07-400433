analysis of &#8220;non-constituent coordination&#8221; described in the previous section is, as far as we know, unique to CCG.
    Finally, the lexicalized nature of CCG has implications for the engineering of a widecoverage parser.
    Later we show that use of a supertagger (Bangalore and Joshi 1999) prior to parsing can produce an extremely efficient parser.
    The supertagger uses statistical sequence tagging techniques to assign a small number of lexical categories to each word in the sentence.
    Because there is so much syntactic information in lexical categories, the parser is required to do less work once the lexical categories have been assigned; hence Srinivas and Joshi, in the context of TAG, refer to supertagging as almost parsing.
    The parser is able to parse 20 Wall Street Journal (WSJ) sentences per second on standard hardware, using our best-performing model, which compares very favorably with other parsers using linguistically motivated grammars.
    A further advantage of the supertagg
