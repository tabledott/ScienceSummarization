005).
    Note that in the experiments described in Section 6 we predict the mention types as described there and do not use any gold data.
    The mention type feature is used in all experiments.
    String relation features indicate whether two strings share some property, such as one being the substring of another or both sharing a modifier word.
    Features are listed in Table 1.
    Modifiers are limited to those occurring before the head.
    Feature Definition headi substring of headj modi == (headj or modj) Alias acronym(headi) == headj or lastnamei == lastnamej Another class of features captures the semantic relation between two words.

    Descriptions of the methods for computing these features are described next.
    Gender Match We determine the gender (male, female, or neuter) of the two phrases, and report
