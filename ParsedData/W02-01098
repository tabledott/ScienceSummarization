    The parser module defines a high-level interface for producing trees that represent the structures of texts.
    The chunkparser module defines a sub-interface for parsers that identify nonoverlapping linguistic groups (such as base noun phrases) in unrestricted text.
    Four modules provide implementations for these abstract interfaces.
    The srparser module implements a simple shift-reduce parser.
    The chartparser module defines a flexible parser that uses a chart to record hypotheses about syntactic constituents.
    The pcfgparser module provides a variety of different parsers for probabilistic grammars.
    And the rechunkparser module defines a transformational regular-expression based implementation of the chunk parser interface.
    The tagger module defines a standard interface for augmenting each token of a text with supplementary information, such as its part of speech or its WordNet synset tag; and provides several different implementations for this interface.
