on (Isozaki, 2001), our system is different from Yamada?s system in the fol lowing points: 1) adjustment of word boundaries, 2)ChaSen?s parameters for unknown words, 3) char acter types, 4) use of the Viterbi search.
			For efficient classification, Burges and Scho?lkopf (1997) propose an approximation method that uses ?reduced set vectors?
			instead of support vectors.
			Since the size of the reduced set vectors is smaller than  , classifiers become more efficient, but the computational cost to determine the vectors is verylarge.
			Osuna and Girosi (1999) propose two meth ods.
			The first method approximates +-) by support vector regression, but this method is applicable onlywhen S is large enough.
			The second method reformulates the training phase.
			Our approach is sim pler than these methods.
			Downs et al (Downs et al, 2001) try to reduce the number of support vectors by using linear dependence.
			We can also reduce the run-time complexity of a multi-class problem by cascading SVMs in the form o
