usual reduce actions into smaller pieces (CHECK and BUILD), and uses two separate passes (not including the POS tagging pass) for determining chunks and higher syntactic structures separately.
    Finally, there have been other deterministic shift-reduce parsers introduced recently, but their levels of accuracy have been well below the stateof-the-art.
    The parser in Kalt (2004) uses a similar algorithm to the one described here, but the classification task is framed differently.
    Using decision trees and fewer features, Kalt&#8217;s parser has significantly faster training and parsing times, but its accuracy is much lower than that of our parser.
    Kalt&#8217;s parser achieves precision and recall of about 77% and 76%, respectively (with automatically tagged text), compared to our parser&#8217;s 86% (see section 4).
    The parser of Wong and Wu (1999) uses a separate NP-chunking step and, like Ratnaparkhi&#8217;s parser, does not require a binary transracy, and time required to parse the test set.
