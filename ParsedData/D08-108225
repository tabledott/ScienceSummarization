orms substantially better than all the three previous models, with a notable improvement in the recall score.
    In fact, if we look at the recall scores alone, our best-performing model achieves a 6.7% and 9.8% absolute improvement over two other state-of-the-art models WASP and KRISP respectively.
    This indicates that overall, our model is able to handle over 25% of the inputs that could not be handled by previous systems.
    On the other hand, in terms of F-measure, we gain a 4.1% absolute improvement over KRISP, which leads to an error reduction rate of 22%.
    On the ROBOCUP corpus, our model&#8217;s performance is also ranked the highest1.
    As a generic model that requires minimal assumptions on the natural language, our model is natural language independent and is able to handle various other natural languages than English.
    To validate this point, we evaluated our system on a subset of the GEOQUERY corpus consisting of 250 instances, with four different NL annotations.
    As we can see fr
