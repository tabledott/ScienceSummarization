y, and semantic distance.
  Resnik (1995) attempts to demonstrate the distinction between the first two by way of example.
  ?Cars and gasoline?, he writes, ?would seem to be more closely related than, say, cars and bicycles, but the latter pair are certainly more similar.?
  Similarity is thus a special case of semantic relatedness, and we adopt this perspective in this paper.
  Among other relationships that the notion of relatedness encompasses are the various kinds of meronymy, antonymy, functional association, and other ?non-classical relations?
  (Morris and Hirst 2004).
  The term semantic distance may cause even more confusion, as it can be used when talking about either just similarity or relatedness in general.
  Two concepts are ?close?
  to one another if their similarity or their relatedness is high, and otherwise they are ?distant?.
  Most of the time, these two uses are consistent with one another, but not always; antonymous concepts are dissimilar and hence distant in one sense, and yet are st
