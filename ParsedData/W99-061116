he resulting equivalence classes would still be {{The chairman, he}, {Ms. White}}.
    In this way, the equivalence classes grow in a flexible manner.
    In particular, the clustering algorithm automatically computes the transitive closure of the coreference relation.
    For instance, if dist(NP,,NP3) &lt; r and dist(NP3,NPk) &lt; r then (assuming no incompatible NPs), NP, NP3, and NPk will be in the same class and considered mutually coreferent.
    In fact, it is possible that dist(NPz,NPk)&gt; r, according to the distance measure; but as long as that distance is not oo, NP can be in the same class as NPk.
    The distance measure operates on two noun phrases in isolation, but the clustering algorithm can and does make use of intervening NP information: intervening noun phrases can form a chain that links otherwise distant NPs.
    By separating context-independent and recall levels are fairly low.
    The &amp;quot;adjusted&amp;quot; figures of Table 4 reflect this upper bound on recall.
