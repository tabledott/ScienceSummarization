  In our approach elementary structures are associated with their lexical heads.
  These structures specify extended domains of locality (as compared to a context-free gram- mar) over which constraints can be stated.
  These con- straints either hold within the elementary structure itself or specify what other structures can be composed with a given elementary structure.
  We state the conditions under which context-free based grammars can be lexicalized without changing the
