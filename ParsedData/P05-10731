ms have identified several linguistically motivated features for discriminating arguments and their labels (see Table 1).
    These features usually characterize aspects of individual arguments and the predicate.
    It is evident that the labels and the features of arguments are highly correlated.
    For example, there are hard constraints &#8211; that arguments cannot overlap with each other or the predicate, and also soft constraints &#8211; for example, is it unlikely that a predicate will have two or more AGENT arguments, or that a predicate used in the active voice will have a THEME argument prior to an AGENT argument.
    Several systems have incorporated such dependencies, for example, (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2003) and several systems submitted in the CoNLL-2004 shared task (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004).
    However, we show that there are greater gains to be had by modeling joint information about a verb&#8217;s argument structure.
    We propose a discrimi
