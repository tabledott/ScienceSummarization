onolingual features), we create label-specific versions by conjoining the label pair (`(n), `(n')).
    We use both the typed and untyped variants of all features.
  
  
    Recall that our data condition supplies sentence pairs (s, s') along with gold parse pairs (g, g').
    We do not observe the alignments a which link these parses.
    In principle, we want to find weights which maximize the marginal log likelihood of what we do observe given our sentence pairs:3 Child labels: In addition, we also encode whether w&#8727; = arg max EP(g,a,g0|s,s0,w) (1) certain label pairs occur as children of matched w a nodes.
    Let c(n, `) select the children of n with la- = arg max Ea exp(w&gt;&#966;(g, a, g0)) bel `. w &#65533; &#65533;a exp(w&gt;&#966;(t, a, t0)) (2) (t,t') CHILDLABEL(`, `') = |c(n, `) |&#183; |c(n', `')| Note that the corresponding &#8220;self labels&#8221; feature is not listed because it arises in the next section as a typed variant of the bias feature.
    There are several challenges.
