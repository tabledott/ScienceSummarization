    As we are experimenting on an automaticallyacquired clustering, all the figures are affected by the 22.06% error rate resulting from Table 2.
    As a first experiment, we assessed the effect of the automatic sense clustering on the English allwords task at Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).
    This task required WSD systems to provide a sense choice for 2,081 content words in a set of 301 sentences from the fiction, news story, and editorial domains.
    We considered the three best-ranking WSD systems &#8211; GAMBL (Decadt et al., 2004), SenseLearner (Mihalcea and Faruque, 2004), and Koc University (Yuret, 2004) &#8211; and the best unsupervised system, namely IRST-DDD (Strapparava et al., 2004).
    We also included SSI as it outperforms all the untrained systems (Navigli and Velardi, 2005).
    To evaluate the performance of the five systems on our coarse clustering, we considered a fine-grained answer to be correct if it belongs to the same cluster as that of the correct answer.
