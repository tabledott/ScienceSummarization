ved between two polar clauses as observed in the discourse.
    As the two polar clauses, we consider the following types: Window.
    A polar clause and the nearest polar clause which is found in the preceding n sentences in the discourse.
    Context.
    Two polar clauses in the intrasentential and/or inter-sentential context described in Section 4.1.
    This is the viewpoint of context in our method.
    Table 4 shows the frequencies of coherent pairs, conflicting pairs, and the coherent precision for half of the digital camera domain corpus.
    &#8220;Baseline&#8221; is the percentage of positive clauses among the polar clauses6.
    For the &#8220;Window&#8221; method, we tested for n=0, 1, 2, and oc.
    &#8220;0&amp;quot; means two propositions within a sentence.
    Apparently, the larger the window size, the smaller the cp value.
    When the window size is &#8220;oo&amp;quot;, implying anywhere within a discourse, the ratio is larger than the baseline by only 2.7%, and thus these types of coheren
