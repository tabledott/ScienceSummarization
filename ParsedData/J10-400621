ensor, tuples can become the backbone of a unified model for distributional semantics.
    Different semantic spaces are then generated on demand through the independently motivated operation of tensor matricization, mapping the third-order tensor onto two-way matrices.
    The matricization of the tuple tensor produces both familiar spaces, similar to those commonly used for attributional or relational similarity, and other less known distributional spaces, which will yet prove useful for capturing some interesting semantic phenomena.
    The crucial fact is that all these different semantic spaces are now alternative views of the same underlying distributional object.
    Apparently unrelated semantic tasks can be addressed in terms of the same distributional memory, harvested only once from the source corpus.
    Thus, thanks to the tensor-based representation, distributional data can be turned into a general purpose resource for semantic modeling.
    As a further advantage, the third-order tensor formali
