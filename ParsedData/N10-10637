document alignment in news and web corpora has been explored by a number of researchers, including Resnik and Smith (2003), Munteanu and Marcu (2005), Tillmann and Xu (2009), and Tillmann (2009).
    Since our corpus already contains document alignments, we sidestep this problem, and will not discuss further details of this issue.
    That said, we believe that our methods will be effective in corpora without document alignments when combined with one of the aforementioned algorithms.
    Much of the previous work involves building a binary classifier for sentence pairs to determine whether or not they are parallel (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005; Tillmann, 2009).
    The training data usually comes from a standard parallel corpus.
    There is a substantial class imbalance (O(n) positive examples, and O(n2) negative examples), and various heuristics are used to mitigate this problem.
    Munteanu and Marcu (2005) filter out negative examples with high length difference or low word overlap (based on a bilingual dic
