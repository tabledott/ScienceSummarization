    Evaluation Methodology Agirre and Soroa (2007) present two evaluation schemes for assessing sense induction methods.
    Under the first scheme, the system output is compared to the gold standard using standard clustering evaluation metrics (e.g., purity, entropy).
    Here, no attempt is made to match the induced senses against the labels of the gold standard.
    Under the second scheme, the gold standard is partitioned into a test and training corpus.
    The latter is used to derive a mapping of the induced senses to the gold standard labels.
    The mapping is then used to calculate the system&#8217;s F-Score on the test corpus.
    Unfortunately, the first scheme failed to discriminate among participating systems.
    The onecluster-per-word baseline outperformed all systems, except one, which was only marginally better.
    The scheme ignores the actual labeling and due to the dominance of the first sense in the data, encourages a single-sense approach which is further amp
