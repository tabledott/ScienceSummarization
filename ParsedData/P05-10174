    They reported that the semantic orientations of only 113 words are extracted with precision 84.1% (the low recall is due partly to their large set of seed words (1187 words)).
    The handcrafted rules are only for Japanese.
    Kamps et al. (2004) constructed a network by connecting each pair of synonymous words provided by WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), and then used the shortest paths to two seed words &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; to obtain the semantic orientation of a word.
    Limitations of their method are that a synonymy dictionary is required, that antonym relations cannot be incorporated into the model.
    Their evaluation is restricted to adjectives.
    The method proposed by Hu and Liu (2004) is quite similar to the shortest-path method.
    Hu and Liu&#8217;s method iteratively determines the semantic orientations of the words neighboring any of the seed words and enlarges the seed word set in a bootstrapping manner.
    Subjective words are often semantically oriented.
