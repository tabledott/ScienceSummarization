  2 Lexical izat ion  of  CFGs The domain of locality of CFGs can be easily extended by using a tree rewriting grammar.
  This tree rewriting grammar consists of a set of trees that are not restricted to be of depth one (as in CFGs).
  It uses only substitution as a combining operation.
  Substitution can take place only on non-terminal nodes of the frontier of each tree.
  The language is defined to be the set of strings on the frontiers of trees whose roots are labeled by a distinguished symbol S. It is easy to see that the set of languages generated by this tree rewriting grammar is exactly the same set as context-free languages.
  If no recarsive chain rules exist, it is formally possible to lexicalize a CFG with this tree rewriting grammar, a Recursive chain rules are disallowed since they introduce unbounded structures with no lexical items attached to them.
  Although a CFG can be lexicalized by using trees, it is not poss
