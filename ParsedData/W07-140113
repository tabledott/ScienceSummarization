hey picked sentence pairs with high lexical overlap, preferably where at least one of the sentences was taken from the summary (this sentence usually played the role of t).
    For positive examples, the hypothesis was simplified by removing sentence parts, until it was fully entailed by t. Negative examples were simplified in a similar manner.
    In alternative, &#8220;pyramids&#8221; produced for the experimental evaluation mehod in DUC 2005 (Passonneau et al. 2005) were exploited.
    In this new evaluation method, humans select subsentential content units (SCUs) in several manually produced summaries on a subject, and collocate them in a &#8220;pyramid&#8221;, which has at the top the SCUs with the higher frequency, i.e. those which are present in most summaries.
    Each SCU is identified by a label, a sentence in natural language which expresses the content.
    Afterwards, the annotators individuate the SCUs present in summaries generated automatically (called peers), and link them to the ones present
