rithm for inferring the parameters of a stochastic context-free grammar that can take advantage of constituent information (constituent bracketing) in a partially bracketed corpus.
    The method has been successfully applied to SCFG inference for formal languages and for part-of-speech sequences derived from the ATIS spoken-language corpus.
    The use of partially bracketed corpus can reduce the number of iterations required for convergence of parameter reestimation.
    In some cases, a good solution is found from a bracketed corpus but not from raw text.
    Most importantly, the use of partially bracketed natural corpus enables the algorithm to infer grammars specifying linguistically reasonable constituent boundaries that cannot be inferred by the inside-outside algorithm on raw text.
    While none of this is very surprising, it supplies some support for the view that purely unsupervised, self-organizing grammar inference methods may have difficulty in distinguishing between underlying grammatical stru
