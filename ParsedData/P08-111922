d productivity also performed well, but productivity information by itself seems to perform better in some cases.
    It can be difficult to compare the results of different semantic class learners because there is no standard set of benchmark categories, so researchers report results for different classes.
    For the state and country categories, however, we can compare our results with that of other web-based semantic class learners such as Pasca (Pas&#184;ca, 2007a) and the KnowItAll system (Etzioni et al., 2005).
    For the U.S. states category, our system achieved 100% recall and 100% precision for the first 50 items generated, and KnowItAll performed similarly achieving 98% recall with 100% precision.
    Pasca did not evaluate his system on states.
    For the countries category, our system achieved 100% precision for the first 150 generated instances (77% recall).
    (Pas&#184;ca, 2007a) reports results of 100% precision for the first 25 instances generated, and 82% precision for the first 150 inst
