    The sole member of this intersection is the verb mantic classes such that ci n n cal &gt; c, where E is a relevance cut-off.
    We then reclassified the verbs in the database as follows.
    A verb was assigned membership in an intersective class if it was listed in each of the existing classes that were combined to form the new intersective class.
    Simultaneously, the verb was removed from the membership lists of those existing classes.
    Some of the large Levin classes comprise verbs that exhibit a wide range of possible semantic components, and could be divided into smaller subclasses.
    The split verbs (cut, draw, kick, knock, push, rip, roll, shove, slip, split, etc.) do not obviously form a homogeneous semantic class.
    Instead, in their use as split verbs, each verb manifests an extended sense that can be paraphrased as &amp;quot;separate by V-ing,&amp;quot; where &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; is the basic meaning of that verb (Levin, 1993).
