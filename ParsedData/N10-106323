test sets are summarized in Table 5.
    We evaluated the resulting systems using BLEU4 (Papineni et al., 2002); the results are presented in Table 6.
    First we note that the extracted Wikipedia data are very helpful in medium data conditions, significantly improving translation performance in all conditions.
    Furthermore we found that the extracted Wikipedia sentences substantially improved translation quality on held-out Wikipedia articles.
    In every case, training on medium data plus Wikipedia extracts led to equal or better translation quality than the large system alone.
    Furthermore, adding the Wikipedia data to the large data condition still made substantial improvements.
  
  
    Our first substantial contribution is to demonstrate that Wikipedia is a useful resource for mining parallel data.
    The sheer volume of extracted parallel sentences within Wikipedia is a somewhat surprising result in the light of Wikipedia&#8217;s construction.
    We are also releasing several valuable resour
