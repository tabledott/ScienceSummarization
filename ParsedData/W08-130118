clueless when there is no overt maker of conjunction.
    Another limitation of the tool is the treatment of long-distance dependencies, such as whmovement and control/raising: the system cannot handle long-distance dependencies that cross clauses.
    In a sentence like What does he think?, the system will correctly find that what is a direct object of think: SD dobj(think-4, What-1) aux(think-4, does-2) nsubj(think-4, he-3) However in a sentence such as Who the hell does he think he&#8217;s kidding?
    (BNC), the automatic extraction will fail to find that who is the direct object of kidding.
    Here, it is vital to distinguish between SD as a representation versus the extant conversion tool.
    Long-distance dependencies are not absent from the formalism, but the tool does not accurately deal with them.5
  
  
    SD has been successfully used by researchers in different domains.
    In the PASCAL Recognizing 5As possible future work, we have thought of using a tool such as the one of Levy and Manning (
