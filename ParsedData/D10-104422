ated work, major themes in SMT adaptation include the IR (Hildebrand et al., 2005; L&#168;u et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2004) and mixture (Finch and Sumita, 2008; Foster and Kuhn, 2007; Koehn and Schroeder, 2007; L&#168;u et al., 2007) approaches for LMs and TMs described above, as well as methods for exploiting monolingual in-domain text, typically by translating it automatically and then performing self training (Bertoldi and Federico, 2009; Ueffing et al., 2007; Schwenk and Senellart, 2009).
    There has also been some work on adapting the word alignment model prior to phrase extraction (Civera and Juan, 2007; Wu et al., 2005), and on dynamically choosing a dev set (Xu et al., 2007).
    Other work includes transferring latent topic distributions from source to target language for LM adaptation, (Tam et al., 2007) and adapting features at the sentence level to different categories of sentence (Finch and Sumita, 2008).
  
  
    In this paper we have proposed an approach for instance-weighting phrase pairs
