adwords from a corpus, then generalizing to other, similar words.
    Some approaches have used WordNet for the generalization step (Resnik, 1996; Clark and Weir, 2001; Abe and Li, 1993), others EM-based clustering (Rooth et al., 1999).
    In this paper we propose a new, simple model for selectional preference induction that uses corpus-based semantic similarity metrics, such as Cosine or Lin's (1998) mutual informationbased metric, for the generalization step.
    This model does not require any manually created lexical resources.
    In addition, the corpus for computing the similarity metrics can be freely chosen, allowing greater variation in the domain of generalization than a fixed lexical resource.
    We focus on one application of selectional preferences: semantic role labeling.
    The argument positions for which we compute selectional preferences will be semantic roles in the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) paradigm, and the predicates we consider will be semantic classes of words rather than indiv
