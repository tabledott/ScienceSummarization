plex Boolean combinations of properties, that is, descriptions that involve more than a merely intersective (i.e., logically conjunctive) combination of properties.
    Such generalizations are natural because the properties involved are implicitly present in the KB, as we will explain; they become especially relevant when the algorithms are also generalized to generate references to sets, rather than individual objects.
    But, before we arrive at these generalizations, we will identify and confront a number of cases in which current GRE algorithms are incomplete even with respect to merely intersective descriptions.
    In this paper, we will deal with &#8220;first mention&#8221; descriptions only (unlike Dale 1992, Chapter 5; Mittal et al. 1998; Kibble 1999), assuming that the information used for generating the description is limited to a KB containing complete information about which properties are true of each object.
    Also, we focus on &#8220;one shot&#8221; descriptions, disregarding cases where a
