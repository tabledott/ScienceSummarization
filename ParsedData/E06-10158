 above kernels which include the leaves in the fragment space.
    For this purpose, it is enough to add the condition: 0. if n1 and n2 are leaves and their associated symbols are equal then A(n1, n2) = 1, to the recursive rule set for the A evaluation (Zhang and Lee, 2003).
    We will refer to such extended kernels as ST+bow and SST+bow (bag-ofwords).
    Moreover, we add the decay factor &#955; by modifying steps (2) and (3) as follows1: The computational complexity of Eq.
    1 is O(INT1I x INT21).
    We will refer to this basic implementation as the Quadratic Tree Kernel (QTK).
    However, as observed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002) this worst case is quite unlikely for the syntactic trees of natural language sentences, thus, we can design algorithms that run in linear time on average.
    To compute the kernels defined in the previous section, we sum the A function for each pair (n1,n2)E NT1 x NT2 (Eq.
    1).
    When the productions associated with n1 and n2 are different, we can avoid to evaluate A(n1
