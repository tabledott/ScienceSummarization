ding short textual sentences (tweets) became openly available for the research community.
			Many of these tweets contain a wide vari ety of user-defined hashtags.
			Some of these tagsare sentiment tags which assign one or more senti ment values to a tweet.
			In this paper we propose away to utilize such tagged Twitter data for classi fication of a wide variety of sentiment types from text.
			We utilize 50 Twitter tags and 15 smileys assentiment labels which allow us to build a classifier for dozens of sentiment types for short tex tual sentences.
			In our study we use four different feature types (punctuation, words, n-grams and patterns) for sentiment classification and evaluate the contribution of each feature type for this task.We show that our framework successfully identi fies sentiment types of the untagged tweets.
			We confirm the quality of our algorithm using human judges.
			We also explore the dependencies and overlap between different sentiment types represented by smileys and Twitter tags.
