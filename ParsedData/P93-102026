mmarized in Hirschberg and Litman (1993).
    That is, if a cue word occurs at the beginning of a prosodic phrase, the usage is assumed to be discourse and thus the phrase is taken to be the beginning of a new segment.
    Figure 2 shows 2 boundaries (CUE) assigned by the algorithm, both due to and.
    Table 3 shows the average performance of the cue word algorithm for statistically validated boundaries.
    Recall is 72% (a.=.027; max=.88; min=.40), precision is 15% (a-=.003; max=.23; min=.04), fallout is 53% (a-=.006) and error is 50% (o-=.005).
    While recall is quite comparable to human performance (row 4 of the table), the precision is low while fallout and error are quite high.
    Precision, fallout and error have much lower variance, however.
    Grosz and Hirschberg (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992) found that in a corpus of recordings of AP news texts, phrases beginning discourse segments are correlated with duration of preceding pauses, while phrases ending discourse segme
