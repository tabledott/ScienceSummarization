ciated with it then we retmm the obligatory constraint regarcllelm of the relationship between qt and p, mud q4 and s. if the constraint amsccinted with X is a null adjoining constraint, we seaociate ( qt, qt, CL,, q ), and ( q, r, r, q4 ) with Y and Z resp~tively, and aamcinte the nuU adjoining enustramt with X.
  If the label o( Z is a. where s E ~, then we cboous s ~ q such that 6 ( q, a ) I s. In the nu II adjoining constr~nt c~ule, q is cheeeu such that 6 ( q, a ) == q4.

  Then we shall smucinte (p,q,q,r), (r,qs,qa,s) with Y and Z.

  If qt ~ P or q4 ~ r then we make the constraint obligatory.
