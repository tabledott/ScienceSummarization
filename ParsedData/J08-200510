 Labeling (SRL) Task The goal of the semantic role labeling task is to discover the predicate?argument struc- ture of each predicate in a given input sentence.
  In this work, we focus only on the verb predicate.
  For example, given a sentence I left my pearls to my daughter-in-law in my will, 259 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 the goal is to identify the different arguments of the verb predicate left and produce the output: [A0 I] [V left ] [A1 my pearls] [A2 to my daughter-in-law] [AM-LOC in my will].
  Here A0 represents the leaver, A1 represents the thing left, A2 represents the beneficiary, AM-LOC is an adjunct indicating the location of the action, and V determines the boundaries of the predicate, which is important when a predicate contains many words, for example, a phrasal verb.
  In addition, each argument can be mapped to a constituent in its corresponding full syntactic parse tree.
  Following the definition of the PropBank and CoNLL-2004 and 2005 shared tasks, there are six differ
