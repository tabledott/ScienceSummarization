slightly higher than the rates achieved by the decision tree produced by ID3.
    As the learned decision tree has the search for a same-head antecedent as the first test, we modified our algorithm to work in the same way, and tested it again with the two corpora.
    The results with this configuration were: In other words, the results were about the same, although a slightly better performance was obtained when the tests to identify discourse-new descriptions were tried first.
  
  
    A major difference between our proposal and almost all others (theoretical and implemented) is that we concentrate on definite descriptions; most of the systems we discuss below attempt to resolve all types of anaphoric expressions, often concentrating on pronouns.
    Focusing on definite descriptions allowed us to investigate what types of lexical knowledge and commonsense inference are actually used in natural language comprehension.
    From an architectural standpoint, the main difference between our work and other prop
