inition or- ders such shifts before reductions.
  In summary, this instance of the architecture develops parses in right-association/minlmal-attachment preference order.
  4.3 Generator  Ins tances As a final example of the use of this architecture, we considerusing it for generation by changing the initialization condition as follows: * The init ial ization of the agenda includes axioms for each word in the lexicon at each position (e.g., [O, sonny ,  1] and [0, left, 1] and /1, left, 2/, and so on) and an initial prediction for each rule whose left-hand side is the start symbol of the grammar (e.g., [0, S +- NP VP,0]).
  In the case of a grammar formalism with more complex information structures as nonterminals, e.g., definite-clause grammars, the "start symbol" might include infor- mation about, say, the meaning of the sentence to be generated, We will refer to this as the goal meaning.
  u The success criterion is that the nonterminal be subsumed by the start nonterminal (and therefore have the appropriat
