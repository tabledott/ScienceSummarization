rley parser used for unification-based formalisms no longer exist.
  The use of restrictors as proposed by Shieber (1985) is no longer necessary and the difficulties caused by treating subcategorization as a feature is no longer a problem.
  By assuming that the number of structures associated with a lexical item is finite, since each structure has a lexi- cal item attached to it, we implicitly make the assumption that an input string of finite length cannot be syntactically infinitely ambiguous.
  Since the trees are produced by the input string, the parser can use information that might be non-local to guide the search.
  For example, consider the language gen- erated by the following CFG (example due to Mitch Mar- cus): S ~ A IB A ~ aAlax B -* aBlay This grammar generates the language:{a*x} U {ay}.
  In a standard CFG parsing algorithm, As and Bs will be built until the last token in the input (x or y) is recog- nized.
  It would require unbounded look-ahead to decide which rule (3 -+ A or S ~ B) to choose
