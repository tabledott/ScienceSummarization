 be pursued within generalized systems, such as PairClass (Turney 2008), that require keeping a full corpus around and corpus-processing know-how on behalf of interested researchers from outside the NLP community (see discussion in Section 4 above).
    Similarly, the DM triples might help in fostering the dialogue between computational linguists and the computational neuro-cognitive community, where it is common to adopt triple-based representations of knowledge, and to use the same set of tuples to simulate various aspects of cognition.
    For a recent extended example of this approach, see Rogers and McClelland (2004).
    It would be relatively easy to use a DM model in lieu of their neural network, and use it to simulate the conceptual processes they reproduce.
    DM, unlike classic DSM models that go directly from the corpus data to solving specific semantic tasks, introduces a clear distinction between an acquisition phase (corpus-based tuple extraction and weighting), the declarative structure at th
