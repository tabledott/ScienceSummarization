  Adaptation Of Maximum Entropy Capitalizer: Little Data Can Help A Lot
  
    A novel technique for maximum &#8220;a posteriori&#8221; (MAP) adaptation of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and maximum entropy Markov models (MEMM) is presented.
    The technique is applied to the problem of recovering the correct capitalization of uniformly cased text: a &#8220;background&#8221; capitalizer trained on 20Mwds of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) text from 1987 is adapted to two Broadcast News (BN) test sets &#8212; one containing ABC Primetime Live text and the other NPR Morning News/CNN Morning Edition text &#8212; from 1996.
    The &#8220;in-domain&#8221; performance of the WSJ capitalizer is 45% better than that of the 1-gram baseline, when evaluated on a test set drawn from WSJ 1994.
    When evaluating on the mismatched &#8220;out-ofdomain&#8221; test data, the 1-gram baseline is outperformed by 60%; the improvement brought by the adaptation technique using a very small amount of matched BN data &#8212; 25-70kwds &#8212
