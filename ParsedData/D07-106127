 be written as pi log 12??
			= pi log 2 ? = pi ?.
			Note here an analogy to the case with qj &gt; 0 and where pj is exactly one order of magnitude greater than qj , i.e. pj = 2 ? qj . For such a term in the standard KL divergence, we would get pj log pj qj = pj log(2) = pj . Therefore, the ? term in skew divergence implicitly defines a parameter stating how many orders of magnitude smaller than pj to count qj if qj = 0.
			We define the Zero-KL divergence with respect to 2In Lee?s (1999) original presentation, skew divergence isdefined not as s?(p, q) but rather as s?(q, p).
			We reverse the ar gument order for consistency with the other measures discussed here.
			586 gamma: ZKL?(p, q) = ? i pi { log piqi qi 6= 0 ? qi = 0Note that this is exactly KL-divergence when KLdivergence is defined and, like skew divergence, approx imates KL divergence in the limit as ? ?
			A similar analysis of the skew divergence terms for when 0 &lt; qi  pi (and in particular with qi less than pi by more than a factor of 2??)
