 out some pairwise relations.
    Stage 2 is related to the work of Choueka (1988), and to some extent to what has been done in speech recognition (e.g., Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983; Merialdo 1987; Ephraim and Rabiner 1990).
    In this second stage, Xtract uses the same components used for the first stage but in a different way.
    It starts with the pairwise lexical relations produced in stage 1 and produces multiple word collocations, such as rigid noun phrases or phrasal templates, from them.
    To do this, Xtract studies the lexical relations in context, which is exactly what lexicographers do.
    For each bigram identified at the previous stage, Xtract examines all instances of appearance of the two words and analyzes the distributions of words and parts of speech in the surrounding positions.
    Input: Output of Stage 1.
    Similar to Table 4, i.e., a list of bigrams with their statistical information as computed in stage 1.
    Identical to Stage 1, Step 1.1.
