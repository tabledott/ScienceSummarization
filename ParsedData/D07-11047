hat such a small sample size works as well as the full data.
			However, recent work by Och (2005) and Federico and Bertoldi (2006) has shown that the statistics used by phrase-based systems are not very precise.
			3In the canonical representation of the grammar, source-sidecoindexes are always in sorted order, making them unambigu ous.
			977 ? Nonterminals must span at least two words.
			Adjacent nonterminals are disallowed in the source side of a rule.
			Expressed more economically, we say that our goal is to search for source phrases in the form u, uXv, or uXvXw, where 1 ? |uvw| ? 5, and |v| &gt; 0 in the final case.
			Note that the model also allows rules in the form Xu, uX , XuX , XuXv, and uXvX . However, these rules are lexically identical to other rules, and thus will match the same locations in the source text.
	
	
			On-the-fly lookup using suffix arrays involves an added complication when the rules are in form uXv or uXvXw.
			Binary search enables fast lookup of contiguous substrings.
