nd the stores SS and SO of the subject and object the verb subcategorizes for satisfy the constraint shuffle (SS, SO, SC), meaning that SC is an interleaving of elements of SS and SO in their original order.5 Constraints in grammar rules such as the one above are handled in the generator by the clause generate(lGoalsp call(Goals). which passes the conditions to Prolog for execution.
    This extension must be used with great care, because it is in general difficult to know the instantion state of such goals when they are called from the generator, and as noted before underinstantiated goals may lead to nontermination.
    A safer scheme would rely on delaying the execution of goals until their required instantiation patterns are satisfied (Naish 1986).
    Finally, it is necessary to deal with the noun phrases that create store elements.
    Ignoring the issue of how to treat quantifiers from within complex noun phrases, we need lexical rules for determiners, of the form stating that the semantics of a quanti
