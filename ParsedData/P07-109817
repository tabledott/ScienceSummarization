sentations (processed by previous kernels).
    As test data, we collected the 138 TREC 2001 test questions labeled as &#8220;description&#8221; and for each, we obtained a list of answer paragraphs extracted from Web documents using YourQA.
    Each paragraph sentence was manually evaluated based on whether it contained an answer to the corresponding question.
    Moreover, to simplify the classification problem, we isolated for each paragraph the sentence which obtained the maximal judgment (in case more than one sentence in the paragraph had the same judgment, we chose the first one).
    We collected a corpus containing 1309 sentences, 416 of which &#8211; labeled &#8220;+1&#8221; &#8211; answered the question either concisely or with noise; the rest &#8211; labeled &#8220;-1&#8221;&#8211; were either irrelevant to the question or contained hints relating to the approximately between 2.5 and 5.
    The experiments were organized as follows: First, we examined the contributions of BOW and PT representation
