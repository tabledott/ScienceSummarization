e translation and a set of reference translations.
    Using the example given in Section 3.1: S1. police killed the gunman S2. police kill the gunman S3. the gunman kill police S4. the gunman police killed Each sentence has C(4,2)3 = 6 skip-bigrams.
    For example, S1 has the following skip-bigrams: (&#8220;police killed&#8221;, &#8220;police the&#8221;, &#8220;police gunman&#8221;, &#8220;killed the&#8221;, &#8220;killed gunman&#8221;, &#8220;the gunman&#8221;) S2 has three skip-bigram matches with S1 (&#8220;police the&#8221;, &#8220;police gunman&#8221;, &#8220;the gunman&#8221;), S3 has one skip-bigram match with S1 (&#8220;the gunman&#8221;), and S4 has two skip-bigram matches with S1 (&#8220;police killed&#8221;, &#8220;the gunman&#8221;).
    Given translations X of length m and Y of length n, assuming X is a reference translation and Y is a candidate translation, we compute skip-bigram-based F-measure as follows: Where SKIP2(X,Y) is the number of skip-bigram matches between X and Y, ,B = Pskip2/Rski
