which the product features and opinion expressions are all correctly extracted respectively: OERight and PFRight.
    These two results show that given an exactly extraction of opinion expression and product feature, the results of opinion relation extraction will be much better.
    Further, opinion expressions are more influential which naturally means the opinion expressions are crucial in opinion relation extraction.
    For evaluations on cross domain, the Adjacent method doesn&#8217;t need training data, its results are the same as the in-domain experiments.
    Note in Table 3 and Table 4, we don&#8217;t use domain related features in SVM-1, SVM-WTree, SVMPTree, but SVM-2&#8217;s features are domain dependent.
    Since the cross-domain training set is larger than the original one in Diaper and DVD domain, the models are trained more sufficiently.
    The final results on cross-domain are even better than in-domain experiments on SVM-1, SVM-WTree, and SVM-PTree with percentage of 4.6%, 8.6%, 10.3% in a
