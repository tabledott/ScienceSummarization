ather than predicting local block neighbors as in (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) , here the model parameters are trained in a global setting.
    Starting with a simple model, the training data is decoded multiple times: the weight vector is trained to discriminate block sequences with a high translation score against block sequences with a high BLEU score 2.
    The high BLEU scoring block sequences are obtained as follows: the regular phrase-based decoder is modified in a way that it uses the BLEU score as optimization criterion (independent of any translation model).
    Here, searching for the highest BLEU scoring block sequence is restricted to local re-ordering as is the model-based decoding (as shown in Fig.
    1).
    The BLEU score is computed with respect to the single reference translation provided by the parallel training data.
    A block sequence with an average BLEU score of about is obtained for each training sentence 3.
