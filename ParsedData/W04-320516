), (ii) the relations are compatible (antonymy and happens-before), where presence of one does not imply or rule out presence of the other, and (iii) the relations are incompatible (similarity and antonymy).
    It is not uncommon for our algorithm to identify presence of several relations, with different strengths.
    To produce the most likely output, we use semantics of compatibility of the relations to output the most likely one(s).
    The rules are as follows: If the frequency was too low (less than 10 on the pattern &amp;quot;X * Y&amp;quot; OR &amp;quot;Y * X&amp;quot; OR &amp;quot;X * * Y&amp;quot; OR &amp;quot;Y * * X&amp;quot;), output that the statements are unrelated and stop.
    If happens-before is detected, output presence of happens-before (additional relation may still be output, if detected).
    If happens-before is not detected, ignore detection of enablement (because enablement is more specific than happens-before, but is sometimes falsely detected in the absence of happens-before).
