    Participants could work with the training data as long as they wished.

    In general, FrameNet frames contain many frame elements (perhaps an average of 10), most of which are not instantiated in a given sentence.
    Systems were not penalized if they returned more frame elements than those identified by the FrameNet taggers.
    For the 8002 sentences in the test set,
