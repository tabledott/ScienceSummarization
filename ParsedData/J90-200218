n brief, it works like this: given some initial estimate of the parameters, we can compute the probability of any particular alignment.
    We can then re-estimate the parameters by weighing each possible alignment according to its probability as determined by the initial guess of the parameters.
    Repeated iterations of this process lead to parameters that assign ever greater probability to the set of sentence pairs that we actually observe.
    This algorithm leads to a local maximum of the probability of the observed pairs as a function of the parameters of the model.
    There may be many such local maxima.
    The particular one at which we arrive will, in general, depend on the initial choice of parameters.
  
  
    In our first experiment, we test our ability to estimate parameters for the translation model.
    We chose as our English vocabulary the 9,000 most common words in the English part of the Hansard data, and as our French vocabulary the 9,000 most common French words.
    For the purposes
