groups and newswire in the 2006 test set.
    Most of these domains have characteristics which are different from those of the training data, e.g., broadcast conversations have characteristics of spontaneous speech, and the newsgroup data is comparatively unstructured.
    Given the particular data sets described above, Table 3 shows the various options for the Estimate, Score and Select functions (see Section 3).
    The table provides a quick guide to the experiments we present in this paper vs. those we did not attempt due to computational infeasibility.
    We ran experiments corresponding to all entries marked with &#8727; (see Section 4.2).
    For those marked &#8727;&#8727; the experiments produced only minimal improvement over the baseline and so we do not discuss them in this paper.
    The entries marked as &#8224; were not attempted because they are not feasible (e.g. full re-training on the NIST data).
    However, these were run on the smaller EuroParl corpus.
    We evaluated the generated tran
