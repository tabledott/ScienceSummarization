efix of FORM iLEMMA, POSTAG, FEATS only for back-off smoothing All data sets except German and Swedish had different values for CPOSTAG and POSTAG, although the granularity varied widely.
    Again, there are different approaches to dealing with the redundancy: By design, a FEATS column value has internal structure.
    Splitting it at the &#8216;|&#8217;30 results in a set of components.
    The following approaches have been used: When deciding whether there should be a dependency relation between tokens i and j, all parsers use at least information about these two tokens.
