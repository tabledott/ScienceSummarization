 the conditions for correctness.
    We now describe our normal form for parsers, which is very similar to that used by Shieber, Schabes, and Pereira (1995) and by Sikkel (1993).
    This work can be thought of as a generalization from their work in the Boolean semiring to semirings in general.
    In most parsers, there is at least one chart of some form.
    In our normal form, we will use a corresponding, equivalent concept, items.
    Rather than, for instance, a chart element chart [i, A, j], we will use an item [i, A,]].
    Furthermore, rather than use explicit, procedural descriptions, such as chart[s, A, s +1] := chart[s, A, s +1] v chart[s,B, s+ t] A chart[s+t, C, 9+1] A TRUE we will use inference rules such as The meaning of an inference rule is that if the top line is all true, then we can conclude the bottom line.
    For instance, this example inference rule can be read as saying that if A BC and B w, wk_i and C wk w/_i, then A .
    &#8226; The general form for an inference rule will be where i
