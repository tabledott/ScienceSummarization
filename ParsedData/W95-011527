 be required for a pair of languages like English and Japanese.
    For the case of French and English, each of the presented filters makes a significant improvement over the baseline model.
    Taken together, the filters produce models which approach human performance.
    These conclusions could not have been drawn without a uniform framework for filter comparison or without a technique for automatic evaluation.
    An automatic evaluation technique such as BiBLE should be used to gauge the effectiveness of any MT system which has a lexical transfer component.
    BiBLE's objective criterion is quite simple, with the drawback that it gives no indication of what kinds of errors exist in the lexicon being evaluated.
    Even so, given a test corpus of a reasonable size, it can detect very small differences in quality between two N-best translation lexicons.
    For example, BiBLE evaluations were used to find the precise optimum value for the LCSR cut-off in the Cognate Filter.
    BiBLE also helped to selec
