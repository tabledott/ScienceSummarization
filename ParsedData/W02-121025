rsity (Oepen et al. 2002) should be applicable to this grammar as well.
  
  
    The grammar currently covers 93.4% of constructed examples for the banking domain (747 sentences) and 78.2% of realistic email correspondence data (316 sentences), concerning requests for documents.
    During three months of work, the coverage in the banking domain increased 48.49%.
    The coverage of the document request data increased 51.43% in the following two weeks.
    We applied the grammar to unseen data in one of the covered domains, namely the FAQ site of a Japanese bank.
    The coverage was 61%.
    91.2% of the parses output were associated with all well-formed MRSs.
    That means that we could get correct MRSs in 55.61% of all sentences.
  
  
    We described a broad coverage Japanese grammar, based on HPSG theory.
    It encodes syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic information.
    The grammar system is connected to a morphological analysis system and uses default entries for words unknown to the HPSG lexicon.
