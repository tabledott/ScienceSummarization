    A number of different approaches to evaluation have been proposed in the past.
    First, early work used an informal evaluation of manually comparing the clusters or dendrograms produced by the algorithms with the authors' intuitive judgment of the lexical categories.
    This is inadequate for a number of obvious reasons &#8212; first it does not allow adequate comparison of different techniques, and secondly it restricts the languages that can easily be studied to those in which the researcher has competence thus limiting experimentation on a narrow range of languages.
    A second form of evaluation is to use some data that has been manually or semi-automatically annotated with part of speech (POS) tags, and to use some information theoretic measure to look at the correlation between the 'correct' data and the induced POS tags.
    Specifically, one could look at the conditional entropy of the gold standard tag
