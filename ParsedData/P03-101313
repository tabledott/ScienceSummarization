imized on the development set).
    We also tested variants of the baseline model and the C&amp;R model that include grammatical function information, as we hypothesized that this information might help the model to handle wordorder variation more adequately, as explained above.
    Finally, we tested variant of the C&amp;R model that uses Lopar&#8217;s parameter pooling feature.
    This feature makes it possible to collapse the lexical choice distribution Pchoice for either the daughter or the mother categories of a rule (see Section 3.2).
    We pooled the estimates for pairs of conjoined and nonconjoined daughter categories (S and CS, NP and CNP, etc.
    ): these categories should be treated as the same daughters; e.g., there should be no difference between S &#8212;* NP V and S &#8212;* CNP V. We also pooled the estimates for the mother categories NPs and PPs.
    This is a way of dealing with the fact that there is no separate NP node within PPs in Negra.
    Lopar and the Collins model differ in their
