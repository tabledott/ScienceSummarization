baseline algontlims that select important units randomly It follows that our program outperforms significantly the one found in the Office97 package We are not aware of any other summarization program that can build summaries with granularity as fine as a clause (as our program can)
  
  
    We described the first experiment that shows that the concepts of rhetoncal analysis and nucleanty can be used effectively for summarizing text The experiment suggests that discourse-based methods can account for detemmimg the most important units in a text with a recall and precision as high as 70% We showed how the concepts of rhetorical analysis and nucleanty can be treated algorithmically and we compared recall and precision figures of a summarization program that implements these concepts with recall and precision figures that pertain to a baseline algorithm and to a commercial system, the Microsoft Office97 summarizer The discourse-based summanzation program that we propose outperforms both the baseline and the com
