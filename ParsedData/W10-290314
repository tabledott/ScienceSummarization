ctures as being suboptimal.
    Negative feedback indicates that the structure should not be added to the training pool as it will introduce noise into the learning process.
    Algorithm 2 outlines the learning in more detail.
    As before, y&#65533; and z&#65533; are predicted using the current weight vector and feedback received (lines 4 and 5).
    When positive feedback is received a new training instance for a structured learner is created from the input sentence and prediction (line 7) this training instance replaces any previous instance for the input sentence.
    When negative feedback is received the training pool Sl is not updated.
    A weight vector is learned using a structured learner where the training data S contains at most one example per input sentence.
    In the first iteration of the outer loop the training data S will contain very few examples.
    In each subsequent iteration the newly learned weight vector allows the algorithm to acquire new examples.
    This is repeated until no
