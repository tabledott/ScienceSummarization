 exactly twice the cardinality of the MTG, and each of the boundaries can range over 0(n) possible positions.
    Thus, the space complexity of Parser A for an MTG G is in 0(1Ni D n2C (G) ) If G is bilexical, then the number of possible nonterminals hides a factor of nD , raising the space complexity of Parser A to 0 (ID np +2C (G)) The time complexity of Parser A depends on how many boundaries are shared between antecedent items in A.0 rules.
    In the best case, all the boundaries are shared except the two outermost boundaries in each dimension, and the inferred item is contiguous.
    In the worst case, no boundaries are shared, and the inferred item stores all the boundaries of the antecedent items.
    In any case, if y and z are the cardinalities of the composed items, and x is the cardinality of the inferred item, then the number of free boundaries in an A.0 inference is x + y + z.
    Thus, in the worst case, the number of free boundaries involved in an A.0 inference is 3C(G).
