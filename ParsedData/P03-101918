about 96% is obtained with the extended ITG constraints.
    Thus with the extended ITG constraints, the coverage increases by about 8% absolute.
    For the Canadian Hansards task, the baseline ITG constraints yield a worse coverage than the IBM constraints.
    Especially for the English-French translation direction, the ITG coverage of 73.6% is very low.
    Again, the extended ITG constraints obtained the best results.
    Here, the coverage increases from about 87% for the IBM constraints to about 96% for the extended ITG constraints.
  
  
    In our experiments, we use the following error criteria: The WER is computed as the minimum number of substitution, insertion and deletion operations that have to be performed to convert the generated sentence into the target sentence.
    For each test sentence, not only a single reference translation is used, as for the WER, but a whole set of reference translations.
    For each translation hypothesis, the WER to the most similar sentence is calculated (Nie&#22
