re not meaningful unless one can evaluate them on the same corpus.
    Unfortunately, there is no standard corpus of Chinese texts, tagged with either single or multiple human judgments, with which one can compare performance of various methods.
    One hopes that such a corpus will be forthcoming.
    Finally, we wish to reiterate an important point.
    The major problem for our segmenter, as for all segmenters, remains the problem of unknown words (see Fung and Wu [1994]).
    We have provided methods for handling certain classes of unknown words, and models for other classes could be provided, as we have noted.
    However, there will remain a large number of words that are not readily adduced to any productive pattern and that would simply have to be added to the dictionary.
    This implies, therefore, that a major factor in the performance of a Chinese segmenter is the quality of the base dictionary, and this is probably a more important factor&#8212;from the point of view of performance alone&#8212;th
