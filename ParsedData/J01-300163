ur experiments the exact match figure is computed at the LDOCE sense level, where the number of tokens correctly disambiguated to the sense level is divided by the number ambiguous at that level.
    At the homograph level, the number correctly disambiguated to the homograph is divided by the number which are polyhomographic.
  
  
    Using the evaluation procedure described in the previous section, it was found that the system correctly disambiguated 90% of the ambiguous instances to the fine-grained sense level, and in excess of 94% to the homograph level.
    In order to analyze the effectiveness of our tagger in more detail, we split the main corpus into sub-corpora by grammatical category.
    In other words, we created four individual sub-corpora containing the ambiguous words which had been partof-speech tagged as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
    The figures characterizing each of these corpora are shown in Table 7.
    The majority of the ambiguous words were nouns, with far fewer verbs and
