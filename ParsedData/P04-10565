e illustrated with examples in Sections 4 and 5 where the clique templates used in our model are described in detail.
    Depending on the number of hidden labels in we define two categories of clique templates: After the graph model for a document d has been completed with cliques from all templates, the probability distribution over the random field of hidden entity labels d.Y given the observed features d.X is computed as: The above distribution presents the RMN as a Markov random field (MRF) with the clique templates as a method for tying potential values across different cliques in the graphical model.
  
  
    Like most entity names, almost all proteins in our data are base noun phrases or parts of them.
    Therefore, such substrings are used to determine candidate entities.
    To avoid missing options, we adopt a very broad definition of base noun phrase.
    Definition 1: A base noun phrase is a maximal contiguous sequence of tokens whose POS tags are from { &amp;quot;JJ&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;VBN&am
