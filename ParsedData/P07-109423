 2I(C, C&#8242;).
    Even when accuracy can be measured, VI may be more informative: two different tag assignments may have the same accuracy but different VI with respect to the gold standard if the errors in one assignment are less consistent than those in the other.
    Table 3 gives the results for this set of experiments.
    One or both versions of BHMM outperform MLHMM in terms of tag accuracy for all values of d, although the differences are not as great as in earlier experiments.
    The differences in VI are more striking, particularly as the amount of dictionary information is reduced.
    When ambiguity is greater, both versions of BHMM show less confusion with respect to the true tags than does MLHMM, and BHMM2 performs the best in all circumstances.
    The confusion matrices in Figure 3 provide a more intuitive picture of the very different sorts of clusterings produced by MLHMM and BHMM2 when no tag dictionary is available.
    Similar differences hold to a lesser degree when a partial dictio
