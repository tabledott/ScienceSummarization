ouns are simply translated into strictly right-branching binary trees, which yields the correct analysis in some, but not all, cases.
    This eschews the computational problem that a grammar for compound nouns induces all possible binary bracketings, but is linguistically incorrect.
    A similar problem arises in compound nouns that involve internal coordination: We include the following (linguistically incorrect) rule in our grammar, which yields a default dependency structure corresponding to N/N coordination: conj N &#8658; N (56) This rule allows us to translate the above tree as follows: N/N cotton N N conj and N N fibers The Treebank markup of NP appositives is indistinguishable from that of NP lists: Therefore, our current grammar does not distinguish between appositives and NP coordination, even though appositives should be analyzed as predicative modifiers.
    This leads to a reduction of ambiguity in the grammar, but is semantically incorrect: Our current grammar does not implement number agreeme
