he mapping for the transitive verb category (S[dcl]\NP1)/NP2: Argument slot 1 is a non-clausal subject and argument slot 2 is a direct object.
    In the example Kim likes juicy oranges, likes is associated with the transitive verb category, Kim is the subject, and oranges is the head of the constituent filling the object slot, leading to the following GRs: (ncsubj likes Kim ) and (dobj likes oranges).
    The third row shows an example of a modifier: (S\NP)/(S\NP) modifies a verb phrase to the right.
    Note that, in this example, the order of the lexical category (%l) and filler (%f) is switched compared to the previous example to match the DepBank annotation.
    There are a number of reasons why creating the dependency transformation is more difficult than these examples suggest.
    The first problem is that the mapping from CCG dependencies to GRs is many-to-many.
    For example, the transitive verb category (S[dcl]\NP)/NP applies to the copular in sentences like Imperial Corp. is the parent of Imperi
