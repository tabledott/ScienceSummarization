g, we say that a tee set contains trees with dependent paths if there are two paths p., = vim., and g., = in each 7 E r such that v., is some, possibly empty, shared initial subpath; v., and wi are not bounded in length; and there is some &amp;quot;dependence&amp;quot; (such as equal length) between the set of all v., and w., for each 7 Er.
    A tree set may be said to have dependencies between paths if some &amp;quot;appropriate&amp;quot; subset can be shown to have dependent paths as defined above.
    We attempt to formalize this notion in terms of the tee pumping lemma which can be used to show that a tee set does not have dependent paths.
    Thatcher (1973) describes a tee pumping lemma for recognizable sets related to the string pumping lemma for regular sets.
    The tee in Figure 9a can be denoted by t1 i223 where tee substitution is used instead of concatenation.
    The tee pumping lemma states that if there is tree, t = 22 t2t3, generated by a CFG G, whose height is more than a predetermined boun
