list.
    We were surprised, and a little disappointed that the straight overlap of neighbours did not give a significant relationship, other than for the overlap of 30 neighbours.
    We believe this is due to the large scope for open class words as neighbours, and that there is often some element of meaning added by the particle.
    Thus the overlap where we reduce neighbours of the phrasal to simplex form compensated for this.
    We have not yet explored varying the number of neighbours for methods other than the overlap and overlapS.
    We feel that it would be worth exploring the effect of the number of neighbours further, and also to use the similarity scores of the neighbours, rather than simple measures operating on the types occurring as neighbours.
    This would help control for the fact that for some verbs there are not many close neighbours and neighbours further down the ranked list may in fact be quite distant.
    Whilst statistics are useful indicators of noncompositionality, there are com
