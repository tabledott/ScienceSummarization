ram types (one-tailed t-tests found no significant differences between the correlation coefficients).
    The correlation between BNC counts and Web counts reached the upper limit for noun-noun and verb-object bigrams (no significant differences for either search engine) and significantly exceeded it for adjective-noun bigrams for AltaVista (t(87) = 3.16, p &lt; .01) and Google (t(87) = 3.26, p &lt; .01).
    We conclude that simple heuristics (see Section 2.3) are sufficient to obtain useful frequencies from the Web; it seems that the large amount of data available for Web counts outweighs the associated problems (noisy, unbalanced, etc.).
    We found that Web counts were highly correlated with frequencies from two different corpora.
    Furthermore, Web counts and corpus counts are as highly correlated as counts from two different corpora (which can be regarded as an upper bound).
    Note that Tables 8 and 9 also provide the correlation coefficients obtained when corpus frequencies are compared with frequ
