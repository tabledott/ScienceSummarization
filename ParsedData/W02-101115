xEnt makes no assumptions about the relationships between features, and so might potentially perform better when conditional independence assumptions are not met.
    The &#57738;i,c&#8217;s are feature-weight parameters; inspection of the definition of PME shows that a large &#57738;i,c means that fi is considered a strong indicator for than zero are called support vectors, since they are the only document vectors contributing to &#57740;w.
    Classification of test instances consists simply of determining which side of &#57740;w&#8217;s hyperplane they fall on.
    We used Joachim&#8217;s (1999) SVMlight package8 for training and testing, with all parameters set to their default values, after first length-normalizing the document vectors, as is standard (neglecting to normalize generally hurt performance slightly).
  
  
    We used documents from the movie-review corpus described in Section 3.
    To create a data set with uniform class distribution (studying the effect of skewed class distributions was o
