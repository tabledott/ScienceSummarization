 that the classifier is not misled like the learners.
			Finally, a surprising difference comes from looking at what to is confused with.
			The model often suggests at where to would be correct.
			This is perhaps not entirely unusual as both can occur with locative complements (one can go to a placeor be at a place) and this similarity could be con fusing the classifier.
			Learners, however, although they do make this kind of mistake, are much more hampered by the confusion between for and to, as in She was helpful for me or This is interesting for you.
			In other words, for learners it seems that the abstract use of this preposition, its benefactive sense, is much more problematic than the spatial sense.
			We can hypothesise that the classifier is less distracted by these cases because the effect of the lexical features is stronger.
			A more detailed discussion of the issues arising from the comparison of confusion pairs cannot be had here.
			However, in noting both divergences and similarities betwee
