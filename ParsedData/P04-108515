e aim to detect cases of mismatch between a correct pragmatic interpretation and the surface form of the utterance, e.g. the case of weak or &#8220;empty&#8221; agreement, which has some properties of downright agreement (lexical items of positive polarity), but which is commonly considered to be a disagreement (Pomerantz, 1984).
    While the actual classification problem incorporates four classes, the BACKCHANNEL class is igTable 3.
    Local features for agreement and disagreement classification nored here to make the empirical study easier to interpret.
    We assume in that study that accurate AP labeling is available, but for the purpose of building and testing a classifier, we use only automatically extracted adjacency pair information.
    We tested the validity of four pragmatic assumptions: dency: a tag is influenced by , the most recent tag of the same speaker addressing the same listener; for example, it might be reasonable to assume that if speaker B disagrees with A, B is likely to disagree with
