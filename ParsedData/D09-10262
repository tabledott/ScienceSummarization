 a task we call tag-specific snippet extraction.
    And when a user browses to a particular document, a tag-augmented user interface might provide overview visualization cues highlighting which portions of the document are more or less relevant to the tag, helping the user quickly access the information they seek.
    One simple approach to these challenges can be found in models that explicitly address the credit attribution problem by associating individual words in a document with their most appropriate labels.
    For instance, in our news story about the transportation bill, if the model knew that the word &#8220;highway&#8221; went with transportation and that the word &#8220;politicians&#8221; went with politics, more relevant passages could be extracted for either label.
    We seek an approach that can automatically learn the posterior distribution of each word in a document conditioned on the document&#8217;s label set.
    One promising approach to the credit attribution problem lies in the machin
