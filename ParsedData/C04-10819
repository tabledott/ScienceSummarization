			k ?2k 2?2k (2) where ?2k is the variance for feature dimension k. The variance can be feature dependent.
			However for simplicity, constant variance is often used for all features.
			We experiment an alternate version ofGaussian prior in which the variance is feature dependent.
			We bin features by frequency in the train ing set, and let the features in the same bin share the same variance.
			The discounted value is set to be ?k dck/Me??2 where ck is the count of features, M is the bin size set by held out validation, and dae is the ceiling function.

			2.2 State transition features.
			Varying state-transition structures with different Markov order can be specified by different CRF feature functions, as determined by the number ofoutput labels y examined together in a feature func tion.
			We define four different state transition feature functions corresponding to different Markov orders.Higher-order features capture more lon
