n be done in the Treebank-to-chunk conversion script2) influences the chunking task.
    Most PP chunks just consist of one word (the preposition) with the part-of-speech tag IN.
    This does not mean, though, that finding PP chunks is completely trivial.
    INs can also constitute an SBAR chunk (see below) and some PP chunks contain more than one word.
    This is the case with fixed multi-word prepositions such as such as, because of, due to, with prepositions preceded by a modifier: well above, just after, even in, particularly among or with coordinated prepositions: inside and outside.
    We think that PPs behave sufficiently differently from NPs in a sentence for not wanting to group them into one class (as Ramshaw and Marcus did in their N-type chunks), and that on the other hand tagging all NP chunks inside a PP as I-PP would only confuse the chunker.
    We therefore chose not to handle the recognition of true PPs (prep.+NP) during this first chunking step.
    SBAR chunks mostly consist of one wor
