    We refer to the features that are added incrementally during the parsing process as dynamic features.
  
  
    We use Kyoto University text corpus (Version 2.0) consisting of articles of Mainichi newspaper annotated with dependency structure(Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997).
    7,958 sentences from the articles on January 1st to January 7th are used for the training data, and 1,246 sentences from the articles on January 9th are used for the test data.
    For the kernel function, we used the polynomial function (9).
    We set the soft margin parameter C to be 1.
    The feature set used in the experiments are shown in Table 1.
    The static features are basically taken from Uchimoto's list(Uchimoto et al., 1999) with little modification.
    In Table 1, 'Head' means the rightmost content word in a chunk whose part-of-speech is not a functional category.
    'Type' mewls the rightmost functional word or the inflectional form of the rightmost predicate if there is no functional word in the chunk.
