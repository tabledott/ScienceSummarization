  The withoutfeatures row shows the score after 3 iterations of refinement with an empty feature set.
    Here we can see that our model in its simplest form is capable of producing a significant improvement in alignment quality.
    The rows with ftd only and with fta only describe the scores after 3 iterations of training using only dependency and adjacency features respectively.
    The two features provide significant contributions, with the adjacency feature being slightly more important.
    The final row shows that both features can work together to create a greater improvement, despite the independence assumptions made in Section 2.
    Even though we have compared our algorithm to alignments created using IBM statistical models, it is not clear if our model is essential to our performance.
    This experiment aims to determine if we could have achieved similar results using the same initial alignment and search algorithm with an alternative model.
    Without using any features, our model is similar
