.
			However, this was a pilot study, which is limited to words with exactly two translation candidates, and it is not clear that the conclusions would generalize to more recent SMT architectures.
	
	
			The close relationship between WSD and SMT has been emphasized since the emergence of WSD asan independent task.
			However, most of previous re search has focused on using multilingual resourcestypically used in SMT systems to improve WSD ac curacy, e.g., Dagan and Itai (1994), Li and Li (2002), 63 Diab (2004).
			In contrast, this paper focuses on theconverse goal of using WSD models to improve ac tual translation quality.Recently, several researchers have focused on de signing WSD systems for the specific purpose oftranslation.
			Vickrey et al (2005) train a logistic regression WSD model on data extracted from auto matically word aligned parallel corpora, but evaluateon a blank filling task, which is essentially an eval uation of WSD accuracy.
