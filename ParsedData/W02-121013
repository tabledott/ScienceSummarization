    In the case of kureru, it is with the recipient.
    We model this within the sign by positing a feature EMPATHY within CONTEXT and linking it to the relevant arguments' indices.
  
  
    In the multilingual context in which this grammar has been developed, a high premium is placed on parallel and consistent semantic representations between grammars for different languages.
    Ensuring this parallelism enables the reuse of the same downstream technology, no matter which language is used as input.
    Integrating MRS representations parallel to those used in the ERG into the Japanese grammar took approximately 3 months.
    Of course, semantic work is on-going, as every new construction treated needs to be given a suitable semantic representation.
    For the most part, semantic rep
