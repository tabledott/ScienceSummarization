he source (Chinese) sentence and the parse trees of its reference translation and the two hypothesis translations (English) is given in Table 1.
    Each row in this table shows the alignment between a node in the Chinese parse-tree and nodes in the reference and the two hypothesis parse-trees.
    The computation of the Bitree Loss function and the Bitree Error Rate is presented in the last two rows of the table.
    In Table 2 we compare various translation loss functions for the example from Figure 1.
    The two hypothesis translations are very similar at the word level and therefore the BLEU score, PER and the WER are identical.
    However we observe that the sentences differ substantially in their syntactic structure (as seen from Parse-Trees in Figure 3), and to a lesser extent in their word-to-word alignments (Figure 1) to the source sentence.
    The first hypothesis translation is parsed as a sentence while the second translation is parsed as a noun phrase.
