e domain-specific solutions.
    They include: The problem of text coherence can be characterized in specific terms as follows.
    Assuming that input elements are sentence- or clause-sized chunks of representation, the permutation set of the input elements defines the space of possible paragraphs.
    A simplistic, brute-force way to achieve coherent text would be to search this space and pick out the coherent paragraphs.
    This search would be factorially expensive.
    For example, in paragraph (b) above, the 7 input clusters received from PEA provide 7!
    = 5,040 candidate paragraphs.
    However, by utilizing the constraints imposed by coherence, one can formulate operators that guide the search and significantly limit the search to a manageable size.
    In the example, the operators described below produced only 3 candidate paragraphs.
    Then, from this set of remaining candidates, the best paragraph can be found by applying a relatively simple evaluation metric.
