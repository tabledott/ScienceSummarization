larity methods tends to either compare sets of distributionally similar words to a manually created semantic resource (Lin, 1998; Curran and Moens, 2002) or be orientedtowards a particular task such as language mod elling (Dagan et al, 1999; Lee, 1999).
			The first approach is not ideal since it assumes that the goal of distributional similarity methods is topredict semantic similarity and that the semantic resource used is a valid gold standard.
			Further, the second approach is clearly advanta geous when one wishes to apply distributional similarity methods in a particular application area.
			However, it is not at all obvious that oneuniversally best measure exists for all applica tions (Weeds and Weir, 2003).
			Thus, applying adistributional similarity technique to a new ap plication necessitates evaluating a large number of distributional similarity measures in addition to evaluating the new model or algorithm.
			We propose a shift in focus from attemptingto discover the overall best distributional s
