ies and relations.
    Note that LP does not apply learning at all, but still outperforms pipeline, which uses entity predictions as new features in learning.
    The results of the omniscient classifiers reveal that there is still room for improvement.
    One option is to apply learning to tune a better cost function in the LP approach.
    One of the more significant results in our experiments, we believe, is the improvement in the quality of the decisions.
    As mentioned in Sec.
    1, incorporating constraints helps to avoid inconsistency in classification.
    It is inpi = teresting to investigate how often such mistakes happen without global inference, and see how effectively the global inference enhances this.
    For this purpose, we define the quality of the decision as follows.
    For an active relation of which the label is classified correctly, if both its argument entities are also predicted correctly, we count it as a coherent prediction.
    Quality is then the number of coherent prediction
