    This data was used by Choi (2000) to compare various domain-independent text segmentation systems.6 He evaluated (Choi, 2000), TextTiling (Hearst, 1994), DotPlot (Reynar, 1998), and Segmenter (Kan et al., 1998) by using the data and reported that achieved the best performance among these systems.
    The data description is as follows: &#8220;An artificial test corpus of 700 samples is used to assess the accuracy and speed performance of segmentation algorithms.
    A sample is a concatenation of ten text segments.
    A segment is the first sentences of a randomly selected document from the Brown corpus.
    A sample is characterised by the range .&#8221; (Choi, 2000) Table 1 gives the corpus statistics. racy.
    The sample texts were preprocessed &#8211; i.e., punctuation and stop words were removed and the remaining words were stemmed &#8211; by a program using the libraries available in Choi&#8217;s package.
    The texts were then segmented by the systems listed in Tables 2 and 3.
