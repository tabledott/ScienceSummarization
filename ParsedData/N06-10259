we use include path length based measures (Rada et al., 1989; Wu &amp; Palmer, 1994; Leacock &amp; Chodorow, 1998), as well as ones based on information content (Resnik, 1995; Jiang &amp; Conrath, 1997; Lin, 1998).
    In our case, the measures are obtained by computing the similarity scores between the head lemmata of each potential antecedent-anaphor pair.
    In order to overcome the sense disambiguation problem, we factorise over all possible sense pairs: given a candidate pair, we take the cross product of each antecedent and anaphor sense to form pairs of synsets.
    For each measure WN SIMILARITY, we compute the similarity score for all synset pairs, and create the following features.
    WN SIMILARITY BEST the highest similarity score from all (SENSEREi&#65533;ry,,, SENSEREj&#65533;m) synset pairs.
    WN SIMILARITY AVG the average similarity score from all (SENSEREi&#65533;ry,,, SENSEREj&#65533;m) synset pairs.
    Pairs containing REs which cannot be mapped to WordNet synsets are assumed to have a
