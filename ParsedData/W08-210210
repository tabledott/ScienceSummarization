 particular, it is important that given this definition of l, it is possible to define a function GRM(l) that maps a label l to a triple of nonterminals that represents the grammatical relation between m and h in the dependency structure.
    For example, in the tree shown in figure 1(a), the grammatical relation between cake and ate is the triple GRM(l) = (VP VBD NP).
    In the tree shown in figure 1(b), the grammatical relation between cake and ate is the triple GRM(l) = (VP VP NP).
    The conditions under which a pair (E, D) forms a valid derivation for a sentence x are similar to those in conventional LTAGs.
    Each (i, &#951;) E E must be such that &#951; is an elementary tree whose anchor is the word xi.
    The dependencies D must form a directed, projective tree spanning words 0 ... n, with * at the root of this tree, as is also the case in previous work on discriminative approches to dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005).
    We allow any modifier tree &#951;m to adjoin into any position in a
