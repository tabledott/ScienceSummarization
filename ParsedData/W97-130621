asonable number of relevant documents.
    The coreference would only help the scores of presumably relevant documents, but at the expense of missing some relevant documents.
    A higher recall, lower precision algorithm would potentially add more irrelevant documents.
    A direct application of the &amp;quot;ambiguity noticing&amp;quot; ability of CogNIAC is in checking the coherence of pronoun use in text for children and English as a second language learners.
    Ambiguous pronoun use is a substantial problem for beginning writers and language learners.
    CogNIAC could scan texts as they are being written and evaluate whether there was sufficient syntactic support from the context to resolve the pronoun--if not, then the user could be notified of a potentially ambiguous use.
    It is not clear that CogNIAC's current levels of performance could support such an application, but it is a promising application.
    Information extraction amounts to filling in template like data structures from free text.
