 in this section is aimed at determining how well the method presented above can distinguish +S verbs from -S verbs.
    Let P-s be an estimate of 7,.
    It is conceivable that P(m+,n,p_s) might not be a good predictor of whether or not a verb is +S, regardless of the estimate p&#8222;.
    For example, if the correspondence between the cues and the structures they are designed to detect were quite weak, then many -S verbs might have lower P(m+,n,p,) than many +S verbs.
    This experiment measures the accuracy of binomial hypothesis testing on the data collected by Lerner's cues as a function of p_s.
    In addition to showing that P(m+,n,p_s) is good for distinguishing +S and -S verbs, these data provide a baseline against which to compare methods for estimating the error rate 7r_s.
    Method The cues described in Section 2 were applied to the Brown Corpus (untagged version).
    Equation 2 was applied to the resulting data with a cutoff of P(m+,n,p,) &lt; .02 and p &#8222; varying between 2-5 (1 error in
