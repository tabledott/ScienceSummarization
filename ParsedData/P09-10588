describe our new approach to leverage additional examples of unknown words.
    Intuition suggests that even though the system can handle some unknown words, many unidentified unknown words remain that cannot be recovered by the system; we wish to learn the characteristics of such unidentified unknown words.
    We propose the following simple scheme: Several types of errors are produced by the baseline model, but we only focus on those caused by unidentified unknown words, which can be easily collected in the evaluation process.
    As described later in Section 5.2, we measure the recall on out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
    Here, we define unidentified unknown words as OOV words in each validation set that cannot be recovered by the system.
    After ten cross validation runs, we get a list of the unidentified unknown words derived from the whole training corpus.
    Note that the unidentified unknown words in the cross validation are not necessary to be infrequent words, but some overlap may exist.
