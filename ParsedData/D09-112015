ference pattern which we will leverage in Section 3.2 to mine semantic knowledge.
    As with appositives, we annotate object predicate-nominative NPs and constrain coreference as before.
    This yields a minor improvement to 55.5 F1.
    While appositives and related syntactic constructions can resolve some cases of non-pronominal reference, most cases require semantic knowledge about the various entities as well as the verbs used in conjunction with those entities to disambiguate references (Kehler et al., 2008).
    However, given a semantically compatible mention head pair, say AOL and company, one might expect to observe a reliable appositive or predicative-nominative construction involving these mentions somewhere in a large corpus.
    In fact, the Wikipedia page for AOL10 has a predicate-nominative construction which supports the compatibility of this head pair: AOL LLC (formerly America Online) is an American global Internet services and media company operated by Time Warner.
