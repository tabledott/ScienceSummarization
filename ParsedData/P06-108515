722; is n&#8722; + 1.
    Using these equations we can simply proceed through the data, sampling each potential boundary point in turn.
    Once the Gibbs sampler converges, these samples will be drawn from the posterior distribution P(h1d).
    In our experiments, we used the same corpus that NGS and MBDP were tested on.
    The corpus, supplied to us by Brent, consists of 9790 transcribed utterances (33399 words) of childdirected speech from the Bernstein-Ratner corpus (Bernstein-Ratner, 1987) in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney and Snow, 1985).
    The utterances have been converted to a phonemic representation using a phonemic dictionary, so that each occurrence of a word has the same phonemic transcription.
    Utterance boundaries are given in the input to the system; other word boundaries are not.
    Because our Gibbs sampler is slow to converge, we used annealing to speed inference.
    We began with a temperature of -y = 10 and decreased -y in 10 increments to a final value of 1.
    A temperature o
