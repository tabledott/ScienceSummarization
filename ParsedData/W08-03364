t this assumption is false: aspects of segmenters other than error rate are more critical to their performance when embedded in an MT system.
    Unless these issues are attended to, simple baseline segmenters can be more effective inside an MT system than more complex machine learning based models, with much lower word segmentation error rate.
    In this paper, we show that even having a basic word segmenter helps MT performance, and we analyze why building an MT system over individual characters doesn&#8217;t function as well.
    Based on an analysis of baseline MT results, we pin down four issues of word segmentation that can be improved to get better MT performance.
    (i) While a feature-based segmenter, like a support vector machine or conditional random field (CRF) model, may have very good aggregate performance, inconsistent context-specific segmentation decisions can be quite harmful to MT system performance.
    (ii) A perceived strength of feature-based systems is that they can generate out-of-v
