ronoun of a particular gender along a coreferent path, we count this as an instance of that noun being that gender.
    In the end, the probability that the noun is a particular gender is the proportion of times it was connected to a pronoun of that gender along a coreferent path.
    Gender information becomes a single intuitive, accessible feature (i.e. the probability of the noun being that gender) rather than Bergsma&#8217;s 20-dimensional feature vector requiring search-engine queries to instantiate.
    We acquire gender and number data for over 3 million nouns.
    We use add-one smoothing for data sparsity.
    Some example gender/number probabilities are given in Table 4 (cf.
    (Ge et al., 1998; Cherry and Bergsma, 2005)).
    We get a performance of 90.3% (Table 3), again meeting our requirements of high performance and allowing for a fast, practical implementation.
    This is lower than Bergsma&#8217;s top score of 92.2% (Figure 3), but again, Bergsma&#8217;s top system relies on Google search q
