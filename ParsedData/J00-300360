ount of training data, and, principally, assumptions made about what information is available for &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; (e.g., hand-transcribed versus automatically recognized words, or segmented versus unsegmented utterances).
    Thus, we will focus on the conceptual aspects of previous research efforts, and while we do offer a summary of previous quantitative results, these should be interpreted as informative datapoints only, and not as fair comparisons between algorithms.
    Previous research on DA modeling has generally focused on task-oriented dialogue, with three tasks in particular garnering much of the research effort.
    The Map Task corpus (Anderson et al. 1991; Bard et al.
    1995) consists of conversations between two speakers with slightly different maps of an imaginary territory.
    Their task is to help one speaker reproduce a route drawn only on the other speaker's map, all without being able to see each other's maps.
    Of the DA modeling algorithms described below, Taylor et al. (1
