then the result is 76%.
    For definitions longer than 10 words this latter figure tails off, mainly due to misapplication of such statistically induced, but nevertheless structural, attachment preferences.
    Figure 11 summarizes these results.
    We also parsed a further 55 LDOCE noun definitions not drawn from the training corpus, each containing up to 10 words (mean length 5.7).
    Of these, in 41 cases the correct parse is the most highly ranked, in 6 cases it is the second or third most highly ranked, and in the remaining 8 cases it is not in the first three analyses.
    This yields a correct parse/sentence measure of 75%.
    Examination of the failures again reveals that a preference for local attachment of postmodifiers accounts for 5 cases, a preference for compounds for 1, and the misanalysis of a single constituent for 2.
    The others are mostly caused by the lack of lexical entries with appropriate SUBCAT features.
    In Figure 12 we show the analysis for the unseen definition of affectat
