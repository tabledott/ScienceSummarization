tree accuracy, for both p &lt; 0.05).
    Similar results were.achieved-for&#8226; the,yormalized quality metric: (r(,) = 0.16 and r(.,9) = .0.33: for simple accuracy and generation accuracy, for both p &gt; 0.05), (r(,)) = 0.45 and r(,) = 0.42, for tree accuracy and generation tree accuracy, for both p &lt; 0.05).
    A second aim of our qualitative evaluation was to test various models of the relationship between intrinsic variables and qualitative user judgments.
    We proposed a number- of-models7in-which Aratiou conibinations of intrinsic metrics were used to predict user judgments of understanding and quality.
    .We conducted a series of linear regressions with normalized judgments of understanding and quality as the dependent measures and as independent measures different combinations of one of our four metrics with sentence length, and with the &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; variables that we used to define the string metrics (S, I, D, Al, , D' - see Section 3 for definitions).
