oval: Bush administration plans to take complete unilateral control of post-Saddam Hussein Iraq The third and fourth types of iterative shortening are the removal of trailing PPs and SBARs, respectively: These are the riskiest of the iterative shortening rules, as indicated in our analysis of the human-generated headlines.
    Thus, we apply these conservatively, only when there are no other categories of rules to apply.
    Moreover, these rules are applied with a backoff option to avoid over-trimming the parse tree.
    First the PP shortening rule is applied.
    If the threshold has been reached, no more shortening is done.
    However, if the threshold has not been reached, the system reverts to the parse tree as it was before any PPs were removed, and applies the SBAR shortening rule.
    If the threshold still has not been reached, the PP rule is applied to the result of the SBAR rule.
    Other sequences of shortening rules are possible.
    The one above was observed to produce the best results on a
