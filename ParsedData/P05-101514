niques for finding minimum s-t cuts in graphs (Ishikawa and Geiger, 1998; Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih, 1999; Ishikawa, 2003).
    Interestingly, previous sentiment analysis research found that a minimum-cut formulation for the binary subjective/objective distinction yielded good results (Pang and Lee, 2004).
    Of course, there are many other related semi-supervised learning algorithms that we would like to try as well; see Zhu (2005) for a survey.
  
  
    We need to specify an item similarity function to use the metric-labeling formulation described in Section 3.3.
    We could, as is commonly done, employ a term-overlap-based measure such as the cosine between term-frequency-based document vectors (henceforth &#8220;TO(cos)&#8221;).
    However, Table 2 respond to different versions of nearest-neighbor learning, e.g., majority-vote, weighted average of labels, or weighted median of labels. test where is monotonically increasing (we chose unless otherwise specified) and is a trade-off and/or scaling parame
