 stage for selecting the proposed translation.
    The 45 collocations were randomly selected from a larger set of 300 collocations so that the Dice coefficient's performance on them is representative (i.e., approximately 70% of them are translated correctly by Champollion when the Dice measure is used), and the correct translation is always included in the final set of candidate translations.
    In this way, the number of erroneous decisions made when SI is used at the final pass is a lower bound on the number of errors that would have been made if SI had also been used in the intermediate stages.
    We compared the results and found that out of the 45 source collocations, Table 3 summarizes these results and shows the breakdown across categories.
    In the table, the numbers of collocations correctly and incorrectly translated when the Dice coefficient is used are shown in the second and third rows respectively.
    For both cases, the second column indicates the number of collocations that were correctl
