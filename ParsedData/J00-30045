on.
    Thus many documents that are completely irrelevant to the query will be returned, causing the precision of information retrieval to decrease greatly.
    Similar problems occur in word-based compression, speech recognition, and so on.
    It is true that most search engines allow the user to search for multiword phrases by enclosing them in quotation marks, and this facility could be used to search for multicharacter words in Chinese.
    This, however, runs the risk of retrieving irrelevant documents in which the same characters occur in sequence but with a different intended segmentation.
    More importantly, it imposes on the user an artificial requirement to perform manual segmentation on each full-text query.
    Word segmentation is an important prerequisite for such applications.
    However, it is a difficult and ill-defined task.
    According to Sproat et al. (1996) and Wu and Fung (1994), experiments show that only about 75% agreement between native speakers is to be expected on the &amp;q
