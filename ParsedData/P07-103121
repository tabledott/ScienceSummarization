ount for the disparate cross-validation figures.
    On this data, the lexical features perform the best, which is to be expected given the nature of the corpus.
    The best model in this case comes from using all the features.
    We can also look at the impact of our new annotations upon full statistical parsing.
    We use Bikel&#8217;s implementation (Bikel, 2004) of Collins&#8217; parser (Collins, 1999) in order to carry out these experiments, using the non-deficient Collins settings.
    The numbers we give are labelled bracket precision, recall and F-scores for all sentences.
    Bikel mentions that base-NPs are treated very differently in Collins&#8217; parser, and so it will be interesting to observe the results using our new annotations.
    Firstly, we compare the parser&#8217;s performance on the original Penn Treebank and the new NML and JJP bracketed version.
    Table 8 shows that the new brackets make parsing marginally more difficult overall (by about 0.5% in F-score).
    The performance on
