    Geographic Topic Model This is the full version of our system, as described in this paper.
    To predict the unseen location yd, we iterate until convergence on the variational updates for the hidden topics zd, the topic proportions 9d, and the region rd.
    From rd, the location can be estimated as yd = &#65533;J argmaxy j p(y|vj, Aj)q(rd = j).
    The development set is used to tune the number of topics and to select the best of multiple random initializations.
    Mixture of Unigrams A core premise of our approach is that modeling topical variation will improve our ability to understand geographical variation.
    We test this idea by fixing K = 1, running our system with only a single topic.
    This is equivalent to a Bayesian mixture of unigrams in which each author is assigned a single, regional unigram language model that generates all of his or her text.
    The development set is used to select the best of multiple random initializations.
