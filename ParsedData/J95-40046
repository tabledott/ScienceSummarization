P(Tag, I Tagi_iTag1_2)) and the result of multiplying different combinations of these probabilities together.
    Below, we describe a new approach to corpus-based natural language processing, called transformation-based error-driven learning.
    This algorithm has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, and syntactic parsing (Brill 1992; Brill 1993a; Brill 1993b; Brill and Resnik 1994; Brill 1994).
    We have also recently begun exploring the use of this technique for letter-to-sound generation and for building pronunciation networks for speech recognition.
    In this approach, the learned linguistic information is represented in a concise and easily understood form.
    This property should make transformation-based learning a useful tool for further exploring linguistic modeling and attempting to discover ways of more tightly coupling the underlying linguistic systems and our approximating models.
