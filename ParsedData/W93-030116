by a Gaussian with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 102.
    We have found it useful to make use of three filters to deal with robustness issues.
    Empirically, we found that both high frequency and low frequency words caused difficulties and therefore connections involving these words are filtered out.
    The thresholds are set to exclude the most frequent function words and punctuations, as well as words with less than 3 occurrences.
    In addition, following a similar filter by Brown et al., small values of t( f le) are set to 0 after each iteration of the EM algorithm because these small values often correspond to inappropriate translations.
    Finally, connections to null are ignored.
    Such connections model French words that are often omitted in the English translation.
    However, because of OCR errors and other sources of noise, it was decided that this phenomenon was too difficult to model.
    Some words will not be aligned because of these heuristics.
    It may not be necessary, howe
