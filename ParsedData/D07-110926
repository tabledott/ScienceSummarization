e to ambiguous ones to ?explain away?
			the usage of ambiguous terms in selectional restrictions.
			We have adapted these approaches and put them into the context of a topic model.
			Recently, other approaches have created ad hoc connections between synsets in WORDNET and then considered walks through the newly created graph.
			Given the difficulties of using existing connections in WORDNET, Mihalcea (2005) proposed creating links between adjacent synsets that might comprise a sentence, initially setting weights to be equal to the Lesk overlap between the pairs, and then using the PageRank algorithm to determine the stationary distribution over synsets.

			Yarowsky was one of the first to contend that ?there is one sense for discourse?
			(1992).
			This has lead to the approaches like that of Magnini (Magnini et al., 2001) that attempt to find the category of a text, select the most appropriate synset, and then assign the selected sense using domain annotation attached to WORDN
