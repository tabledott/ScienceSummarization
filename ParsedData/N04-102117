 Syntax-based MT has shown promise in the work of, among others, Wu and Wong (1998) and Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas (2000).
    We hope that adding features based on Treebank-based syntactic analyses of the source and target sentences will address grammatical errors in the output of the baseline system.
    The most straightforward way to integrate a statistical parser in the system would be the use of the (log of the) parser probability as a feature function.
    Unfortunately, this feature function did not help to obtain better results (it actually seems to significantly hurt performance).
    To analyze the reason for this, we performed an experiment to test if the used statistical parser assigns a higher probability to presumably grammatical sentences.
    The following table shows the average log probability assigned by the Collins parser to the 1-best (produced), oracle and the reference translations: We observe that the average parser log-probability of the 1-best translation is higher than the ave
