ediction of classifier F1.
    By setting k &gt; 1, fine-grained distinctions (related to intrinsic sub-classes of target classes) can be learned.
    From a c-way classification problem, c!=(c &#8212; k)! binary prediction problems can be created.
  
  
    Using auxiliary problems introduced above, we study the performance of our semi-supervised learning method on named entity chunking and syntactic chunking.
    This section describes the algorithmic aspects of the experimental framework.
    The taskspecific setup is described in Sections 5 and 6.
    In our experiments, we use an extension of SVDASO.
    In NLP applications, features have natural grouping according to their types/origins such as &#8216;current words&#8217;, &#8216;parts-of-speech on the right&#8217;, and so forth.
    It is desirable to perform a localized optimization for each of such natural feature groups.
    Hence, we associate each feature group with a submatrix of structure matrixO.
    The optimization algorithm for this extensio
