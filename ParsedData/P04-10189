7) to (8), entities other than the one in focus, , are assumed to have no influence on the decision of linking with .
    (9) further assumes that the entity-mention score can be obtained by the maximum mention pair score.
    The model (9) is very similar to the model in (Morton, 2000; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002) while (8) has more conditions.
    We use maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996) for both the mention-pair model (9) and the entity-mention model (8): where is a feature and is its weight; is a normalizing factor to ensure that (10) or (11) is a probability.
    Effective training algorithm exists (Berger et al., 1996) once the set of features is selected.
    The basic features used in the models are tabulated in Table 1.
    Features in the lexical category are applicable to non-pronominal mentions only.
    Distance features characterize how far the two mentions are, either by the number of tokens, by the number of sentences, or by the number of mentions in-between.
