 1 rather than 2.
    Then we get 6 out of 7 for the 1-depth subtrees.
    For the 2depth subtrees, we get S&#8594;NP VP, NP&#8594;PRON, and VP&#8594;V NP which also appear in the reference syntax tree.
    For the same reason, the subtree NP&#8594;PRON can only be counted once.
    Then we get 3 out of 4 for the 2-depth subtree.
    Similarly, the fraction of 3-depth subtrees is 1 out of 2.
    Therefore, the final score of STM is (6/7+3/4+1/2)/3=0.702.
    While the subtree overlap metric defined above considers only subtrees of a fixed depth, subtrees of other configurations may be important for discriminating good hypotheses.
    For example, we may want to look for the subtree: to find sentences with transitive verbs, while ignoring the internal structure of the subject noun phrase.
    In order to include subtrees of all configurations in our metric, we turn to convolution kernels on our trees.
    Using H(x) to denote the vector of counts of all subtrees found in tree x, for two trees T1 and T2, the in
