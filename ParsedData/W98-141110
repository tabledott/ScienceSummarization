not have a complex model of focus development through the text, though development of such a model would be worthwhile.
    As McKeown and others have done, we prefer certain transitions over others.
    If consecutive facts mention the same entities or verb, the prospects for aggregation are greater, and this is usually desirable.
    We score as follows: -9 for a fact (apart from the first) not mentioning any previously mentioned entity -3 for a fact not mentioning any entity in the previous fact, but whose subject is a previously mentioned entity +3 for a fact retaining the subject of the last fact as its subject +3 for a fact using the same verb as the previous one Object Introduction When an entity is first introduced as the subject of a fact, it is usual for that to be a very general statement about the entity.

    We score as follows: +3 for the first fact with a given entity as subject having verb &amp;quot;is&amp;quot;
