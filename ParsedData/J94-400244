se structure would no doubt improve the performance of a structurally based algorithm such as RAP.
    At the very least, formatting information concerning paragraph and section boundaries, list elements, etc., should be taken into account.
    A treatment of definite NP resolution would also presumably lead to more accurate resolution of pronominal anaphora, since it would improve the reliability of the salience weighting mechanism.
    However, some current discourse-based approaches to anaphora resolution assign too dominant a role to coherence and focus in antecedent selection.
    As a result, they establish a strong preference for intersentential over intrasentential anaphora resolution.
    This is the case with the anaphora resolution algorithm described by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987).
    This algorithm is based on the centering approach to modeling attentional structure in discourse (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, 1986).22 Constraints and rules for centering are applied by the algorithm
