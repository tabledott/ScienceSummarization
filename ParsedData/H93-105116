ifications for each sense, and the off- diagonal elements how classification errors.
  For exam- ple, the entry containing 5 in the bottom row of Table 2 means that 5 contexts whose correct sense is the product sense were classified as the phone sense.
  Ten heavily weighted tokens for each sense for each clas- sifter appear in Table 1.
  The words on the list seem, for the most part, indicative of the target sense.
  How- ever, there are some consistent differences among the methods.
  For example, whereas the Bayesian method is sensitive to proper nouns, the neural network appears to have no such preference.
  To test the hypothesis that the methods have different response patterns, we performed the X 2 test for corre- lated proportions.
  This test measures how consistently the methods treat individual test contexts by determin- ing whether the classifiers are making the same classifica- tion errors in each of the senses.
  For each sense, the test compares the off-diagonal elements of a matrix whose colum
