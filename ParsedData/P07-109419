assume an improper uniform prior), and use a single Metropolis-Hastings update (Gilks et al., 1996) to resample the value of each hyperparameter after each iteration of the Gibbs sampler.
    Informally, to update the value of hyperparameter &#945;, we sample a proposed new value &#945;&#8242; from a normal distribution with p = &#945; and a = .1&#945;.
    The probability of accepting the new value depends on the ratio between P(t|w, &#945;) and P(t|w, &#945;&#8242;) and a term correcting for the asymmetric proposal distribution.
    Performing inference on the hyperparameters allows us to relax the assumption that every tag has the same prior on its output distribution.
    In the experiments reported in the following section, we used two different versions of our model.
    The first version (BHMM1) uses a single value of Q for all word classes (as above); the second version (BHMM2) uses a separate Qj for each tag class j.
  
  
    In this set of experiments, we used the full tag dictionary (as above), bu
