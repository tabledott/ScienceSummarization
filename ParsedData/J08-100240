umber of assigned entries exceeds n, or the accumulated probability exceeds c. If this procedure does not assign a lexical entry necessary to produce a correct parse (i.e., an oracle lexical entry), it is added to the list of lexical entries.
    It should be noted that oracle lexical entries are given by the HPSG treebank.
    This assures that the filtering method does not exclude correct parse trees from parse forests.
    Figure 19 shows an example of filtering the lexical entries assigned to saw.
    With c = 0.95, four lexical entries are assigned.
    Although the lexicon includes other lexical entries, such as a verbal entry taking a sentential complement (p = 0.01 in the figure), they are filtered out.
    Although this method reduces the time required for parsing a treebank, this approximation causes bias in the training data and results in lower accuracy.
    The tradeoff between parsing cost and accuracy will be examined experimentally in Section 5.4.
    We have several ways to integrate p&#175;
