reordering patterns as n increases.
    The form of reordering rules, and the calculation of reordering probability for a particular node, can also be generalized easily.6 The only problem for the generalized reordering knowledge is that, as there are more classes, data sparseness becomes more severe.
  
  
    The last three sections explain how the S &#8212;*nxS' part of formula 2 is done.
    The S'&#8212;*T part is simply done by our re-implementation of PHARAOH (Koehn, 2004).
    Note that nonmonotonous translation is used here since the distance-based model is needed for local reordering.
    For the nxT &#8212;* T&#65533; part, the factors in consideration include the score of T returned by the decoder, and the reordering probability Pr(S &#8212;* S').
    In order to conform to the log-linear model used in the decoder, we integrate the two factors by defining the total score of T as formula 3: The first term corresponds to the contribution of syntax-based reordering, while the second term that of the
