 by chance.
    After analyzing the results, we find that 24.95%, 8.79%, and 7.16% of the paraphrases achieve sentence compression, simplification, and similarity computation, respectively, which are much lower than our method.
    Previous research regarded sentence compression, simplification, and similarity computation as totally different problems and proposed distinct method for each one.
    Therefore, it is interesting to compare our method to the application-specific methods.
    However, it is really difficult for us to reimplement the methods purposely designed for these applications.
    Thus here we just conduct an informal comparison with these methods.
    Sentence compression: Sentence compression is widely studied, which is mostly reviewed as a word deletion task.
    Different from prior research, Cohn and Lapata (2008) achieved sentence compression using a combination of several operations including word deletion, substitution, insertion, and reordering based on a statistical model, which is
