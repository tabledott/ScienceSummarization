llation and screening, the two processes of CS.
    The program is syntax-driven, a form of control carried over from the structure of earlier programs by Boguraev (1979) and Huang (1985), on which meta5 is based.
    Meta5 analyzes sentences, discriminates the seven kinds of semantic relation between pairs of word senses in those sentences (i.e., the program recognizes metonymies, metaphors, and so on), and resolves any lexical ambiguity in those sentences.
    Meta5 analyzes all the sentences given in Sections 3 and 4, plus a couple more metaphorical sentences discussed in Section 7.
    Below are simplified versions of some of the metonymic inference rules used in meta5.
    The metonymic concepts used in CS contain three key elements: the conceptual relationship involved, the direction of inference, and a replacement of the source or target.
    The metonymic inference rules in meta5 contain all three key elements.
    The rules, though written in a prolog-like format, assume no knowledge of Prolog on the
