1987; 1989) (in which the matrix clause is adjoined into the embedded clause) cannot be transferred, and in fact no linguistically plausible TAG analysis appears to be available.
    In the past, variants of TAG have been developed to extend the range of possible analyses.
    In Multi-Component TAG (MCTAG) (Joshi, 1987), trees are grouped into sets which must be adjoined to- (multicomponent adjunction).
    However, MCexpressive power since, while syntactic relations are invariably subject to c-command or dominance constraints, there is no way to state that Mary OBJ hotdog claim SUBJ spicyhe I MOD small adore COMP COMP Mary OBJ seem hotdog claim MOD SUBJ spicy small he COMP seamSUBJ 152 two trees from a set must be in a dominance relain the derived tree.
    Domination et al., 1991) are multicomponent systems that allow for the expression of dominance constraints.
    However, MCTAG-DL share a further problem with MCTAG: the derivation structures cannot be given a linguistically meaningful interpretation.
