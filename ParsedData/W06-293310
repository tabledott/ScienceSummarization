s of the Swedish results reveals a high accuracy for function words, which is compatible with previous studies (Nivre, 2006).
    Thus, the labeled F-score is 100% for infinitive markers (IM) and subordinating conjunctions (UK) , and above 95% for determiners (DT).
    In addition, subjects (SS) have a score above 90%.
    In all these cases, the dependent has a configurationally defined (but not fixed) position with respect to its head.
    Arguments of the verb, such as objects (DO, IO) and predicative complements (SP), have a slightly lower accuracy (about 85% labeled F-score), which is due to the fact that they &#8220;compete&#8221; in the same structural positions, whereas adverbials (labels that end in A) have even lower scores (often below 70%).
    The latter result must be related both to the relatively fine-grained inventory of dependency labels for adverbials and to attachment ambiguities that involve prepositional phrases.
    The importance of this kind of ambiguity is reflected also in the drast
