at results from chunking/shallow parsing (Zhang et al., 2001; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Veenstra and van den Bosch, 2000).
    Future work includes the investigation of the effects of individual features, the use of additional classification features, and the use of different classifiers.
    In particular, the use of tree features seems appealing.
    This may be accomplished with SVMs using a tree kernel, or the tree boosting classifier BACT described in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004).
    Additionally, we plan to investigate the use of the beam strategy of Ratnaparkhi (1997) to pursue multiple parses while keeping the run-time linear.
