ted to different domains and text genres.
    The model is particularly relevant for multidocument summarization since it could provide an alternative to chronological ordering especially for documents where publication date information is unavailable or uninformative (e.g., all documents have the same date).
    We proposed Kendall&#8217;s &#964; as an automated method for evaluating the generated orders.
    There are a number of issues that must be addressed in future work.
    So far our evaluation metric measures order similarities or dissimilarities.
    This enables us to assess the importance of particular feature combinations automatically and to evaluate whether the model and the search algorithm generate potentially acceptable orders without having to run comprehension experiments each time.
    Such experiments however are crucial for determining how coherent the generated texts are and whether they convey the same semantic content as the originally authored texts.
