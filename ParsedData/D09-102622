window as the expected probability that the tag had generated each word.
    For SVMs, each window was taken as its own document and scored using the tag-specific SVM&#8217;s un-thresholded scoring function, taking the window with the most positive score.
    While a complete solution to the tag-specific snippet extraction quality as extracted by L-LDA and SVM.
    The center column is the number of document-tag pairs for which a system&#8217;s snippet was judged superior.
    The right column is the number of snippets for which all three annotators were in complete agreement (numerator) in the subset of document scored by all three annotators (denominator). problem might be more informed by better linguistic features (such as phrase boundaries), this experimental setup suffices to evaluate both kinds of models for their ability to appropriately assign words to underlying labels.
    Figure 3 shows some example snippets output by our system for this document.
    Note that while SVMs did manage to select snip
