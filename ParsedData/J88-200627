t; RTb.
    Thus if po(Cb,Ea,RTb) = Eb, the event Eb described by 8b is taken to be prior to Ea.
    As Moens &amp; Steedman (this volume) point out, the consequences of an event described with a perfect tense are still assumed to hold.
    Hence the overlap shown in Figure 5: The next example illustrates ,conseq: 13. a. John went into the florist shop. b.
    He picked out three red roses, two white ones and one pale pink.
    Clause 13a evokes an entity Ea describable as John's going into a flower shop.
    Since Clause 13b is simple past, ETb = RTb.
    Thus given pconseq(Cb,Ea,RTb) = Eb, event Eb is taken as being part of the consequent phase of Ea.
    That is, John's picking out the roses is taken as happening after his going into the florist shop.
    This is shown in Figure 6.
    The next example illustrates the case of pprep: To summarize, I have claimed that: 1. the notion of specification makes sense with respect to tensed clauses; 2. one can describe the anaphoric relation in terms of the RT of a
