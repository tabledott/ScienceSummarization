ntered.
    To a first approximation, a CURRENT-FOCUS reaches only nodes that are c-commanded (Chomsky 1977) by its generator.
    Finally, certain blocker nodes block the transfer of the FLOAT-OBJECT to their children.
    A simple example will help explain how this works.
    For the sentence &amp;quot;(How many pies), did Mike buy (t,)?&amp;quot; as illustrated by the parse tree in Figure 3, the [qsubject] &amp;quot;how many pies&amp;quot; is a generator, so it fills the CURRENT-FOCUS with its subparse.
    The [do-question] is an activator; it moves the CURRENT-FOCUS into the FLOAT-OBJECT position.
    Finally, the object of &amp;quot;buy,&amp;quot; an absorber, takes the [q-subject] as its subparse.
    The [do-question] refuses to accept any solutions from its children if the FLOAT-OBJECT has not been absorbed.
    Thus, the sentence &amp;quot;How many pies did Mike buy the pies?&amp;quot; would be rejected.
    Furthermore, the same [do-question] grammar node deals with the yes/no question &amp;quot;Di
