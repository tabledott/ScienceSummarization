 be small.
    Another obstacle to extracting predicate-argument structure from parse trees is whmovement.
    This section describes a probabilistic treatment of extraction from relative clauses.
    Noun phrases are most often extracted from subject position, object position, or from within PPs: It might be possible to write rule-based patterns that identify traces in a parse tree.
    We argue again, however, that this task is best integrated into the parser: The task is complex enough to warrant a probabilistic treatment, and integration may help parsing accuracy.
    A couple of complexities are that modification by an SBAR does not always involve extraction (e.g., the fact (SBAR that besoboru is played with a ball and a bat)), and it is not uncommon for extraction to occur through several constituents (e.g., The changes (SBAR that he said the government was prepared to make TRACE)).
    One hope is that an integrated treatment of traces will improve the parameterization of the model.
    In particular,
