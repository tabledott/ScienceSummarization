 FEM NEU For exainple, the FS f l  AGR[nnm: NUM] subsumes the FS f9 AGR[num: PLUR, gen(ler: FEM] because f2 has more specifc information than f l  : no gender is spec- ified in fl, and the number value of f2 PLUR is more specific than the number value off l ,  NUM.
  Typed unification proceeds as ordinary unification for FSs, recnrsively corot)thing substructures at the same paths.
  When two (typed) FSs are unified, frst the type symbols are unified, and if this unifica- tion succeeds, the FSs are unified.
  Unification of two types X and Y is defined .
  as the set of) mostgeneral type(s) which is smaller than both x and Y: ~t is the greatest lower bound (GLB) of these two symbols in the lattice of type syml)ols.
  If taso types are di- rectly comparable, the smallest iv the result of the unification: HUM M PLUR = PLUR.
  This extension is consistent with the definition of the unifier of two FSs ~s the GLB of these structures (see, for exam- pie, [16]).
