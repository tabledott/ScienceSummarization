    For every pair of nouns, where each noun had a total frequency in the triple data of 10 or more, we computed their distributional similarity using the measure given by Lin (1998).
    If is the set of co-occurrence types such that is positive then the similarity between two nouns, and , can be computed as: where: A thesaurus entry of size for a target noun is then defined as the most similar nouns to .
    We use the WordNet Similarity Package 0.05 and WordNet version 1.6.
    2 The WordNet Similarity package supports a range of WordNet similarity scores.
    We experimented using six of these to provide the in equation 1 above and obtained results well over our baseline, but because of space limitations give
