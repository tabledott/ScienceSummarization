r-by-link matrix, such as qualia harvesting with patterns or generating lists of characteristic properties, can be elegantly recast in the W1W2xL space by measuring the length of (w1,w2) vectors in a link (sub)space, thus bringing a wider range of semantic operations under the umbrella of the natural DM spaces.
    The W1W2xL space represents pairs of words that co-occur in the corpus within the maximum span determined by the scope of the links connecting them (for our models, this maximum span is never larger than a single sentence).
    When words do not co-occur or only co-occur very rarely (and even in large corpora this will often be the case), attributional similarity can come to the rescue.
    Given a target pair, we can construct other, probably similar pairs by replacing one of the words with an attributional neighbor.
    For example, given the pair (automobile, wheel), we might discover in W1xLW2 space that car is a close neighbor of automobile.
    We can then look for the pair (car, wheel), and
