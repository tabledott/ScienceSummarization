    Because of the importance of this task, a number of recent methods have been proposed for automatic semantic role labelling (e.g., Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Fleischman et al., 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2003).
    These supervised methods are limited by their reliance on the manually roletagged corpora of FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or PropBank (Palmer et al., 2003) as training data, which are expensive to produce, are limited in size, and may not be representative.
    We have developed a novel method of unsupervised semantic role labelling that avoids the need for expensive manual labelling of text, and enables the use of a large, representative corpus.
    To achieve this, we take a &#8220;bootstrapping&#8221; approach (e.g., Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Yarowsky, 1995; Jones et al., 1999), which initially makes only the role assignments that are unambiguous according to a verb lexicon.
    We then iteratively: creat
