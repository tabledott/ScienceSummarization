cells&amp;quot; in the contingency table.
    In informal experiments described elsewhere (Melamed 1995), I found that the G2 statistic suggested by Dunning (1993) slightly outperforms 02.
    Let the cells of the contingency table be named as follows: where B(kin,p) = () pk(1 p)n-k are binomial probabilities.
    The statistic uses maximum likelihood estimates for the probability parameters: p1 = bf P2 &#8212; c&#177;cd' P = a&#177;ab&#177;&#177;cc-Fd' G2 is easy to compute because the binomial coefficients in the numerator and in the denominator cancel each other out.
    All my methods initialize the parameters score(u,v) to G2(u, v), except that any pairing with NULL is initialized to an infinitesimal value.
    I have also found it useful to smooth the co-occurrence counts, e.g., using the Simple Good-Turing smoothing method (Gale and Sampson 1995), before computing G2.

    To further reduce the complexity of estimating link counts, I employ the competitive li
