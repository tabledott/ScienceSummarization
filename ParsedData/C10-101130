		The scores for Catalan, Chinese and Japanese are still lower than the top scores.
			However, the parser would have ranked second for these languages.
			For Catalan and Chinese, the top results obtained transition-basedparsers.
			Therefore, the integration of both tech niques as in Nivre and McDonald (2008) seems to be very promising.
			For instance, to improvethe accuracy further, more global constrains capturing the subcategorization correct could be inte grated as in Riedel and Clarke (2006).
			Our fasteralgorithms may make it feasible to consider fur ther higher order factors.
			In this paper, we have investigated possibilities for increasing parsing speed without any accuracyloss.
			The parsing time is 3.5 times faster on a sin gle CPU core than the baseline parser which has an typical architecture for a maximum spanning tree parser.
			The improvement is due solely to theHash Kernel.
			The Hash Kernel was also a prereq uisite for the parallelization of the parser because it requires much less m
