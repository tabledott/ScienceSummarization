onments for an objectl and object2 are specified more explicitly.
    An objecti can be the object of the sentence if it is contained in the semantic decomposition of a verb that includes an agent and belongs to the repair class of verbs.
    An object2 can be indicated by a with prepositional phrase if it is contained in the semantic decomposition of a replace verb: The selection restriction on an agent is that it must be a field engineer, and an instrument must be a tool.
    The selection restrictions on the two objects are more complicated, since they must be machine parts, have the same type, and yet also be distinct objects.
    In addition, the first object must already be associated with something else in a haspart relationship, in other words it must already be included in an existing assembly.
    The opposite must be true of the second object: it must not already be included in an assembly, so it must not be associated with anything else in a haspart relationship.
    There is also a pragmatic rest
