    For Slovenian, minimum risk annealing is significantly better than the other training methods, while minimum error is significantly worse.
    For Bulgarian, both minimum error and annealed minimum risk training achieve significant gains over maximum likelihood, but are indistinguishable from each other.
    For Dutch, the three methods are indistinguishable. than either and in some cases significantly helped.
    Note, however, that annealed minimum risk training results in a deterministic classifier just as these other training procedures do.
    The orthogonal of Bayes risk decoding achieved gains on parsing (G
