is used to take entailment decisions using information about overlapping sub-segments as features.
  
  
    Despite the novelty of the problem and the difficulty to capture multi-directional entailment relations across languages, the first round of the Crosslingual Textual Entailment for Content Synchronization task organized within SemEval-2012 was a successful experience.
    This year a new interesting challenge has been proposed, a benchmark for four language combinations has been released, baseline results have been proposed for comparison, and a monolingual English dataset has been produced as a by-product which can be useful for monolingual TE research.
    The interest shown by participants was encouraging: 10 teams submitted a total of 92 runs for all the language pairs proposed.
    Overall, the results achieved on all datasets are encouraging, with best systems significantly outperforming the proposed baselines.
    It is worth observing that the nature of the task, which lies between semantics an
