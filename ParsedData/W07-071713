orpus is assumed to represent the test domain.
    Therefore, we also experimented with using Downhill Simplex optimization to directly learn the set of linear weights Ac that yield maximum BLEU score on the development corpus.
    A final variant on setting linear mixture weights is a hybrid between cross-domain and dynamic adaptation.
    In this approach, both the global loglinear weights and, if they are being used, the mixture parameters Qi, ai, bi are set to characterize the test domain as in cross-domain adaptation.
    When translating, however, distances to the current source text are used in (3) or (4) instead of distances to the indomain development corpus.
    This obviously limits the metrics used to ones that depend only on source text.
  
  
    All experiments were run on the NIST MT evaluation 2006 Chinese data set.
    Table 1 summarizes the corpora used.
    The training corpus was divided into seven components according to genre; in all cases these were identical to LDC corpora, with the e
