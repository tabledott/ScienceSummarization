The aim is to limit the work of the tokeniser to maximise efficiency, and enable greater flexibility by placing the burden of analysis on the grammars.
    This means that the tokeniser does not need to be modified for different applications or text types.
    The sentence splitter is a cascade of finitestate transducers which segments the text into sentences.
    This module is required for the tagger.
    Both the splitter and tagger are domainand application-independent.
    The tagger is a modified version of the Brill tagger, which produces a part-of-speech tag as an annotation on each word or symbol.
    Neither the splitter nor the tagger are a mandatory part of the NE system, but the annotations they produce can be used by the grammar (described below), in order to increase its power and coverage.
    The gazetteer consists of lists such as cities, organisations, days of the week, etc.
    It not only consists of entities, but also of names of useful indicators, such as typical company designators (e.
