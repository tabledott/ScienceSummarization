, inversion-invariant transduction grammars, in which all productions occur with both orientations (Wu 1995).
    As the applications below demonstrate, the bilingual lexical constraints carry greater importance than the tightness of the grammar.
    Formally, an inversion transduction grammar, or ITG, is denoted by G = (Al, Wi, W2, S), where .AT is a finite set of nonterminals, Wi is a finite set of words (terminals) of language 1, W2 is a finite set of words (terminals) of language 2, R is a finite set of rewrite rules (productions), and S E Ai is the start symbol.
    The space of word-pairs (terminal-pairs) X = (WI U {E}) x (W2 U {e}) contains lexical translations denoted x/y and singletons denoted x/&#8364; or c/y, where x E Wi and y E W2.
    Each production is either of straight orientation written A [aia2 ad, or of inverted orientation written A &#8212;) (aia2...a&#8222;), where ai E Alu X and r is the rank of the production.
    The set of transductions generated by G is denoted T(G).
