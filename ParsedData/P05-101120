 a packed representation (Taskar et al., 2004).
    As discussed in Section 6, exploration of other features is indispensable to further improvements.
    A possible direction is to encode larger contexts of parse trees, which were shown to improve the accuracy (Toutanova and Manning, 2002; Toutanova et al., 2004).
    Future work includes the investigation of such features, as well as the abstraction of lexical dependencies like semantic classes.
