t automatic summarizers rely on extracting key sentences or paragraphs from an article to produce a summary.
    Since the extracted sentences are disconnected in the original article, when they are strung together, the resulting summary can be inconcise, incoherent, and sometimes even misleading.
    We present a cut and paste based text summarization technique, aimed at reducing the gap between automatically generated summaries and human-written abstracts.
    Rather than focusing on how to identify key sentences, as do other researchers, we study how to generate the text of a summary once key sentences have been extracted.
