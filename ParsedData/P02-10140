  Improving Machine Learning Approaches To Coreference Resolution
  
    We present a noun phrase coreference system that extends the work of Soon et al. (2001) and, to our knowledge, produces the best results to date on the MUC- 6 and MUC-7 coreference resolution data sets &#8212; F-measures of 70.4 and 63.4, respectively.
    Improvements arise from two sources: extra-linguistic changes to the learning framework and a large-scale expansion of the feature set to include more sophisticated linguistic knowledge.
  
  
    Noun phrase coreference resolution refers to the problem of determining which noun phrases (NPs) refer to each real-world entity mentioned in a document.
    Machine learning approaches to this problem have been reasonably successful, operating primarily by recasting the problem as a classification task (e.g.
    Aone and Bennett (1995), McCarthy and Lehnert (1995)).
    Specifically, a pair of NPs is classified as co-referring or not based on constraints that are learned from an annotated c
