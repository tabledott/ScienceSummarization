sired result only if applied left to right and only if obligatory.
    The alternation of long and short vowels results from the fact that each application shortens a long vowel that would otherwise serve as part of the context for a subsequent application.
    The same rule appears as the rhythmic law in Slovak&#8212;all suffix vowels are shortened following a long vowel, as in the following examples: vol+a+me 'we call' chit+a+me 'we read' vol+av+a+me 'we call often' chit+av+a+me 'we read often' This time the rule must be applied either simultaneously or from right to left.
    It might seem that a transducer mimicking the operation of a right-to-left rule would have to examine its tapes in the opposite order from one that implemented a left-to-right rule, and it is difficult to see how two transducers operating in different directions could then be composed.
    However, we shall see that directionality in rewriting rules is not mirrored by directionality in the transducers.
    Instead, directionality dete
