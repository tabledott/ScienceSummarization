iteratively approximating the value of a set of polynomial equations, as we are essentially doing in Equation 7, is equal to the smallest solution to the equations (Kuich 1997, 622).
    In particular, consider the equations: where V &lt;0&#8222;(x, B) can be thought of as indicating IB I different variables, one for each item x in the looping bucket B.
    Equation 7 represents the iterative approximation of Equation 8, and therefore the smallest solution to Equation 8 represents the supremum of Equation 7.
    One fact will be useful for several semirings: whenever the values of all items x E B at generation g +1 are the same as the values of all items in the preceding generation, g, they will be the same at all succeeding generations, as well.
    Thus, the value at generation g will be the value of the supremum.
    Elsewhere (Goodman 1998), we give a trivial proof of this fact.
    Now, we can consider various semiring-specific algorithms for computing the supremum.
    Most of these algorithms are well
