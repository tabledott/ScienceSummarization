correctness for the test sentences.
    We again judged the attachment for the 1000 triples, this time using the full-sentence context, first grading the test sentences separately, and then discussing examples on which there was disagreement.
    Disambiguating the test sample turned out to be a surprisingly difficult task.
    While many decisions were straightforward, more than 10% of the sentences seemed problematic to at least one author.
    There are several kinds of constructions where the attachment decision is not clear theoretically.
    These include idioms as in Examples 8 and 9, light verb constructions (Example 10), and small clauses (Example 11).
