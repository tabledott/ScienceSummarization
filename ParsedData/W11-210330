larly FrenchHEnglish, constrained systems are found to be able to be on the same level or outperform unconstrained systems.
    It also seems that making use of the Gigaword corpora is likely to yield better systems, even when translating out of English, as in English-French and English-German.
    For English-German the rule-based MT systems performed well.
    Of the participating teams, there is no individual system clearly outperforming all other systems across the different language pairs.
    However, one of the crawled systems, ONLINE-B, performs consistently well, being one of the winners in all eight language pairs.
    As for the system combination track (Table 9), the CMU-HEAFIELD-COMBO entry performed quite well, being a winner in seven out of eight language pairs.
