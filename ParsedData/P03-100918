 A56) We identified a close relation between the clustering performance and the following patterns of semantic behaviour: 1) Monosemy: We had 32 monosemous test verbs.
    10 gold standard classes included 2 or more or these.
    7 classes were correctly acquired using clustering (e.g.
    A1), indicating that clustering monosemous verbs is fairly &#8216;easy&#8217;.
    2) Predominant sense: 10 clusters were examined by hand whose members got correctly classified together, despite one of them being polysemous (e.g.
    A2).
    In 8 cases there was a clear indication in the data (when examining SCFs and the selectional preferences on argument heads) that the polysemous verb indeed had its predominant sense in the relevant class and that the co-occurrence was not due to noise. ysemy11 were frequently assigned to singleton clusters.
    For example, add (A4) has a &#8216;combining and attaching&#8217; sense in class 22 which involves NP and PP SCFs and another &#8216;communication&#8217; sense in 37 which take
