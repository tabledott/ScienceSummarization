re generally, these constraints can be used to eliminate supertags that cannot have their features satisfied in the context of the input string.
    An example of this is the elimination of supertag that requires a wh+ NP when the input string does not contain wh-words.
    Table 2 indicates the decrease in supertag ambiguity for 2,012 WSJ sentences (48,763 words) by using the structural constraints relative to the supertag ambiguity without the structural constraints.5 These filters prove to be very effective in reducing supertag ambiguity.
    The graph in Figure 3 plots the number of supertags at the sentence level for sentences of length 2 to 50 words with and without the filters.
    As can be seen from the graph, the supertag ambiguity is significantly lower when the filters are used.
    The graph in Figure 4 shows the percentage drop in supertag ambiguity due to filtering for sentences of length 2 to 50 words.
    As can be seen, the average reduction in supertag ambiguity is about 50%.
    This means
