 its pre-conjunct is extended to contain CS1-2.
    As a result of this process, the reduced form of a sentence is obtained as shown in Figure 11.
  
  
    As described in the preceding sections, information about CSs can be used to reduce a sentence into a simpler form.
    Consequently, a dependency structure of an entire sentence can be obtained by applying relatively simple head-dependent rules to CSs and the sentence.
    Another serious problem regarding CSs, in addition to the ambiguity of scope, is the ellipses that may occur in the components of CSs.
    We recover the omitted components in the stage of dependency analysis.
    We will explain this process in the following.
    In this paper, the goal of the syntactic analysis is to transform a sentence into a dependency tree structure in which a dependent bunsetsu node is placed as a child node of its head bunsetsu node.
    In a Japanese sentence, because each bunsetsu depends on one of the bunsetsus to the right of it, a sentence can be transform
