list of candidate final translations C is empty, Champollion has failed to locate a target language translation of the source collocation and stops, reporting this.
    Otherwise, the entry with the highest Dice coefficient with the source collocation is selected as the translation.
    In the case of ties, the longer of the tied collocations is selected.
    Note that because of the way table C is maintained, the word group selected in this way is guaranteed to correspond to a global maximum (among all word groups considered) of the similarity measure.
    We are planning to experiment with a more sophisticated technique for selecting the globally best translation, giving more weight to the collocation length so that longer word groups are considered better choices.
    If the final translation contains just one word, Champollion reports the result and halts.
    Otherwise, the following step is executed.
    Step 5 in our example selects the pair (officielles, langues) with a score of 0.951070 as the best c
