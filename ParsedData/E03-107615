ned the system on the 650,000 NP/PPs with the Giza toolkit, and evaluated the translation quality on the same 1000 NP/PP test set as in the previous section.
    Training and testing data was split consistently in the same way.
    The translation accuracy is measured against reference translations using the BLEU score [Papineni et al., 2002].
    Table 2 displays the results.
    Somewhat surprisingly, the frequency based method leads to better translation quality than the more accurate methods that take advantage from knowledge from the parallel corpus.
    One reason for this is that the system recovers more easily from words that are split too much than from words that are not split up sufficiently.
    Of course, this has limitations: Eager splitting into as many parts as possible fares abysmally.
    7.3 Translation Quality with Phrase Based Machine Translation Compound words violate the bias for one-to-one word correspondences of word based SMT systems.
    This is one of the motivations for phrase bas
