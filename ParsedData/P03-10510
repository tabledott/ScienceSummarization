  Language Model Based Arabic Word Segmentation
  
  
    Our work adopts major components of the algorithm from (Luo &amp; Roukos 1996): language model (LM) parameter estimation from a segmented corpus and input segmentation on the basis of LM probabilities.
    However, our work diverges from their work in two crucial respects: (i) new technique of computing all possible segmentations of a word into prefix*-stem-suffix* for decoding, and (ii) unsupervised algorithm for new stem acquisition based on a stem candidate's similarity to stems occurring in the training corpus.
    (Darwish 2002) presents a supervised technique which identifies the root of an Arabic word by stripping away the prefix and the suffix of the word on the basis of manually acquired dictionary of word-root pairs and the likelihood that a prefix and a suffix would occur with the template from which the root is derived.
    He reports 92.7% segmentation marking a prefix with '#&amp;quot; and a suffix with '+' will be adopted throughout the
