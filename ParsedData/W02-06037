zation and applies an incremental, greedy search algorithm which is suitable for on-line learning such that children might employ.
    In this work, we use a model where words may consist of lengthy sequences of segments.
    This model is especially suitable for languages with agglutinative morphological structure.
    We call the segments morphs and at this point no distinction is made between stems and affixes.
    The practical purpose of the segmentation is to provide a vocabulary of language units that is smaller and generalizes better than a vocabulary consisting of words as they appear in text.
    Such a vocabulary could be utilized in statistical language modeling, e.g., for speech recognition.
    Moreover, one could assume that such a discovered morph vocabulary would correspond rather closely to linguistic morphemes of the language.
    We examine two methods for unsupervised learning of the model, presented in Sections 2 and 3.
    The cost function for the first method is derived from the Minim
