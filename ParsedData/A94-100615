er existing resource.&amp;quot; Even if other resources, such as general technical dictionaries, are available it is important to verify the translation of terms in previously translated documents of the same customer (or domain) to ensure consistency across documents.
    Several translation workstations provide sentence alignment and allow the user to search interactively for term translations in aligned archives (e.g.
    (Ogden and Gonzales, 1993)).
    Some methods use sentence alignment and additional statistics to find candidate translations of terms (Smadja, 1992; van der Eijk, 1993).
    We suggest that word level alignment is better suitable for term translation.
    The bilingual component of termight gets as input a list of source terms and a bilingual corpus aligned at the word level.
    We have been using the output of word_align, a robust alignment program that proved useful for bilingual concordancing of noisy texts (Dagan et al., 1993).
    Word_align produces a partial mapping between the w
