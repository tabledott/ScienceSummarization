that V is -S and that the 2 occurrences with cues for S are explained by the five percent error rate on -S verbs.
    The next section reviews the hypothesis-testing method and gives the formulas for computing the probabilities of various outcomes of coin tosses, given the coin's bias.
    It also provides empirical evidence that, for some values of 71-_&#8222; hypothesis-testing does a good job of distinguishing +S verbs from -S verbs that occur with cues for S because of mismatches between cue and structure.
    The following section proposes a method for estimating 7r_s and provides empirical evidence that its estimates are nearly optimal.
    The statistical component of Lerner is designed to prevent the information provided by the cues from being washed out by the noise.
    The basic approach is hypothesis testing on binomial frequency data (Kalbfleisch 1985).
    Specifically, a verb V is shown to 4 Given a verb V, the outcomes of the coins for different S's are treated as approximately independent, ev
