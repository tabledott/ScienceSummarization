in (2), with their variables suitably instantiated, become the initial entries of an agenda and we begin to move them to the chart in accordance with the algorithm schema, say in the order given.
    The variables in the 'Cat' and 'Semantics' columns of (2) provide the essential link between syntax and semantics.
    The predicates that represent the semantics of a phrase will simply be the union of those representing the constituents.
    The rules that sanction a phrase (e.g.
    (3) below) show which variables from the two parts are to be identified. the entry for moved, no interactions are because the chart is empty.
    When moved, the ran considered as a possible phrase on the basis of rule (3).
    (3) s(x) &#8212;&gt; np(y), vp(x, y).
    With appropriate replacements for variables, this maps onto the subset (4) of the original semantic specification in (1).
    (4) r: run(r), past(r), argl(r, j), name(j, John) Furthermore it is a complete sentence.
    However, it does not count as an output to the g
