a trace of Earley parser operation on a sample sentence.
    Earley's parser can deal with any type of context-free rule format, even with null or &amp;productions, i.e., those that replace a nonterminal with the empty string.
    Such productions do, however, require special attention, and make the algorithm and its description more complicated than otherwise necessary.
    In the following sections we assume that no null productions have to be dealt with, and then summarize the necessary changes in Section 4.7.
    One might choose to simply preprocess the grammar to eliminate null productions, a process which is also described.
  
  
    A stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) extends the standard context-free formalism by adding probabilities to each production: [p], where the rule probability p is usually written as P(X --4 A).
    This notation to some extent hides the fact that p is a conditional probability, of production X -4 A being chosen, given that X is up for expansion.
    The probabilities of
