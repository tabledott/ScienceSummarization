potheses about tag(g) and tag(g + 1); their signatures are correspondingly different.
  Under model B, a k-.g span may not combine with an 6-~n span whose tags violate its assumptions about g and g + 1.

  which is replaced by the less obvious expression in (7).
  As usual, scores can be constructed from the bottom up (though tword(j) in the second factor of (7) is not available to the algorithm, j being outside the span, so we back off to word(j)).
  5 Empirical Comparison We have undertaken a careful study to compare these models success at generalizing from train- ing data to test data.
