he parameters that maximize the likelihood of the training data using : The success of the model in tagging depends to a large extent on the selection of suitable features.
    Given , a feature must encode information that helps to predict .
    The features we used in our experiments are instantiations of the feature templates in (1).
    Feature templates (b) to (e) represent character features while (f) represents tag features.
    In the following list, are characters and are LMR tags.
    ), the previous two characters ( ), and the next two characters ( ) (e) The previous and the next character ( ) (f) The tag of the previous character ( ), and the tag of the character two before the current character ( ) One potential problem with the MEMM is that it can only scan the input in one direction, from left to right or from right to left.
    It is noted in (Lafferty et al., 2001) that non-generative finite-state models, MEMM models included, share a weakness which they call the Label Bias Problem (LBP): a t
