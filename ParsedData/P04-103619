BNC, but the first senses of words like division and goal shift towards the more specific senses (league and score respectively).
    Moreover, the chosen senses of the word tie proved to be a textbook example of the behaviour we expected.
    The word share is among the words whose predominant sense remained the same for all three corpora.
    We anticipated that the stock certificate sense would be chosen for the FINANCE domain, but this did not happen.
    However, that particular sense ended up higher in the ranking for the FINANCE domain.
    Figure 2 displays the results of the second experiment with the domain specific corpora.
    This figure shows the domain labels assigned to the predominant senses for the set of 38 words after ranking the words using the SPORTS and the FINANCE corpora.
    We see that both domains have a similarly high percentage of factotum (domain independent) labels, but as we would expect, the other peaks correspond to the economy label for the FINANCE corpus, and the sports la
