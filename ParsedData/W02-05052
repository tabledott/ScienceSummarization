    Kawtrakul et al. (1998) present a back transliteration system from Thai into English in the context of document retrieval.
    In their approach, loan words are first segmented into syllables using a combination of rules and statistical techniques.
    Then, syllables are mapped to phonemes based on some transcription rules.
    The phoneme sequence of the loan word is
