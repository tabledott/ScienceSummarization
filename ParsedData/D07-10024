			Since FrameNet is still under development, its coverage tends to be more of a prob lem in comparison to other semantic role resources such as PropBank.
			In this paper we propose an answer extractionmodel which effectively incorporates FrameNetstyle semantic role information.
			We present an auto matic method for semantic role assignment which is conceptually simple and does not require extensive feature engineering.
			A key feature of our approachis the comparison of dependency relation paths at tested in the FrameNet annotations and raw text.
			We formalize the search for an optimal role assignment as an optimization problem in a bipartite graph.
			Thisformalization allows us to find an exact, globally op timal solution.
			The graph-theoretic framework goessome way towards addressing coverage problems related with FrameNet and allows us to formulate an swer extraction as a graph matching problem.
			As abyproduct of our main investigation we also exam ine the issue of F
