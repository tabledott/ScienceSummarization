ance, however, is the fact that inference rules are the mechanism by which we instantiat e domain-specific constraints and set up the particulars required for scenario-level templates .
  Some of this information is again gained by fairly straightforward compositional means .
  For example, the phrase "Walter IZawleigh Jr ., retired chairman of Mobil Corp ."
  yields a succession template through the mediation of on e inference rule .
  The phrase is compositionally interpreted as organization(org-14) title(ttl-15) retired-ttl(ttl-15) job((ttl-15, org-14), job-16 ) person(pers-17) holds job((pers-17, job-16) h -j-18 ) The rule that maps these propositions to a succession event i s job-out(pers, ttl, org) &lt;?
  holds job((pers,job) x) +job((ttl, org), job) + retired-ttl(ttl ) When applied to the above propositions this rule yields job-out((pers-17, ttl-15, org-07) j-o-19) .
  This fact is all that is required for the template generator to subsequently issue the appropriate succession event templates .
