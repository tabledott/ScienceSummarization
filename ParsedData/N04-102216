performed using Equation 3.
    We say we have a matched condition when the same loss function is used in both the error rate and the decoder design.
    The performance of the MBR decoders on the NIST 2001+2002 test set is reported in Table 3.
    For all performance metrics, we show the 70% confidence interval with respect to the MAP baseline computed using bootstrap resampling (Press et al., 2002; Och, 2003).
    We note that this significance level if otherwise, does meet the customary criteria for minimum significance intervals of 68.3% (Press et al., 2002).
    We observe in most cases that the MBR decoder under a loss function performs the best under the corresponding error metric i.e. matched conditions perform the best.
    The gains from MBR decoding under matched conditions are statistically significant in most cases.
    We note that the MAP decoder is not optimal in any of the cases.
    In particular, the translation performance under the BLEU metric can be improved by using MBR relative to MAP
