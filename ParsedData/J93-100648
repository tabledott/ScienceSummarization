t;element&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;-usammensetzung&amp;quot; (39) is on the basis of a normalized form (for words ending in &amp;quot;Zusammensetzung&amp;quot;), whereas &amp;quot;Zusammensetzung,&amp;quot; unnormalized, is correctly associated with &amp;quot;composition&amp;quot; (35).
    Totally unrelated words are associated in a few instances, as in &amp;quot;Observatory&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;diesem&amp;quot; (24), &amp;quot;detectors&amp;quot; /&amp;quot;primare-&amp;quot; (36), and &amp;quot;bright-&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;Astronona-&amp;quot; (48).
    Of these only the second remains at the end of the third pass.
    The English &amp;quot;Observatory&amp;quot; is then properly associated with the German word &amp;quot;Observatorium-.&amp;quot; At that stage, &amp;quot;bright-&amp;quot; has no association.
