hat includes both entities.
			We will show in this paper that increased extraction performance can be 724 obtained by designing a kernel method that uses an even smaller part of the dependency structure ? theshortest path between the two entities in the undi rected version of the dependency graph.
	
	
			Let e1 and e2 be two entities mentioned in the samesentence such that they are observed to be in a re lationship R, i.e R(e1, e2) = 1.
			For example, R can specify that entity e1 is LOCATED (AT) entity e2.
			Figure 1 shows two sample sentences from ACE, with entity mentions in bold.
			Correspondingly, the first column in Table 1 lists the four relations of typeLOCATED that need to be extracted by the IE sys tem.
			We assume that a relation is to be extractedonly between entities mentioned in the same sen tence, and that the presence or absence of a relation is independent of the text preceding or following the sentence.
			This means that only information derived from the sentence including the two entit
