to our argument-based evaluation, the annotation of the arguments of the verb began is: [The deregulation]ARG1 of railroads [that]C-ARG1 [began]PRED enabled shippers to bargain for transportation.
    The difference between our argument based measure and the CoNLL evaluation measure is such that we cannot say that the value of one is always higher than the value of the other.
    Either measure could be higher depending on the kinds of errors made.
    For example, if the guessed labeling is: [The deregulation]ARG0 of railroads [that]R-ARG1 [began]PRED enabled shippers to bargain for transportation, the CoNLL script would count the argument that as correct and report precision and recall of .5, whereas our argument-based measure would not count any argument correct and report precision and recall of 0.
    On the other hand, if the guessed labeling is [The deregulation]ARG1 of railroads [that]C-ARG1 [began]PRED enabled shippers to bargain for transportation, the CoNLL measure would report a precision and reca
