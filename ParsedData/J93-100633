 for entry into the WAT&#8222; it should only be added with a low priority.
    The exact stochastic relation is depicted in Figure 1, where the probability is shown that a word of a frequency k that was aligned with a word in the other text with a certain similarity s is just the result of a random process.'
    Note that, for a high-frequency word that has a high similarity with some other word (right front corner), it is very unlikely (negligible plateau height) that this association has to be attributed to chance.
    On the other hand, low similarities (back) can easily be attained by just associating arbitrary words.
    Low-frequency words&#8212;because there are so many of them in a text&#8212;can also achieve a high similarity with some other words without having to be related in an interesting way.
    This can be intuitively explained by the fact that the similarity of a high-frequency word is based on a pattern made up of a large number of instances.
    It is therefore a pattern that is unlikely
