er a proposition P is true or know what the referent of a description is.
    We define &amp;quot;A knows that P&amp;quot;, written KNOW(A,P), as P A BA(P).
    This is weaker than some definitions of &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; in the philosophical literature, where, among other things, &amp;quot;A knows that P&amp;quot; entails that A believes P for the &amp;quot;right reasons&amp;quot;; i.e. knowledge is true and justified belief (Ayer [1956], but see also Gettier [1963]).
    If S believes that A knows that P, S is committed to believing that P is true.
    In other words, if S believes A does not know P, then S must believe that P is true in addition to believing that A does not believe P is true.
    This problem is analogous to the wide/narrow scope distinction that Russell found in his account of definite descriptions (Russell [1919]).
    One solution to this problem is to consider KNOW as a &amp;quot;macro&amp;quot; whose expansion is sensitive to negation.
    Details may be found in Allen [1979].
