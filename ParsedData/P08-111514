hat used the shortest-path distance metric (which was already a higher baseline).
    Table 3 summarizes the results of our experiment comparing the performance of two distance metrics to determine whether a rule has exceeded the decoder&#8217;s span limit.
    The pattern is the same, showing a clear increase in BLEU for the shortest path metric over the baseline.
  
  
    Chinese word segmentation.
    A necessary first step in translating Chinese using standard models is segmenting the character stream into a sequence of words.
    Word-lattice translation offers two possible improvements over the conventional approach.
    First, a lattice may represent multiple alternative segmentations of a sentence; input represented in this way will be more robust to errors made by the segmenter.2 Second, different segmentation granularities may be more or less optimal for translating different spans.
    By encoding alternatives in the input in a word lattice, the decision as to which granularity to use for a given
