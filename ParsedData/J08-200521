chunk that immediately precedes the clause.
  This is a simple rule to distinguish the type of clause based on the intuition that a subordinate clause often modifies the part of the sentence immediately before it.
  Figure 2 shows the pseudo-parse tree of the parse tree in Figure 1.
  By disregarding the chunks, there are four configurations?
  ?target constituent and predicate are siblings,?
  ?target constituent?s parent is an ancestor of predicate,?
  ?predicate?s parent is an ancestor of target word,?
  or ?otherwise.?
  This feature can be viewed as a generalization of the Path feature described earlier.
  
  
  
  The rules of the NEG and MOD features are used in a baseline SRL system developed by Erik Tjong Kim Sang (Carreras and Ma`rquez 2004).
