 Bayesian Discrimination Surprisingly good results can be achieved using Bayesian discrimination methods which have been used very suc- cessfully in many other applications, especially author identification (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964) and infor- mation retrieval (IR) (Salton, 1989, section 10.3).
  Our word-sense disambiguation algorithm uses the words in a 100-word context 1 surrounding the polysemous word very much like the other two applications use the words in a test document.
  Information Retreival (IR): Pr(wlret) I1  r(wlirrd) w in  doe l i t  is common to use very smal l  contexts  (e.g., 5-words) based on the observat ion that  people do not  need very much context in order to performance the d isambiguat ion  task.
  In contrast ,  we use much larger contexts  (e.g., 100 words).
  A l though people may be able to make do with much less context,  we believe the machine needs all the help it can get, and  we have found that  the larger context  makes  the task much easier.
  In fact, we have been a
