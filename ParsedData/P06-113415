 added for each instance of dswj that is in a subjective expression, and subtracted for each instance that is not in a subjective expression.
    Note that the annotations in the MPQA corpus are for subjective expressions in context.
    Thus, the data is somewhat noisy for our task, because, as discussed in Section 3, objective senses may appear in subjective expressions.
    Nonetheless, we hypothesized that subjective senses tend to appear more often in subjective expressions than objective senses do, and use the appearance of words in subjective expressions as evidence of sense subjectivity.
    (Wiebe, 2000) also makes use of an annotated corpus, but in a different approach: given a word w and a set of distributionally similar words DSW, that method assigns a subjectivity score to w equal to the conditional probability that any member of DSW is in a subjective expression.
    Moreover, the end task of that work was to annotate words, while our end task is the more difficult problem of annotating word sen
