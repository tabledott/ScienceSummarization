ctive, because this is the most common tag for words ending in ous.
    This information is derived automatically from the training corpus.
    This very simple algorithm has an error rate of about 7.9% when trained on 90% of the tagged Brown Corpus' [Francis and Kueera 82], and tested on a separate 5% of the corpus.2 Training consists of compiling a list of the most common tag for each word in the training corpus.
    The tagger then acquires patches to improve its performance.
    Patch templates are of the form: The initial tagger was trained on 90% of the corpus (the training corpus).
    5% was held back to be used for the patch acquisition procedure (the patch corpus) and 5% for testing.
    Once the initial tagger is trained, it is used to tag the patch corpus.
    A list of tagging errors is compiled by comparing the output of the tagger to the correct tagging of the patch corpus.
    This list consists of triples &lt; taga,tagb,number &gt;, indicating the number of times the tagger mistagged a word w
