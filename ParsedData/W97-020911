    Discussion.
    The results of the experiment show that disambiguation using automatically acquired selectional constraints leads to performance significantly better than random choice.
    Not surprisingly, though, the results are far from what one might expect to obtain with supervised training.
    In that respect, the most direct point of comparison is the performance of Miller et al. 's (1994) frequency heuristic &#8212; always choose the most frequent sense of a word &#8212; as evaluated using the full sense-tagged corpus, including nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
    For ambiguous words, they report 58.2% correct, as compared to a random baseline of 26.8%.
    Crucially, however, the frequency heuristic requires sense-tagged training data (Miller et al. evaluated via cross-validation), and this paper starts from the assumption that such data are unavailable.
    A fairer comparison, therefore, considers al'Excluded were some inapplicable cases, e.g. where object was a proper nou
