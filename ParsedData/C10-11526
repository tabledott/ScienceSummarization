hieve the best sentence alignment on our dataset, we tested three similarity measures: (i) sentence-level TF*IDF (Nelken and Shieber, 2006), (ii) word overlap (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003) and (iii)word-based maximum edit distance (MED) (Lev enshtein, 1966) with costs of insertion, deletionand substitution set to 1.
			To evaluate their perfor mance we manually annotated 120 sentence pairs from the article pairs.
			Tab.
			1 reports the precision and recall of these three measures.
			We manually adjusted the similarity threshold to obtain a recallvalue as close as possible to 55.8% which was pre viously adopted by Nelken and Shieber (2006).
			Similarity Precision Recall TF*IDF 91.3% 55.4% Word Overlap 50.5% 55.1% MED 13.9% 54.7% Table 1: Monolingual Sentence Alignment The results in Tab.
			1 show that sentence-levelTF*IDF clearly outperforms the other two mea sures, which is consistent with the results reported by Nelken and Shieber (2006).
			We henceforth chose sentence-level TF*IDF to align our dataset.
