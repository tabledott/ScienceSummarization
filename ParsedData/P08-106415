    We carried out a number of experiments to examine the proposed tree sequence alignment-based translation model.
    In this subsection, we first report the rule distributions and compare our model with the three baseline systems.
    Then we study the model&#8217;s expressive ability by comparing the contributions made by different kinds of rules, including strict tree sequence rules, non-syntactic phrase rules, structure reordering rules and discontinuous tured by the two syntax-based models through tree node operations.
    &#8226; Our model is much more effective in utilizing linguistic structures than STSG since it uses tree sequence as basic translation unit.
    This allows our model not only to handle structure reordering by tree node operations in a larger span, but also to capture non-syntactic phrases, which circumvents previous syntactic constraints, thus giving our model more expressive power.
    3) The linguistically motivated SCFG shows much lower performa
