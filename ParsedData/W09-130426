 system that uses predicted hedge cues achieves 65.55% PCS in the abstracts corpus, which is very similar to the result obtained by the negation scope finding system with predicted negation cues (66.07% PCS).
    However, the results for the papers and clinical subcorpora are considerably lower than the results for the abstracts subcorpus in the two phases.
    In the case of the negation scope finding system, the evaluation on the clinical subcorpus yielded a 4.23% PCS higher result, whereas in the case of the hedge scope finding system the results are almost 30.00% PCS lower, confirming the observation that the portability of hedge classifers is limited.
    Future research will focus on trying to improve the first phase of the system and anlysing errors in depth in order to get insights into how to get a better performance.
