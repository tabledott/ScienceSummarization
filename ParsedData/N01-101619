DITED nodes appear in the tree structure produced by the parser.
    Second, we are not interested in the fine structure of EDITED sections of the string, just the fact that they are EDITED.
    That we do care which words are EDITED comes into our figure of merit in two ways.
    First, (noncontiguous) EDITED nodes remain, even though their substructure does not, and thus they are counted in the precision and recall numbers.
    Secondly (and probably more importantly), failure to decide on the correct positions of edited nodes can cause collateral damage to neighboring constituents by causing them to start or stop in the wrong place.
    This is particularly relevant because according to our definition, while the positions at the beginning and ending of an edit node are equivalent, the interior positions are not (unless related by the punctuation rule). than the simplified gold standard.
    We rejected this because the &#8801;e relation would then itself be dependent on the parser&#8217;s output, a state o
