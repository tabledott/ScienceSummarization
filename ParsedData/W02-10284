ndidate words are added to the lexicon, and the process starts over again.
    In this section, we describe Basilisk&#8217;s bootstrapping algorithm in more detail and discuss related work.
    The input to Basilisk is a text corpus and a set of seed words.
    We generated seed words by sorting the words in the corpus by frequency and manually identifying the 10 most frequent nouns that belong to each category.
    These seed words form the initial semantic lexicon.
    In this section we describe the learning process for a single semantic category.
    In Section 3 we will explain how the process is adapted to handle multiple categories simultaneously.
    To identify new lexicon entries, Basilisk relies on extraction patterns to provide contextual evidence that a word belongs to a semantic class.
    As our representation for extraction patterns, we used the AutoSlog system (Riloff, 1996).
    AutoSlog&#8217;s extraction patterns represent linguistic expressions that extract a noun phrase in one of three s
