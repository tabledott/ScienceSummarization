 PL + PTV and no other labels, which yields the probabilities P(PUU | Therefore, part of the corpus should be used as training data, and the rest as test data.
    Both data sets are segmented using the unsupervised segmentation algorithms.
    The training set is then used for estimating the distance values d(M, L).
    These values are used when the test set is aligned.
    The better segmentation algorithm is the one that yields a better alignment distance for the test set.
    For morph/label pairs that were never observed in the training set, a maximum distance value is assigned.
    A good segmentation algorithm will find segments that are good building blocks of entirely new word forms, and thus the maximum distance values will occur only rarely.
  
  
    We compared the two proposed methods as well as Goldsmith&#8217;s program Linguistica5 on both Finnish and English corpora.
    The Finnish corpus consisted of newspaper text from CSC6.
    A morphosyntactic analysis of the text was performed using t
