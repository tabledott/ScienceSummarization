tic properties of VNICs is both necessary and beneficial for the appropriate treatment of these expressions. is known to perform poorly on low frequency data.
    To examine the effect of frequency on the measures, we analyze their performance on the two divisions of the test data, corresponding to the two frequency bands, TEST and TEST .
    Results are given in Table 3, with the best performance shown in boldface.
    As expected, the performance of drops substantially for low frequency items.
    Interestingly, although it is a PMI-based measure, performs slightly better when the data is separated based on frequency.
    The performance of improves quite a bit when it is applied to high frequency items, while it improves only slightly on the low frequency items.
    These results show that both Fixedness measures perform better on homogeneous data, while retaining comparably good performance on heterogeneous data.
    These results reflect that our fixedness measures are not as sensitive to frequency as .
