e content selection stage is to measure how well we identify common phrases throughout multiple sentences.
    Our algorithm was compared against intersections extracted by human judges from each theme, producing 39 sentence-level predicateargument structures.
    Our intersection algorithm identified 29 (74%) predicate-argument structures and was able to identify correctly 69% of the subjects, 74% of the main verbs, and 65% of the other constituents in our list of model predicate-argument structures.
    We present system accuracy separately for each category, since identifying a verb or a subject is, in most cases, more important than identifying other sentence constituents.
  
  
    In this paper, we presented an implemented algorithm for multi-document summarization which moves beyond the sentence extraction paradigm.
    Assuming a set of similar sentences as input extracted from multiple documents on the same event (McKeown et al., 1999; Eskin et al., 1999), our system identifies common phrases across
