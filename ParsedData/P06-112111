sistent across the data.
			Figure 2(a) shows the six possible ways of attaching ? to constituents of pi: besides the highest attachment (rule (f)),?
			can move along the ancestors of France, since it is to the right of the translation of that word, and be considered to be part of an NNP, NP, or VP rule.
			We make the same reasoning to the left: ? can either start the NNS of astronauts, or start an NP.
			Our account of all possible ways of consistentlyattaching ? to constituents means we must extract more than one derivation to explain transfor mations in G, even if we still restrict ourselves to minimal derivations (a minimal derivation for G is unique if and only if no source-language word in G is unaligned).
			While we could enumerateall derivations separately, it is much more effi cient both in time and space to represent them as aderivation forest, as in Figure 2(b).
			Here, the for est covers all minimal derivations that correspondto G. It is necessary to ensure that for each deriva tion, each unal
