syntactic well-formedness of MT output.
    By reranking a 1000-best list generated by the baseline MT system from Och (2003), the BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) score on the test dataset was improved from 31.6% to 32.9%.
  
  
    Like machine translation, parsing is another field of natural language processing in which generative models have been widely used.
    In recent years, reranking techniques, especially discriminative reranking, have resulted in significant improvements in parsing.
    Various machine learning algorithms have been employed in parse reranking, such as Boosting (Collins, 2000), Perceptron (Collins and Duffy, 2002) and Support Vector Machines (Shen and Joshi, 2003).
    The reranking techniques have resulted in a 13.5% error reduction in labeled recall/precision over the previous best generative parsing models.
    Discriminative reranking methods for parsing typically use the notion of a margin as the distance between the best candidate parse and the rest of the parses.
