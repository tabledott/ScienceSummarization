ng and performance has increased steadily.
    For training these parsers, syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks) of thousands to tens of thousands of sentences are necessary; so initially, research has focused on English.
    During the last few years, however, treebanks for other languages have become available and some parsers have been applied to several different languages.
    See Section 2 for a more detailed overview of related previous research.
    So far, there has not been much comparison between different dependency parsers on exactly the same data sets (other than for English).
    One of the reasons is the lack of a de-facto standard for an evaluation metric (labeled or unlabeled, separate root accuracy?
    ), for splitting the data into training and testing portions and, in the case of constituency treebanks converted to dependency format, for this conversion.
    Another reason are the various annotation schemes and logical data formats used by different treebanks, which make it tedious
