or the device of pseudo-attachment, the skeletal analysis of the Treebank is entirely restricted to simple context-free trees.
  The reader may have noticed that the ADJP brackets in Figure 4 have vanished in Figure 5.
  For the sake of the overall efficiency of the annotation task, we leave all ADJP brackets in the simplified structure, with the annotators expected to remove many of them during annotation.
  The reason for this is somewhat complex, but provides a good example of the considerations that come into play in designing the details of annotation methods.
  The first relevant fact is that Fidditch only outputs ADJP brackets within NPs for adjective phrases containing more than one lexical item.
  To be consistent, he final structure must contain ADJP nodes for all adjective phrases within NPs or for none; we have chosen to delete all such nodes within NPs under normal circumstances.
  (This does not affect the use of the ADJP tag for predicative adjective phrases outside of NPs.)
