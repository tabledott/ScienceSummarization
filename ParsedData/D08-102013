ntence, and article length (F7).3 Article length (F7) was the only significant baseline factor, with correlation of -0.37.
    Longer articles are perceived as less well-written and harder to read than shorter ones.
    None of the other baseline metrics were close to being significant predictors of readability.
    We use a unigram language model, where the probability of an article is: P(wIM) is the probability of word-type w according to a background corpus M, and C(w) is the number of times w appears in the article.
    The log likelihood of an article is then: Note that this model will be biased in favor of shorter articles.
    Since each word has probability less than 1, the log probability of each word is less than 0, and hence including additional words decreases the log likelihood.
    We compensate for this by performing linear regressions with the unigram log likelihood and with the number of words in the article as an additional variable.
    The question then arises as to what to use as a backgr
