se patterns produced errors in anaphora resolution which were eliminated by processing them first.
    Hand-designed decision tree for Version 1 and Version 2.
    &#8226; only then try to interpret the definite description as a bridge (last test).
    The heuristics for recognizing bridging descriptions are only applied when the other heuristics fail.
    This is because the performance of these heuristics is very poor and also because some of the heuristics that deal with bridging descriptions are computationally expensive; the idea was to eliminate those cases less likely to be bridging before applying these heuristics.
    The system does not classify all occurrences of definite descriptions: when none of the tests succeeds, the definite description is not classified.
    We observed in our first tests that definite descriptions not resolved as direct anaphora and not identified as discourse-new by our heuristics were mostly classified in the standardized annotation as bridging descriptions or discourse-n
