nish at the maximum as well, so the log likelihood can be maximized by minimizing the average distortion with respect to the class centroids while class membership is kept fixed Minimizing the Average KL Distortion We first show that the minimization of the relative entropy yields the natural expression for cluster centroids To minimize the average distortion (10), we observe that the variation of the KL distance between noun and centroid distributions with respect to the centroid distribution p(v lc), with each centroid distribution normalized by the Lagrange multiplier Ac, is given by Substituting this expression into (10), we obtain c n v Since the bp(vic) are now independent, we obtain immediately the desired centroid expression (11), which is the desired weighted average of noun distributions.
    We can now see that the variation 6 log Z, vanishes for centroid distributions given by (11), since it follows from (10) that The Free Energy Function The combined minimum distortion and maximum entropy optimiz
