t one is the constrained data track of the NIST Arabicto-English (aren) and Chinese-to-English (zhen) translation task1.
    On this task, the parallel and the monolingual data included all the allowed training sets for the constrained track.
    Table 1 reports statistics computed over these data sets.
    Our development set (dev) consists of the NIST 2005 eval set; we use this set for optimizing MBR parameters.
    We report results on NIST 2002 and NIST 2003 evaluation sets.
    The second task consists of systems for 39 language-pairs with English as the target language and trained on at most 300M word tokens mined from the web and other published sources.
    The development and test sets for this task are randomly selected sentences from the web, and contain 5000 and 1000 sentences respectively.
    Our phrase-based statistical MT system is similar to the alignment template system described in (Och and Ney, 2004; Tromble et al., 2008).
    Translation is performed using a standard dynamic programming b
