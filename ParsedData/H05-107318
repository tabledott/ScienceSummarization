igure 1 for the two tuning conditions on the main feature sets and baselines.
			As expected, Table 5: Mean classification accuracy: N vs. E, 2 conditions same-tune-eval sep-tune-eval P(Neutral) 59.94 60.05 Content BOW 61.01 58.30 All features except BOW 64.68 63.45 All features 68.99 63.31 All features + sequencing 69.37 62.94 degree of success reflects parameter settings, bothfor content BOW and all features.
			Nevertheless, un der these circumstances, performance above a na??vebaseline and a BOW approach is obtained.
			More over, sequencing shows potential for contributing in one case.
			However, observations also point to three issues: first, the current data set appears tobe too small.
			Second, the data is not easily separa ble.
			This comes as no surprise, given the subjectivenature of the task, and the rather low interannota tor agreement, reported above.
			Moreover, despite the schematic narrative plots of children?s stories, tales still differ in their overall affective orientation, which incr
