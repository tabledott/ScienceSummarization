establishing a standard relational database (using PostgreSQL) for storing information for the lexical entries themselves, improving both scalability and clarity compared to the current simple text file representation.
    Formbased tools will be provided both for constructing lexical entries and for viewing the contents of the lexicon.
    The primary focus of work on syntactic generalization in the matrix is to support more freedom in word order, for both complements and modifiers.
    The first step will be a relatively conservative extension along the lines of Netter (1996), allowing the grammar writer more control over how a head combines with complements of different types, and their interleaving with modifier phrases.
