entially the main strategies that the phrase-based system is able to employ when modeling differing word-order across different languages.
    In practice, when training the parameters of an SMT system, for example using the discriminative methods of (Och, 2003), the cost for skips of this kind is typically set to a very high value.
    In experiments with the system of (Koehn et al., 2003) we have found that in practice a large number of complete translations are completely monotonic (i.e., have skips), suggesting that the system has difficulty learning exactly what points in the translation should allow reordering.
    In summary, phrase-based systems have relatively limited potential to model word-order differences between different languages.
    The reordering stage described in this paper attempts to modify the source language (e.g., German) in such a way that its word order is very similar to that seen in the target language (e.g., English).
    In an ideal approach, the resulting translation problem t
