ntic preferences.
    To see how the cue strengths of frequency information, morphological preferences, collocations, clusters, syntactic preferences, and role-related preferences interact with one another to produce the final ranking of senses, consider the problem of deciding the correct sense of reached in Example 1 (repeated below): Example 1 The agreement reached by the state and the EPA provides for the safe storage of the waste.
    According to the system's lexicon, reached has four possible verb senses: Figure 16 shows a tabulation of cue strengths for each of these interpretations of reach in Example 1, when just information in the VP reached by the state and the EPA is considered.
    The sense reach3 has the highest total score.
    From the table, we see that, at this point in the parse, the only strong source of preferences is the role information (line 6 of Figure 16).
    The derivation of these numbers is shown in Figures 17, 18, and 19, which list the role preferences associated with the pos
