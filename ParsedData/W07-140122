n order to make the task more challenging, and a pilot task was proposed.
    The Third RTE Challenge have also confirmed that the methodology for the creation of the datasets, developed in the first two campaigns, is robust.
    Overall, the transition of the challenge coordination from Bar-Ilan &#8211;which organized the first two challenges- to CELCT was successful, though some problems were encountered, especially in the preparation of the data set.
    The systems which took part in RTE-3 showed that the technology applied to Entailment Recognition has made significant progress, confirmed by the results, which were generally better than last year.
    In particular, visible progress in defining several new principled scenarios for RTE was represented, such as Hickl&#8217;s commitment-based approach, Bar Haim&#8217;s proof system, Harmeling&#8217;s probabilistic model, and Standford&#8217;s use of Natural Logic.
    If, on the one hand, the success that RTE has had so far is very encouraging, on the other
