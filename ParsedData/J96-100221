ical methods can be used to calculate A*.
    One simple method is coordinate-wise ascent, in which A* is computed by iteratively maximizing 41(A) one coordinate at a time.
    When applied to the maximum entropy problem, this technique yields the popular Brown algorithm (Brown 1959).
    Other general purpose methods that can be used to maximize T(A) include gradient ascent and conjugate gradient.
    An optimization method specifically tailored to the maximum entropy problem is the iterative scaling algorithm of Darroch and Ratcliff (1972).
    We present here a version of this algorithm specifically designed for the problem at hand; a proof of the monotonicity and convergence of the algorithm is given in Della Pietra et al. (1995).
    The algorithm is applicable whenever the feature functions f,(x,y) are nonnegative: This is, of course, true for the binary-valued feature functions we are considering here.
    The algorithm generalizes the Darroch-Ratcliff procedure, which requires, in addition to the nonn
