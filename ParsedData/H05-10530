	Domain-Specific Sense Distributions And Predominant Sense Acquisition
		Distributions of the senses of words are often highly skewed.
		This fact is exploitedby word sense disambiguation (WSD) sys tems which back off to the predominant sense of a word when contextual clues arenot strong enough.
		The domain of a doc ument has a strong influence on the sensedistribution of words, but it is not feasi ble to produce large manually annotated corpora for every domain of interest.
		In this paper we describe the construction of three sense annotated corpora in different domains for a sample of English words.We apply an existing method for acquiring predominant sense information automatically from raw text, and for our sam ple demonstrate that (1) acquiring suchinformation automatically from a mixeddomain corpus is more accurate than de riving it from SemCor, and (2) acquiringit automatically from text in the same do main as the target domain performs best by a large margin.
		We also show that for an all words WS
