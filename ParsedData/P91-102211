g and further inspection verifies that the number of tokens in sentences that are translations of one another are correlated.
    We looked, therefore, at the possibility of obtaining alignments solely on the basis of sentence lengths in tokens.
    From this point of view, each corpus is simply a sequence of sentence lengths punctuated by occasional paragraph markers.
    Figure 2 shows the initial portion of such a pair of corpora.
    We have circled groups of sentence lengths to show the correct alignment.
    We call each of the groupings a bead.
    In this example, we have an el-bead followed by an eff-bead followed by an e-bead followed by a 1,5f-bead.
    An alignment, then, is simply a sequence of beads that accounts for the observed sequences of sentence lengths and paragraph markers.
    We imagine the sentences in a subsection to have been generated by a pair of random processes, the first produring a sequence of beads and the second choosing the lengths of the sentences in each bead.
