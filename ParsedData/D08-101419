    Although we could have used a Spanish text to carry out a similar experiment, due to the fact that the dataset would have been different, the results would not have been directly comparable.
    The results of the two experiments exploring the portability to Spanish are shown in Table 4.
    Interestingly, all the figures are higher than those obtained for Romanian.
    We assume this occurs because Spanish is one of the six official United Nations languages, and the Google translation engine is using the United Nations parallel corpus to train their translation engine, therefore implying that a better quality translation is achieved as compared to the one available for Romanian.
    We can therefore conclude that the more accurate the translation engine, the more accurately the subjective content is translated, and therefore the better the results.
    As it was the case for Romanian, the SVM classifier produces the best results, with absolute improvements over the Naive Bayes classifier ranging from 0.
