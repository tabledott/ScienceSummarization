Brown et al. 1993).
    Following convention, we call the source language &#8220;French&#8221; and the target language &#8220;English&#8221;; the translation of a French sentence f into an English sentence e is modeled as: The phrase-based translation model P( f  |e) &#8220;encodes&#8221; e into f by the following steps: Other phrase-based models model the joint distribution P(e,f ) (Marcu and Wong 2002) or make P(e) and P(f I e) into features of a log-linear model (Och and Ney 2002).
    But the basic architecture of phrase segmentation (or generation), phrase reordering, and phrase translation remains the same.
    Phrase-based models can robustly perform translations that are localized to substrings that are common enough to have been observed in training.
    But Koehn, Och, and Marcu (2003) find that phrases longer than three words improve performance little for training corpora of up to 20 million words, suggesting that the data may be too sparse to learn longer phrases.
    Above the phrase level, some
