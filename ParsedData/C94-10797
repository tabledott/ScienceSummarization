lexi- eel item &lt;\[i,j\], av~lf, av ..... p&gt;, create an initiM message &lt;\[i,j\], av~r, 0&gt; and send this message to the grammar network node that represents the category or subcategory of the word sense.
			When the node receives the initial message, it may forward the message to other nodes or it ma,y combine the message with other messages and send the resulting combination to other nodes.
			This initiates a message passing pro- cess which stops when there are no more mes- sages to be passed around.
			At that point, the initial message for the next lexical item is fed into the network.
			Step 3: Build a Shared Parse Forest When all lexieal items have been processed, a shared parse forest for the input sentence can be built by tracing the origins of the messages at the highest node (CP or IP), whose str com- ponent is the whole sentence.
			The parse forest consists of the links of the grammar network that are traversed uring the tracing process.
			The structure of the parse forest is similar t
