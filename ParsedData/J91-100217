can be assumed to be coreferential.
    And more importantly, one should not be misled by chicken-andegg questions when dealing with cohesion and coherence.
    Rather, one should use each where applicable.
    Since the lexical cohesion between combination and safe is easy to compute, we argue that it makes sense to use this information as an indicator of coherence.

    Three structure levels are above the category level.
    The topmost level consists of eig
