pe of a word's arguments, but lexical information about their fillers.
    Although we are not aware of previous comparisons of the frequencies of argument fillers, we can only assume that they vary at least as much as the syntactic subcategorization frames.
  
  
    We take as our baseline parser the statistical model of Model 1 of Collins (1997).
    The model is a historybased, generative model, in which the probability for a parse tree is found by expanding each node in the tree in turn into its child nodes, and multiplying the probabilities for each action in the derivation.
    It can be thought of as a variety of lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar, with the rule probabilities factored into three distributions.
    The first distribution gives probability of the syntactic category H of the head child of a parent node with category P, head word Hhw with the head tag (the part of speech tag of the head word) Hht: The head word and head tag of the new node H are defined to be the same as those
