 of the 1997 pilot Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) corpus.
    The TDT corpus, developed by NIST and DARPA, is a collection of 16,000 news articles from Reuters and CNN where many of the articles and transcripts have been manually grouped into 25 categories each of which corresponds to a single event (see http: //morph. ldc upenn. edu/Catalog/LDC98T25 .html).
    Using the Reuters part of the corpus, we selected five of the larger categories and extracted all articles assigned to them from several randomly chosen days, for a total of 30 articles.
    Since paragraphs in news stories tend to be short&#8212;typically one or two sentences&#8212;in this study we use paragraphs as our small text units, although sentences would also be a possibility.
    In total, we have 264 text units and 10,345 comparisons between units.
    As comparisons are made between all pairs of paragraphs from the same topic, the total number of comparisons is equal to 2 where Ni is the number of paragraphs in all selected articles fr
