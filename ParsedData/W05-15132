t may seem that the larger search space of constituent trees (compared to the space of dependency trees) would make it unlikely that accurate parse trees could be built deterministically, we show that the precision and recall of constituents produced by our parser are close to those produced by statistical parsers with higher run-time complexity.
    One desirable characteristic of our parser is its simplicity.
    Compared to other successful approaches to corpus-based constituent parsing, ours is remarkably simple to understand and implement.
    An additional feature of our approach is its modularity with regard to the algorithm and the classifier that determines the parser&#8217;s actions.
    This makes it very simple for different classifiers and different sets of features to be used with the same parser with very minimal work.
    Finally, its linear runtime complexity allows our parser to be considerably faster than lexicalized PCFG-based parsers.
    On the other hand, a major drawback of the classif
