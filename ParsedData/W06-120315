her words small similarity values should be diagnostic for the presense of non-compositinoal uses of the MWE.
    We calculated the estimated compositional meaning vector by taking it to be the sum of the meaning vector of the parts, i.e., the compositional meaning of an expression w1w2 consisting of two words is taken to be sum of the meaning vectors for the constituent words.6 In order to maximize the independent contribution of the constituent words, the meaning vectors for these words were always computed from contexts in which they appear alone (that is, not in the local context of the other constituent).
    We call the estimated compositional meaning vector the &#8220;composed&#8221; vector.7 The comparisons we made are illustrated in Figure 2, where vectors for the MWE auf die Strecke bleiben &#8216;to fall by the wayside&#8217; and the words Strecke &#8216;route&#8217; and bleiben &#8216;to stay&#8217; are mapped into two dimensions8.
    (the words Autobahn &#8216;highway&#8217; and eigenst&#168;and
