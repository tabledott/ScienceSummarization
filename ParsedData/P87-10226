    The constraints proposed by [GJW86] fail in certain examples like the following (read with pronouns destressed): Brennan drives an Alfa Romeo.
    She drives too fast.
    Friedman races her on weekends.
    She often beats her.
    This example is characterized by its multiple ambiguous pronouns and by the fact that the final utterance achieves a shift (see figure 4).
    A shift is inevitable because of constraint 3, which states that the Cb(Un) must equal the Cp(Un_i) (since the Cp(U,i) is directly realized by the subject of Un, &amp;quot;Friedman&amp;quot;).
    However the constraints and rules from [GJW86] would fail to make a choice here between the co-specification possibilities for the pronouns in Un.
    Given that the transition is a shift, there seem to be more and less coherent ways to shift.
    Note that the three items being examined in order to characterize the transition between each pair of anchor?' are the
  
  
    Cb of Un_1, the Cb of Un, and the Cp
