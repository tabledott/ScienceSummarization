n us a tool for our studies of sense resolution in context.
  In the course of this exercise, however, it has become apparent to us that cross-referencing a lexicon and a textual corpus produces a hybrid resource that will be useful in a variety of practical and scientific applications.
  It has occurred to us that seman- tic concordances might be even more useful if a richer syn- tactic component could be incorporated, but how best to accomplish that is presently a question for the future.
