arser implemen tation and confirmed our findings.
			In the literature of k shortest-path problems, Minieka (1974) generalized the Floyd algorithm in a way very similar to our Algorithm 0 and Lawler (1977) improvedit using an idea similar to but a little slower than the bi nary branching case of our Algorithm 1.
			For hypergraphs, Gallo et al (1993) study the shortest hyperpath problemand Nielsen et al (2005) extend it to k shortest hyper path.
			Our work differes from (Nielsen et al, 2005) in two aspects.
			First, we solve the problem of k-best derivations (i.e., trees), not the k-best hyperpaths, although in many cases they coincide (see Sec.
			3 for further discussions).Second, their work assumes non-negative costs (or probabilities ? 1) so that they can apply Dijkstra-like algorithms.
			Although generative models, being probability based, do not suffer from this problem, more general models (e.g., log-linear models) may require negative edge costs (McDonald et al, 2005; Taskar et al, 2004).Our work,
