the parsing model estimates the conditional probability .
    The most likely parse is then given by formula (2).
    The second component is called the discourse parser, and it is an algorithm for finding .
    We first focus on the parsing model.
    A discourse parse tree can be formally represented as a set of tuples.
    The discourse tree in Figure 1, for example, can be formally written as the set of tuples ATTRIBUTION-SN[1,1,3] ENABLEMENT-NS[2,2,3] .
    A tuple is of the form , and denotes a discourse relation that holds between the discourse span that contains edus through , and the discourse span that contains edus through .
    Each relation also signals explicitly the nuclearity assignment, which can be NUCLEUSSATELLITE (NS), SATELLITE-NUCLEUS (SN), or NUCLEUSNUCLEUS (NN).
    This notation assumes that all relations are binary relations.
    The assumption is justified empirically: 99% of the nodes of the discourse trees in our corpus are binary nodes.
    Using only binary relations makes our d
