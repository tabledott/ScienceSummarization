ximately the semantic variable of the unnormalized Lexile (version 1.0) score.
    Because the Carroll-Davies-Richman corpus was not available to us, we used the written subset of the British National Corpus (Burnard, 1995) which has 921,074 types.
    (We converted these to the American equivalents.)
    We also included a fourth predictor: the FleschKincaid score (Kincaid et al. 1975), which is a linear combination of the text&#8217;s average sentence length (in tokens), and the average number of syllables per token.
    This was included for illustration purposes only, to verify the effect of syntactic noise.
    The results of the evaluation are summarized in Table 1.
    On the DRS test collection, the TYPES and FleschKincaid predictors had the best correlation with labeled grade level (0.93).
    TYPES also obtained the best correlation (0.86) for the Reading A-Z documents.
    However, Reading A-Z documents were written to pre-established criteria which includes objective factors such as type/ token ra
