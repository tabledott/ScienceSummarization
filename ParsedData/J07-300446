    Because the copula and to mediate similar dependencies between their subjects and complements, but do not fill their own subject dependencies, Japanese has the following dependencies: In the Treebank, object-raising verbs (wants half the debt forgiven) take a small clause argument with non-empty subject.
    Following our treatment of small clauses (see Section 5.3) we modify this tree so that we obtain the lexical category (((S[dcl]\NP)/(S[pss]\NPi))/NPi) for wanted, which mediates the dependency between debt and forgiven.16 Extraposition of Appositives.
    Appositive noun phrases can be extraposed out of a sentence or verb phrase, resulting in an anaphoric dependency.
