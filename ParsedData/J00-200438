fraction is largely determined by two bitext properties: the distribution of word frequencies, and the distribution of co-occurrence counts.
    Melamed (to appear) explores these properties in greater depth. parameters as the logarithm of the trans parameters.
    The competitive linking algorithm only cares about the relative magnitudes of the various score(u, v).
    However, Equation 26 is a sum rather than a product, so I scale the trans parameters logarithmically, to be consistent with its probabilistic interpretation: Yarowsky (1993, 271) has shown that &amp;quot;for several definitions of sense and collocation, an ambiguous word has only one sense in a given collocation with a probability of 90-99%.&amp;quot; In other words, a single contextual clue can be a highly reliable indicator of a word's sense.
    One of the definitions of &amp;quot;sense&amp;quot; studied by Yarowsky was a word token's translation in the other half of a bitext.
    For example, the English word sentence may be considered to
