    Our work looks for the first time at predicting the performance of NP coreference resolvers.
  
  
    We examine the state-of-the-art in NP coreference resolution.
    We show the relative impact of perfect NE recognition, perfect anaphoricity information for coreference elements, and knowledge of all and only the annotated CEs.
    We also measure the performance of state-of-the-art resolvers on several classes of anaphora and use these results to develop a measure that can accurately estimate a resolver&#8217;s performance on new data sets.
