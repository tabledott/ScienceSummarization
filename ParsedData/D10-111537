ur framework: one is to represent adjectives by the average of the AN vectors that contain them (the centroid vectors whose neighbors are illustrated in Table 1 above), and the other to compare them based on the 300&#215;300 weight matrices we estimate from noun-AN pairs (we unfold these matrices into 90K-dimensional vectors).
    We compare the quality of these representations to that of the standard approach in distributional semantics, i.e., representing the adjectives directly with their corpus co-occurrence profile vectors (in our case, projected onto the SVD-reduced space).
    We evaluate performance on the task of clustering those 19 adjectives in our set that can be relatively straightforwardly categorized into general classes comprising a minimum of 4 items.
    The test set built according to these criteria contains 4 classes: color (white, black, red, green), positive evaluation (nice, excellent, important, major, appropriate), time (recent, new, current, old, young), and size (big, huge, little,
