s to date have not been comparable with respect to the training and test data used, or the lexicons which have been made available to the learners.
			In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive comparison of methods for unsupervised part-of speech tagging.
			In addition, we explore two new ideas for improving tagging accuracy.
			First, we explore an HMM approach to tagging that uses context on both sides of the word to be tagged, inspired by previous work on building bidirectionality into graphical models (Lafferty et. al. 2001, Toutanova et. al. 2003).
			Second we describe a method for sequential unsupervised training of tag sequence and lexical probabilities in an HMM, which we observe leads to improved accuracy over simultaneous training with certain types of models.
			In section 2, we provide a brief description of the methods we evaluate and review published results.
			Section 3 describes the contextualized variation on HMM tagging that we have explored.
			In Section 4 we provide a direct co
