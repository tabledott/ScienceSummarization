tituent in figure 6 and decides No.
    The third pass terminates when CHECK is presented a constituent that spans the entire sentence.
    Table 2 compares the actions of BUILD and CHECK to the operations of a standard shift-reduce parser.
    The No and Yes actions of CHECK correspond to the shift and reduce actions, respectively.
    The important difference is that while a shift-reduce parser creates a constituent in one step (reduce a), the procedures BUILD and CHECK create it over several steps in smaller increments.
  
  
    This paper takes a &amp;quot;history-based&amp;quot; approach (Black et al., 1993) where each tree-building procedure uses a probability model p(alb), derived from p(a, b), to weight any action a based on the available context, or history, b.
    First, we present a few simple categories of contextual predicates that capture any information in b that is useful for predicting a.
    Next, the predicates are used to extract a set of features from a corpus of manually parsed sentence
