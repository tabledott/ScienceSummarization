that follow them.
    In particular, we look at the co-occurrence of nominals with between, with, and to.
    Table 1 shows results of the conflating noun plus preposition patterns.
    The percentage shown indicates the ratio of the particular collocation to the key word.
    Mutual information (MI) statistics for the two words in collocation are also shown.
    What these results indicate is that induction of semantic type from conflating syntactic patterns is possible.
    Based on the semantic types for these prepositions, the syntactic evidence suggests that there is an equivalence class where each preposition makes reference to a symmetric relation between the arguments in the following two patterns: We then take these results and, for those nouns where the association ratios for N with and N between are similar, we pair them with the set of verbs governing these &amp;quot;NP PP&amp;quot; combinations in corpus, effectively partitioning the original V-0 set into [+agentive] predicates and [&#8212;agenti
