 C-deaccented, or bears a H*, L* or complex pitch accent. level producing this classification was good.
    However, as with the OFD subtype of Discourse Type A, which also has the worst results for its class, we have the fewest tokens for this prosodic type.
    Tokens that fit Discourse Type B in Figure 6-first in a larger phrase and deaccented (NOFD) or first in a larger phrase and bearing a L* accent (NOFL)-appear more problematic: of the former, there was more disagreement than agreement between the judge's classification and the prosodic prediction of the classification.
    And of the 153 sentential items that fit this discourse prosodic model, 127 (83.0%) are conjunctions.
    The level of disagreement for the judge's classifications was also highest for Discourse Type B.
    While there is more agreement that tokens corresponding to Sentential Model A and characterized as NOFH-first in a larger phrase with a H* accent-or NOFC-first in a larger phrase and bearing a complex pitch accent, are sentential
