ich sets to the function if , otherwise.
    In the one setting in which there is a significant difference between the two, the Potts model does worse (ovaPSPovaPSP [3c]).
    Also, employing the Potts model generally leads to fewer significant improvements over a chosen base method (compare Figure 2&#8217;s tables with: regPSPreg [3c]; ovaPSP ova [3c]; ovaPSP ova [4c]; but note that regPSPreg [4c]).
    We note that optimizing the Potts model in the multi-label case is NPhard, whereas the optimal metric labeling with the identity metric-transformation function can be efficiently obtained (see Section 3.3).
    Q: Your datasets had many labeled reviews and only one author each.
    Is your work relevant to settings with many authors but very little data for each?
    A: As discussed in Section 2, it can be quite difficult to properly calibrate different authors&#8217; scales, since the same number of &#8220;stars&#8221; even within what is ostensibly the same rating system can mean different things for differ
