pus including sections from every genre.
    First, the test corpus was tagged by the simple lexical tagger.
    Next, each of the patches was in turn applied to the corpus.
    Below is a graph showing the improvement in accuracy from applying patches.
    It is significant that with only 71 patches, an error rate of 5.1% was obtained'.
    Of the 71 patches, 66 resulted in a reduction in the number of errors in the test corpus, 3 resulted in no net change, and 2 resulted in a higher number of errors.
    Almost all patches which were effective on the training corpus were also effective on the test corpus.
    Unfortunately, it is difficult to compare our results with other published results.
    In [Meteer et at.
    91], an error rate of 3-4% on one domain, Wall Street Journal articles and 5.6% on another domain, texts on terrorism in Latin American countries, is quoted.
    However, both the domains and the tag set are different from what we use.
    [Church 88] reports an accuracy of &amp;quot;95-99% cor
