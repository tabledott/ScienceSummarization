sion in (1) will be referred to as the most informative subsumer of wi and w2.
    Although there are many ways to associate probabilities with taxonomic classes, it is reasonable to require that concept probability be non-decreasing as one moves higher in the taxonomy; i.e., that ci c2 implies Pr(c2) &gt; Pr(ci ).
    This guarantees that &amp;quot;more abstract&amp;quot; does indeed mean &amp;quot;less informative,&amp;quot; defining informativeness in the traditional way in terms of log likelihood.
    Probability estimates are derived from a corpus by computing where words(c) is the set of nouns having a sense subsumed by concept C. Probabilities are then computed simply as relative frequency: where N is the total number of noun instances observed.
    Singular and plural forms are counted as the same noun, and nouns not covered by WordNet are ignored.
    Although the WordNet noun taxonomy has multiple root nodes, a single, &amp;quot;virtual&amp;quot; root node is assumed to exist, with the original root
