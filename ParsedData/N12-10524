    We develop an algorithm that generates cross-lingual word clusters; that is clusters of words that are consistent across languages.
    This is achieved by means of a probabilistic model over large amounts of monolingual data in two languages, coupled with parallel data through which cross-lingual word-cluster constraints are enforced.
    We show that by augmenting the delexicalized direct transfer system of McDonald et al. (2011) with cross-lingual cluster features, we are able to reduce its error by up to 13% relative.
    Further, we show that by applying the same method to direct-transfer NER, we achieve a relative error reduction of 26%.
    In line with much previous work on word clusters for tasks such as dependency parsing and NER, for which local syntactic and semantic constraints are of importance, we induce word clusters by means of a probabilistic class-based language model (Brown et al., 1992; Clark, 2003).
    However, rather than the more commonly used model of Brown et al. (1992), w
