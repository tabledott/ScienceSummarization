    The main advantage of typed unification is for grammar development.
    The type information on features allows the lexicon, grammar, and semantics compilers to provide detailed error analysis regarding the flow of values through the grammar, and to warn if features are assigned improper values, or variables of incompatible types are unified.
    Since the type-analysis is performed statically at compile time, there is no run-time overhead associated with adding types to the grammar.
    The major grammatical category plays a special role in the typing scheme of Gemini.
    For each category, Gemini makes a set of declarations stipulating its allowable features and the relevant value spaces.
    Thus, the distinction between the syntactic category of a constituent and its other features can be cashed out as follows: the syntactic category can be thought of as the feature structure type.
    The only other typ
