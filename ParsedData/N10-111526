 much better in terms of exact match, and much faster.
    As our parsing framework can easily and efficiently utilize more structural information than globally optimized parsers, we believe that with some enhancements and better features, it can outperform globally optimized algorithms, especially when more structural information is needed, such as for morphologically rich languages.
    Moreover, we show that our parser produces different structures than those produced by both left-to-right and globally optimized parsers, making it a good candidate for inclusion in an ensemble system.
    Indeed, a simple combination scheme of graph-based, left-to-right and non-directional parsers yields state-of-the-art results on English dependency parsing on the CoNLL 2007 dataset.
    We hope that further work on this non-directional parsing framework will pave the way to better understanding of an interesting cognitive question: which kinds of parsing decisions are hard to make, and which linguistic constructs are hard
