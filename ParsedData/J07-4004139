Statistical Parsing in supertagger accuracy by roughly one half.
    Future work will also look at maintaing the POS tag ambiguity through to the parsing stage.
    Currently we do not use the probabilities assigned to the lexical categories by the supertagger as part of the parse selection process.
    These scores could be incorporated as real-valued features, or as auxiliary functions, as in Johnson and Riezler (2000).
    We would also like to investigate using the generative model of Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002b) in a similar way.
    Using a generative model&#8217;s score as a feature in a discriminative framework has been beneficial for reranking approaches (Collins and Koo 2005).
    Because the generative model uses local features similar to those in our log-linear models, it could be incorporated into the estimation and decoding processes without the need for reranking.
    One way of improving the accuracy of a supertagger is to use the parser to provide large amounts of additional training data
