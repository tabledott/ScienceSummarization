everal joined target language words are dealt with as a new lexicon entry.
    This approach is used for the German-to-English translation experiments presented in this article.
    In order to deal with the IBM-4 fertility parameters within the DP-based concept, we adopt the distinction between open and closed hypotheses given in Berger et al. (1996).
    A hypothesis is said to be open if it is to be aligned with more source positions than it currently is (i.e., at least two).
    Otherwise it is called closed.
    The difference between open and closed is used to process the input sentence one position a time (for details see Tillmann 2001).
    The word reordering restrictions and the beam search pruning techniques are directly carried over to the full set of IBM-4 parameters, since they are based on restrictions on the coverage vectors C only.
    To ensure its correctness, the implementation was tested by carrying out forced alignments on 500 German-to-English training sentence pairs.
