    The threshold Bagr controls the precision of the agreement links, in that values of Bagr greater than zero mean that greater confidence is required before an agreement link can be added.10
  
  
    This section presents experiments testing the utility of using speech-segment relationships, evaluating against a number of baselines.
    All reported results use values for the free parameter &#945; derived via tuning on the development set.
    In the tables, boldface indicates the development- and test-set results for the development-set-optimal parameter settings, as one would make algorithmic choices based on development-set performance.
    Recall that to gather inter-speaker agreement information, the strategy employed in this paper is to classify by-name references to other speakers as to whether they indicate agreement or not.
    To train our agreement classifier, we experimented with undoing the deletion of amendmentrelated speech segments in the training set.
    Note that such speec
