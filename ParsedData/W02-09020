  Learning A Translation Lexicon From Monolingual Corpora
  
    This paper presents work on the task of constructing a word-level translation lexicon purely from unrelated monolingual corpora.
    We combine various clues such as cognates, similar context, preservation of word similarity, and word frequency.
    Experimental results for the construction of a German-English noun lexicon are reported.
    Noun translation accuracy of 39% scored against a parallel test corpus could be achieved.
  
  
    Recently, there has been a surge in research in machine translation that is based on empirical methods.
    The seminal work by Brown et al. [1990] at IBM on the Candide system laid the foundation for much of the current work in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).
    Some of this work has been re-implemented and is freely available for research purposes [AlOnaizan et al., 1999].
    Roughly speaking, SMT divides the task of translation into two steps: a word-level translation model and a model for word reo
