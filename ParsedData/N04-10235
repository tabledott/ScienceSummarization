conditional model estimated using a maximum entropy model.
    A small number of feature functions defined on the source and target sentence were used to rerank the translations generated by a baseline MT system.
    While the total number of feature functions was small, each feature function was a complex statistical model by itself, as for example, the alignment template feature functions used in this approach.
    Och (2003) described the use of minimum error training directly optimizing the error rate on automatic MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU.
    The experiments showed that this approach obtains significantly better results than using the maximum mutual information criterion on parameter estimation.
    This approach used the same set of features as the alignment template approach in (Och and Ney, 2002).
    SMT Team (2003) also used minimum error training as in Och (2003), but used a large number of feature functions.
    More than 450 different feature functions were used in order to improve the
