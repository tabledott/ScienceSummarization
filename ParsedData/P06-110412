ch&#246;lkopf and Smola, 2001), the two composite kernels are also proper kernels.
    A relation instance is encapsulated by a parse tree.
    Thus, it is critical to understand which portion of a parse tree is important in the kernel calculation.
    We study five cases as shown in Fig.1. mon sub-tree including the two entities.
    In other words, the sub-tree is enclosed by the shortest path linking the two entities in the parse tree (this path is also commonly-used as the path tree feature in the feature-based methods).
    Fig.
    1 illustrates different representations of an example relation instance.
    T1 is MCT for the relation instance, where the sub-tree circled by a dashed line is PT, which is also shown in T2 for clarity.
    The only difference between MCT and PT lies in that MCT does not allow partial production rules (for example, NP4PP is a partial production rule while NP4NP+PP is an entire production rule in the top of T2).
    For instance, only the most-right child in the most-left sub
