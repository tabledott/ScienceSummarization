    The gov and path features seem roughly equivalent in performance.
    Using head word, phrase type, and target word without either position or grammatical function yielded only 76.3% accuracy, indicating that although the two features accomplish a similar goal, it is important to include some measure of the constituent&#8217;s relationship to the target word, whether relative position or either of the syntactic features.
    Use of the active/passive voice feature seems to be beneficial only when the feature is tied to grammatical function: the second column in Table 7 shows no improvement over the first, while the right-hand column, where grammatical function and voice are tied, shows gains (although only trends) of at least 0.5% in all cases.
    As before, our three indicators of grammatical function seem roughly equivalent, with the best result in this case being the gov feature.
    The lattice of Figure 8c performs as well as our system of Figure 7, indicating that including both posit
