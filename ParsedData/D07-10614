			As an example, one of the best performing is the measure proposed by Jiang and Conrath (1997) (similar to the one proposed by (Lin,1991)), which finds the shortest path in the taxonomic hi erarchy between two candidate words before computing similarity as a function of the information content of thetwo words and their lowest common subsumer in the hi erarchy.
			We note the distinction between word similarityand word relatedness.
			Similarity is a special case of relat edness in that related words such as ?cat?
			and ?fur?
			share some semantic relationships (such as meronymy), but do not express the same likeness of form as would similarwords such as ?cat?
			and ?lion.?
			The Jiang-Conrath mea sure and most other measures that primarily make use of of hypernymy (is-a links) in the WordNet graph are better categorized as measures of similarity than of related
