ilistic counterpart described in the previous section.
    In contrast to the parser described by Ng and Tomita (1991), our probabilistic parser is able to merge (state and stack) configurations and in all cases still maintain a full record of all the probabilities computed up to that point, since it associates probabilities with partial analyses of the input so far rather than with nodes in the graph-structured stack.
    We are currently experimenting with techniques for probabilistically unpacking the packed parse forest to recover the first few most probable derivations without the need for exhaustive search or full expansion.
    In order to test the techniques and ideas described in previous sections, we undertook a preliminary experiment using a subset of LDOCE noun definitions as our test corpus.
    (The reasons for choosing this corpus are discussed in the introduction.)
    A corpus of approximately 32,000 noun definitions was created from LDOCE by extracting the definition fields and normalizing t
