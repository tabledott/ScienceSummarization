 test for reliability in such cases is the ability to agree on the rare categories (regardless of whether these are the categories of interest).
    Indeed, chance-corrected coefficients are sensitive to agreement on rare categories.
    This is easiest to see with a simple example of two coders and two categories, one common and the other one rare; to further simplify the calculation we also assume that the coder marginals are identical, so that &#960; and &#954; yield the same values.
    We can thus represent the judgments in a contingency table with just two parameters: E is half the proportion of items on which there is disagreement, and &#948; is the proportion of agreement on the Rare category.
    Both of these proportions are assumed to be small, so the bulk of the items (a proportion of 1 &#8722; (&#948; + 2E)) are labeled with the Common category by both coders (Table 7).
    From this table we can calculate Ao = 1 &#8722; 2E and Ae = 1 &#8722; 2(&#948; + E) + 2(&#948; + E)2, as well as &#960; and
