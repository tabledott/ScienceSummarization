ression and supervised LDA perform especially poorly on the classification metric.
    Both methods make predictions that are averaged across Earth&#8217;s surface requires computing or approximating the great circle distance &#8211; we use the Haversine formula (Sinnott, 1984).
    For the continental U.S., the relationship between degrees and kilometers is nearly linear, but extending the model to a continental scale would require a more sophisticated approach. each word in the document: in text regression, each word is directly multiplied by a feature weight; in supervised LDA the word is associated with a latent topic first, and then multiplied by a weight.
    For these models, all words exert an influence on the predicted location, so uninformative words will draw the prediction towards the center of the map.
    This yields reasonable distance errors but poor classification accuracy.
    We had hoped that K-nearest neighbors would be a better fit for this metric, but its performance is poor at all valu
