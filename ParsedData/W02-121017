representation of the semantic contribution of numeral classifiers (a relation between numbers and the nouns they modify, this time with an ARG feature), and a set of rules for promoting numeral classifier phrases to NPs that contribute the appropriate nominal semantics (underspecified in the case of ordinary numeral classifiers or specific in the case of words like en 'yen').
    The primary issue in the analysis of relative clauses and adjectives is the possibility of extreme ambiguity, due to several intersecting factors: Japanese has rampant pro-drop and does not have any relative pronouns.
    In addition, a head noun modified by a relative clause need not correspond to any gap in the relative clause, as shown by examples like the following (Matsumoto 1997): head NOM better become book 'a book that makes one smarter' Therefore, if we were to posit an attributive adjective + noun construction (distinct from the relative clause + noun possibility) we would have systematic ambiguities for NPs like akai hon
