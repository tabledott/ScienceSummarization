nsitive to the prior on &#955;i, allowing the use of the best value &#955;i for modeling the adaptation data.
    Another observation is that not only the features observed in the adaptation data get updated: even if E&#732;p(x,y)[fi] = 0, the weight &#955;i for feature fi will still get updated if the feature fi triggers for a context x encountered in the adaptation data and some predicted value y &#8212; not necessarily present in the adaptation data in context x.
    In our experiments the variances were tied to &#963;i = &#963; whose value was determined by line search on development data drawn from the adaptation data.
    The common variance &#963; will thus balance optimally the log-likelihood of the adaptation data with the A0 mean values obtained from the background data.
    Other tying schemes are possible: separate values could be used for the Fadapt \ Fbackground and Fbackground feature sets, respectively.
    We did not experiment with various tying schemes although this is a promising research
