tain subjective sentences.
    Second, we are trying to learn lexical items associated with subjectivity, that is, PSEs.
    As discussed above, many words and phrases with subjective usages have objective usages as well.
    Thus, even in perfect data with no noise, we would not expect 100% precision.
    (This is the motivation for the work on density presented in section 4.4.)
    Third, the distribution of opinions and nonopinions is highly skewed in favor of nonopinions: Only 9% of the articles in the combination of OP1 and OP2 are opinion pieces.
    In this work, increases in precision over a baseline precision are used as evidence that promising sets of PSEs have been found.
    Our main baseline for comparison is the number of word instances in opinion pieces, divided by the total number of word instances: Baseline Precision = number of word instances in opinion pieces total number of word instances Frequencies and increases in precision of unique words in subjective-element data.
