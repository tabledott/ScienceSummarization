 in text (subjectivity).
    A large number of text processing applications have already employed techniques for automatic subjectivity analysis, including automatic expressive text-to-speech synthesis (Alm et al., 2005), text semantic analysis (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), tracking sentiment timelines in on-line forums and news (Lloyd et al., 2005; Balog et al., 2006), mining opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004), and question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).
    A significant fraction of the research work to date in subjectivity analysis has been applied to English, which led to several resources and tools available for this language.
    In this paper, we explore multiple paths that employ machine translation while leveraging on the resources and tools available for English, to automatically generate resources for subjectivity analysis for a new target language.
