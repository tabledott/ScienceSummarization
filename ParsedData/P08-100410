ranging variables sequentially in a linear chain, RE can be treated as a sequence labeling problem.
    Linear-chain CRFs have been applied to a variety of sequential text processing tasks including named-entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, word segmentation, semantic role identification, and recently relation extraction (Culotta et al., 2006).
    As with O-NB, O-CRF&#8217;s training process is selfsupervised.
    O-CRF applies a handful of relationindependent heuristics to the PennTreebank and obtains a set of labeled examples in the form of relational tuples.
    The heuristics were designed to capture dependencies typically obtained via syntactic parsing and semantic role labelling.
    For example, a heuristic used to identify positive examples is the extraction of noun phrases participating in a subjectverb-object relationship, e.g., &#8220;&lt;Einstein&gt; received &lt;the Nobel Prize&gt; in 1921.&#8221; An example of a heuristic that locates negative examples is the extraction of objects that
