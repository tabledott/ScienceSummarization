8220;Change&#8221;, tumor regression is &#8220;Ending/reduction&#8221; and &#8220;Change&#8221; and bladder dysfunction is &#8220;Location&#8221; and &#8220;Defect&#8221;.
    Our approach handles this kind of multi-labeled classification.
    Two relation types are especially problematic.
    Some compounds are non-compositional or lexicalized, such as vitamin k and e2 protein; others defy classification because the nouns are subtypes of one another.
    This group includes migraine headache, guinea pig, and hbv carrier.
    We placed all these NCs in a catch-all category.
    We also included a &#8220;wrong&#8221; category containing word pairs that were incorrectly labeled as NCs.2 The relations were found by iterative refinement based on looking at 2245 extracted compounds (described in the next section) and finding commonalities among them.
    Labeling was done by the authors of this paper and a biology student; the NCs were classified out of context.
    We expect to continue development and refinement
