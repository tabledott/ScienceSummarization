    This reflected the relative skew of random spans being more likely to be distituents.
    This contrasts with our previous work, which was sensitive to smoothing method, and required a massive amount of it.
  
  
    We performed most experiments on the 7422 sentences in the Penn treebank Wall Street Journal section which contained no more than 10 words after the removal of punctuation and null elements (WSJ-10).
    Evaluation was done by measuring unlabeled precision, recall, and their harmonic mean F1 against the treebank parses.
    Constituents which could not be gotten wrong (single words and entire sentences) were discarded.3 The basic experiments, as described above, do not label constituents.
    An advantage to having only a single constituent class is that it encourages constituents of one type to be found even when they occur in a context which canonically holds another type.
    For example, NPs and PPs both occur between a verb and the end of the sentence, and they can transfer constit
