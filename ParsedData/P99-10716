istribution in the text (Salton et al., 1991; Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998).
    Recent work (Mani and Bloedorn, 1997) exploits semantic relations between text units for content representation, such as synonymy and co-reference.
    A spreading activation algorithm and graph matching is used to identify similarities and differences across documents.
    The output is presented as a set of paragraphs with similar and unique words highlighted.
    However, if the same information is mentioned several times in different documents, much of the summary will be redundant.
    While some researchers address this problem by selecting a subset of the repetitions (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998), this approach is not always satisfactory.
