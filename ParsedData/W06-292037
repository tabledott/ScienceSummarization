se and has also been used by Kudo and Matsumoto tions (SD) from the average per participant are calculated over the 12 obligatory languages (i.e. excluding Bulgarian).
    Note that due to the equal sizes of the test sets for all languages, the total scores, i.e. the LAS over the concatenation of the 12 obligatory test sets, are identical (up to the first decimal digit) to the average LAS over the 12 test sets.
    Averages and standard deviations per data set are calculated ignoring zero scores (i.e. results not submitted).
    The highest score for each column and those not significantly worse (p &lt; 0.05) are shown in bold face.
    Significance was computed using the official scoring script eval.pl and Dan Bikel&#8217;s Randomized Parsing Evaluation Comparator, which implements stratified shuffling. aAttardi&#8217;s submitted results contained an unfortunate bug which caused the DEPREL values of all tokens with HEAD=0 to be an underscore (which is scored as incorrect).
    Using the simple heuristic of a
