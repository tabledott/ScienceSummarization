restore the missing structure wherever possible, in many cases this would have required additional manual annotation, going beyond the scope of our project.
    We suspect that these properties of the original Treebank will affect any similar attempt to extract dependency structures or grammars for other expressive formalisms.
    The Penn Treebank is the earliest (and still the largest) corpus of its kind; we hope that our experiences will extend its useful life, and help in the design of future treebanks.
  
  
    Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) was originally developed as a &#8220;near-contextfree&#8221; theory of natural language grammar, with a very free definition of derivational structure adapted to the analysis of coordination and unbounded dependency without movement or deletion transformations.
    It has been successfully applied to the analysis of coordination, relative clauses and related constructions, intonation structure, binding and control, and quantifier scope alternation, in a number
