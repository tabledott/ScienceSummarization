h the output of char_align because it is more robust than alternative sentence-based methods.
    This choice, of course, requires certain modifications to the model of Brown et al. to accommodate as input an initial rough alignment (such as produced by char_align) instead of pairs of aligned sentences.
    It is also useful to reduce the number of parameters that we are trying to estimate, because we have much less data and much more noise.
    The paragraphs below describe our modifications which are intended to meet these somewhat different requirements.
    The two major modifications are: (a) replacing the sentence-by-sentence alignment with a single global alignment for the entire corpus, and (b) replacing the set of probabilities a(ijj, in,!) with a small set of offset probabilities.
    Word_align starts with an initial rough alignment, I, which maps French positions to English positions (if the mapping is partial, we use linear extrapolation to make it complete).
    Our goal is to find a global alig
