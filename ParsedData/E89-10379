tions of more abstract structures to be produced.
    Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988), for example, discuss a level of semantic structure that encodes predicate-argument relations and quantifier scope, information that does not enter into the kinds of syntactic generalizations that the f-structure supports.
    They point out how the semantic structure can be set in correspondence with both c-structure and f-structure units by means of related mappings a and a'.
    Kaplan (1987) raises the possibility of further distinct structures and correspondences to represent anaphoric dependencies, discourse properties of sentences, and other projections of the same string.
    Second, Kaplan (1988) and Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988) discuss other methods for deriving the descriptions necessary to determine these abstract structures.
    The arrangement outlined above, in which the description of one kind of structure (the f-structure) is derived by analyzing or matching against another one, is an example of what is called de
