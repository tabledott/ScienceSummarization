    In outline, the ITS algorithm is as follows: For the sake of concreteness, let us take features to be labeled subdags.
    In step 2 of the algorithm we do not consider every conceivable labeled subdag, but only the atomic (i.e., single-node) subdags and those complex subdags that can be constructed by combining features already in the field or by combining a feature in the field with some atomic feature.
    We also limit our attention to features that actually occur in the training corpus.
    In our running example, the atomic features are as shown in Figure 12.
    Features can be combined by adding connecting arcs, as shown in Figure 13, for example.
    Combining features to create more complex features.
    Field induction begins with the null field.
    With the corpus we have been assuming, the null field takes the form in Figure 14.
    No dag x has any features, so 0(x) = n, i3( is a The null field for G2. product of zero terms, and hence has value 1.
    As a result, q is the uniform distribut
