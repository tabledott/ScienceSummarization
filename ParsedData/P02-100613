;QUESTION_TERM_2&gt;&#8221;, where &lt;QUESTION_TERM_1&gt; and &lt;QUESTION_TERM_2&gt; represent the terms &#8220;Long Beach&#8221; and &#8220;county&#8221; respectively.
    The performance of the system depends significantly on there being only one anchor word, which allows a single word match between the question and the candidate answer sentence.
    The presence of multiple anchor words would help to eliminate many of the candidate answers by simply using the condition that all the anchor words from the question must be present in the candidate answer sentence.
    The system does not classify or make any distinction between upper and lower case letters.
    For example, &#8220;What is micron?&#8221; is answered by &#8220;In Boise, Idaho, a spokesman for Micron, a maker of semiconductors, said Simms are &#8216; a very high volume product for us ...&#8217; &#8221;.
    The answer returned by the system would have been perfect if the word &#8220;micron&#8221; had been capitalized in the question.
