POS) tags before training or testing.
    We used the EM algorithm to train this model on POS sequences in six languages.
    Complete experimental details are given in the appendix.
    Performance with unsupervised and supervised model selection across different &#955; values in add-&#955; smoothing and three initializers O(0) is reported in Table 1.
    The supervised-selected model is in the 40&#8211;55% F1-accuracy range on directed dependency attachments.
    (Here F1 Pz&#65533; precision Pz&#65533; recall; see appendix.)
    Supervised model selection, which uses a small annotated development set, performs almost as well as the oracle, but unsupervised model selection, which selects the model that maximizes likelihood on an unannotated development set, is often much worse.
  
  
    Hidden-variable estimation algorithms&#8212; including EM&#8212;typically work by iteratively manipulating the model parameters O to improve an objective function F(O).
    EM explicitly alternates between the computation o
