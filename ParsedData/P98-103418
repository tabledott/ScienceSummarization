crease in training time.
    Another effective technique to speed up training is motivated by Charniak's (1996) observation that the benefit of using rules that only occurred once in training is marginal.
    By discarding these rules before pruning, we reduce the size of the initial grammar &#8212; and the time for incremental pruning &#8212; by 60%, with a performance drop of only -0.3P/-0.1R.
    It is informative to consider the kinds of errors made by the treebank approach to bracketing.
    In particular, the errors may indicate options for incorporating lexical information into the base NP finder.
    Given the increases in performance achieved by Ramshaw &amp; Marcus by including word-level cues, we would hope to see similar improvements by exploiting lexical information in the treebank approach.
    For each corpus we examined the first 100 or so errors and found that certain linguistic constructs consistently cause trouble.
    (In the examples that follow, the bracketing shown is the error.)
