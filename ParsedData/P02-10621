hods is their flexibility in incorporating features into a model: essentially any features which might be useful in discriminating good from bad structures can be included.
    A second appeal of these methods is that their training criterion is often discriminative, attempting to explicitly push the score or probability of the correct structure for each training sentence above the score of competing structures.
    This discriminative property is shared by the methods of (Johnson et al. 1999; Collins 2000), and also the Conditional Random Field methods of (Lafferty et al.
    2001).
    In a previous paper (Collins 2000), a boosting algorithm was used to rerank the output from an existing statistical parser, giving significant improvements in parsing accuracy on Wall Street Journal data.
    Similar boosting algorithms have been applied to natural language generation, with good results, in (Walker et al. 2001).
    In this paper we apply reranking methods to named-entity extraction.
