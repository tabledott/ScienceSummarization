    Instead we used a head table that defined several types of heads (syntactic, semantic) and a link table that specified what linked to which type of head.24 Another problem existed with the Dutch treebank.
    Its original PoS tag set is very coarse and the PoS and the word stem information is not very reliable.25 We therefore decided to retag the treebank automatically using the Memory-Based Tagger (MBT) (Daelemans et al., 1996) which uses a very fine-grained tag set.
    However, this created a problem with multiwords.
    MBT does not have the concept of multiwords and therefore tags all of their 21Many thanks to Academia Sinica for granting the temporary license fo
