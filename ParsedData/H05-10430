	Extracting Product Features And Opinions From Reviews
		Consumers are often forced to wade through many on-line reviews inorder to make an informed prod uct choice.
		This paper introducesOPINE, an unsupervised informationextraction system which mines reviews in order to build a model of important product features, their evalu ation by reviewers, and their relative quality across products.
		Compared to previous work, OPINE achieves 22% higher precision (with only 3% lower recall) on the feature extraction task.
		OPINE?s novel use ofrelaxation labeling for finding the semantic orientation of words in con text leads to strong performance on the tasks of finding opinion phrases and their polarity.
