od, based on grouped voting.
    The most straightforward method to combine the results of multiple taggers is to do an n-way vote.
    Each tagger is allowed to vote for the tag of its choice, and the tag with the highest number of votes is selected.'
    The question is how large a vote we allow each tagger (Figure 1).
    The most democratic option is to give each tagger one vote (Majority).
    This does not require any tuning of the voting mechanism on training data.
    However, the component taggers can be distinguished by several figures of merit, and it appears more useful to give more weight to taggers that have proved their quality.
    For this purpose we use precision and recall, two well-known measures, which can be applied to the evaluation of tagger output as well.
    For any tag X, precision measures which percentage of the tokens tagged X by the tagger are also tagged X in the benchmark.
    Recall measures which percentage of the tokens tagged X in the benchmark are also tagged X by the ta
