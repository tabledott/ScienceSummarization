ibutional similarity models?
			successfulapplications in various NLP tasks, one major limi tation common to most of these models is that they assume only one representation for each word.
			Thissingle-prototype representation is problematic be cause many words have multiple meanings, whichcan be wildly different.
			Using one representa tion simply cannot capture the different meanings.
			Moreover, using all contexts of a homonymous or polysemous word to build a single prototype could hurt the representation, which cannot represent any one of the meanings well as it is influenced by all meanings of the word.
			Instead of using only one representation per word,Reisinger and Mooney (2010b) proposed the multi prototype approach for vector-space models, which uses multiple representations to capture different senses and usages of a word.
			We show how our 875model can readily adopt the multi-prototype ap proach.
