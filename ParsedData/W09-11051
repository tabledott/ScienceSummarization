 the same approach can also be used for text from other domains.
    Finding the scope of a negation signal means determining at sentence level the sequence of words in the sentence that is affected by the negation.
    This task is different from determining whether a word is negated or not.
    For a sentence like the one in Example (1) taken from the BioScope corpus (Szarvas et al., 2008), the system detects that lack, neither, and nor are negation signals; that lack has as its scope lack of CD5 expression, and that the discontinuous negation signal neither ... nor has as its scope neither to segregation of human autosome 11, on which the CD5 gene has been mapped, nor to deletion of the CD5 structural gene.
    Predicting the scope of negation is relevant for text mining and information extraction purposes.
    As Vincze et al. (2008) put it, extracted information that falls in the scope of negation signals cannot be presented as factual information.
    It should be discarded or presented separately.
