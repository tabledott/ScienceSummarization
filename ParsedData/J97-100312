oximated the average subtopic segment length.
    Salton, Allan, and Buckley (1993), working with encyclopedia text, find that comparing a query against orthographically marked sections and then paragraphs is more successful than comparing against full documents alone.
    Moffat et al. (1994) find, somewhat surprisingly, that manually supplied sectioning information may lead to poorer retrieval results than techniques that automatically subdivide the text.
    They compare two methods of subdividing long texts.
    The first consists of using author-supplied sectioning information.
    The second uses a heuristic in which small numbers of paragraphs are grouped together until they exceed a size threshold.
    The results are that the small, artificial multi-paragraph groupings seemed to perform better than the author-supplied sectioning information (which usually consisted of many more paragraphs than Moffet et al. 's subdivision algorithm or TextTiling would create).
    More experiments in this vein are ne
