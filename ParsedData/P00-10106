values to identified time expressions.
    Times which are fully specified are tagged with their value, e.g, &#8220;June 1999&#8221; as 19:99:06 by the SC module.
    The DP module uses an ordered sequence of rules to handle the context-dependent expressions.
    These cover the following cases: Explicit offsets from reference time: indexicals like &#8220;yesterday&#8221;, &#8220;today&#8221;, &#8220;tomorrow&#8221;, &#8220;this afternoon&#8221;, etc., are ambiguous between a specific and a nonspecific reading.
    The specific use (distinguished from the generic one by machine learned rules discussed below) gets assigned a value based on an offset from the reference time, but the generic use does not.
    Positional offsets from reference time: Expressions like &#8220;next month&#8221;, &#8220;last year&#8221; and &#8220;this coming Thursday&#8221; use lexical markers (underlined) to describe the direction and magnitude of the offset from the reference time.
    Implicit offsets based on verb tense: Expressi
