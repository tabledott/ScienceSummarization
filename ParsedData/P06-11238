    One of the important design choices in this kind of study is how to treat multiple links attached to the same word token.
    Word aligners, both human and automatic, are often inconsistent about whether they intend such sets of links to be disjunctive or conjunctive.
    In accordance with its focus on lower bounds, the present study treated them as disjunctive, to give the hierarchical alignment algorithm more opportunities to use fewer gaps.
    This design decision is one of the main differences between our study and that of Fox (2002), who treated links to the same word conjunctively.
    By treating many-to-one links disjunctively, our measure of complexity ignored a large class of discontinuities.
    Many types of discontinuous constituents exist in text independently of any translation.
    Simard et al. (2005) give examples such as English verb-particle constructions, and the French negation ne... pas.
    The disparate elements of such constituents would usual
