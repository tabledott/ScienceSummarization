nformation gain-like metric described in (Chien, 1997; Gao et al., 2002) to estimate how likely a candidate is to form a morphologically derived word, and remove &#8216;bad&#8217; candidates.
    The basic idea behind the metric is that a Chinese word should appear as a stable sequence in the corpus.
    That is, the components within the word are strongly correlated, while the components at both ends should have low correlations with words outside the sequence.
    (3) Linguistic selection.
    We finally manually check the remaining candidates, and construct the morph-lexicon, where each entry is tagged by its morphological pattern.
    We consider four types of named entities: person names (PN), location names (LN), organization names (ON), and transliterations of foreign names (FN).
    Because any character strings can be in principle named entities of one or more types, to limit the number of candidates for a more effective search, we generate named entity candidates, given an input string, in two steps
