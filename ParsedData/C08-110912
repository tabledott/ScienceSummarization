			The Comlex-based features did not improve the model, and though the Google N-gram corpus represents much more information than our7 million event model, its inclusion improved per formance only marginally.
			2.4 Evaluation.
			In our initial evaluation of the system we col lected a corpus of 8,269 preposition contexts,error-annotated by two raters using the scheme de scribed in Section 3 to serve as a gold standard.
			In this study, we focus on two of the three types of preposition errors: using the incorrect preposition and using an extraneous preposition.
