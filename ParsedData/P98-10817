n about the focus word and the two positions before and after, at least for known words.
    For unknown words, the single position before and after, three suffix letters, and information about capitalization and presence of a hyphen or a digit are used.
    The fourth and final system is the MXPOST system as described by Ratnaparkhi (19962; henceforth tagger E, for Entropy).
    It uses a number of word and context features rather similar to system M, and trains a Maximum Entropy model that assigns a weighting parameter to each feature-value and combination of features that is relevant to the estimation of the probability P(taglfeatures).
    A beam search is then used to find the highest probability tag sequence.
    Both this system and Brill's system are used with the default settings that are suggested in their documentation.
  
  
    The data we use for our experiment consists of the tagged LOB corpus (Johansson 1986).
    The corpus comprises about one million words, divided over 500 samples of 2000 w
