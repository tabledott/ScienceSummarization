utput the similarities computed by the adjective-noun module, after converting them to dissimilarities), and evaluated the results produced.
    The values of the metrics for the partition with 9 clusters appear in Table 4, alongside the corresponding values produced when the system uses both modules.
    When both modules are used, we can see a significant improvement of about 15 points, which is a 43% to 50% improvement for all metrics (except for fallout where the improvement is about 17%).
    This represents a definite improvement even though for our test set of 21 adjectives (Figure 2) we observed in our corpus only 41 distinct adjectiveadjective pairs, out of a possible (221)=210 pairs.
    Al7Thus indicating that human models which fared well on the precision metric tended to perform badly on recall, and vice versa; remember that the values of the metrics are related to the number of clusters used, and that the human judges were allowed to select the number of clusters they considered most appropriate
