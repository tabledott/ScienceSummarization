ontextual polarity of the instances of those clues in the corpus.
    The process that we use has two steps, first classifying each clue as being in a neutral or polar phrase, and then disambiguating the contextual polarity of the clues marked as polar.
    For each step in the process, we experiment with a variety of features and evaluate the performance of the features using several different machine learning algorithms.
    Our experiments reveal a number of interesting findings.
    First, being able to accurately identify neutral contextual polarity&#8212;when a positive or negative clue is not being used to express a sentiment&#8212;is an important aspect of the problem.
    The importance of neutral examples has previously been noted for classifying the sentiment of documents (Koppel and Schler 2006), but ours is the first work to explore how neutral instances affect classifying the contextual polarity of words and phrases.
    In particular, we found that the performance of features for distinguishing
