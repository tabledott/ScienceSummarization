  Corpus-Based Induction Of Syntactic Structure: Models Of Dependency And Constituency
  
    present a generative model for the learning of dependency structures.
    We also describe the multiplicative combination of this dependency model with a model of linear constituency.
    The product model outperforms both components on their respective evaluation metrics, giving the best published figures for undependency parsing constituency parsing.
    We also demonstrate that the combined model works and is robust cross-linguistically, being able to exploit either attachment or distributional regularities that are salient in the data.
  
  
    The task of statistically inducing hierarchical syntactic structure over unannotated sentences of natural language has received a great deal of attention (Carroll and Charniak, 1992; Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Brill, 1993; Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994).
    Researchers have explored this problem for a variety of reasons: to argue empirically against the poverty of the sti
