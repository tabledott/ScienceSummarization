e incorporate model building (see 628 Section 5 for a discussion of related work).
			Both methods are domain-independent to increasetransferrability and have not been tailored to any par ticular test suite.
			In Section 4 we test their accuracy and robustness on the RTE datasets as one of the few currently available datasets for textual inference.
			We also combine the two methods in a hybrid approach using machine learning.
			We discuss particularly the following questions:?
			Can the methods presented improve significantly over the baseline and what are the per formance differences between them?
			Does thehybrid system using both shallow and deep se mantic analysis improve over the individual use of these methods?
			How far does deep semantic analysis suffer from a lack of lexical and world knowledge and how can we perform logical inference in the face of potentially large knowledge gaps??
			How does the design of the test suite affect per formance?
			Are there subsets of the test suitethat are mor
