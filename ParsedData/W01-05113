ieves accuracies as high as 62%.
    By taking advantage of lexical ontologies, we achieve strong results on noun compounds for which neither word is present in the training set.
    Thus, we think this is a promising approach for a variety of semantic labeling tasks.
    The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related work, Section 3 describes the semantic relations and how they were chosen, and Section 4 describes the data collection and ontologies.
    In Section 5 we describe the method for automatically assigning semantic relations to noun compounds, and report the results of experiments using this method.
    Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses future work.
  
  
    Several approaches have been proposed for empirical noun compound interpretation.
    Lauer and Dras (1994) point out that there are three components to the problem: identification of the compound from within the text, syntactic analysis of the compound (left versus right association), and the interpr
