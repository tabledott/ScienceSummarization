ly all efforts in this area have sought to extract the maximum mileage from quite limited semantic representations.
    Some have used simple measures of semantic overlap, but the more interesting work has largely converged on a graphalignment approach, operating on semantic graphs derived from syntactic dependency parses, and using a locally-decomposable alignment score as a proxy for strength of entailment.
    (Below, we argue that even approaches relying on weighted abduction may be seen in this light.)
    In this paper, we highlight the fundamental semantic limitations of this type of approach, and advocate a multi-stage architecture that addresses these limitations.
    The three key limitations are an assumption of monotonicity, an assumption of locality, and a confounding of alignment and evaluation of entailment.
    We focus on the PASCAL RTE data, examples from which are shown in table 1.
    This data set contains pairs consisting of a short text followed by a one-sentence hypothesis.
