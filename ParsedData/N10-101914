 to grammatical proofing.
    Spelling errors that were flagged as morphology errors were left alone.
    By the same token, we corrected confused words that are covered by MS Word.
    We then revised British English spelling to American English spelling conventions.
    In addition, we eliminated all annotations for nonpertinent errors (i.e., non-preposition/article errors, or errors that do not involve any of the targeted prepositions), but we maintained the original (erroneous) text for these.
    This makes our task harder since we will have to learn how to make predictions in text containing multiple errors, but it also is a more realistic scenario given real learner writing.
    Finally, we eliminated sentences containing nested errors and immediately adjacent errors when they involve pertinent (preposition/article) errors.
    For example, an annotated error &amp;quot;take a picture&amp;quot; with the correction &amp;quot;take pictures&amp;quot; is annotated as two consecutive errors: &amp;quot;delete
