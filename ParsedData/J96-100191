f translations produced by this extension.
    While we have not yet completed a full evaluation of these results, preliminary work using the evaluation of only one judge suggests that our results improve substantially.
    Tools for the target language.
    Tools in French, such as a morphological analyzer, a tagger, a list of acronyms, a robust parser, and various lists of tagged words, would be most helpful and would allow us to improve our results.
    For example, a tagger for French would allow us to run XTRACT on the French part of the corpus, and thus to translate from either French or English as input.
    In addition, running XTRACT on the French part of the corpus would allow for independent confirmation of the proposed translations, which should be French collocations.
    Similarly, a morphological analyzer would allow us to produce richer results, since several forms of the same word would be conflated, increasing both the expected and the actual frequencies of the co-occurrence events; this has
