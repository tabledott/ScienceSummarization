			The task involves a lexical sample of nouns, verbs,adjectives and adverbs.
			Both annotators and sys tems select one or more substitutes for the target word in the context of a sentence.
			The data wasselected from the English Internet Corpus of English produced by Sharoff (2006) from the Inter net (http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/internet.html).
			This is a balanced corpus similar in flavour to the BNC, though with less bias to British English, obtained by sampling data from the web.
			Annotators are notprovided with the PoS (noun, verb, adjective or ad verb) but the systems are.
			Annotators can provide up to three substitutes but all should be equally as good.
			They are instructed that they can provide aphrase if they can?t think of a good single word sub stitute.
			They can also use a slightly more general word if that is close in meaning.
			There is a ?NAME?
			response if the target is part of a proper name and ?NIL?
			response if annotators cannot think of a good substitute.
