 by pruning chart items that have low posterior probability under a simpler grammar.
    Charniak et al. (2006) pre-parse with a sequence of grammars which are coarser than (parentannotated) treebank grammars.
    However, we also work with grammars which are already heavily split, up to half as split as the final grammar, because we found the computational cost for parsing with the simple X-bar grammar to be insignificant compared to the costs for parsing with more refined grammars.
    For a final grammar G = Gn, we compute estimates for the n projections Gn&#8722;1,... , G0 =X-Bar, where Gi = &#960;i(G) as described in the previous section.
    Additionally we project to a grammar G&#8722;1 in which all nonterminals, except for the preterminals, have been collapsed.
    During parsing, we start of by exhaustively computing the inside/outside scores with G&#8722;1.
    At each stage, chart items with low posterior probability are removed from the chart, and we proceed to compute inside/outside scores with t
