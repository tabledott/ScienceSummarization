  As will be explained later, performance does not seem to very sensitive to these precise language dependent quantities, and therefore we simply assume c = 1, which simplifies the program considerably.
    The model assumes that s2 is proportional to length.
    The constant of proportionality is determined by the slope of a robust regression.
    The result for English-German is s2 = 7.3, and for English-French is s2 = 5.6.
    Again, we have found that the difference in the two slopes is not too important.
    Therefore, we can combine the data across languages, and adopt the simpler language independent estimate s2 r--- 6.8, which is what is actually used in the program.
    We now appeal to Bayes Theorem to estimate where Prob(I81) is the probability that a random variable, z, with a standardized (mean zero, variance one) normal distribution, has magnitude at least as large as 181 The program computes 8 directly from the lengths of the two portions of text, li and /2, and the two parameters, c and s2.
