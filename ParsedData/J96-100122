sentence, it is necessary to know the specific translation for each of the source collocations.
    We use XTRACT (Smadja and McKeown 1990; Smadja 1991a; Smadja 1993), a tool we developed previously, to identify collocations in the source language (task 1).
    XTRACT works in three stages.
    In the first stage, word pairs that co-occur with significant frequency are identified.
    These words can be separated by up to four intervening words and thus constitute flexible collocations.
    In the second stage, XTRACT identifies combinations of word pairs from stage one with other words and phrases, producing compounds and idiomatic templates (i.e., phrases with one or more holes to be filled by specific syntactic types).
    In the final stage, XTRACT filters any pairs that do not consistently occur in the same syntactic relation, using a parsed version of the corpus.
    This tool has been used in several projects at Columbia University and has been distributed to a number of research and commercial sites w
