btained from the WSJ corpus presented above) 11 = 0.15.
    Thus a PCFG language model induced from the simple two-tree corpus above can underestimate the relative frequency of NP attachment by a factor of more than 3.
    Now suppose that the corpus contains the following two trees (A2) and (B2) of Figure 5, which are the Chomsky adjunction representations of NP attached and VP attached PP's, respectively, with relative frequencies f and 1 &#8212; f as before.
    Note that unlike the Penn II representations, the Chomsky adjunction representation represents NP and VP modification by PPs symmetrically.
    The training corpus rf2.
    This two-free corpus, which uses Chomsky adjunction tree representations, consists of the trees (A2) with relative frequency f and the trees (B2) with relative frequency 1 &#8212;f.
    The PCFG 132 is estimated from this corpus.
    The counts C2 and the nonunit production probability estimates 152 for the PCFG induced from this two-tree corpus are as follows: As in the previou
