    While the A* estimates given here can be used to accelerate PCFG parsing, most high-performance parsing has utilized models over lexicalized trees.
    These A* methods can be adapted to the lexicalized case.
    In Klein and Manning (2003), we apply a pair of grammar projection estimates to a lexicalized parsing model of a certain factored form.
    In that model, the score of a lexicalized tree is the product of the scores of two projections of that tree, one onto unlexicalized phrase structure, and one onto phrasalcategory-free word-to-word dependency structure.
    Since this model has a projection-based form, grammar projection methods are easy to apply and especially effective, giving over three orders of magnitude in edge savings.
    The total cost per sentence includes the time required for two exhaustive PCFG parses, after which the A* search takes only seconds, even for very long sentences.
    Even when a lexicalized model is
