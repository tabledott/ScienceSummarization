    Table 4 presents results from TE&#8217;s linearand Maximum Entropy-based Alignment Classifiers on a sample of 1000 alignment pairs selected at random from the 2006 PASCAL Test Set.
    Much recent work on automatic paraphrasing (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) has used relatively simple statistical techniques to identify text passages that contain the same information from parallel corpora.
    Since sentence-level paraphrases are generally assumed to contain information about the same event, these approaches have generally assumed that all of the available paraphrases for a given sentence will include at least one pair of entities which can be used to extract sets of paraphrases from text.
    The TE system uses a similar approach to gather phrase-level alternations for each entailment pair.
    In our system, the two highest-confidence entity alignments returned by the Lexical Alignment module were used to construct a query which was used to retrieve the top 500 documents from Google, as wel
