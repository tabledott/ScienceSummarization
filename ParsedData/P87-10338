 approximation method, with an optional step to perform complete consistency checking when necessary.
    Given two feature-descriptions, the strategy of the unification algorithm is to unify the definite components of the descriptions first, and examine the compatibility of indefinite components later.
    Disjuncts are eliminated from the description when they are inconsistent with definite information.
    This strategy avoids exploring disjuncts more than once when they are inconsistent with definite information.
    The exact algorithm is described in Figure 3.
    It has three major steps.
    In the first step, the definite components of the two descriptions are unified together, producing a DG structure, new-def, which represents the definite information of the result.
    This step can be performed by existing unification algorithms for DGs.
    In the second step, the indefinite components of both descriptions are checked for compatibility with new-def, using the function CHECK-INDEF, which is defin
