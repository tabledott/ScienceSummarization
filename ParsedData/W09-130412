econd classification task consists of classifying the tokens of a sentence as being the first element of the scope, the last, or neither.
    This happens as many times as there are hedge cues in the sentence.
  
  
    The two classification tasks (identifying hedge cues and finding the scope) are implemented using supervised machine learning methods trained on part of the annotated corpus.
    In this phase, a classifier predicts for all tokens in a sentence whether a token is the first token of a hedge cue (B-cue), inside a hedge cue (I-cue), or outside of it (O-cue).
    For sentence (3) the system assigns the B-cue class to indicate, the I-cue class to that and the O-cue class to the rest of tokens.
    (3) These results indicate that a component or components of NF&#8211;AT have the potential to reconstitute NF(P) The instances represent all tokens in the corpus and they have features about the token: lemma, word, part-of-speech (POS) and IOB3 chunk tag; and features about the token context: Word, POS a
