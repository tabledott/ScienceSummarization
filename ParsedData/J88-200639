ential focus, just as I claim a perfect-tensed clause does, comes from the reasoning required to understand the following parallel example, where I would claim TF does not move.
    I was talking with Mary yesterday.
    She told me about her trip to Alaska.
    She had spent five weeks above the Arctic Circle with two friends.
    The three of them had climbed Mt.
    McKinley.
    She said that next year they would go for Aconcagua.
    The event described in Clause 20c is the same as that described in Clause 19c, and should be interpreted anaphorically with respect to the entity her trip to Alaska in the same way.
    If this is the case, however, then the anaphoric link does not follow from the movement of TF.
    Example 20 above illustrates one case of an anaphoric function on an NP and a tensed clause, specifically B(Cb,E&#8222;,RTb) where the entity Ea has been evoked by an NP rather than a clause.
    Another possibility is that a(NPb,Ea) = Eb, where NPb is definite by virtue of an entity evoked by a
