    The sense of w in the test example is the sense of w in this closest matching training example.
    If there is a tie among several training examples with the same minimum distance to the test example, LEXAS randomly selects one of these training examples as the closet matching training example in order to break the tie.
  
  
    To evaluate the performance of LEXAS, we conducted two tests, one on a common data set used in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), and another on a larger data set that we separately collected.
    To our knowledge, very few of the existing work on WSD has been tested and compared on a common data set.
    This is in contrast to established practice in the machine learning community.
    This is partly because there are not many common data sets publicly available for testing WSD programs.
    One exception is the sense-tagged data set used in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), which has been made available in the public domain by Bruce and Wiebe.
    This data set consists of 2369 sentences eac
