where all five phrasal translations presented to the annotator were identical, and report both numbers. which had a K &lt; .25 in last year&#8217;s evaluation).
    We used the web interface to collect timing information.
    The server recorded the time when a set of sentences was given to a judge and the time when the judge returned the sentences.
    It took annotators an average of 18 seconds per sentence to rank a list of sentences.8 It took an average of 10 seconds per sentence for them to rank constituents, and an average of 8.5 seconds per sentence for them to make yes/no judgments.
    Figure 3 shows the distribution of times for these tasks.
    These timing figures indicate that the tasks which the annotators were the most reliable on (yes/no judgments and constituent ranking) were also much quicker to complete than the ones they were less reliable on (ranking sentences).
    Given that they are faster at judging short phrases, they can do proportionally more of them.
    For instance, we could col
