    We have evaluated our method using publically available resources, both for balanced and domain specific text.
    Magnini and Cavagli`a (2000) have identified WordNet word senses with particular domains, and this has proven useful for high precision WSD (Magnini et al., 2001); indeed in section 5 we used these domain labels for evaluation.
    Identification of these domain labels for word senses was semiautomatic and required a considerable amount of hand-labelling.
    Our approach is complementary to this.
    It only requires raw text from the given domain and because of this it can easily be applied to a new domain, or sense inventory, given sufficient text.
    Lapata and Brew (2004) have recently also highlighted the importance of a good prior in WSD.
    They used syntactic evidence to find a prior distribution for verb classes, based on (Levin, 1993), and incorporate this in a WSD system.
    Lapata and Brew obtain their priors for verb classes directly from subcategoris
