    Again, following K&amp;M, contrast this with the probabilities assigned when the compressed tree is identical to the original (Figure 5).
    Expressed like this it is somewhat daunting, but notice that if all we want is to see which probability is higher (the compressed being the same as the original or truly compressed) then most of these terms cancel, and we get the rule, prefer the truly compressed if and only if the following ratio is greater than one.
    In the numerator are the unmatched probabilities that go into the compressed sentence noisy channel probability, and in the denominator are those for when the sentence does not undergo any change.
    We can make this even simpler by noting that because tree-bank pre-terminals can only expand into words p(jj &#8594; large  |jj &#8594; large) = 1.
    Thus the last fraction in Equation 7 is equal to one and can be ignored.
    For a compression to occur, it needs to be less desirable to add an adjective in the cha
