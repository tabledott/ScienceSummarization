 3 The method of retaining only the boundaries and reclassifying the entities was shown to improve the performance of 11 of the 12 systems participating in the CoNLL-2002 shared tasks, in both languages (Florian, 2002b). are obtained by using features exclusively extracted from the training data.
    In general, given n classifiers, one can interpret the classifier combination framework as combining probability distributions: where Ci is the classifier i&#8217;s classification output, f is a combination function.
    A widely used combination scheme is through linear interpolation of the classifiers&#8217; class probability distribution The weights Ai (w) encode the importance given to classifier i in combination, for the context of word w, and Pi (C|w, Ci) is an estimation of the probability that the correct classification is C, given that the output of the classifier i on word w is Ci.
    To estimate the parameters in Equation (2), the provided training data was split into 5 equal parts, and each classifie
