ar easier to classify.
    Thus, it appears that prosodic configurations that are distinguished solely by differences in pitch accent, rather than upon differences in phrasing and position within a phrase, may be less useful indicators of the discourse/sentential distinction.
    Furthermore, we found that orthographic cues (from transcription) successfully disambiguate between discourse and sentential usage in 675 cases (80.1% of the 843).
    Part of speech was less successful in distinguishing discourse from sentential use, disambiguating only 561 cases in the study (63.9% of 878).
    Using both orthography and part of speech for predicting the discourse/sentential distinction in our corpus was nearly equivalent to using orthography alone, predicting 677 (80.3% of 843) cases correctly.
    The relationship between the orthography of transcription and the orthography of written text will be an important determinant of whether orthography alone can be used for prediction in text-to-speech applications; if t
