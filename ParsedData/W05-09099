;quot;computer&amp;quot;)* The &amp;quot;WN synonymy&amp;quot; module maps two unigrams if they are synonyms of each other* In the second phase of each stage, the largest subset of these unigram mappings is selected such that the resulting set constitutes an alignment as defined above (that is, each unigram must map to at most one unigram in the other string)* If more than one subset constitutes an alignment, and also has the same cardinality as the largest set, METEOR selects that set that has the least number of unigram mapping crosses* Intuitively, if the two strings are typed out on two rows one above the other, and lines are drawn connecting unigrams that are mapped to each other, each line crossing is counted as a &amp;quot;unigram mapping cross&amp;quot;* Formally, two unigram mappings (ti, rj) and (tk, rl) (where ti and tk are unigrams in the system translation mapped to unigrams rj and rl in the reference translation respectively) are said to cross if and only if the following formula evaluates to a
