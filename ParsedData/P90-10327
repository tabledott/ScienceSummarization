 significant word pairs are retained.
    In [Smadja 89a], and [Smadja 88], we detail an earlier version of Xtract and its output, and in [Smadja 89b] we compare our results both qualitatively and quantitatively to the lexicon used in [Kukich 83].
    Xtract has also been used for information retrieval in [Maarek &amp; Smadja 89].
    In the updated version of Xtract we describe here, statistical significance is based on four parameters, instead of just one, and a second stage of processing has been added that looks for combinations of word pairs produced in the first stage, resulting in multiple word collocations.
    Stage one: In the first phase, Xconcord is called for a single open class word and its output is pipelined to Xstat which then analyzes the distribution of words in this sample.
    The output of this first stage is a list of tuples (w1, w2, distance, strength, spread, height, type), where (w1, w2) is a lexical relation between two open-class words (w1 and tu2).
