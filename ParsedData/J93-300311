antecedents can be ruled out on structural grounds.
    Without such discourse segmentation, the incorrect potential antecedents might have been preferred, given their surface proximity and number agreement with the pronoun in question.
    Note that without cue phrases as explicit indicators of this topic structure, one would have to infer the relationships among discourse segments by appeal to a more detailed analysis of the semantic content of the passage.
    For example, in task-oriented dialogs, plan-based knowledge could be used to assist in the recognition of discourse structure (Grosz 1977).
    However, such analysis is often beyond the capabilities of current natural language processing systems.
    Many domains are also not task-oriented.
    Additionally, cue phrases are widely used in the identification of rhetorical relations among portions of a text or discourse (Hobbs 1979; Mann and Thompson 1983; Reichman 1985), and have been claimed in general to reduce the complexity of discourse processin
