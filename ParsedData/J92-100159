though the system favors the 'communication' sense of reach in the VP, for the final result, it must balance this information with that provided by the relationship between agreement and the verb phrase.
    By the end of the parse, the 'event-change' sense comes to take precedence: Role-related preferences of reach4 for the preposition by.
    The main cause of this weakness is that (in our system) the role that agreement would fill, DESTINATION, has no special preference for being associated with a c-de st-event &#8212; many events allow a DESTINATION role.
    By summing the cue strengths of each possible interpretation in this way and selecting the one with the highest total score, the system decides which sense is the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; one for the context.
    The strengths of individual components of each interpretation contribute to, but do not determine, the strength of the final interpretation, because there are also strengths associated with how well the individual components fit together.
