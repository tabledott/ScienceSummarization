    C99 and C99b are the algorithms described in (Choi, 2000a).
    C99b,, is the same as C99b except ranking has been disabled.
    The 11% difference between the two shows ranking is crucial to the cosine metric.
    U00 and U00b are the word frequency methods proposed in (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001).
    CWM is the new method described in this paper.
    All versions of the algorithm use a LSA space that was trained on paragraphs.
    CWM1 is identical to C99b except the stemming algorithm has been disabled and it uses A500 to measure similarity.
    The results show it is more accurate than previous methods.
    CWM2 is the same algorithm but ranking has been disabled.
    The 5% difference between this and CWM1 implies ranking does improve accuracy.
    Finally, CWM3 is a variant of CWM2 which uses A100 to measure similarity.
    The 11% difference between this and C99b,_, shows LSA is more accurate than the cosine metric.
    The significance of our results has been confirmed by both t-test and KS-test
