    This description corresponds to one of the simplest ones, &amp;quot;Model 2&amp;quot;; search costs for the more complex models are correspondingly higher. also be used with the new model described below, but the issue is independent of our focus here.
    In this paper we address the underlying assumptions of core channel model itself which does not directly use linguistic structure.
    A slightly different model is employed for a word alignment application by Dagan et al. (Dagan, Church, and Gale, 1993).
    Instead of alignment probabilities, offset probabilities o(k) are employed, where k is essentially the positional distance between the English words aligned to two adjacent Chinese words: wherepr e v is the position of the immediately preceding Chinese word and N is a constant that normalizes for average sentence lengths in different languages.
    The motivation is that words that are close to each other in the Chinese sentence should tend to be close in the English sentenc
