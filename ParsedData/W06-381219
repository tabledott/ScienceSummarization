word-class-ambiguous word &#8220;drink&#8221; (to drink the drink) is responsible for all intra-cluster edges.
    The hypothesis here is that words sharing many neighbors should usually be observed with the same part-of-speech and get high weights in the second order graph.
    In figure 9, three clusters are obtained that correspond to different parts-of-speech (POS).
    To test this on a large scale, we computed the second-order similarity graph for the British National Corpus (BNC), excluding the most frequent 2000 words and drawing edges between words if they shared at least four left and right neighbors.
    The clusters are checked against a lexicon that contains the most frequent tag for each word in the BNC.
    The largest clusters are presented in table 2 .
    In total, CW produced 282 clusters, of which 26 exceed a size of 100.
    The weighted average of cluster purity (i.e. the number of predominant tags divided by cluster size) was measured at 88.8%, which exceeds significantly the precision
