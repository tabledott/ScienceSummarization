purposes.
    First, parsing algorithms such as the above can be modified for use by grammar formalisms other than PATR-II.
    In particular. defin ite-c lause grammars are amenable to this technique, and it can be used to extend the Earley deduction of Pereira and Warren [I LI.
    Pereira has used a similar technique to improve the efficiency of the RUP (bottomup left-corner) parser 171 for DCG.
    I,FC and (PSG parsers can make rise of the top-down filtering device as Well.
    El'C parsers might be built that do not require a context-free backbone.
    Second, restriction ran be used to enhane4. it her parsing algorithms.
    For example. the ancillary rimrt ion to compfite 1.1t closure-- which, like the Earley algorithm. either does not use feature information, or fails to terminate&#8212;can be modified in the same way as the Earley predictor step to terminate while still using significant feature information.
    EA parsing techniques can thereby 1)0 used for efficient parsing if complex-feature-base
