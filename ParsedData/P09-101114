e word choice model pw(w I t, v) specifies a distribution over words given the field type t and field value v. This distribution is a mixture of a global backoff distribution over words and a field-specific distribution which depends on the field type t. Although we designed our word choice model to be relatively general, it is undoubtedly influenced by the three domains.
    However, we can readily extend or replace it with an alternative if desired; this modularity is one principal benefit of probabilistic modeling.
    Integer Fields (t = INT) For integer fields, we want to capture the intuition that a numeric quantity v is rendered in the text as a word which is possibly some other numerical value w due to stylistic factors.
    Sometimes the exact value v is used (e.g., in reporting football statistics).
    Other times, it might be customary to round v (e.g., wind speeds are typically rounded to a multiple of 5).
    In other cases, there might just be some unexplained error, where w deviates from v by
