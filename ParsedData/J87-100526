ly is called with (6) as form and (7) as term, the result of scoping the restriction of (7) will be the following four wffs: Because this call to pull has complete? equal to false, the unprocessed restriction itself, wff (9), as well as the partially scoped wff (10), is returned along with the fully scoped forms of the restriction.
    Wff (9) will ultimately generate the two readings in which variables d and c outscope r. Wff (10) is also partial as it still contains a complex term.
    It will ultimately yield a reading in which r outscopes d but is outscoped by c; the complex term for c is still available for an application that will give it wide Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 1-2, January-June 1987 53 Jerry R. Hobbs and Stuart M. Shieber An Algorithm for Generating Quantifier Scopings scope.
    Wffs (11) and (12) will ultimately yield readings in which d and c are outscoped by r. Each of these wffs becomes the restriction in a quantified wff constructed by apply.
    Thus, from restriction
