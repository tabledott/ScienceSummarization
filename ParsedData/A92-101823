ady conveniently factored so that the dependence on bj(St+i ) is outside the inner sum.
    Hence, if k is the average number of non-zero entries in each row of B, the cost of computing equation 1 can be reduced to 0(kTN).
    Equations 2-4 can be similarly reduced by switching the order of iteration.
    For example, in equation 2, rather than for a given t computing ot(i) for each i one at a time, one can accumulate terms for all i in parallel.
    The net effect of this rewriting is to place a b3(St+i) = 0 check outside the innermost iteration.
    Equations 3 and 4 submit to a similar approach.
    Equation 5 is already only 0(N).
    Hence, the overall cost of training can be reduced to 0(kTN), which, in our experience, amounts to an order of magnitude speedup.
    4 The time complexity of the Viterbi algorithm can also be reduced to 0(kTN) by noting that b3 (S) can be factored out of the maximization of equation 6.
    Adding up the sizes of the probability matrices A, B, and H, it is easy to see that t
