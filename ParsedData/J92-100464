ning representation from the sentence.
    The grammar is not a semantic grammar in the usual sense, because it does include high level nodes of a syntactic nature, such as noun-clause, subject, predicate, etc.
    A second important feature is that unifications are performed in a one-dimensional framework.
    That is to say, features delivered to a node by a close relative (sibling/parent/ child) are unified with particular feature values associated with that node.
    The x variable in an x-y relationship is not explicitly mentioned, but rather is assigned to be &amp;quot;whatever was delivered by the relative.&amp;quot; Thus, for example, a node such as [subject] unifies in exactly the same way, regardless of the rule under construction.
    Another important feature of TINA is that the same grammar can be run in generation mode, making up random sentences by tossing the dice.
    This has been found to be extremely useful for revealing overgeneralization problems in the grammar, as well as for automatica
