are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between positive and negative contextual polarity.
    The evaluation includes assessing the performance of features across multiple machine learning algorithms.
    For all learning algorithms except one, the combination of all features together gives the best performance.
    Another facet of the evaluation considers how the presence of neutral instances affects the performance offeatures for distinguishing between positive and negative polarity.
    These experiments show that the presence of neutral instances greatly degrades the performance of these features, and that perhaps the best way to improve performance across all polarity classes is to improve the system&#8217;s ability to identify when an instance is neutral.
  
  
    Many approaches to automatic sentiment analysis begin with a large lexicon of words marked with their prior polarity (also called semantic orientation).
    However, the contextual polarity of the phrase in which a particular
