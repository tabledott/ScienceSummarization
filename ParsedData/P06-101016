    (2) The answer is there, but our candidate generation method has missed it.
    In order to see more clearly how accurate each method is for ranking the candidates, we also compute the MRR for the subset of English names whose transliteration answers are in our candidate list.
    We distinguish the MRRs computed on these two sets of English names as &#8220;AllMRR&#8221; and &#8220;CoreMRR&#8221;.
    Below we first discuss the results of each of the two methods.
    We then compare the two methods and discuss results from combining the two methods.
    We show sample results for the phonetic scoring method in Table 1.
    This table shows the 10 highest scoring transliterations for each Chinese character sequence based on all texts in the Chinese and English Xinhua newswire for the 13th of August, 2001.
    8 out of these 10 are correct.
    For all the English names the MRR is 0.3, and for the hua corpus for 8/13/01.
    The final column is the &#8722;log P estimate for the transliteration.
