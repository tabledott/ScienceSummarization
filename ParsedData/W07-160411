re-ran the test allowing the classifier to skip any preposition if its top ranked and second ranked choices differed by less than a specified amount.
    In other words, we permitted it to respond only when it was confident of its decision.
    When the difference between the first and second ranked choices was 0.60 or greater, 50% of the cases received no decision, but for the remaining half of the test cases, the proportion of agreement was 0.90 and kappa was 0.88.
    This suggests that a considerable improvement in performance can be achieved by using a more conservative approach based on a higher confidence level for the classifier.
  
  
    To evaluate the ME model&#8217;s suitability for analyzing ungrammatical text, 2,000 preposition contexts were extracted from randomly selected essays written on ESL tests by native speakers of Chinese, Japanese, and Russian.
    This set of materials was used to look for problems that were likely to arise as a consequence of the mismatch between the training corpus
