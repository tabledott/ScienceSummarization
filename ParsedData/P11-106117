 the feature value is 0 and has no effect on the model, while its value is &#8722;oc when tx(y) = 0 and constrains the HMM&#8217;s state space.
    This formulation of the constraint feature is equivalent to the use of a tagging dictionary extracted from the graph using a threshold T on the posterior distribution of tags for a given word type (Eq.
    7).
    It would have therefore also been possible to use the integer programming (IP) based approach of Ravi and Knight (2009) instead of the feature-HMM for POS induction on the foreign side.
    However, we do not explore this possibility in the current work.
  
  
    Before presenting our results, we describe the datasets that we used, as well as two baselines.
    We utilized two kinds of datasets in our experiments: (i) monolingual treebanks9 and (ii) large amounts of parallel text with English on one side.
    The availability of these resources guided our selection of foreign languages.
    For monolingual treebank data we relied on the CoNLL-X and CoNL
