t the correct parse.
    A similar architecture may be applied to noun compounds.
    In the experiments below the accuracy of such a system is measured.
    Comparisons are made across five dimensions: While Hindle and Rooth (1993) use a partial parser to acquire training data, such machinery appears unnecessary for noun compounds.
    Brent (1993) has proposed the use of simple word patterns for the acquisition of verb subcategorisation information.
    An analogous approach to compounds is used in Lauer (1994) and constitutes one scheme evaluated below.
    While such patterns produce false training examples, the resulting noise often only introduces minor distortions.
    A more I.beral alternative is the use of a cooccurrence window.
    Yarowsky (1992) uses a fixed 100 word window to collect information used for sense disambiguation.
    Similarly, Smadja (1993) uses a six content word window to extract significant collocations.
    A range of windowed training schemes are employed below.
