e randomly selected and set aside to serve as the test set.
    The distribution of sense tags in the data set is presented in Table 1.
    We now turn to the selection of individually informative contextual features.
    In our approach to disambiguation, a contextual feature is judged to be informative (i.e., correlated with the sense tag of the ambiguous word) if the model for independence between that feature and the sense tag is judged to have an extremely poor fit using the test described in Section 2.
    The worse the fit, the more informative the feature is judged to be (similar to the approach suggested in [9]).
    Only features whose values can be automatically determined were considered, and preference was given to features that intuitively are not specific to interest (but see the discussion of collocational features below).
    An additional criterion was that the features not have too many possible values, in order to curtail sparsity in the resulting data matrix.
    We considered three diffe
