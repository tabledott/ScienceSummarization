r some time, as far as we know this is the first time a probabilistic model of speech repairs based on a model of syntactic structure has been described in the literature.
    Probabilistic models have the advantage over other kinds of models that they can in principle be integrated with other probabilistic models to produce a combined model that uses all available evidence to select the globally optimal analysis.
    Shriberg and Stolcke (1998) studied the location and distribution of repairs in the Switchboard corpus, but did not propose an actual model of repairs.
    Heeman and Allen (1999) describe a noisy channel model of speech repairs, but leave &#8220;extending the model to incorporate higher level syntactic ... processing&#8221; to future work.
    The previous work most closely related to the current work is Charniak and Johnson (2001), who used a boosted decision stub classifier to classify words as edited or not on a word by word basis, but do not identify or assign a probability to a repair as a
