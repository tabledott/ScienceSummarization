f the characteristics of the depth scores for a given document, using the average and standard deviation a of their scores (thus assuming that the scores are normally distributed).
    One version of this function entails drawing a boundary only if the depth score exceeds .g &#8212; a (the liberal measure, LC).
    This function can be varied to achieve correspondingly varying precision/recall trade-offs.
    A higher precision but lower recall can be found by setting the limit to be depth scores exceeding &#8212; a/2 (the conservative measure, HC) instead of &#8212; a.
  
  
    There are several ways to evaluate a segmentation algorithm, including comparing its segmentation against that of human judges, comparing its segmentation against author-specified orthographic information, and comparing its segmentation against other automated segmentation strategies in terms of how they effect the outcome of some computational task.
    This section presents comparisons of the results of the algorithm against human
