t.
    Storage and time requirements were computed as well.
    Where possible, we used a 10-fold cross-validation approach.
    In this experimental method, a data set is partitioned ten times into 90% training material, and 10% testing material.
    Average accuracy provides a reliable estimate of the generalization accuracy.
    Our goal is to adhere to the concept of memory-based learning with full memory while at the same time keeping memory and processing speed within attractive bounds.
    To this end, we applied the IGTree formalism to the task.
    In order to prove that IGTree is a suitable candidate for practical memory-based tagging, we compared three memory-based learning algorithms: (i) IB1, a slight extension (to cope with symbolic values and ambiguous training items) of the well-known k-nn algorithm in statistical pattern recognition (see Aha et al., 1991), (ii) IB1-IG, an extension of IB1 which uses feature relevance weighting (described in Section 2), and (iii) IGTree, a memory- and processi
