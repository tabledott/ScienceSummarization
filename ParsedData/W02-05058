    One serious limitation of the phonetic-based model described above is that only English words with known pronunciations can be produced.
    For backtransliterating person names of English origin, this is not a big problem because many of such names are typically found in the dictionary.
    However, applying this technique to transliterate names of origins other than English is not going to work, because many such names are not likely to be in the dictionary despite the fact that the dictionary has more than 100,100 entries in it, as shown in Table 2.
    Moreover, if we want to apply this technique to transliterate a name into a language other than English, a large pronunciation dictionary is needed for that language, which is not easily obtainable.
    Also, human translators often transliterate words based on how they are spelled in the source language.
    For example, Graham is typically transliterated by humans into Arabic as &amp;quot;r .Orciham&amp;quot; an
