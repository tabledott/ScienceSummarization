mate the needed expectations.
    The fact that attribute-value grammars generate constrained languages makes Gibbs sampling inapplicable, but I show that sampling can be done using the more general Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
  
  
    Stochastic versions of regular grammars and context-free grammars have received a great deal of attention in computational linguistics for the last several years, and basic techniques of stochastic parsing and parameter estimation have been known for decades.
    However, regular and context-free grammars are widely deemed linguistically inadequate; standard grammars in computational linguistics are attribute-value (AV) grammars of some variety.
    Before the advent of statistical methods, regular and context-free grammars were considered too inexpressive for serious consideration, and even now the reliance on stochastic versions of the less-expressive grammars is often seen as an expedient necessitated by the lack of an adequate stochastic version of attribute-value gramm
