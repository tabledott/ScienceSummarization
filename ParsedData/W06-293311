ic difference in accuracy between noun pre-modifiers (AT) (F &gt; 97%) and noun post-modifiers (ET) (F Pz&#65533; 75%).
    Finally, it is worth noting that coordination, which is often problematic in parsing, has high accuracy.
    The Swedish treebank annotation treats the second conjunct as a dependent of the first conjunct and as the head of the coordinator, which seems to facilitate parsing.6 The attachment of the second conjunct to the first (CC) has a labeled F-score above 80%, while the attachment of the coordinator to the second conjunct (++) has a score well above 90%.
    In Turkish, very essential syntactic information is contained in the rich morphological structure, where concatenated suffixes carry information that in other languages may be expressed by separate words.
    The Turkish treebank therefore divides word forms into smaller units, called inflectional groups (IGs), and the task of the parser is to construct dependencies between IGs, not (primarily) between word forms (Eryi&#728;git an
