c category in the argument list.
    Motivated by Collins&#8217; syntactic parsing models (Collins, 2003), we consider the generation process for a hybrid sequence from an MR production as a Markov process.
    Given the assumption that each MR production has at most two semantic categories in its arguments (any production can be transformed into a sequence of productions of this form), Table 1 includes the list of all possible hybrid patterns.
    In this table, m is an MR production, Y and Z are respectively the first and second child semantic category in m&#8217;s argument list.
    The symbol w refers to a contiguous sequence of NL words, and anything inside [] can be optionally omitted.
    The last row contains hybrid patterns that reflect reordering of one production&#8217;s child semantic categories during the generation process.
    For example, consider the case that the MR production STATE : exclude (STATE1 STATE2) generates a hybrid sequence STATE1 do not STATE2, the hybrid pattern m &#8594; YwZ i
