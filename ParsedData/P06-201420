    We still evaluate all methods with the original alignment gold standard.
  
  
    We conduct two experiments.
    The first tests the dependency-augmented ITG described in Section 3.2 as an aligner with hard cohesion constraints.
    The second tests our discriminative ITG with soft cohesion constraints against two strong baselines.
    We conduct our experiments using French-English Hansard data.
    Our 02 scores, link probabilities and word frequency counts are determined using a sentence-aligned bitext consisting of 50K sentence pairs.
    Our training set for the discriminative aligners is the first 100 sentence pairs from the FrenchEnglish gold standard provided for the 2003 WPT workshop (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).
    For evaluation we compare to the remaining 347 gold standard pairs using the alignment evaluation metrics: precision, recall and alignment error rate or AER (Och and Ney, 2003).
    SVM learning parameters are tuned using the 37-pair development set provided with this data.
