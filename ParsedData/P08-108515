p(t|w) we use either a uniform distribution based on the tags allowed in the dictionary, or the estimate obtained by using the modified Levinger et al. algorithm.
    We use contexts of the form LR=w_1, w+1 (the neighbouring words).
    We estimate p(w|c) and p(c|w) via relative frequency over all the events w1, w2, w3 occurring at least 10 times in the corpus. allow(t, w) follows the dictionary.
    Because of the wide coverage of the Hebrew lexicon, we take RELc to be C (all available contexts).
    We run a series of experiments with 8 distinct initial conditions, as shown in Table 1: our baseline (Uniform) is the uniform distribution over all tags provided by the KC analyzer for each word.
    The Syntagmatic initial conditions add the p(t|t_1, t+1) constraints described above to the uniform baseline.
    The Morphology-Based and Linear-Context initial conditions are computed as described above, while the Morph+Linear is the result of applying the linear-context algorithm over initial values computed by t
