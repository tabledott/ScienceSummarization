compared to the single-best segmentation approach.
    All results using our word-lattice decoding for the hierarchical models (hs+ss and hs+ss+cs) are significantly better than the best segmentation (ss).4 For the phrase-based model, we obtain significant gains using our word-lattice decoder using all three segmentations on MT05.
    The other results, while better than the best segmentation (hs) by at least 0.3 BLEU points, are not statistically significant.
    Even if the results are not statistically significant for MT06, there is a high decrease in OOV items when using word-lattices.
    For example, for MT06 the number of OOVs in the hs translation is 484.
    The number of OOVs decreased by 19% for hs+ss and by 75% for hs+ss+cs.
    As mentioned in Section 3, using lexical reordering for word-lattices further improves the translation quality.
    We created lattices from an unsegmented version of the Arabic test data and generated alternative arcs where clitics as well as the definiteness marker and t
