 as part of the selection procedure for identifying the antecedents of pronouns in a discourse.
    The algorithm strongly prefers intersentential antecedents that preserve the center or maximize continuity in center change, to intrasentential antecedents that cause radical center shifts.
    This strong preference for intersentential antecedents is inappropriate for at least some text domains&#8212;in our corpus of computer manual texts, for example, we estimate that less than 20% of referentially used third person pronouns have intersentential antecedents.'
    There is a second difficulty with the Brennan et al. centering algorithm.
    It uses a hierarchy of grammatical roles quite similar to that of RAP, but this role hierarchy does not directly influence antecedent selection.
    Whereas the hierarchy in RAP contributes to a multi-dimensional measure of the relative salience of all antecedent candidates, in Brennan et al. 1987, it is used only to constrain the choice of the backward-looking center, Cb,
