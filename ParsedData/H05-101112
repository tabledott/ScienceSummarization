conditional proba bility of linking not to ne...pas by considering the number of sentence pairs in which not occurs in the English sentence and both ne and pas occur in the French sentence, compared to the number of timesnot is linked to both ne and pas in pairs of corre sponding sentences.
			However, when we make this estimate in the CLP-based model, we do not count a link between not and ne...pas if the same instance of not, ne, or pas is linked to any other words.The CLP-based model incorporates the same ad dtional features as the LLR-based model, except that it omits the one-to-many feature, since we assumethat the one-to-one vs. one-to-many trade-off is al ready modeled in the conditional link probabilities for particular one-to-one and one-to-many clusters.We have developed two versions of the CLP based model, using two different estimates for the conditional link probabilities.
			One estimate of theconditional link probabilities comes from the LLRbased model described above, optimized on an an notate
