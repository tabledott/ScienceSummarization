3, on the node 0 belonging to some elemen- tary tree, say a.4 ? If r)!
			is tim foot node of an auxiliary tree fl that has been adjoined, then the derivation of the node below q\] must resume.
			In this case, include: b\["0l\] ,~1 b\[..\] (7) The above stochastic production is included with probabil ity one since the decision of adjunction has already been made in rules of the form (6).
			Finally, if r h is the root node of an initial tree that can be substituted on a node marked for substitution r), include: t\[$~\] L t\[S~t\] (g) Here, p is the probability that the initial tree rooted by ~/~ is substituted at node q. It corresponds to the probability of substituting the lexicalized initial tree whose root node is 71, say 6, at the node q of a lexicalized elementary tree, say a. 5 The SLIG constructed as above is well defined if the following equalities hold for all nodes ~l: P(t\[..~/\] ---* b\[..~/\]) + E P(t\[..~/\] --* t\[..q0~\] ) = 1 (9) P(t\[$~/\] ---* t\[$Ol\]) ---- 1 (10) E P(t\[$\] -~ t\[$O0\])
