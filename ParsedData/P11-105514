    Our goal is to select a subset of the edges which maximizes the sum of their weights, subject to each node vSi E VS being incident to exactly one edge, and each node vr E Vy being incident to at least one edge. y Exact Solution An exact solution can be obtained by first computing the maximum weighted bipartite matching, and adding edges to nodes which are not incident to an edge.
    This can be computed in time O(|V|(|&#163; |+ |V |log |V|)), which we can rewrite as O((|R |+ |S|)(|R||S |+ (|R |+ |S|) log(|R |+ |S|))).
    Approximate Solution An approximate solution can be obtained by iterating over the nodes in Vy, and each time adding the highest weight incident edge whose addition doesn&#8217;t violate a constraint.
    The running time is O(|R||S|).
    This greedy search guarantees each fact is extracted at least once and allows any additional extractions that increase the overall probability of the assignment.
    Given the computational advantage, we
