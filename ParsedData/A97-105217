    Nevertheless, this experiment demonstrates that lexicalizing a grammar/parser with subcategorization frequencies can appreciably improve the accuracy of parse ranking.
    4 Related Work Brent's (1993) approach to acquiring subcategorization is based on a philosophy of only exploiting unambiguous and determinate information in unanalysed corpora.
    He defines a number of lexical patterns (mostly involving closed class items, such as pronouns) which reliably cue one of five subcategorization classes.
    Brent does not report comprehensive results, but for one class, sentential complement verbs, he achieves 96% precision and 76% recall at classifying individual tokens of 63 distinct verbs as exemplars or non-exemplars of this class.
    He does not attempt to rank different classes for a given verb. al. utilise a PoS tagged corpus and finite-state NP parser to recognize and calculate the relative frequency of six subcategorization classes.
    They report an accuracy rate of 83% (254 errors) at cl
