er, particularly when the target domain is distant from the background data.
    For developers of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems, an additional complication is the heterogeneous nature of SMT components (word-alignment model, language model, translation model, etc.
    ), which precludes a single universal approach to adaptation.
    In this paper we study the problem of using a parallel corpus from a background domain (OUT) to improve performance on a target domain (IN) for which a smaller amount of parallel training material&#8212;though adequate for reasonable performance&#8212;is also available.
    This is a standard adaptation problem for SMT.
    It is difficult when IN and OUT are dissimilar, as they are in the cases we study.
    For simplicity, we assume that OUT is homogeneous.
    The techniques we develop can be extended in a relatively straightforward manner to the more general case when OUT consists of multiple sub-domains.
    There is a fairly large body of work on SMT adaptat
