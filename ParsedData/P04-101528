n to score the remaining 10 percent that was not seen in that training set.
    For the held-out and testing conditions, we used the generative model trained on all of sections 2-21.
    In table 4 we present the results of including the generative model score along with the other perceptron features, just for the run with POS-tagger tags.
    The generative model score (negative log probability) effectively provides a much better initial starting point for the perceptron algorithm.
    The resulting F-measure on section 23 is 2.1 percent higher than either the generative model or perceptron-trained model used in isolation.
  
  
    In this paper we have presented a discriminative training approach, based on the perceptron algorithm with a couple of effective refinements, that provides a model capable of effective heuristic search over a very difficult search space.
    In such an approach, the unnormalized discriminative parsing model can be applied without either cluding labeled precision (LP), labeled rec
