    This would lead us to break up Aktionsplan, but not Freitag.
    See Figure 2 for illustration of this method.
    This approach requires a translation lexicon.
    The easiest way to obtain a translation lexicon is to learn it from a parallel corpus.
    This can be done with the toolkit Giza [Al-Onaizan et al., 1999], which establishes word-alignments for the sentences in the two languages.
    With this translation lexicon we can perform the method alluded to above: For each German word, we consider all splitting options.
    For each splitting option, we check if it has translations on the English side.
    To deal with noise in the translation table, we demand that the translation probability of the English word given the German word be at least 0.01.
    We also allow each English word to be considered only once: If it is taken as evidence for correspondence to the first part of the compound, it is excluded as evidence for the other parts.
    If multiple options match the English, we select the on
