ot; is treated as a transitive verb by the parser.
    As a result, the extracted non-compositional phrases do not usually overlap with phrasal entries in the WordNet.
    Therefore, we conducted the evaluation by manually examining sample results.
    This method was also used to evaluate automatically identified hyponyms (Hearst, 1998), word similarity (Richardson, 1997), and translations of collocations (Smadja et al., 1996).
    Our evaluation sample consists of 5 most frequent open class words in the our parsed corpus: {have, company, make, do, take} and 5 words whose frequencies are ranked from 2000 to 2004: {path, lock, resort, column, gulf}.
    We examined three types of dependency relationships: object-verb, noun-noun, and adjective-noun.
    A total of 216 collocations were extracted, shown in Appendix A.
    We compared the collocations in Appendix A with the entries for the above 10 words in the NTC's English Idioms Dictionary (henceforth NTC-EID) (Spears and Kirkpatrick, 1993), which contains ap
