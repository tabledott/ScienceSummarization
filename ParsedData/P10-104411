proach as follows: we treat each relation as a document whose contents consist of a bags of words corresponding to all the noun phrases observed as arguments of the relation in our corpus.
    Formally, LDA generates each argument in the corpus of relations as follows: for each topic t = 1... T do Generate Ot according to symmetric Dirichlet distribution Dir(,q). for each relation r = 1... |R |do Generate 0r according to Dirichlet distribution Dir(&#945;). for each tuple i = 1... Nr do Generate zr,i from Multinomial(Or).
    Generate the argument ar,i from multiOne weakness of IndependentLDA is that it doesn&#8217;t jointly model a1 and a2 together.
    Clearly this is undesirable, as information about which topics one of the arguments favors can help inform the topics chosen for the other.
    For example, class pairs such as (team, game), (politician, political issue) form much more plausible selectional preferences than, say, (team, political issue), (politician, game).
    As a more tightly coupled altern
