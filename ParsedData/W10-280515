tor of neighbours for real vectors, a characteristic that could be applied to guess distributional synonyms of unseen A-N pairs.
    On the other hand, the additive model (and to a lesser extent PLSR) is especially successful in attracting gold standard neighbours.
    Overall, even at this experimental stage, PLSR is clearly the model that produces the most consistent results.
  
  
    This paper proposed a novel method to model the compositionality of meaning in distributional models of semantics.
    The method, Partial Least Squares Regression, is well known in other dataintensive fields of research, but to our knowledge had never been put to work in computational distributional semantics.
    Its main advantage is the fact that it is designed to approximate functions in problems of multivariate multiple regression where the number of observations is relatively small if compared to the number of variables (dimensions).
    We built a DSM targeting a type of semantic composition that has not been treated
