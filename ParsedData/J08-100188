el framework for representing and measuring text coherence.
    Central to this framework is the entity-grid representation of discourse, which we argue captures important patterns of sentence transitions.
    We re-conceptualize coherence assessment as a learning task and show that our entity-based representation is well-suited for ranking-based generation and text classification tasks.
    Using the proposed representation, we achieve good performance on text ordering, summary coherence evaluation, and readability assessment.
    The entity grid is a flexible, yet computationally tractable, representation.
    We investigated three important parameters for grid construction: the computation of coreferring entity classes, the inclusion of syntactic knowledge, and the influence of salience.
    All these knowledge sources figure prominently in theories of discourse (see Section 2) and are considered important in determining coherence.
    Our results empirically validate the importance of salience and syntact
