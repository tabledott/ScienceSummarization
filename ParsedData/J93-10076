that of Choueka, Klein, and Neuwitz (1983); however the techniques we use are simpler and only produce relevant data.
    Finally, by combining parsing and statistical techniques the third stage labels and filters collocations retrieved at stage one.
    The third stage has been evaluated to raise the precision of Xtract from 40% to 80% with a recall of 94%.
    Section 2 is an introductory section on collocational knowledge, Section 3 describes the type of collocations that are retrieved by Xtract, and Section 4 briefly surveys related efforts and contrasts our work to them.
    The three stages of Xtract are then introduced in Section 5 and described respectively in Sections 6, 7, and 8.
    Some results obtained by running Xtract on several corpora are listed and discussed in Section 9.
    Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our methods and of our results are discussed in Sections 10 and 11.
    Finally, several possible applications and tasks for Xtract are discussed in Section 12.
