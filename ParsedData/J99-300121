    Rule 2 should reflect the intuition that a pair of utterances that have the same theme is more coherent than another pair of utterances with more than one theme.
    The theory claims, above all, that to the extent that a discourse adheres to these rules and constraints, its local coherence will increase and the inference load placed upon the hearer will decrease.
    The basic unit for which the centering data structures are generated is the utterance U.
    Since Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) and Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) do not give a reasonable definition of utterance, we follow Kameyama's (1998) method for dividing a sentence into several center-updating units (Figure 1).
    Her intrasentential centering mechanisms operate at the clause level.
    While tensed clauses are defined as utterances on their own, untensed clauses are processed with the main clause so that
