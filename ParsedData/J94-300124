suming vacuous &#8364; transitions at every state reduces the number of special cases that have to be considered in some of the arguments below.
    A nondeterministic n-way finite-state transducer (fst) is defined by a quintuple similar to that of an fsm except for the transition function 6, a total function that maps Q x E' x x E to 2.
    Partly to simplify the mathematical presentation and partly because only the binary relations are needed in the analysis of rewriting rules and Koskenniemi's two-level systems, from here on we frame the discussion in terms of binary relations and two-tape transducers.
    However, the obvious extensions of these properties do hold for the general case, and they may be useful in developing a formal understanding of autosegmental phonological and morphological theories (for an illustration, see Kay 1987).
    The transition function 6 of a transducer also extends to a function 6* that carries a state and a pair of strings onto a set of states.
    Transitions in fsts are la
