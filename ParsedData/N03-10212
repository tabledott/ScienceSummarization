, we let be the reflexive transitive closure of dichotomy imposes a convenient normal form, without loss of generality. rendering function is a notational convenience; MTGs can be defined without it.
    When no more productions can be applied, i.e., when all nonterminals have been rewritten into terminals, the rendering functions are evaluated in order.
    The rearranges the nonempty terminals in each row of a link vector according to that row's permutation.
    For example, c [1,3,2,4] =wxyz t Env vut By reordering the terminals independently in each component, the join operator hides information about which terminals were derived from the same link.
    Thus, the translational equivalence represented by links is not observable in MTG yields, just as it is not observable in raw multitext.
    To avoid spurious ambiguity, we stipulate a normal form for components of P: In each permutation, first appearance of role precede the first of role y for all y, except where the arrangement is incompatible with a pre
