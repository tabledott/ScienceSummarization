rain the model parameters &#955;M1 of the log-linear models according to Eq.
    4.
    By applying suitable transformations, the GIS algorithm is able to handle any type of real-valued features.
    In practice, We use YASMET 2 written by Franz J. Och for performing training.
    The renormalization needed in Eq.
    4 requires a sum over a large number of possible alignments.
    If e has length l and f has length m, there are possible 2lm alignments between e and f (Brown et al., 1993).
    It is unrealistic to enumerate all possible alignments when lm is very large.
    Hence, we approximate this sum by sampling the space of all possible alignments by a large set of highly probable alignments.
    The set of considered alignments are also called n-best list of alignments.
    We train model parameters on a development corpus, which consists of hundreds of manually-aligned bilingual sentence pairs.
    Using an n-best approximation may result in the problem that the parameters trained with the GIS algorith
