ls to train a classifier with entire GENIA corpus, since the cost of SVM training is super-linear to the size of training samples.
    Even with a more feasible method, pairwise (Kre&#223;el, 1998), which is employed in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000), we cannot train a classifier in a reasonable time, because we have a large number of samples that belong to the non-entity class in this formulation.
    To solve this problem, we propose to split the non-entity class to several sub-classes, using part-ofspeech information.
    We show that this technique not only enables the training feasible but also improves the accuracy.
    In addition, we explore new features such as word cache and the states of an unsupervised HMM for named entity recognition using SVMs.
    In the experiments, we show the effect of using these features and compare the overall performance of our SVMbased recognition system with a system using the Maximum Entropy method, which is an alternative to the SVM method.
