    Some of the dependencies for sentence (2) from Figure 3 are shown in Table 1.
    The dependencies capture structural as well lexical information.
    They are represented as triples, consisting of a head (leftmost element, e.g., say, name), a modifier (rightmost element, e.g., company, its) and a relation (e.g., subject (V:subj:N), object (V:obj:N), modifier (N:mod:A)).
    For efficiency reasons we focused on triples whose dependency relations (e.g., V:subj:N) were attested in the corpus with frequency larger than one per million.
    We further looked at how individual types of relations contribute to the ordering task.
    More specifically we experimented with dependencies relating to verbs (49 types), nouns (52 types), verbs and nouns (101 types) (see Table 1 for examples).
    We also ran a version of our model with all types of relations, including adjectives, adverbs and
  
  
    In this section we describe our experiments with the model and the features introduced in the previous section
