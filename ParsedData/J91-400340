ies for nouns in linguistics; e.g., artifact, natural kind.
    In Pustejovsky (1989b) and Pustejovsky and Anick (1988), I suggest that there is a system of relations that characterizes the semantics of nominals, very much like the argument structure of a verb.
    I called this the Qualia Structure, inspired by Aristotle's theory of explanation and ideas from Moravcsik (1975).
    Essentially, the qualia structure of a noun determines its meaning as much as the list of arguments determines a verb's meaning.
    The elements that make up a qualia structure include notions such as container, space, surface, figure, artifact, and so on.&amp;quot; As stated earlier, there are four basic roles that constitute the qualia structure for a lexical item.
    Here I will elaborate on what these roles are and why they are useful.
    They are given in Example 38, where each role is defined, along with the possible values that these roles may assume.
    When we combine the qualia structure of a NP with the argument stru
