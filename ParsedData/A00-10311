automatic processing and human correction.
    For both applications, a tagger with the highest possible accuracy is required.
    The debate about which paradigm solves the part-of-speech tagging problem best is not finished.
    Recent comparisons of approaches that can be trained on corpora (van Halteren et al., 1998; Volk and Schneider, 1998) have shown that in most cases statistical aproaches (Cutting et al., 1992; Schmid, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1996) yield better results than finite-state, rule-based, or memory-based taggers (Brill, 1993; Daelemans et al., 1996).
    They are only surpassed by combinations of different systems, forming a &amp;quot;voting tagger&amp;quot;.
    Among the statistical approaches, the Maximum Entropy framework has a very strong position.
    Nevertheless, a recent independent comparison of 7 taggers (Zavrel and Daelemans, 1999) has shown that another approach even works better: Markov models combined with a good smoothing technique and with handling of unknown words.
