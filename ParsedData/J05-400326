e previous section, create two sets of training instances and one set of test instances.
    We train two classifiers (one on each training set) and evaluate both of them on the test set.
    The parallel corpora used for generating training and test instances have around 5k sentence pairs each (approximately 150k English tokens), and generate around 10k training instances (for each training set) and 8k test instances.
    Precision and recall of the Chinese-English classifiers.
    Figures 5 and 6 show the recall and precision of our classifiers, for both ArabicEnglish and Chinese-English.
    The results show that the precision of our classification process is robust with respect to dictionary coverage and training domain.
    Even when starting from a very small initial parallel corpus, we can build a high-precision classifier.
    Having a good dictionary and training data from the right domain does help though, mainly with respect to recall.
    The classifiers achieve high precision because their positi
