he behavior for unconstrained context-free (syntax-directed) transduction grammars).
    Compare this against the second column, which shows the number of complete matchings that can be accepted by an ITG between a pair of length-r sequences of subconstituents.
    The fourth column shows the proportion of matchings that ITGs can accept.
    Flexibility is nearly total for sequences of up to r &lt; 4 subconstituents, with a rapid drop thereafter corresponding to the elimination of undesirably tangled (i.e., noncompositional) matchings.
    Figure 7 shows the same numbers over all possible matchings, both complete and partial; in other words, for the more realistic case where some subconstituents are permitted to remain unmatched as singletons.
    The same desirable behavior is exhibited.
    The expressiveness of ITGs thus appears inherently suited to the degree of flexibility versus constraints needed for constituent matching.
