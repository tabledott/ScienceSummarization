od of applying the Baum-Welch algorithm for unsupervised training of a stochastic tagger, and achieves comparable performance to a class-based BaumWelch training algorithm.
    In addition, we have shown that by combining unsupervised and supervised learning, we can obtain a tagger that significantly outperforms a tagger trained using purely supervised learning.
    We are encouraged by these results, and expect an improvement in performance when the number of transformation templates provided to the unsupervised learner increases beyond the four currently used.
    We have also demonstrated that overtraining, a problem in Baum-Welch training, is not a problem in transformationbased learning.
