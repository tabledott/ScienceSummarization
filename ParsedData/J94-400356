    To resolve such ambiguities, it may be useful to consider also co-occurrences of the ambiguous word with other words in the broader context (e.g., Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1993; Yarkowsky 1992).
    For instance, the word 'minister' seems to co-occur in the same context more frequently with 'position' than with 'job.'
