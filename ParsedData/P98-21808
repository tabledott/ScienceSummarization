h is a path created from subpaths in two different inverted semrel structures.
    For example, car and truck are not related directly by a semantic relation or by a semrel path from any single semrel structure.
    However, if one allows the joining of the semantic relations car&#8212;Hyp--vehicle and vehicle&#8249;-Hyp&#8212;truck, each from a different semrel structure, at the word vehicle, the semrel path car&#8212;Hyp-4vehiclet-Hyp--truck results.
    Adequately constrained, extended semrel paths have proven invaluable in determining the relationship between words in MindNet that would not otherwise be connected.
    Semrel paths are automatically assigned weights that reflect their salience.
    The weights in MindNet are based on the computation of averaged vertex probability, which gives preference to semantic relations occurring with middle frequency, and are described in detail in Richardson (1997).
    Weighting schemes with similar goals are found in work by Braden-Harder (1993) and Bookman (1994)
