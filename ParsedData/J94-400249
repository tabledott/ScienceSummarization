, and Rich and LuperFoy (1988) are examples of this mixed evaluation strategy.
    In general, these systems use composite scoring procedures that assign a global rank to an antecedent candidate on the basis of the scores that it receives from several evaluation metrics.
    Each such metric scores the likelihood of the candidate relative to a distinct informational factor.
    Thus, for example, Rich and LuperFoy (1988) propose a system that computes the global preference value of a candidate from the scores provided by a set of constraint source modules, in which each module invokes different sorts of conditions for ranking the antecedent candidate.
    The set of modules includes (among others) syntactic and morphological filters for checking agreement and syntactic conditions on disjoint reference, a procedure for applying semantic selection restrictions to a verb and its arguments, a component that uses contextual and real-world knowledge, and modules that represent both the local and global focus of dis
