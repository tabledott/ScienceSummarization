    We can extend the definition of a to paths by: a(x) = xoxi &#8226; x-i.
    We denote by 7r e q q' the set of paths from q to q' labeled with the input string w. The definition of S can be extended to Q x E* by: V(q, EQ x E*,(5(q,w) = {q': path 7r in T,7r E q q'} Mohri Transducers in Language and Speech and to 2(2 x E*, by: For (q, w, q') E QxExQ such that there exists a path from q to q' labeled with w, we define 9(q, w, q') as the minimum of the outputs of all paths from q to q' with input w: A successful path in T is a path from an initial state to a final state.
    A string w E E* is accepted by T if there exists a successful path labeled with w: w E S(I,w) n F. The output corresponding to an accepted string w is then obtained by taking the minimum of the outputs of all successful paths with input label w: A transducer T is said to be trim if all states of T belong to a succe
