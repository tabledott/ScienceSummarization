    Let Y(d) be a discrete set of sentiment labels at the document level and Y(s) be a discrete set of sentiment labels at the sentence level.
    As input a system is given a document containing sentences s = s1, ... , sn and must produce sentiment labels for the document, yd E Y(d), and each individual sentence, ys = ys1, ... , ysn, where ysi E Y(s) V 1 G i G n. Define y = (yd, ys) = (yd, ys1, .
