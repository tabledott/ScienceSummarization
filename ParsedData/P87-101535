G's, and TAG's can be recognized in polynomial time since polynomial time algorithms exist in for each of these formalisms.
    A corollary of the result of Section 4.3 is that polynomial time recognition of MCTAG's is possible.
    As discussed in Section 3, independent paths in tree sets, rather than the path complexity, may be crucial in characterizing semilinearity and polynomial time recognition.
    We would like to relax somewhat the constraint on the path complexity of formalisms in LCFRS.
    Formalisms such as the restricted indexed grammars (Gazdar, 1985) and members of the hierarchy of grammatical systems given by Weir (1987) have independent paths, but more complex path sets.
    Since these path sets are semilinear, the property of independent paths in their tree sets is sufficient to cause semilinearity of the languages generated by them.
    In addition, the restricted version of CG's (discussed in Section 6) generates tree sets with independent paths and we hope that it can be included in a m
