edman, and Pollard (1987) utilize this rule for anaphora resolution but restrict it to single transitions.
    Based on the preceding discussion of cheap and expensive transition pairs, we propose to redefine Rule 2 in terms of the costs of transition types.'
    Rule 2 then reads as follows: Rule 2&amp;quot; Cheap transition pairs are preferred over expensive ones.
    We believe that this definition of Rule 2 allows for a far better assessment of referential coherence in discourse than a definition in terms of sequences of transitions.
    For anaphora resolution, we interpret Rule 2&amp;quot; such that the preference for antecedents of anaphors in LI, can be derived directly from the Cf(Ui_i).
    The higher a discourse entity is ranked in the Cf, the more likely it is the antecedent of a pronoun.
    We see the redefinition of Rule 2 as the theoretical basis for a centering algorithm for pronoun resolution that simply uses the Cf as a preference ranking device like the basic centering algorithm shown in T
