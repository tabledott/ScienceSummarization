 many paraphrases that were produced by the baseline method for the sample.
    In addition to applying syntactic constraints to our phrase extraction algorithm, we can also apply them when we substitute a paraphrase into a sentence.
    To do so, we limit the paraphrases to be the same syntactic type as the phrase that it is replacing, based on the syntactic labels that are derived from the phrase tree for a test sentence.
    Since each phrase normally has a set of different CCG labels (instead of a single non-termal symbol) we need a way of choosing which label to use when applying the constraint.
    There are several different possibilities for choosing among labels.
    We could simultaneously choose the best paraphrase and the best label for the phrase in the parse tree of the test sentence: Alternately, we could average over all of the labels that are generated for the phrase in the parse tree: The potential drawback of using Equations 8 and 9 is that the CCG labels for a particular sentence significa
