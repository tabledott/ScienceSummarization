erent polarity, so that we can consistently recover the expression-level gold standard for evaluation.
    This expansion is applied to both the training and test data, and the performance is reported in Table 4.
    From this experiment, we make the following observations: mance for any method.
    This shows that most of relevant context for judging the polarity is contained within the expression boundaries, and motivates the task of finding the boundaries of opinion expressions.
    &#8226; The NEGEX methods perform better than VOTE only when the expression boundaries are reasonably accurate.
    When the expression boundaries are expanded up to sentence boundaries, they perform worse than VOTE.
    We conjecture this is because the scope of negators tends to be limited to inside of expression boundaries.
    &#8226; The COMPO methods always perform better than any other heuristic-based methods.
    And their performance does not decrease as steeply as the NEGEX methods as the expression boundaries expand.
