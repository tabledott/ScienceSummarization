    Our SRL system outputs the following two annotations: (1) [ARG1 Antigens] were [ARGM&#8722;TMP originally] [rel defined] [ARG2 as non-self molecules which bound specifically to antibodies].
    (2)Antigens were originally defined as [ARG1 non-self molecules] [R&#8722;A1 which] [rel bound] [ARGM&#8722;MNR specifically] [ARG2 to antibodies]. giving the PASs in Figure 2.

    As visible in Figure 2.
    (a), when an argument node corresponds to an entire subordinate clause, we label its leaf with PAS, e.g. the leaf of ARG2.
    Such PAS node is actually the root of the subordinate clause in Figure 2.(b).
    Taken as standalone, such PASs do not express the whole meaning of the sentence; it is more accurate to define a single structure encoding the dependency between the two predicates as in It is worth to note that semantically equivalent sentences syntactically expressed in different ways share the same PB arguments and the same PASs, whereas semantically d
