ll data sets, we can consider the following analogy.
    With collectible trading cards, rare cards are the most valuable.
    However, if we have some cards and are trying to determine thier value, looking in only a few packs of cards will not tell us if any of our cards are valuable.
    Only by looking at many packs of cards can we make a determination as to which are the rare ones.
    Only in samples of sufficient size is uniqueness informative.
    The results in this section suggest that an NLP system using uniqueness features to recognize subjectivity should determine uniqueness with respect to the test data augmented with an additional store of (unannotated) data.
    In this section, we describe experiments in identifying potentially subjective collocations.
    Collocations are selected from the subjective-element data (i.e., NG-SE, NG-FE, and WSJ-SE), using the union of the annotators&#8217; tags for the data sets tagged by multiple taggers.
    The results are then evaluated on opinion piece data
