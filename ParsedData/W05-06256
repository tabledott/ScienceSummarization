idates, a1 = &#8220;traders&#8221; and a4 = &#8220;the selling panic in both stocks and futures&#8221;; system B has three argument candidates, b1 = &#8220;traders&#8221;, b2 = &#8220;the selling panic&#8221;, and b3 = &#8220;in both stocks and futures&#8221;.
    The phantom candidates are created for a2, a3, and b4 of which probability is set to the prior.
    Specifically for this implementation, we first train two SRL systems that use Collins&#8217; parser and Charniak&#8217;s parser respectively.
    In fact, these two parsers have noticeably different output.
    In evaluation, we run the system that was trained with Charniak&#8217;s parser 5 times with the top-5 parse trees output by Charniak&#8217;s parser1.
    Together we have six different outputs per predicate.
    Per each parse tree output, we ran the first three stages, namely pruning, argument identification, and argument classification.
    Then a joint inference stage is used to resolve the inconsistency of the output of argument classificat
