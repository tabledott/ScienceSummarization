    The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) is annotated with information to make predicate-argument structure easy to decode, including function tags and markers of &#8220;empty&#8221; categories that represent displaced constituents.
    To expedite later stages of annotation, we have developed a parsing system (Gabbard et al., 2006) that recovers both of these latter annotations, the first we know of.
    A firststage parser matches the Collins (2003) parser on which it is based on the Parseval metric, while simultaneously achieving near state-of-the-art performance on recovering function tags (F-measure 89.0).
    A second stage, a seven stage pipeline of maximum entropy learners and voted perceptrons, achieves state-of-the-art performance (F-measure 74.7) on the recovery of empty categories by combining a linguistically-informed architecture and
