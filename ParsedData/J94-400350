    This model is therefore relevant for translation systems that use a parser for the source language, but may not have available a robust target language parser.
    The corpus used for evaluating the TWS' method consists of articles posted to the USENET news system.
    The articles were collected from news groups that discuss computer-related topics.
    The length of the corpus is 8,871,125 words (tokens), and the lexicon size (distinct types, at the string level) is 95,559.
    The type of text in this corpus is quite noisy, including short and incomplete sentences as well as much irrelevant information, such as person and device names.
    The test set used for the experiment consists of 78 Hebrew sentences that were taken out of a book about computers.
    These sentences were processed as described in Section 4, obtaining a set of 269 ambiguous Hebrew words.
    The average number of alternative translations per ambiguous word in this set is 5.8, and there are 1.35 correct transla
