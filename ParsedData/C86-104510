s even if their categories encode the same combination function.
			Another solution to the problem involves the encoding of the difference in the value part of the functor.
			Yet this solution is not only unintuitive but also contradicts a linguistic generalization.
			It is unintuitive because there is no difference in the distribution of the resulting VPs.
			The only difference holds between the modifiers themselves.
			The gene~:alization that is violated by the encoding of the difference in the value subgraphs is the endocentricity of the VP.
			The modified VP shares all syntactic features with its head, the lower VP.
			Yet the feature that indicates the difference between adverbs and adverbial phrases could not be in both the argument and the value parts of the functor, otherwise iterations of the two types of modifiers as they occur in the following pair of sentences would be ruled out.
