  edges may be added later.
  This information is passed along on whenever  an exist ing edge is extended to a new one.
  At the point at which C" is added to the chart,  no checks are necessary because the new edge already has a pointer to every incoming edge at the s tar t ing vertex that  can now perhaps be extended.
  Let us now consider a situation, in which the chart contains two adjacent edges A(B):C and C".
  In the course of trying to extend the the active edge with C" to build A", the parser has to unify it with the C" constituent of the active edge.
  The nature of chart parsing is :inch Chat, whether or not this unificat, ion succeeds, it must not alter the contents of the two operand edges.
  Both AIB):C and C" must remain on l, he chart because they may be needed later on for some other unification.
  Because unificaLion is a destructive operation, some of the earl ier implementations of unification-based chart parsing, e.g.
  Z-PATR, never apply it directly, instead, the feature sets are first
