th the agreement model (both indicating consensus or both indicating contrast), then the grief of all model components will be zero, and we simply output y.
    On the other hand, if y&#65533; indicates disagreement but the agreement model predicts consensus, then we have the option of predicting y&#65533; and bearing the grief of the agreement model.
    Alternatively, we can predict some consensus y0 (i.e. with y0[i] = y0[j], Vi, j) and bear the grief of the component ranking models.
    The decoder H chooses the option with lowest overall grief.4 m Now we formally define the measures of grief used in this criterion.
    Aspect Model Grief We define the grief of the ithaspect ranking model with respect to a rank r to be the smallest magnitude correction term which places the input&#8217;s score into the rth segment of the real line: Agreement Model Grief Similarly, we define the grief of the agreement model with respect to a joint rank r = (r[1], ... , r[m]) as the smallest correction needed to bring the ag
