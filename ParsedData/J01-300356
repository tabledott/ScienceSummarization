ibution of individual features as above, but with reference to their effect on the performance of individual classes.
    This is important, as it enables us to evaluate our hypotheses concerning the relation between the thematic features and verb class distinctions, which we turn to in Section 4.4.
    We performed single hold-out experiments on the full set of features, as well as on each subset of features with a single feature removed.
    The first line of Table 11 shows that the overall accuracy for all five features is almost exactly the same as that achieved with the 10-fold cross-validation methodology (69.5% versus 69.8%).
    As with the crossvalidation results, the removal of PASS does not degrade performance-in fact, here its removal appears to improve performance (see line 2 of Table 11).
    However, it should be noted that this increase in performance results from one additional verb being
  
  
    classified correctly.
    The remaining lines of Table 11 show that the removal of any other fe
