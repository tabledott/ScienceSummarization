 will in general find a local minimum rather than the global one; the problem is NP-complete (Garey and Johnson, 1979).
    We can arbitrarily increase the probability of finding the globally optimal solution by repeatedly running the algorithm with different starting partitions.
  
  
    The clustering algorithm separates each component of the graph into two groups of adjectives, but does not actually label the adjectives as positive or negative.
    To accomplish that, we use a simple criterion that applies only to pairs or groups of words of opposite orientation.
    We have previously shown (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1995) that in oppositions of gradable adjectives where one member is semantically unmarked, the unmarked member is the most frequent one about 81% of the time.
    This is relevant to our task because semantic markedness exhibits a strong correlation with orientation, the unmarked member almost always having positive orientation (Lehrer, 1985; Battistella, 1990).
    We compute the avera
