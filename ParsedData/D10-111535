 set where rank of observed w.r.t. predicted is &gt; 1K. domly selected cases where the observed AN is the nearest neighbor of the predicted one.
    Here, the ANs themselves make sense, and the (often shared) neighbors are also sensible (recent enquiry for recent request, common approach and common vision for common understanding, etc.).
    Moving to the right, we see 10 random examples of ANs where the observed AN was at least 999 neighbors apart from the alm prediction.
    First, we notice some ANs that are difficult to interpret out-of-context (important summer, white profile, young photo, large pass, ... ).
    Second, at least subjectively, we find that in many cases the nearest neighbor of predicted AN is actually more sensible than that of observed AN: current element (vs. left) for current dimension, historical reality (vs. different today) for historical thing, special thing (vs. little animal) for special something, young image (vs. important song) for young photo.
    In the other cases, the pre
