ch parse is converted into a set of constituents represented as a tuples: (label, start, end).
    The set is then compared with the set generated from the Penn Treebank parse to determine the precision and recall.
    Precision is the portion of hypothesized constituents that are correct and recall is the portion of the Treebank constituents that are hypothesized.
    For our experiments we also report the mean of precision and recall, which we denote by (P + R)I2 and F-measure.
    F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, 2PR/(P + R).
    It is closer to the smaller value of precision and recall when there is a large skew in their values.
    We performed three experiments to evaluate our techniques.
    The first shows how constituent features and context do not help in deciding which parser to trust.
    We then show that the combining techniques presented above give better parsing accuracy than any of the individual parsers.
    Finally we show the combining techniques degrade very little
