es in both directions are added and normalized to a scale between 0 and 1.
    To measure the correlation of the automatic metrics with the human judgments of translation quality at the system-level we used Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient p. We converted the raw scores assigned each system into ranks.
    We assigned a ranking to the systems for each of the three types of manual evaluation based on: &#8226; The percent of time that the sentences it produced were judged to be better than or equal to the translations of any other system.
    &#8226; The percent of time that its constituent translations were judged to be better than or equal to the translations of any other system.
    &#8226; The percent of time that its constituent translations were judged to be acceptable.
    We calculated p three times for each automatic metric, comparing it to each type of human evaluation.
    Since there were no ties p can be calculated using the simplified equation: where di is the difference between the r
