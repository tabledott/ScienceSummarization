    Utilizing statistics outside of a model is an important idea for statistical machine translation in general.
    For example, a decoder in (Och and Ney, 2000) uses alignment template statistics found in the Viterbi alignments.
  
  
    This section describes results from our experiment using the decoder as described in the previous section.
    We used a Chinese-English translation corpus for the experiment.
    After discarding long sentences (more than 20 words in English), the English side of the corpus consisted of about 3M words, and it was parsed with Collins&#8217; parser (Collins, 1999).
    Training the TM took about 8 hours using a 54-node unix cluster.
    We selected 347 short sentences (less than 14 words in the reference English translation) from the held-out portion of the corpus, and they were used for evaluation.
    Table 1 shows the decoding performance for the test sentences.
    The first system ibm4 is a reference system, which is based on IBM Model4.
    The second and the thir
