he Penn treebank tagset has 48.
    The general pattern of the results presented does not vary greatly with the corpus and tagset used.
  
  
    The first experiment concerned the effect of the initial conditions on the accuracy using Baum-Welch re-estimation.
    A model was trained from a handtagged corpus in the manner described above, and then degraded in various ways to simulate the effect of poorer training, as follows:
  
  
    DO Un-degraded lexical probabilities, calculated from f (i, w) / f (i).
    D1 Lexical probabilities are correctly ordered, so that the most frequent tag has the highest lexical probability and so on, but the absolute values are otherwise unreliable.
    D2 Lexical probabilities are proportional to the overall tag frequencies, and are hence independent of the actual occurrence of the word in the training corpus.
    D3 All lexical probabilities have the same value, so that the lexicon contains no information other than the possible tags for each word.
