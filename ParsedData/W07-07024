			The subcategorisation of a verb, for instance, might help select the correct translation.
			Using multiple dependencies on factors in the source, we need a strat egy for dealing with sparse data.
			We propose using a logarithmic opinion pool (Smith et al, 2005) to combine the more specific models (which depend onboth words and supertags) with more general mod els (which only depends on words).
			This paper is the first to suggest this approach for combining multiple information sources in machine translation.Although the addition of supertags to phrase based translation does show some improvement, their overall impact is limited.
			Sequence models over supertags clearly result in some improvementsin local reordering but syntactic information con tains long distance dependencies which are simply not utilised in phrase-based models.
	
	
			Inspired by work on factored language models, Koehn et al (2006) extend phrase-based models to incorporate multiple levels of linguistic knowledgeas factors.
