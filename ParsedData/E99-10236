ion theoretic measure which contains the in their treatment of chunk-initial and chunk-final [+1 words: normalized entropy decrease of the classification set caused by the presence of the feature.
    Details of the algorithm can be found in (Daelemans et al., 1998)1.
    An important decision in an MBL experiment is the choice of the features that will be used for representing the data. is 1-IG is thought to be less sensitive to redundant features because of the data-dependent feature weighting that is included in the algorithm.
    We have found that the presence of redundant features has a negative influence on the performance of the baseNP recognizer.
    In (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) a set of transformational rules is used for modifying the classification of words.
    The rules use context information of the words, the part-of-speech tags that have been assigned to them and the chunk tags that are associated with them.
    We will use the same information as in our feature representation for words.
