del perplexity, interpolated perplexity, and efficiency (i.e., decrease in rule expansions per word) as base beam factor decreases.
    With a simple conditional probability model, and simple statistical search heuristics, we were able to find very accurate parses efficiently, and, as a side effect, were able to assign word probabilities that yield a perplexity improvement over previous results.
    These perplexity improvements are particularly promising, because the parser is providing information that is, in some sense, orthogonal to the information provided by a trigram model, as evidenced by the robust improvements to the baseline trigram when the two models are interpolated.
    There are several important future directions that will be taken in this area.
    First, there is reason to believe that some of the conditioning information is not uniformly useful, and we would benefit from finer distinctions.
    For example, the probability of a preposition is presumably more dependent on a c-commanding hea
