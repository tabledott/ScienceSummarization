 class, and there are no constraints placed on the parameters of these multinomials besides being positive and summing to one.
    This means that all the standard estimation methods (e.g.
    Expectation Maximization, Variational Bayes) extend directly to tied PCFGs.
    Maximum likelihood estimation provides a point estimate of &#175;&#952;.
    However, often we want to incorporate information about &#952;&#175; by modeling its prior distribution.
    As a prior, for each N&#175; E JV&#175; we will specify a Dirichlet distribution over &#952;N&#175; with hyperparameters &#945; &#175;N.
    The Dirichlet has the density function: Thus the prior over &#952; is a product of Dirichlets,which is conjugate to the PCFG likelihood function (Johnson et al., 2007).
    That is, the posterior P(&#175;&#952;|s, t, &#945;) is also a product of Dirichlets, also factoring into a Dirichlet for each nonterminal &#175;N, where the parameters &#945;&#175;r are augmented by the number of times rule r&#175; is observed in tree
