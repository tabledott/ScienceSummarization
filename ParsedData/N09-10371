 answering and textual entailment, it is essential to first have high quality systems for lower level tasks.
    A good (deep analysis) question answering system requires the data to first be annotated with several types of information: parse trees, named entities, word sense disambiguation, etc.
    However, having high performing, lowlevel systems is not enough; the assertions of the various levels of annotation must be consistent with one another.
    When a named entity span has crossing brackets with the spans in the parse tree it is usually impossible to effectively combine these pieces of information, and system performance suffers.
    But, unfortunately, it is still common practice to cobble together independent systems for the various types of annotation, and there is no guarantee that their outputs will be consistent.
    This paper begins to address this problem by building a joint model of both parsing and named entity recognition.
