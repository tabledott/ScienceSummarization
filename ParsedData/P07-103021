m generated a set of 15 binary relations all of which are meaningful.
    Those for which we could find some gold standard are listed in Table 2.
    Other relations generated include served-with, bait-for, food-type, spot-type, and gill-type.
    Our seed consisted of two constellation names, Orion and Cassiopeia.
    There are 88 standard constellations (www.astro.wisc.edu) some of which have multiple names so that the total number of commonly used constellations is 98.
    Of these, 87 names (77 constellations) are strings with no white space.
    The first stage of the algorithm returned 81 constellation names (77 distinct constellations) as well as 38 other names (consisting mostly of names of individual stars).
    Using the list of 87 single word constellation names as our gold standard, this gives precision of 0.68 and recall of 0.93.
    The second part of the algorithm generated a set of ten binary relations.
    Of these, one concerned travel and entertainment (constellations are quite popular as n
