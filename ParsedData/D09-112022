the room and Chinese people).
    Typically, these errors involve a combination of missing syntactic and semantic information.
    The result of this error analysis is given in Table 4; note that a single error may be attributed to more than one cause.
    Despite our efforts in Section 3 to add syntactic and semantic information to our system, the largest source of error is still a combination of missing semantic information or annotated syntactic structure rather than the lack of discourse or salience modeling.
    Our error analysis suggests that in order to improve the state-of-the-art in coreference resolution, future research should consider richer syntactic and semantic information than typically used in current systems.
  
  
    Our approach is not intended as an argument against the more complex, discourse-focused approaches that typify recent work.
    Instead, we note that rich syntactic and semantic processing vastly reduces the need to rely on discourse effects or evidence reconciliation for ref
