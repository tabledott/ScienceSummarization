tated as a concern in Morris's work, perhaps because the texts were short, and presumably, if a word were ambiguous, the correct thesaurus class would nevertheless be chosen because the chained-to words would share only the correct thesaurus class.
    However, my experimentation with an implemented version of Morris' algorithm that made use of Roget's 1911 thesaurus (which is admittedly less structured than the thesaurus used by Morris), when run on longer texts, found ambiguous links to be a common oca.44t:ence and detrimental to the algorithm.
    A thesaurus-based disambiguation algorithm (Yarowsky 1992) may help alleviate this problem (this option is revisited in Section 7), but another solution is to move away from thesaurus classes and use simple word co-occurrence instead, since within a given text a word is usually used with only one sense (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992b).
    The potential downside of this approach is that many useful links may be missed.
    Another limitation of the Morris algor
