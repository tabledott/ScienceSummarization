 accuracies of up to 90.7% on the development set, substantially higher than previous symbol-splitting approaches, while starting from an extremely simple base grammar.
    However, in general, any automatic induction system is in danger of being entirely uninterpretable.
    In this section, we examine the learned grammars, discussing what is learned.
    We focus particularly on connections with the linguistically motivated annotations of Klein and Manning (2003), which we do generally recover.
    Inspecting a large grammar by hand is difficult, but fortunately, our baseline grammar has less than 100 nonterminal symbols, and even our most complicated grammar has only 1043 total (sub)symbols.
    It is therefore relatively straightforward to review the broad behavior of a grammar.
    In this section, we review a randomly-selected grammar after 4 SM cycles that produced an Fl score on the development set of 89.11.
    We feel it is reasonable to present only a single grammar because all the grammars are ver
