    There appear to be strong constraints on the kinds of transitions that are allowed, however.
    In particular, if a given utterance forces either the VF or the VL interpretation, then only this interpretation is possible in the immediately subsequent utterance.
    However, if some utterance only prefers one interpretation (in a given context), but allows the other, then the subsequent utterance may pick up on either one.
    For example, the sequence, in which &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; may be interpreted either VF, or VL, may be followed by either (30) or (31): However, if we change (29b) to force the value-loaded interpretation, as in (26), then only the value-loaded interpretation (30) is possible.
    Similarly, if (29b) is changed to force the value-free interpretation, as in (25b), then only the value-free interpretation (31) is possible.
    Speaker intentions may also enter into the determination of which entities are in the Cf.
