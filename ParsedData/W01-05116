n2 attaches to, or is most closely associated with.
    Because the data is sparse, empirical methods that train on word occurrences alone (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) have been supplanted by algorithms that generalize one or both of the nouns according to classmembership measures (Resnik, 1993; Resnik and Hearst, 1993; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Li and Abe, 1998), but the statistics are computed for the particular preposition and verb.
    It is not clear how to use the results of such analysis after they are found; the semantics of the relationship between the terms must still be determined.
    In our framework we would cast this problem as finding the relationship R(p, n2) that best characterizes the preposition and the NP that follows it, and then seeing if the categorization algorithm determines their exists any relationship R'(n1, R(p, n2)) or R'(v,R(p,n2)).
    The algorithms used in the related work reflect the fact that they condition probabilities on a particular verb and noun.
