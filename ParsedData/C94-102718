twork with 50 units would improve the accuracy of the tagging.
  It turned out that the accuracy actually deteriorated slightly, although the number of training cycles had been increased to 50 millions .
  Also, tire influence of the size of the input context was determined.
  Shrinking the context from three preceding and two following words to two preceding and one following word reduced the accuracy only by 0.1%.
  Enlarging the context gave no improvement.
  A context of three preceding and two following words seems to he optimal.
  As mentioned previously, the tagger can produce an alternative tag, if the decision between two tags is difficult.
  In that way, the accuracy can be raised to 97.79 % at the expense of 4.6 % ambiguously tagged words.
  An analysis of tire errors of the Net-Tagger and the trigram tagger shows that both have problems with the same words, althot, gh the individual errors are of- ten different 9 .
