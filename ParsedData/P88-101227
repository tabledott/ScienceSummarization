l scale, and a decrease of a plain is a change of the plain's location on a vertical scale.
    Unifying these would provide reinforcement for our identification of &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; with the plain.
    Now assuming the most specific atoms we have derived including all the &amp;quot;et cetera&amp;quot; conditions, we arrive at an interpretation that is minimal and that solves the internal coreference problems as a byproduct.
    By combining the idea of interpretation as abduction with the older idea of parsing as deduction (Kowalski, 1980, pp.
    52-53; Pereira and Warren, 1983), it becomes possible to integrate syntax, semantics, and pragmatics in a very thorough and elegant way.a Below is a simple grammar written in Prolog style, but incorporating calls to local pragmatics.
    The syntax portion is represented in standard Prolog manner, with nonterminals treated as predicates and having as two of its arguments the beginning and end points of the phrase spanned by the nonterminal.
