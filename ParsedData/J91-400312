    Turning now to the question of how current theories compare with the coverage of lexical semantic data, there are two generalizations that should be made.
    First, the taxonomic descriptions that have recently been made of verb classes are far superior to the classifications available twenty years ago (see Levin [1985] for review).
    Using mainly the descriptive vocabulary of Talmy (1975, 1985) and Jackendoff (1983), fine and subtle distinctions are drawn that were not captured in the earlier, primitives-based approach of Schank (1972, 1975) or the frame semantics of Fillmore (1968).
    As an example of the verb classifications developed by various researchers (and compiled by the MIT Lexicon Pro
