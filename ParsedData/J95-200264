 performs a computation that is isomorphic to that of inside probabilities shown here.
    Schabes (1991) adds both inner and outer probabilities to Earley's algorithm, with the purpose of obtaining a generalized estimation algorithm for SCFGs.
    Both of these approaches are restricted to grammars without unbounded ambiguities, which can arise from unit or null productions.
    Dan Jurafsky (personal communication) wrote an Earley parser for the Berkeley Restaurant Project (BeRP) speech understanding system that originally computed forward probabilities for restricted grammars (without left-corner or unit production recursion).
    The parser now uses the method described here to provide exact SCFG prefix and next-word probabilities to a tightly coupled speech decoder (Jurafsky, Wooters, Segal, Stolcke, Fosler, Tajchman, and Morgan 1995).
    An essential idea in the probabilistic formulation of Earley's algorithm is the collapsing of recursive predictions and unit completion chains, replacing both with loo
