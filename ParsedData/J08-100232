predicate&#8211;argument structures can be packed into conjunctive nodes by ignoring local structures.
    One may claim that restricting the domain of feature functions to (em, el, er) limits the flexibility of feature design.
    Although this is true to some extent, it does not necessarily mean the impossibility of incorporating features on nonlocal dependencies into the model.
    This is because a feature forest model does not assume probabilistic independence of conjunctive nodes.
    This means that we can unpack a part of the forest without With the method previously described, we can represent an HPSG parsing chart with a feature forest.
    However, equivalence classes in a chart might increase exponentially because predicate&#8211;argument structures in HPSG signs represent the semantic relations of all words that the phrase dominates.
    For example, Figure 14 shows phrasal signs with predicate&#8211;argument structures for saw a girl with a telescope.
    In the chart in Figure 12, these signs a
