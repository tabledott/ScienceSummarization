n difficult to analyze, and the annotation is not very consistent.
    The CCGbank manual lists heuristics that we used to infer additional structure.
    For example, if a node is labeled FRAG, and there is only one daughter (and potentially an end-of-sentence punctuation mark), as in the first example, we treat the tree as if it was labeled with the label of its daughter (NP in this case).
    Parentheticals.
    Parentheticals are insertions that are often enclosed in parentheses, or preceded by a dash.
    Unless the parenthetical element itself is of a type that could be a modifier by itself (e.g., a PP), we assume that the opening parenthesis or first dash takes the parenthetical element as argument and yields a modifier of the appropriate type: (NP (NP the third-highest) (PP-LOC in the developing world))) This results in the following derivation, which ignores the fact that parentheses are usually balanced (Nunberg 1990): &#8211; the third-highest in the developing world We use a similar treatment for
