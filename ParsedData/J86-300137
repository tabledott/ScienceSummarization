s more and more necessary to be able to identify relevant discourse segments, the entities they make salient, and their DSPs.
    The role of attentional state in delineating the information necessary for understanding is thus central to discourse processing.
  
  
    To illustrate the basic theory we have just sketched, we will give a brief analysis of two kinds of discourse: an argument from a rhetoric text and a task-oriented dialogue.
    For each example we discuss the segmentation of the discourse, the intentions that underlie this segmentation, and the relationships among the various DSPs.
    In each case, we point out some of the linguistic devices used to indicate segment boundaries as well as some of the expressions whose interpretations depend on those boundaries.
    The analysis is concerned with specifying certain aspects of the behavior to be explicated by a theory of discourse; the remainder of the paper provides a partial account of this behavior.
    Our first example is an argument taken
