    For two randomly selected pieces of text from other parts of the New York Times newswire, a portion of which is shown in Fig.
    1, out of 200 verbs, the acquired subcategorization dictionary listed 163 of the subcategorization frames that appeared.
    So the token recall rate is approximately 82%.
    This compares with a baseline accuracy of 32% that would result from always guessing TV (transitive verb) and a performance figure of 62% that would result from a system that correctly classified all TV and THAT verbs (the two most common types), but which got everything else wrong.
    We can get a pessimistic lower bound on precision and recall by testing the acquired dictionary against some published dictionary.13 For this 13The resulting figures will be considerably lower than the true precision and recall because the dictionary lists subcategorization frames that do not appear in the training corpus and vice versa.
    However, this is stil
