gorithm terminates when the number of generated paths equals k. In summary, we use k-best MIRA to iteratively update w(i).
    The final weight vector w is the average of the weight vectors after each iteration.
    As reported in (Collins, 2002; McDonald et al., 2005), parameter averaging can effectively avoid overfitting.
    For inference, we can use Viterbi-style decoding to search for the most likely path y* for a given sentence x where: In conventional sequence labeling where the observation sequence (word) boundaries are fixed, one can use the 0/1 loss to measure the errors of a predicted path with respect to the correct path.
    However, in our model, word boundaries vary based on the considered path, resulting in a different numbers of output tokens.
    As a result, we cannot directly use the 0/1 loss.
    We instead compute the loss function through false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN).
    Here, FP means the number of output nodes that are not in the correct path, and FN means the number
