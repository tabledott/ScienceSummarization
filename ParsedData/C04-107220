			estimated using bootstrap resampling (Davison and Hinkley).
			According to Table 2, BLEUS6 (dark/green cell) is the best performer among all BLEUSes, but it is statistically equivalent to BLEUS3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 with 95% of confidence.
			Table 3 shows Pearson?s correlation coefficient for BLEUS1 to 9 over 8 participants in 2003 NIST Chinese-English machine translation evaluation.
			According to Table 3, we find that shorter BLEUS has better correlation with adequacy.
			However, correlation with fluency increases when longer n gram is considered but decreases after BLEUS5.
			There is no consensus winner that achieves best correlation with adequacy and fluency at the same time.
			So which version of BLEUS should we use?
			A reasonable answer is that if we would like to optimize for adequacy th
