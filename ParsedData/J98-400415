sidered here.
    Still, one might hope that a PCFG model might be able to accurately reflect general statistical trends concerning attachment preferences in the training data, even if it lacks the information to correctly resolve individual cases.
    But as the analysis in this section makes clear, even this is not always obtained.
    For example, suppose our corpora only contain two trees, both of which have yields V Det N P Det N, are always analyzed as a VP with a direct object NP and a PP, and differ only as to whether the PP modifies the NP or the VP.
    The corpora differ as to how these modifications are represented as trees.
    The dependencies in these corpora (specifically, the fact that the PP is either attached to the NP or to the VP) violate the independence assumptions implicit in a PCFG model, so one should not expect a PCFG model to exactly reproduce any of these corpora.
    As a CL reviewer points out, the results presented here depend on the assumption that there is exactly one PP.
