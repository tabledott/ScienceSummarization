ably higher time and space complexity compared to decoding.
			For example, with precision loss the time complexity is O(S 3 R) as each step must consider O(S 2) pos sible loss parameter values.
	
	
			In this section we present our extensions of Cohnand Lapata?s (2007) model.
			The latter was de signed with the simpler extractive compression in mind and cannot be readily applied to our task.
			5 Spurious ambiguity in the grammar means that there areoften many derivations linking the source and target.
			We fol low Cohn and Lapata (2007) by choosing the derivation with the most rules, which should provide good generalisation.
			Grammar It is relatively straightforward to extract a grammar from our corpus.
			This grammar will contain many rules encoding deletions and structural transformations but there will be many unobserved paraphrases, no matter how good the extraction method (recall that our corpus consistssolely of 565 sentences).
			For this reason, we ex tract a grammar from our abstractive corpus
