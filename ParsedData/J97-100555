 prosodic phrases, and clauses, respectively, are 50.0%, 43.1%, and 44.9%.
    For the machine learning algorithm we also estimate performance using cross-validation (Weiss and Kulikowski 1991), as detailed in Section 4.3.2.
    The evaluations in this section allow us to compare the utility of two tuning methods: error analysis, and machine learning.
    To quantify algorithm performance, we use the information retrieval metrics shown in Figure 8.
    Recall is the ratio of correctly hypothesized boundaries to target boundaries.
    Precision is the ratio of hypothesized boundaries that are correct to the total hypothesized boundaries.
    (See Figure 8 for fallout and error.)
    These metrics assume that ideal behavior would be to identify all and only the target boundaries: the values for b and c in Figure 8 would thus both equal 0, representing no errors.'
    The ideal values for recall, precision, fallout, and error are 1, 1, 0, and 0, while the worst values are 0, 0, 1, and 1.
