er, will cause the appropriate &amp;quot;reordering&amp;quot; to take place.
    Similarly, nothing more would be required in the transfer grammar in order to place adjectives properly with respect to the nouns they modify, and so forth.
    It may be objected to the line of argument that I have been persuing that it requires the legs of the translating machine to be tied together at too lower a level, essentially at the level of syntax.
    To be sure, it allows more elaborate transfer grammars than the one just illustrated so that the translation of a sentence would not have to be structurally isomorphic with its source, modulo ordering.
    But the device is essentially syntactic.
    However, the relations that can be characterized by FUG and similar monotonic devices are in fact a great deal more diverse than this suggests.
    In particular, much of what falls under the umbrella of semantics in modern linguistics also fits conveniently within this framework.
    Something of the flavor of this can be ca
