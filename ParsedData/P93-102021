r a verb argument nor a restrictive relative.
    Figure 3 illustrates the coding of an NP, wheels.
    It's location is FIC number 25.
    The surface form is the string wheels.
    The wheels are new to the discourse, so the referential index 13 is new.
    The inferential relation (13 r1 12) indicates that the wheels entity is related to the bicycle entity (index 12) by a part/whole relation.6 The input to the segmentation algorithm is a list of 4-tuples representing all the referential NPs in a narrative.
    The output is a set of boundaries B, represented as ordered pairs of adjacent clauses: (FIC&#8222;,FICn+i).
    Before describing how boundaries are assigned, we explain that the potential boundary locations for the algorithm, between each FIC, differ from the potential boundary locations for the human study, between each prosodic phrase.
    Cases where multiple prosodic phrases map to one FIC, as in Figure 3, simply reflect the use of additional linguistic features to reject certain boundary sites,
