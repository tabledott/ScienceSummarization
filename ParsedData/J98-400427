four of the tree transforms depicted in Figure 8.
    The first and fourth transforms turn NP and VP nodes whose rightmost child is a PP into Chomsky adjunction structures, and the second and third transforms adjoin final PPs with a following comma punctuation into Chomsky adjunction structures.
    The constraints that U&gt; 1 and &gt; 2 ensures that these transforms will only apply a finite number of time to any given subtree.
    N'-V' produces trees that represent PP modification of NPs and VPs with a Chomsky adjunction representation that uses an intermediate level of X' structure.
    This is the result of repeatedly applying the four transformations depicted in Figure 8 as in the NP-VP transform, with the modification that the new nonmaximal nodes are labeled N' or V' as appropriate (rather than NP or VP).
    Flatten produces trees in which NPs have a flatter structure than the two-level representation of NPs used in the Penn II treebank.
    Only subtrees consisting of a parent node labeled NP whose
