 the mechanism is similar to the beam search used to prune nonequivalent edges, but a lower threshold was used for equivalent edges (1e vs. 1 100).
    Using these pruning parameters, an average of 14.9 parses per sentence were obtained.
    After rescoring with frame element probabilities, 18% of the sentences were assigned a parse different from the original best parse.
    Nevertheless, the impact on identification of frame elements was small; results are shown in Table 16.
    The results show a slight, but not statistically significant, increase in recall of frame elements.
    One possible reason that the improvement is not greater is the relatively small number of parses per sentence available for rescoring.
    Unfortunately, the parsing algorithm used to generate n-best parses is inefficient, and generating large numbers of parses seems to be computationally intractable.
    In theory, the complexity of n-best variations of the Viterbi chart-parsing algorithm is quadratic in n. One can simply expand
