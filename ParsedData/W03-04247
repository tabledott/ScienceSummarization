    The frequency counts have been obtained from 1 billion words of English newspaper text collected by Curran and Osborne (2002).
    Collins (2002) also describes a mapping from words to word types which groups words with similar orthographic forms into classes.
    This involves mapping characters to classes and merging adjacent characters of the same type.
    For example, Moody becomes Aa, A.B.C. becomes A.A.A. and 1,345.05 becomes 0,0.0.
    The classes are used to define unigram, bigram and trigram contextual predicates over the window.
    We have also defined additional composite features which are a combination of atomic features; for example, a feature which is active for mid-sentence titlecase words seen more frequently as lowercase than uppercase in a large external corpus.
