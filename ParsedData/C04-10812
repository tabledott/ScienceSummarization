 domain knowledge effectively into seg mentation.
			Domain knowledge is either not used, used in a limited way, or used in a complicated way spread across different components.
			For example,the N-gram generative language modeling based ap proach of Teahan et al(2000) does not use domainknowledge.
			Gao et al(2003) uses class-based language for word segmentation where some word cat egory information can be incorporated.
			Zhang et al (2003) use a hierarchical hidden Markov Model to incorporate lexical knowledge.
			A recent advance in this area is Xue (2003), in which the author uses a sliding-window maximum entropy classifier to tag Chinese characters into one of four position tags, and then covert these tags into a segmentation using rules.
			Maximum entropy models give tremendousflexibility to incorporate arbitrary features.
			How ever, a traditional maximum entropy tagger, as used in Xue (2003), labels characters without consideringdependencies among the predicted segmentation labels that is inheren
