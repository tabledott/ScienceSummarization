    Using BioScope for training and evaluation, Morante and Daelemans (2009) developed a scope detector following a supervised sequence labeling approach while &#168;Ozg&#168;ur and Radev (2009) developed a rule-based system that exploits syntactic patterns.
    Several related works have also been published within the framework of The BioNLP&#8217;09 Shared Task on Event Extraction (Kim et al., 2009), where a separate subtask was dedicated to predicting whether the recognized biological events are under negation or speculation, based on the GENIA event corpus annotations (Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2009; Van Landeghem et al., 2009).
  
  
    The shared task addressed the detection of uncertainty in two domains.
    As uncertainty detection is extremely important for biomedical information extraction and most existing approaches have targeted such applications, participants were asked to develop systems for hedge detection in biological scientific articles.
