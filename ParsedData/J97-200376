the reverse SR is not, because it does not have bounded variation.
    Indeed, since: We have: Vn E AT , l(SR , a&amp;quot; b) &#8212; (SR , an c)I = n +1 Mohri Transducers in Language and Speech A characterization similar to that of string-to-string transducers (Choffrut 1978) is possible for bisubsequential power series defined on the tropical semiring.
    In particular, the theorem of the previous sections shows that S is bisubsequential if S and SR have bounded variation.
    We similarly define bideterminizable transducers as the transducers T defined on the tropical semiring admitting two applications of determinization, as follows: In this definition, we assume that the reverse operation is performed simply by reversing the direction of the transitions and exchanging initial and final states.
    Given this definition, we can present the extension of the theorem of Brzozowski (1962) to bideterminizable transducers.21 Theorem 17 Let T be a bideterminizable transducer defined on the tropical semiring.
