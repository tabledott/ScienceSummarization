ntation (Snow et al, 2004).
			The primary reasons for using dependency structures instead of more informative lexicalized phrase structures is that they are more efficient to learn and parse whilestill encoding much of the predicate-argument infor mation needed in applications.
			root John hit the ball with the bat Figure 1: An example dependency tree.
			Dependency representations, which link words to their arguments, have a long history (Hudson, 1984).
			Figure 1 shows a dependency tree for the sentence John hit the ball with the bat.
			We restrict ourselvesto dependency tree analyses, in which each word de pends on exactly one parent, either another word or a dummy root symbol as shown in the figure.
			The tree in Figure 1 is projective, meaning that if we put the words in their linear order, preceded by the root, theedges can be drawn above the words without cross ings, or, equivalently, a word and its descendants form a contiguous substring of the sentence.In English, projective trees are sufficient
