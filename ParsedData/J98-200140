    Although these definite descriptions would have been classified by Hawkins as larger situation uses, in many cases they couldn't really be considered hearer-old or unused: what seems to be happening in these cases is that the writer assumed the reader would use information about the visual form of words, or perhaps lexical knowledge, to infer that an object of that name existed in the world.
    We evaluated the strength of these correlations by means of a computer simulation (Vieira and Poesio 1997).
    The system attempts to classify the definite descriptions found in texts syntactically annotated according to the Penn Treebank format.
    The system classifies a definite description as unfamiliar using heuristics based on the syntac
