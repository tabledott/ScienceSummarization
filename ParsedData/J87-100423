 parse forest, and halts the process.
    This subsection gives a trace of the algorithm with the sentence That information is important is doubtful, to demonstrate that our algorithm can handle multi-part-ofspeech words (in this sentence, that) just like multiple entries without any special mechanism.
    We use the grammar at the right and the parsing table below.
    At the very beginning, the parse forest contains nothing, and the stack contains only one vertex, labeled 0.
    The first word of the sentence is that, which can be categorized as *that, *det or *n. The action table tells us that all of these categories are legal.
    Thus, the algorithm behaves as if a multiple entry is encountered.
    Three actions, &amp;quot;shift 3&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;shift 4&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;shift 5&amp;quot;, are to be executed.
    Note that three different leaf nodes have been created in the parse forest.
    One of the three possibilities, that as a noun, is discarded immediately after the parser sees the n
