			Figure 2 is a gray-scale map of the matrix D[n,n].
			D[n,n] is so sparse that most parts of the graph areblank.
			We can see that there is no good cluster ing of fine classes mistakes within a coarse class,which explains intuitively why the hierarchical clas sifier with an additional level coarse classes does not work much better.
			4.4 Discussion and Examples.
			We have shown that the overall accuracy of our clas sifier is satisfactory.
			Indeed, all the reformulation questions that we exemplified in Sec.
			3 have been correctly classified.
			Nevertheless, it is constructive to consider some cases in which the classifier fails.Below are some examples misclassified by the hier archical classifier.What French ruler was defeated at the battle of Water loo?
			The correct label is individual, but the classifier, failing to relate the word ?ruler?
			to a person, since it was not in any semantic list, outputs event.
			What is the speed hummingbirds fly ? The correct label is speed, b
