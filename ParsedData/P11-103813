    From Table 1, it is clear that &#8220;Letter&#8221; accounts for the majority of ill-formed words in Twitter, and that most ill-formed words are based on morphophonemic variations.
    This empirical finding assists in shaping our strategy for lexical normalisation.
  
  
    Our proposed lexical normalisation strategy involves three general steps: (1) confusion set generation, where we identify normalisation candidates for a given word; (2) ill-formed word identification, where we classify a word as being ill-formed or not, relative to its confusion set; and (3) candidate selection, where we select the standard form for tokens which have been classified as being ill formed.
    In confusion set generation, we generate a set of IV normalisation candidates for each OOV word type based on morphophonemic variation.
    We call this set the confusion set of that OOV word, and aim to include all feasible normalisation candidates for the word type in the confusion set.
    The confusion
