ation and the pin-yin sequence output by the system.
    Note that the pin-yin error performance of our fully statistical method is quite competitive with previous results.
    We further note that increasing the training data results in further reduction of the syllable error rate.
    We concede that this performance, while comparable to other systems, is not satisfactory and merits further investigation.
    We also evaluate the efficacy of our second translation system which maps the pin-yin sequence produced by the previous stages to a sequence of Chinese characters, and obtain character error rates of 12.6%.
    Thus every correctly recognized pin-yin symbol has a chance of being transformed with some error, resulting in higher character error rate than the pin-yin error rate.
    Note that while significantly lower error rates have been reported for converting pin-yin to characters in generic Chinese text, ours is a highly specialized subset of transliterated foreign names, where the choice between sev
