    Recent work in machine translation has evolved from the traditional word (Brown et al., 1993) and phrase based (Koehn et al., 2003a) models to include hierarchical phrase models (Chiang, 2005) and bilingual synchronous grammars (Melamed, 2004).
    These advances are motivated by the desire to integrate richer knowledge sources within the translation process with the explicit goal of producing more fluent translations in the target language.
    The hierarchical translation operations introduced in these methods call for extensions to the traditional beam decoder (Koehn et al., 2003a).
    In this work we introduce techniques to generate syntactically motivated generalized phrases and discuss issues in chart parser based decoding in the statistical machine translation environment.
    (Chiang, 2005) generates synchronous contextfree grammar (SynCFG) rules from an existing phrase translation table.
    These rules can be viewed as phrase pairs with mixed lexical
