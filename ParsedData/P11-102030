    However, a significant portion of the remaining data is useful.
    Thus, an automatic method for filtering those sentences could allow us to utilize even more of the data.
    For example, sentences from the Tier-2 tasks could be used as positive examples to train a string classifier to determine whether a noisy sentence belongs in the same cluster or not.
    We have so far used BLEU to measure semantic adequacy since it is the most common MT metric.
    However, other more advanced MT metrics that have shown higher correlation with human judgments could also be used.
    In addition to paraphrasing, our data collection framework could also
