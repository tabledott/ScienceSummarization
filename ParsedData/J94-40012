    The main reason for this difficulty is the structural ambiguity that is common for conjunctive structures that appear in long sentences.
    Human beings can recognize conjunctive structures because of a certain, but sometimes subtle, similarity that exists between conjuncts.
    Therefore, we have developed an algorithm for calculating a similarity measure between two arbitrary series of words from the left and the right of a conjunction and selecting the two most similar series of words that can reasonably be considered as composing a conjunctive structure.
    This is realized using a dynamic programming technique.
    A long sentence can be reduced into a shorter form by recognizing conjunctive structures.
    Consequently, the total dependency structure of a sentence can be obtained by relatively simple head-dependent rules.
    A serious problem concerning conjunctive structures, besides the ambiguity of their scopes, is the ellipsis of some of their components.
