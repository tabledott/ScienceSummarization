ccuracy for the top 50 words ranked by the system, given a very large corpus.
    Lacking an objective definition of the part-of relation, we use the majority judgment of five human subjects to decide which proposed parts are correct.
    The program's output could be scanned by an enduser and added to an existing ontology (e.g., WordNet), or used as a part of a rough semantic lexicon.
    To the best of our knowledge, there is no published work on automatically finding parts from unlabeled corpora.
    Casting our nets wider, the work most similar to what we present here is that by Hearst [2] on acquisition of hyponyms (&amp;quot;isa&amp;quot; relations).
    In that paper Hearst (a) finds lexical correlates to the hyponym relations by looking in text for cases where known hyponyms appear in proximity (e.g., in the construction (NP, NP and (NP other NN)) as in &amp;quot;boats, cars, and other vehicles&amp;quot;), (b) tests the proposed patterns for validity, and (c) uses them to extract relations from a corp
