 we use testing data provided by LDC, which consists of sentences with Arabic words with reference translations.
    As a blind test set, we use MT 03 Arabic-English DARPA evaluation test set consisting of sentences with Arabic words.
    Three systems are evaluated in our experiments: is the baseline block unigram model without re-ordering.
    Here, monotone block alignments are generated: the blocks have only left predecessors (no blocks are swapped).
    This is the model presented in (Tillmann and Xia, 2003).
    For the model, the sentence is translated mostly monotonously, and only neighbor blocks are allowed to be swapped (at most block is skipped).
    The model allows for the same block swapping as the model, but additionally uses the orientation component described in Section 2: the block swapping is controlled where .
    The are not optimized separately, rather we define: by the unigram orientation counts.
    The and models use the block bigram model in Eq.
    3: all blocks are generated with n
