 applying the optimization method threshold accepting (Dueck and Scheuer, 1990) which is an efficient simplification of simulated annealing.
  
  
    The statistical machine-translation method described in (Och and Weber, 1998) makes use of bilingual word classes.
    The key element of this approach are the alignment templates (originally referred to as translation rules) which are pairs of phrases together with an alignment between the words of the phrases.
    Examples of alignment templates are shown in Figure 2.
    The advantage of the alignment template approach against word-based statistical translation models is that word context and local re-orderings are explicitly taken into account.
    The alignment templates are automatically trained using a parallel training corpus.
    The translation of a sentence is done by a search process which determines the set of alignment templates which optimally cover the source sentence.
    The bilingual word classes are used to generalize the applicability of th
