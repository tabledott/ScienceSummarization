  Moses: Open Source Toolkit for Statistical Machine Translation
  
    where many sources of information about the project can be found.
    Moses was the subject of this year&#8217;s Johns Hopkins University Workshop on Machine Translation (Koehn et al. 2006).
    The decoder is the core component of Moses.
    To minimize the learning curve for many researchers, the decoder was developed as a drop-in replacement for Pharaoh, the popular phrase-based decoder.
    In order for the toolkit to be adopted by the community, and to make it easy for others to contribute to the project, we kept to the following principles when developing the decoder: &#8226; Accessibility &#8226; Easy to Maintain &#8226; Flexibility &#8226; Easy for distributed team development &#8226; Portability It was developed in C++ for efficiency and followed modular, object-oriented design.
    3 Factored Translation Model Non-factored SMT typically deals only with the surface form of words and has one phrase table, as shown in Figure 1.
