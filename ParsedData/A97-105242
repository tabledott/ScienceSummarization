 1992); see figure 65.
    Next, we collected all words in the test corpus tagged as possibly being verbs (giving a total of 356 distinct lemmas) and retrieved all citations of them in the LOB corpus, plus Susanne with the 250 test sentences excluded.
    We acquired subcategorization and associated frequency information from the citations, in the process successfully parsing 380K words.
    We then parsed the test set, with each verb subcategorization possibility weighted by its raw frequency score, and using the naive add-one smoothing technique to allow for omitted possibilities.
    The GEIG measures for the lexicalized parser show a 7% improvement in the crossing bracket score (figure 6).
    Over the existing test corpus this is not statistically significant at the 95% level (paired t-test, 1.21, 249 df, p = 0.11)&#8212;although if the pattern of differences were maintained over a larger test set of 470 sentences it would be significant.
    We expect that a more sophisticated smoothing technique, a lar
