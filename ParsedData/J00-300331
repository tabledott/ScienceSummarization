 dialogue grammars are able to detect speaker gender with 63% accuracy (over Stolcke et al. Dialogue Act Modeling a 50% baseline) on Switchboard (Ries 1999b), indicating that there are global variables in the DA distribution that could potentially be exploited by a cache dialogue grammar.
    Clearly, dialogue grammar adaptation needs further research.
    Second, we built a discourse grammar that incorporated constraints on DA sequences in a nonhierarchical way, using maximum entropy (ME) estimation (Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996).
    The choice of features was informed by similar ones commonly used in statistical language models, as well our general intuitions about potentially information-bearing elements in the discourse context.
    Thus, the model was designed so that the current DA label was constrained by features such as unigram statistics, the previous DA and the DA once removed, DAs occurring within a window in the past, and whether the previous utterance was by the same speaker.
