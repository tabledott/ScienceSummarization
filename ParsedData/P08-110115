acter.
    All input characters are processed in the same way, and the final output is the best candidate in the final agenda.
    The time complexity of the algorithm is O(WTBn), with W being the maximum word size, T being the total number of POS tags and n the number of characters in the input.
    It is also linear in the input size.
    Moreover, the decoding algorithm gives competent accuracy with a small agenda size of B = 16.
    To further limit the search space, two optimizations are used.
    First, the maximum word length for each tag is recorded and used by the decoder to prune unlikely candidates.
    Because the majority of tags only apply to words with length 1 or 2, this method has a strong effect.
    Development tests showed that it improves the speed significantly, while having a very small negative influence on the accuracy.
    Second, like the baseline POS tagger, the tag dictionary is used for Chinese closed set tags and the tags for frequent words.
    To words outside the tag dictiona
