    Again, we use the heuristics from the Section 4.5 to reconcile the mono-directional alignments obtained through training parameters using models of increasing complexity.
    How much is performance affected, if we base word alignments on these simpler methods?
    As Figure 6 indicates, not much.
    While Model 1 clearly results in worse performance, the difference is less striking for Model 2 and 3.
    Using different expansion heuristics during symmetrizing the word alignments has a bigger effect.
    We can conclude from this, that high quality phrase alignments can be learned with fairly simple means.
    The simpler and faster Model 2 provides similar performance to the complex Model 4.
    We validated our findings for additional language pairs.
    Table 3 displays some of the results.
    For all language pairs the phrase model (based on word alignments, Section 3.1) outperforms IBM Model 4.
    Lexicalization (Lex) always helps as well.
  
  
    We created a framework (translation model and
