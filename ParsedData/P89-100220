ent in Figure 1 uses an infix operator / to separate syntactic and semantic category information.
    Subcategorization for complements is performed lexically.
    Consider the generation from the category sentence/decl(call_up(john,friends)).
    The analysis tree that we will be implicitly traversing in the course of generation is given in Figure 2.
    The rule numbers are keyed to the grammar.
    The pivots chosen during generation and the branches corresponding to the semantic head relation are shown in boldface.
    We begin by attempting to find a nonchain rule that will define the pivot.
    This is a rule whose left-hand-side semantics matches the root semantics decl(call_up(john,friends)) (although its syntax may differ).
    In fact, the only such nonchain rule is We conjecture that the pivot is labeled sentence/decl(call_up( j ohn, friends) ) In terms of the tree traversal, we are implicitly choosing the root node [a] as the pivot.
    We recursively generate from the child's node [b], whose cate
