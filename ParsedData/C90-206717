3: "a youth in personal service"), sheep (1), and pen (2.1).
			This example is particularly difficult, because page and sheep compete against each other to activate different senses of pen, as demonstrated in the examples above.
			However, the word young reinforces sense 2.3 of page, which enables sheep to win the struggle.
			Inter-sentential context could be used as well, by retaining the most activated nodes within the network during subsequent runs.
			By running various experiments on VLNNs, we have discovered that when the simple models proposed so far are scaled up, several improvements are necessary.
			We have, for instance, discovered that "gang effects" appear due to extreme imbalance among words having few senses and hence few connections, and words containing up to 80 senses and several hundred connections, and that therefore dampening is required.
			tn addition, we have found that is is necessary to treat a word node and its sense nodes as a complex, ecological unit rather than as separate nt
