ion 5 then brings out the connection between Earley Deduction and chart parsing, and shows the added generality brought in by the proof procedure approach.
    Section 6 outlines some of the problems of implementing Earley Deduction and similar parsing procedures.
    Finally, Section 7 discusses questions of computational complexity and decidability.
  
  
    A definite clause has the form P and Q1, , Qn are literals.
    P is the positive literal or head of the clause; Q1, , Qn are the negative literals, forming the body of the clause.
    Literals have the forth p(11,...4), where p is the predicate of arity k and the ti the arguments.
    The arguments are terms.
    A term may be: a variable (variable names start with capital letters); a constant; a compound term where f is a functor of arity m and the ti are terms.
    All the variables in a clause are implicitly universally quantified.
    A set of definite clauses forms a program, and the clauses in a program are called input clauses.
    A program de
