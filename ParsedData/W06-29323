    We Proceedings of the 10th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-X), pages 216&#8211;220, New York City, June 2006. c&#65533;2006 Association for Computational Linguistics assume that all dependency graphs are trees but may be non-projective, both of which are true in the data sets we use.
  
  
    The first stage of our system creates an unlabeled parse y for an input sentence x.
    This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006).
    That work extends the maximum spanning tree dependency parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b) to incorporate features over multiple edges in the dependency graph.
    An exact projective and an approximate non-projective parsing algorithm are presented, since it is shown that nonprojective dependency parsing becomes NP-hard when features are extended beyond a single edge.
    That system uses MIRA, an online large-margin learning algorithm, to compute model para
