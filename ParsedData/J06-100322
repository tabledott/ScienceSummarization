  (8) Notice that p is monotonic as one moves up the taxonomy: if c1 IS-A c2 then p(c1) ?
  For example, whenever we encounter a nickel, we have encountered a coin (Figure 1), so p(nickel) ?
  As a consequence, the higher the position of the most-specific subsumer for given two concepts in the taxonomy (i.e., the more abstract it is), the lower their similarity.
  In particular, if the taxonomy has a unique top node, its probability will be 1, so if the most-specific subsumer of a pair of concepts is the top node, their similarity will be ?
  log(1) = 0, as desired.
