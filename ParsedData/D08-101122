tputs on MT08 from seven additional single systems as summarized in Table 2.
    These systems belong to two groups.
    Sys-9 to Sys-12 are in the first group.
    They are syntaxaugmented hierarchical systems similar to those described by Shen et al. (2008) using different Chinese word segmentation and language models.
    The second group has Sys-13 to Sys-15.
    Sys-13 is a phrasal system proposed by Koehn et al. (2003), Sys-14 is a hierarchical system proposed by Chiang (2007), and Sys-15 is a syntax-based system proposed by Galley et al.
    (2006).
    All seven systems were trained within the confines of the constrained training condition of NIST MT08 evaluation.
    We collected 10-best MT outputs only on the MT08 test set from these seven extra systems.
    No MT outputs on our dev set are available from them at present.
    Therefore, we directly adopt system combination parameters trained for the previous 8way system combination, except the system weights, which are re-set by the following heuris
