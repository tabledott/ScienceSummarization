emanding u(C) &#8804; 3, we obtain the S3 restriction Illustration of the IBM-style reordering constraint. introduced in the Appendix.
    An upper bound of O(E3 &#183; J4) for the word reordering complexity is given in Tillmann (2001).
    In order to demonstrate the complexity of the proposed reordering constraints, we have modified our translation algorithm to show, for the different reordering constraints, the overall number of successor states generated by the algorithm given in Table 3.
    The number of successors shown in Figure 10 is counted for a pseudotranslation task in which a pseudo&#8211;source word x is translated into the identically pseudo&#8211; target word x.
    No actual optimization is carried out; the total number of successors is simply counted as the algorithm proceeds through subsets of increasing cardinality.
    The complexity differences for the different reordering constraints result from the different number of coverage subsets C and corresponding reordering states S allowed.
