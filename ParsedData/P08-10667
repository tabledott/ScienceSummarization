on-terminal alignments in A must be one-to-one.
    In order to exclude undesirable structures, we only allow 5e whose dependency structure D is well-formed, which we will define below.
    In addition, the same well-formedness requirement will be applied to partial decoding results.
    Thus, we will be able to employ shared structures to merge multiple partial results.
    Based on the results in previous work (DeNeefe et al., 2007), we want to keep two kinds of dependency structures.
    In one kind, we keep dependency trees with a sub-root, where all the children of the sub-root are complete.
    We call them fixed dependency structures because the head is known or fixed.
    In the other, we keep dependency structures of sibling nodes of a common head, but the head itself is unspecified or floating.
    Each of the siblings must be a complete constituent.
    We call them floating dependency structures.
    Floating structures can represent many linguistically meaningful non-constituent structures: for e
