  Often we are not interested in all parses of an alnbiguous input string, neither in their exact probabilities, but only in which parse is the preferred parse.
  Thus we would like to have a strategy fllat estimates file top of the probability hierarchy of parses.
  "llais call be achieved by using Monte Carlo techniques (see e.g.
  [Hammersley 1964]): we estimate the preferred parse by taking random samples frotn the space of possibilities.
  This will give us a more effective approach dian exhaustively calculating the probabilities.
  Discussion Although DOP has not yet been tested thoroughly 2, we call already predict sonic of its capabilities.
  In DOP, the probability of a parse depends on all tuples of coustructious that generate that parse.
  ~lhe more different ways in which a parse can be generated, the lligher its probability.
  This implies that a parse which can (also) be generated by relatively large constructions is favoured over a parse which can only be generated by relatively small constr
