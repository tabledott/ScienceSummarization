e used thesesampling algorithms to infer morphological analy ses of Sesotho verbs given their strings (a task on which the standard Maximum Likelihood estimatorreturns a trivial and linguistically uninteresting so lution), achieving 0.75 unlabeled morpheme f-score and 0.54 exact word match accuracy.
			Thus this is one of the few cases we are aware of in which a PCFG estimation procedure returns linguistically meaningful structure.
			We attribute this to the ability of the Bayesian prior to prefer sparse grammars.We expect that these algorithms will be of inter est to the computational linguistics community both because a Bayesian approach to PCFG estimation ismore flexible than the Maximum Likelihood meth ods that currently dominate the field (c.f., the use of a prior as a bias towards sparse solutions), and because these techniques provide essential building blocks for more complex models.
