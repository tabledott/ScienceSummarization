ses an update equation to reestimate the probability of an object label based on its previous probability estimate and the features of its neighborhood.
			The algorithm stops when the global label assignment stays constant over multiple consecutive iterations.We employ relaxation labeling for the following rea sons: a) it has been extensively used in computer-vision with good results b) its formalism allows for many typesof constraints on label assignments to be used simulta neously.
			As mentioned before, constraints are integratedinto the algorithm as neighborhood features which influ ence the assignment of a particular label to a particular object.
			OPINE uses the following sources of constraints: 342 a) conjunctions and disjunctions in the review textb) manually-supplied syntactic dependency rule templates (see Table 5).
			The templates are automatically instantiated by our system with different dependency re lationships (premodifier, postmodifier, subject, etc.) in order to obtain syntactic dependen
