fully, the positions of the SB and EB are restricted as follows: SB: We examine head-dependent relations in a series of bunsetsus from the first bunsetsu in a sentence to the KB.
    If there exists a bunsetsu in that range whose head is not found, the analysis must fail for a CS whose pre-conjunct contains this bunsetsu.
    Therefore, the SB is restricted to be to the right of this bunsetsu.
    EB: We examine head-dependent relations in all series of bunsetsus that can be a post-conjunct.
    If the analysis of a certain series of bunsetsus fails, the last bunsetsu of this series cannot become an EB of a new CS.
    After reanalysis of the CS, the analysis returns to the reduction of a sentence by checking the relations between all pairs of CSs.
    An example of redetecting a CS is shown in Figure 18.
  
  
    We report the results of analyzing 150 test sentences, which are different from the 30 training sentences used in the parameter adjustment, to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.
