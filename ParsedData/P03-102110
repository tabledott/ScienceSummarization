escribe a new algorithm for efficient line optimization of the unsmoothed error count (Eq.
    5) using a log-linear model (Eq.
    3) which is guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
    The new algorithm is much faster and more stable than the grid-based line optimization method.
    Computing the most probable sentence out of a set of candidate translation (see Eq.
    6) along a line with parameter results in an optimization problem of the following functional form: Here, and are constants with respect to .
    Hence, every candidate translation in corresponds to a line.
    The function is piecewise linear (Papineni, 1999).
    This allows us to compute an efficient exhaustive representation of that function.
    In the following, we sketch the new algorithm to optimize Eq.
    5: We compute the ordered sequence of linear intervals constituting for every sentence together with the incremental change in error count from the previous to the next interval.
    Hence, we obtain for every sentence a sequence
