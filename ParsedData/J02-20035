on of how to determine a suitable level of generalization in the hierarchy.
    Li and Abe use the minimum description length principle to obtain a level of generalization, and Resnik uses a simple technique based on a statistical measure of selectional preference.
    (The work by Ribas builds on that by Resnik, and the work by McCarthy builds on that by Li and Abe.)
    We compare our estimation method with those of Resnik and Li and Abe, using a pseudo-disambiguation task.
    Our method outperforms these alternatives on the pseudo-disambiguation task, and an analysis of the results shows that the generalization methods of Resnik and Li and Abe appear to be overgeneralizing, at least for this task.
    Note that the problem being addressed here is the engineering problem of estimating predicate argument probabilities, with the aim of producing estimates that will be useful for NLP applications.
    In particular, we are not addressing the problem of acquiring selectional restrictions in the way this is usu
