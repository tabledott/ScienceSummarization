ments not reported here, we found that taking into account the brevity penalty at the sentence level can cause large fluctuations in lattice MBR performance on different test sets.
    We therefore treat only cns as variables.
    The corpus log BLEU gain is approximated by a first-order vector Taylor series expansion about the initial values of cn. where the partial derivatives are given by where each &#916;cn = c0n &#8722; cn counts the statistic in the sentence of interest, rather than the corpus as a whole.
    This score is therefore a linear function in counts of words &#916;c0 and n-gram matches &#916;cn.
    Our approach ignores the count clipping present in the exact BLEU score where a correct n-gram present once in the reference but several times in the hypothesis will be counted only once as correct.
    Such an approach is also followed in Dreyer et al. (2007).
    Using the above first-order approximation to gain in log corpus BLEU, Equation 9 implies that &#952;0, &#952;w from Section 3 would ha
