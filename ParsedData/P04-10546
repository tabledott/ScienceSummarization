task of feature engineering &#8211; searching for the optimal feature set either manually by consulting domain experts or automatically through feature induction and selection (Scott and Matwin, 1999).
    For example, in entity detection the original instance representation is generally a word vector corresponding to a sentence.
    Feature extraction and induction may result in features such as part-ofspeech, word n-grams, character n-grams, capitalization, and conjunctions of these features.
    In the case of more structured objects, such as parse trees, features may include some description of the object&#8217;s structure, such as &#8220;has an NP-VP subtree.&#8221; Kernel methods can be particularly effective at reducing the feature engineering burden for structured objects.
    By calculating the similarity between two objects, kernel methods can employ dynamic programming solutions to efficiently enumerate over substructures that would be too costly to explicitly include as features.
