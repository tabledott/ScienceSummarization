ts, because is a number between 1 and .
    The total description length for all the segment lengths is thus bits.3 Generally speaking, takes a large value when the number of segments is small.
    On the other hand, takes a large value when the number of segments is large.
    If only is used to segment the text, then the resulting segmentation will have too many segments.
    By using both and , we can get a reasonable number of segments.
  
  
    To find the maximum-probability segmentation , we first define the cost of segmentation as 2&#8216;Log&#8217; denotes the logarithm to the base 2.
    3We have used as before.
    But we use in this paper, because it is easily interpreted as a description length and the experimental results obtained by using are slightly better than those obtained by using .
    An anonymous reviewer suggests using a Poisson distribution whose parameter is , the average length of a segment (in words), as prior probability.
    We leave it for future work to compare the suitabilit
