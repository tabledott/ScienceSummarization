    This program differs from earlier work in its almost complete lack of hand-crafting, relying instead on a very small corpus of Penn Wall Street Journal Tree-bank text (Marcus et al., 1993) that has been marked with co-reference information.
    The first sections of this paper describe this program: the probabilistic model behind it, its implementation, and its performance.
    The second half of the paper describes a method for using (portions of) the aforementioned program to learn automatically the typical gender of English words, information that is itself used in the pronoun resolution program.
    In particular, the scheme infers the gender of a referent from the gender of the pronouns that refer to it and selects referents using the pronoun anaphora program.
    We present some typical results as well as the more rigorous results of a blind evaluation of its output.
  
  
    There are many factors, both syntactic and semantic, upon which a pronoun resolution system relies.
