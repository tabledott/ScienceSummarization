ay in which traditional generative grammar and contemporary probabilistic grammar formalism can be understood as complementing each other.
    I, at least, take it in that way, and this paper is offered in that spirit.
  
  
    Since what we are really interested in computing is not the minimum description length as such, but rather the difference between the description length of one model and that of a variant, it is convenient to consider the general form of the difference between two MDL computations.
    In general, let us say we will compare two analyses Si and S2 for the same corpus, where S2 typically contains some item(s) that Si does not (or they may differ by where they break a string into factors).
    Let us write out the difference in length between these two analyses, as in (7)&#8212;(11), calculating the length of Si minus the length of S2.
    The general formulas derived in (7)&#8212;(11) are not of direct computational interest; they serve rather as a template that can be filled in to comp
