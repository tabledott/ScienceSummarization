rfect coerce the culminated process to become a culmination.
    The transition network allows this to happen if the entire event of climbing Mt.
    Everest is treated as a single unit by making it a point, so that it can become a culmination in its own right.
    The perfect then delivers a rather different kind of consequent state.
    A process like work in the garden can be coerced by a perfect auxiliary in essentially the same way: the process of working, possibly associated with a culmination point, is treated as a single unit.
    This pointlike entity can then be used as the starting point for the construction of a new nucleus, by treating it as a culmination in its own right, provided that there are associated consequences.
    As a result, a question like 24 can only be used felicitously if John's working in the garden was (for example) part of a prearranged plan, or a particular task John had to finish before something else could happen: 24.
