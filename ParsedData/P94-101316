o build a full part of speech tagger for Spanish would be quite costly (and require special tagged corpora).
    The current approach uses just the information available in dictionaries, exploiting only that which is useful for the accent restoration task.
    Were dictionaries not available, a productive approximation could have been made using the associational distributions of suffixes (such as -aba, -aste, -amos) which are often satisfactory indicators of part of speech in morphologically rich languages such as Spanish.
    The use of the word-class and part-of-speech data is illustrated below, with the example of distinguishing terrninaralterminard (a subjunctive/future tense ambiguity): The collocations most strongly indicative of a particular pattern will have the largest log-likelihood.
    Sorting by this value will list the strongest and most reliable evidence first6.
    Evidence sorted in the above manner will yield a decision list like the following, highly abbreviated example7: The resulting dec
