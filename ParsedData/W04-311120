d part-of-speech annotating.
    While both aspects are similar to those used for the Penn Treebank, there are some differences, partly alluded to in Section 3.
    Tokens are somewhat more fine-grained than in the Penn Treebank, so that H-ras, e.g., would consist of three tokens: H, -, and ras.
    Tokenized and part-of-speech annotated files are then sent to the entity annotators, either for oncology or CYP, depending on which domain the abstract has been chosen for.
    The entities described in Section 2 are annotated at this step.
    We are using WordFreak, a Java-based linguistic annotation tool5, for annotation of tokenization, POS, and entities.
    Figure 3 is a screen shot of the oncology domain annotation, here showing a variation relation being created out of component entities for type and location.
    In parallel with the entity annotation, a file is treebanked - i.e., annotated for its syntactic structure.
    Note that this is done independently of the entity annotation.
    This is because
