 not provide separate precision and recall numbers.
    However we can see that the Medline self-trained parser achieves an f-score of 84.3%, which is an absolute reduction in error of 4.1%.
    This corresponds to an error rate reduction of 20% over the L/C baseline.
  
  
    Prior to the above experiment on the test data, we did several preliminary experiments on development data from the Genia Treebank.
    These results are summarized in Figure 2.
    Here we show the f-score for four versions of the parser as a function of number of self-training sentences.
    The dashed line on the bottom is the raw C/J parser with no self-training.
    At 80.4, it is clearly the worst of the lot.
    On the other hand, it is already better than the 80.2% best previous result for biomedical data.
    This is solely due to the introduction of the 50-best reranker which distinguishes the C/J parser from the preceding Charniak parser.
    The almost flat line above it is the C/J parser with NANC self-training data.
