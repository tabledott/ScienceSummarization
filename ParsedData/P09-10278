    In particular, several previous studies focus on the problem of cross-lingual text classification, which can be considered as a special case of general cross-domain text classification.
    Bel et al. (2003) present practical and cost-effective solutions.
    A few novel models have been proposed to address the problem, e.g. the EM-based algorithm (Rigutini et al., 2005), the information bottleneck approach (Ling et al., 2008), the multilingual domain models (Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2005), etc.
    To the best of our knowledge, cotraining has not yet been investigated for crossdomain or cross-lingual text classification.
  
  
    The purpose of our approach is to make use of the annotated English corpus for sentiment polarity identification of Chinese reviews in a supervised framework, without using any Chinese resources.
    Given the labeled English reviews and unlabeled Chinese reviews, two straightforward methods for addressing the problem are as follows: 1) We first learn a class
