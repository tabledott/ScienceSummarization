ature f: This is for the case of a confusion set of two words, w1 and w2.
    It can be shown that this metric produces the identical ranking of features as the following somewhat simpler metric, provided p(wilf)&gt; 0 for all i:5 As an example of using the metric, suppose f is the context word arid, and suppose that arid cooccurs 10 times with desert and 1 time with dessert in the training corpus.
    Then reliability/(f) max(10/11, 1/11) = 10/11 = 0.909.
    This value measures the extent to which the presence of the feature is unambiguously correlated with one particular w. It can be thought of as the feature's reliability at picking out that wi from the others in the confusion set. collocation.
    The bottom line of the table shows the number of collocations learned, averaged over all confusion sets, also as a function of e. One peculiar property of the reliability metric is that it ignores the prior probabilities of the words in the confusion set.
    For instance, in the arid example, it would award th
