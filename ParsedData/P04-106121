ose, and might therefore be put into the same class.
    Clark (2001) and Klein and Manning (2002) show that this approach can be successfully used for discovering syntactic constituents as well.
    However, as one might expect, it is easier to cluster word sequences (or word class sequences) than to tell how to put them together into trees.
    In particular, if one is given all contiguous subsequences (subspans) from a corpus of sentences, most natural clusters will not represent valid constituents (to the extent that constituency of a non-situated sequence is even a well-formed notion).
    For example, it is easy enough to discover that DET N and DET ADJ N are similar and that V PREP DET and V PREP DET ADJ are similar, but it is much less clear how to discover that the former pair are generally constituents while the latter pair are generally not.
    In Klein and Manning (2002), we proposed a constituent-context model (CCM) which solves this problem by building constituency decisions directly into the d
