    Humans are able to quickly judge the relative semantic relatedness of pairs of concepts.
    For example, most would agree that feather is more related to bird than it is to tree.
    This ability to assess the semantic relatedness among concepts is important for Natural Language Understanding.
    Consider the following sentence: He swung the bat, hitting the ball into the stands.
    A reader likely uses domain knowledge of sports along with the realization that the baseball senses of hitting, bat, ball and stands are all semantically related, in order to determine that the event being described is a baseball game.
    Consequently, a number of techniques have been proposed over the years, that attempt to automatically compute the semantic relatedness of concepts to correspond closely with human judgments (Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Lin, 1998; Leacock and Chodorow, 1998).
    It has also been shown that these techniques prove useful for task
