cause our constraint to rule out approximately 54% of the training set.
    Thus, the reduced size of the usable training set accounts for some of the degraded performance of OEM relative to OH.
    However, the results in figure 1 of the following section show that OEM trained on twice as much data as OH still underperforms the heuristic, indicating a larger issue than decreased training set size.
    To test the relative performance of OEM and OH, we evaluated each using an end-to-end translation system from English to French.
    We chose this nonstandard translation direction so that the examples in this paper would be more accessible to a primarily English-speaking audience.
    All training and test data were drawn from the French/English section of the Europarl sentence-aligned corpus.
    We tested on the first 1,000 unique sentences of length 5 to 15 in the corpus and trained on sentences of length 1 to 60 starting after the first 10,000.
    The system follows the structure proposed in the documenta
