n F1 score is over 6 points higher than the score of the second system in Table 13.
    The system of Henderson et al. (2008), which was designed for joint learning of the complete task, improves its rank from eighth to fifth compared to the official results (Table 10).
    Table 14 shows the unlabeled F1 scores for prediction of nonprojective syntactic dependencies.
    Since nonprojectivity is quite rare, many teams chose to ignore this issue.
    The table shows only those systems that submitted well-formed dependency trees, and whose output contained at least one nonprojective link.
    The small number of nonprojective links in the training set makes it hard to learn to predict such links, and this is also reflected in the figures.
    In general, the figures for nonprojective wh-movements and split clauses are higher, and they are also the most common types.
    Also, they are detectable by fairly simple patterns, such as the presence of a wh-word or a pair of commas.
