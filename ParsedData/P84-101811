roperty of FDs that no attribute should figure more than once in any conjunct, though a given attribute may appear in feature lists that are themselves the values of different attributes.
    This being the case, it is always possible to identify a given conjunct or disjunct in a FD by giving a sequence of attributes (al.
    &#8226; &#8226;ak). al is a attribute in the FD whose value, v1, is another FD.
    The attribute a2 is an attribute in vi whose value if an FD, and so on.
    Sequences of attributes of this kind are referred to as paths.
    If the FD contains disjuncts, then the value identified by the path will naturally also be a disjunct.
    We sometimes write a path as the value of an attribute to indicate that that value of that attribute is not only eaqual to the value identified by the path but that these values are one and the same, inshort, that they are unified in a sense soon to be explained.
    Roughly, if more information were acquired about one of the values so that more features were
