n that hypernym hierarchies of nouns can be constructed automatically from text with similar performance to semantic lexicons built automatically for hand-selected hypernyms.
    With the addition of some improvements we have identified, we believe that these automatic methods can be used to construct truly useful hierarchies.
    Since the hierarchy is learned from sample text, it could be trained on domainspecific text to create a hierarchy that is more applicable to a particular domain than a general-purpose resource such as WordNet.
