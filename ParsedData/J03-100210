    In Section 3, we describe the training of the alignment models and present a new training schedule that yields significantly better results.
    In addition, we describe how to deal with overfitting, deficient models, and very small or very large training corpora.
    In Section 4, we present some heuristic methods for improving alignment quality by performing a symmetrization of word alignments.
    In Section 5, we describe an evaluation methodology for word alignment methods dealing with the ambiguities associated with the word alignment annotation based on generalized precision and recall measures.
    In Section 6, we present a systematic comparison of the various statistical alignment models with regard to alignment quality and translation quality.
    We assess the effect of training corpora of various sizes and the use of a conventional bilingual dictionary.
    In the literature, it is often claimed that the refined alignment mo
