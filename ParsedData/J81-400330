operties of the resulting systems are far from evident, and practical difficulties, because they lead to obscure grammars and prevent the use of any reasonable parsing algorithm.
    DCGs, although they provide the basic machinery for a clear description of languages and their structures, lack a mechanism to describe simply left extraposition and the associated restrictions.
    MGs can express the rewrite of several symbols in a single rule, but the symbols must be contiguous, as in a type-0 grammar rule.
    This is still not enough to describe left extraposition without complicating the rest of the grammar.
    XGs are an answer to those limitations.
    An XG has the same fundamental property as a DCG, that it is no more than a convenient notation for the clauses of an ordinary logic program.
    XGs and their translation into definite clauses have been designed to meet three requirements: (i) to be a principled extension of DCGs, which can be interpreted as a grammar formalism independently of its transl
