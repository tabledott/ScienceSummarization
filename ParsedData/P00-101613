em as a function of time.
    Figure 2 shows the rule list constructed by one of the subjects.
    The quantitative results of the rule-writing experiments are presented in the next section.
  
  
    This section will analyze and compare the performance of systems constructed with hand-built rules with systems that were trained from data selected during real-time active learning.
    The performance of Ramshaw &amp; Marcus' system trained on the annotations of each subject in the real-time active learning experiments, and the performance achieved by the manually constructed systems of the top 6 rule writers are shown in Figures 3 and 4, depicting the performance achieved by each individual system.
    The x-axes show the time spent by each human subject (either annotating or writing rules) in minutes; the y-axes show the f-measure performance achieved by the systems built using the given level of supervision.
    It is important to note that when comparing the curves in Figure 4, experimental conditions acro
