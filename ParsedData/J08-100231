to feature forests, because they over-generate possible unpacked trees.
    6 For ease of explanation, the definition of the root node is different from the original definition given in Section 3.
    In this section, we define R as a set of conjunctive nodes rather than a single node r. The definition here is translated into the original definition by introducing a dummy root node r' that has no features and only one disjunctive daughter whose daughters are R. Feature forest representation of HPSG parse trees in Figure 12. changing the model.
    Actually, we successfully developed a probabili stic model including features on nonlocalpredicate&#8211;argument dependencies, as described subsequently.
    Locality: In each step of composition of structure, only a limited depth of the structures are referred to.
    That is, local structures in the deep descendent phrases maybe ignored to construct larger phrases.
