enmaier (2003a).
    For example, adding long-range dependency features to the log-linear model is straightforward.
    We also showed in Clark and Curran (2004b) that, in contrast with Hockenmaier (2003a), adding distance to the dependency features in the log-linear model does improve parsing accuracy.
    Another feature of conditional log-linear models is that they are trained discriminatively, by maximizing the conditional probability of each gold-standard parse relative to the incorrect parses for the sentence.
    Generative models, in contrast, are typically trained by maximizing the joint probability of the (training sentence, parse) pairs, even though the sentence does not need to be inferred.
    The treebank used in this article performs two roles: It provides the lexical category set used by the supertagger, plus some unary type-changing rules and punctuation rules used by the parser, and it is used as training data for the statistical models.
    The treebank is CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman
