  Stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars And Bilingual Parsing Of Parallel Corpora
  
    Technology introduce (1) a novel inversion transduction formalism bilingual modeling of sentence-pairs, and (2) the concept of parsing a variety of parallel corpus analysis applications.
    Aside from the bilingual orientation, three major features distinguish the formalism from the finite-state transducers more traditionally found in computational linguistics: it skips directly to a context-free rather than finite-state base, it permits a minimal extra degree of ordering flexibility, and its probabilistic formulation admits an efficient maximum-likelihood bilingual parsing algorithm.
    A convenient normal form is shown to exist.
    Analysis of the formalism's expressiveness suggests that it is particularly well suited to modeling ordering shifts between languages, balancing needed flexibility against complexity constraints.
    We discuss a number of examples of how stochastic inversion transduction grammars br
