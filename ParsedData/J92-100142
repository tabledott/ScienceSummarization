s word senses specific to a context, such as a domain, a situation, or a collocation.
    In most cases this approach helps reduce the amount of ambiguity.
    The approach is compatible with evidence discussed by Simpson and Burgess (1988) that The lexical entry for the verb agree.
    &amp;quot;multiple meanings are activated in frequency-coded order&amp;quot; and that low-frequency senses are handled by a second retrieval process that accumulates evidence for those senses and activates them as necessary.
    Once the system determines the morphological analysis of each word, the next step in preprocessing is to try to determine the correct part of speech for the word.
    Our system uses a tagging program, written by Uri Zernik (1990), that takes information about the root, affix, and possible syntactic category for each word and applies stochastic techniques to select a syntactic tag for each word.
    Stochastic taggers look at small groups of words and pick the most likely assignment of tags, determined
