rs, but none had any formal linguistics training.
    The initial training set T is the first 100 sentences of Ramshaw &amp; Marcus' training set.
    To acquaint the subjects with the Treebank conventions, they were first asked to spend some time in a feedback phase, where they would annotate up to 50 sentences (they were allowed to stop at any time) drawn from the initial 100 sentences in T. The sentences were annotated one at a time, and the Treebank annotation was shown to them after every sentence.
    On average, the annotators spent around 15 minutes on this feedback phase before deciding that they were comfortable enough with the convention.
    The active learning phase follows the feedback phase.
    The f-complement disagreement measure was used to select 50 sentences from the rest of Ramshaw &amp; Marcus' training set and the annotator was instructed to annotate them.
    The annotated sentences were then sent back to the server.
    The system chose the next 50 sentences.
