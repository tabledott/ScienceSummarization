ate algorithm p(z|xi, yi; 0) is computationally efficient and, as we will see, O &lt;-- O + O(xi, z*) &#8212; O(xi, z') works well in practice. end if Our first modification is to do online learning end for instead of optimizing the full objective.
    Define the end for feature sums O(x, z) = Ej O(xj, zj) which range Return O over the sentences, as indexed by j.
