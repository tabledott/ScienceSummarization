    We ran linear E-insensitive support vector regression using Joachims&#8217; SVM&amp;quot;ght package (1999) with all default parameters.
    The continuous prediction on a test document is discretized for classification.
    Regression results are reported under the heading &#8216;reg.&#8217; Note this method does not use unlabeled data for training.
    We ran Pang and Lee&#8217;s method based on metric labeling, using SVM regression as the initial label preference function.
    The method requires an itemsimilarity function, which is equivalent to our similarity measure wij.
    Among others, we experimented with PSP-based similarity.
    For consistency with (Pang and Lee, 2005), supervised metric labeling results with this measure are reported under &#8216;reg+PSP.&#8217; Note this method does not use unlabeled data for training either.
    PSPi is defined in (Pang and Lee, 2005) as the percentage of positive sentences in review xi.
    The similarity between reviews xi, xj is the cosine
