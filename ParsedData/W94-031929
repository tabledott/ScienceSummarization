only arise, however, if the results of engineering analyses are reported in the research literature, especially when they suggest going against some theoretical principle.
    Unfortunately, to date the results of such analyses have all-too-often been regarded more as embarrassments (since they contradict theory) than as valuable observations, and hence have not been published.
    I would like to conclude this paper by encouraging generation researchers to regard the results of engineering analyses to be as interesting and as important to the understanding of language as conventional linguistic analyses.
    After all, as Woods [1975] has pointed out, while descriptive analyses of language can at best tell us what the brain does, engineering analyses can potentially offer insights on why the brain functions as it does.
