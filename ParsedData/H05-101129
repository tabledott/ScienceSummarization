l, along with fea 87 tures incorporating part-of-speech information, and whether the aligned words are given as translations in a bilingual dictionary.
			The log-linear model is trained by standard maximum-entropy methods.Klein and Taskar (2005), in a tutorial on maximum margin methods for natural-language processing, described a weighted linear model incorporat ing association, position, and orthography features,with its parameters trained by a structured-supportvector-machine method.
			This model is in some respects very similar to our LLR-based model, us ing Dice coefficient association scores where we use LLR scores, and absolute position differences where we use nonmonotonicity measures.
	
	
			The results of our work and other recent efforts on discriminatively trained alignment models showthat results comparable to or better than those ob tained with the IBM models are possible within aframework that makes it easy to add arbitrary ad ditional features.
