    Why are the precision scores so low?
    Compared with previous work that manually select entity types for expansion, such as countries and companies, our work is the first to evaluate over a large set of randomly selected entity types.
    On just the countries class, our R-Precision was 0.816 using Web100.
    The following sections analyze the effects of various expansion variables: corpus size, corpus quality, seed size, and seed quality.
    Not surprisingly, corpus size and quality have a significant impact on expansion performance.
    Figure 2 and Table 3 quantify this expectation.
    On our Web crawl corpora, we observe that the full 200+ billion token crawl (Web100) has an average Rprecision 13% higher than 1/5th of the crawl (Web020) and 53% higher than 1/25th of the crawl.
    Figure 2 also illustrates that throughout the full precision/recall curve, Web100 significantly outperforms Web020, which in turn significantly outperforms Web004.
