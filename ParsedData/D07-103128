 the hope of improving the 1-to-1 accuracy of the high-frequency tags.
			As Table 1 shows, this markedly improves both the 1-to-1 accuracy and the VI score.
			A 25-state HMM estimated by EM performs effectively as wellas the best VB model in terms of both 1-to-1 accu racy and VI score, and runs 4 times faster because it has only half the number of hidden states.
			6 Conclusion and future work.
			This paper studied why EM seems to do so badly in HMM estimation for unsupervised POS tagging.
			In fact, we found that it doesn?t do so badly at all: thebitag HMM estimated by EM achieves a mean 1-to 1 tagging accuracy of 40%, which is approximately the same as the 41.3% reported by (Haghighi and Klein, 2006) for their sophisticated MRF model.
			Then we noted the distribution of words to hidden states found by EM is relatively uniform, comparedto the distribution of words to POS tags in the eval uation corpus.
			This provides an explanation of why the many-to-1 accuracy of EM is so high while the 1-to-1 accura
