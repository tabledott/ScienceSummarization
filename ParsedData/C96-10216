listing of all noun phrases, reduced to modifier-head sequences.
			This data set is obtained by means of a phrasal grammar whose patterns characterize the composition of a noun phrase (NP) in terms of possible token sequences.
			The output of NP identification is a set of token/feature matrix/offset sequences, where offset value is deter- mined by the offset of the first token in the sequence.
			The offset indicates the position of the NP in the text, and so provides crucial information about precedence relations.
			A secondary data set consists of observations about the syntactic ontexts in which the NPs identified by the phrasal grammar appear.
			These observations are derived using a set of patterns designed to detect nom- inal sequences in two subordinate syntactic environ- ments: containment in an adverbial adjunct and con- tainment in an NP (i.e., containment in a prepositional or clausal complement of a noun, or containment in a relative clause).
			This is accomplished by running a set of pattern
