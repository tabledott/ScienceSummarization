 individual binary classifiers is measured with accuracy resp.
    F1-measure.
    To collect statistically significant information, we run 10-fold cross validation on the 6,000 questions.
    Question classification results Table 1 shows the accuracy of different question representations on the UIUC split (Column 1) and the average accuracy &#177; the corresponding confidence limit (at 90% significance) on the cross validation splits (Column 2).
    (i) The TK on PT and the linear kernel on BOW produce a very high result, i.e. about 90.5%.
    This is higher than the best outcome derived in (Zhang and Lee, 2003), i.e.
    90%, obtained with a kernel combining BOW and PT on the same data.
    Combined with PT, BOW reaches 91.8%, very close to the 92.5% accuracy reached in (Li and Roth, 2005) using complex semantic information from external resources.
    (ii) The PAS feature provides no improvement.
    This is mainly because at least half of the training and test questions only contain the predicate &#8220;t
