rosheva et al., 2004), an extension of LDA that simultaneously models two sets of distributions for each topic.
    These two sets represent the two arguments for the relations.
    Thus, LDA-SP is able to capture information about the pairs of topics that commonly co-occur.
    This information is very helpful in guiding inference.
    We run LDA-SP to compute preferences on a massive dataset of binary relations r(a1, a2) extracted from the Web by TEXTRUNNER (Banko and Etzioni, 2008).
    Our experiments demonstrate that LDA-SP significantly outperforms state of the art approaches obtaining an 85% increase in recall at precision 0.9 on the standard pseudodisambiguation task.
    Additionally, because LDA-SP is based on a formal probabilistic model, it has the advantage that it can naturally be applied in many scenarios.
    For example, we can obtain a better understanding of similar relations (Table 1), filter out incorrect inferences based on querying our model (Section 4.3), as well as produce a repositor
