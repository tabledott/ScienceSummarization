NP, while (11.2) is read as a conjunction of three individual NPs, with structures as indicated by (11.1a,2a).
    We assume here, crucially, that constituents in coordination are all attached to the same constituent; they can be thought of as &amp;quot;stacking&amp;quot; in a plane orthogonal to the standard referent, as (Chomsky 821 suggests.
    The conjunction itself is attached to the rightmost of the coordinate structures.
    (11.2a) They sell [Np ripe cheese], tNP bread], [Np and cherries from local orchards].
    (11.3) They sell ripe N 1, N2, and N3 from local orchards.
    Thus, it would seem that to determine the level at which the structures are conjoined requires much pragmatic knowledge about fruit, flowers and the like.
    Note also that while (11.1-2) have particular primary readings, one needs to consider these sentences carefully to decide what the primary reading is.
    This is suggestive of the kind of syntactic vagueness that VanLehn argues characterizes many judgements of quantifier s
