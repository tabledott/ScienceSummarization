ample of the application of Earley Deduction to parsing, corresponding to the chart of Figure 1. corresponds to the following definite-clause program: The lexical categories of the sentence 0Agatha1's2husband3hit4Ulrich5 can be represented by the unit clauses n(0,1). g-en(1,2). n(2,3). n(4,5).
    Thus, the task of determining whether (26) is a sentence can be represented by the goal statement ans s(0.5).
    (:32) If the sentence is in the language, the unit clause ans will he derived in the course of an Earley Deduction proof.
    Such a proof could proceed as follows: 5(0,5). ans.
    Note how subsumption is used to curtail the left recursion of rules (21) and (22), by stopping extraneous instantiation steps from the derived clauses (35) and (36).
    As we have seen in the example of the previous section, this mechanism is a general one, capable of handling complex grammar symbols within certain constraints that will be discussed later.
    The Earley Deduction derivation given above corresponds directly
