bol + specifies that there must be a se,querire of one anniore characters, each belonging to the character set abbreviated by A.
    Double quotes indicate literal character symbols.
    The right-hand side of the rule gives the C code to be executed when an input string matches the regular expression.
    When the Flex rule matches the input address-I-8_1V, for example, the C function np_vord_form (defined elsewhere in the generator) is called to determine the word form corresponding to the input: the function deletes the inflection type and PoS label specifications and the delimiters, removes the last character of the lemma, and finally attaches the characters es; the word form generated is thus addresses.
    Of course not all plural noun inflections are correctly generated by the rule in (1) since there are many irregularities and subregularities.
    These are dealt with using additional, more specific, rules.
    The order in which these rules are applied to the input follows exactly the order in which
