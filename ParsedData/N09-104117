ries in order to train a sentence ranking system which discriminatively maximizes ROUGE scores.
    PYTHY uses several features to rank sentences including several variations of the SUMBASIC score (see section 3.1).
    At DUC 2007, PYTHY was ranked first overall in automatic ROUGE evaluation and fifth in manual content judgments.
    As PYTHY utilizes a sentence simplification component, which we do not, we also compare against PYTHY without sentence simplification.
    ROUGE results comparing variants of HIERSUM and PYTHY are given in table 3.
    The HIERSUM system as described in section 3.4 yields 7.3 R-2 without stop words, falling significantly short of the 8.7 that PYTHY without simplification yields.
    Note that R-2 is a measure of bigram recall and HIERSUM does not represent bigrams whereas PYTHY includes several bigram and higher order n-gram statistics.
    In order to put HIERSUM and PYTHY on equalfooting with respect to R-2, we instead ran HIERSUM with each sentence consisting of a bag of bigr
