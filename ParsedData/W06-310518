euristic heuristic parameterization OH.6 Notice also that the Learned translation probabilities from heuristic extraction are non-deterministic.
    On the other hand, the translation system makes a significant lexical error on this sim&gt; 2 ple sentence when parameterized by OEM: the use of caract&#180;erise in this context is incorrect.
    This error arises from a sharply peaked distribution over English phrases for caract&#180;erise.
    This example illustrates a recurring problem: errors do not necessarily arise because a correct translation is not available.
    Notice that a preferable translation of degree as degr&#180;e is available under both parameterizations.
    Degr&#180;e is not used, however, because of the peaked distribution of a competing translation candidate.
    In this way, very high probability translations can effectively block the use of more appropriate translations at decoding time.
    What is furthermore surprising and noteworthy in this example is that the learned, near-determ
