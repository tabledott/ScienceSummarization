f linguistic knowledge &#8212; syntax, coreference resolution, and salience &#8212; which play a prominent role in Centering analyses of discourse coherence.
    An additional motivation for our study is exploration of the trade-off between robustness and richness of linguistic annotations.
    NLP tools are typically trained on human-authored texts, and may deteriorate in performance when applied to automatically generated texts with coherence violations.
    Syntax To evaluate the effect of syntactic knowledge, we eliminated the identification of grammatical relations from our grid computation and recorded solely whether an entity is present or absent in a sentence.
    This leaves only the coreference and salience information in the model, and the results are shown in Table 4 under (Coreference+Salience).
    The omission of syntactic information causes a uniform drop in performance on both tasks, which confirms its importance for coherence analysis.
    Coreference To measure the effect of fullyfledged co
