as anaphoric same-head by the system, the antecedent was a definite NF.
    According to the annotation of one of our coders (not the system's output), the 312 anaphoric descriptions were grouped in 164 coreference chains and 86 of these chains were initiated by definite descriptions.
    In Figure 5, the results reported by the system are compared with the standard annotation.
    The figure also shows how descriptions which were not resolved by the system were classified in the standard annotation.
    Most of the descriptions not classified by the system were bridging descriptions.
    The overall precision and recall results of Version 1 of the system are shown in Table 18.
    Note that because a large number of definite descriptions are not classified, the overall recall is only 59%, even though the recall for both anaphoric and discoursenew descriptions is much higher.
    Test Data.
    Next, the system was evaluated using the test data, Corpus 2, which had not been used to develop the heuristics.
