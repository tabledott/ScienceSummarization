n 4) by restricting the maximum order of the n-grams in the procedure.
    The results (Table 5) show that on aren, there is no degradation if we limit the maximum order of the n-grams to 3.
    However, on zhen/enzh, there is improvement by considering 4-grams.
    We can therefore reduce Lattice MBR computations in aren.
  
  
    We have presented a procedure for performing Minimum Bayes-Risk Decoding on translation lattices.
    This is a significant development in that the MBR decoder operates over a very large number of translations.
    In contrast, the current N-best implementation of MBR can be scaled to, at most, a few thousands of hypotheses.
    If the number of hypotheses is greater than, say 20,000, the N-best MBR becomes computationally expensive.
    The lattice MBR technique is efficient when performed over enormous number of hypotheses (up to 1080) since it takes advantage of the compact structure of the lattice.
    Lattice MBR gives consistent improvements in translation performance over N
