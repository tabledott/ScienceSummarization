			Table 13 compares the argument classification accuracies of various systems, and at various levels of classification granularity, and parse accuracy.
			It can be seen that the SVM System performs significantly better than all the other systems on all PropBank arguments.

			Table 14 shows the results for the task where the system first identifies candidate argument boundaries and then labels them with the most likely argument.
			This is the hardest of the three tasks outlined earlier.
