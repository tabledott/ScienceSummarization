ed multidocument summarization.16 Crucially however, Daum&#180;e III and Marcu (2006) selected sentences with the highest expected number of CONTENT words.17 We found that in our model using this extraction criterion yielded 5.3 R-2 without stop words, significantly underperforming our TOPICSUM model.
    One reason for this may be that Daum&#180;e III and Marcu (2006)&#8217;s criterion encourages selecting sentences which have words that are confidently generated by the CONTENT distribution, but not necessarily sentences which contain a plurality of it&#8217;s mass.
    TENT distribution by analytically integrating over &#966;C (Blei et al., 2003), doing so gave no benefit.
    Previous sections have treated the content of a document set as a single (perhaps learned) unigram distribution.
    However, as Barzilay and Lee (2004) observe, the content of document collections is highly structured, consisting of several topical themes, each with its own vocabulary and ordering preferences.
