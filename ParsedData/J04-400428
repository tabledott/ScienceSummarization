R-A, VP-A, g, and miscellaneous.
    The g indicates that a gap must be generated and is applicable only to Model 3.
    Miscellaneous items include all nonterminals that were marked as arguments in the training data that were not any of the other named types.
    There are rules for determining whether NPs, Ss, SBARs, and VPs are arguments, and the miscellaneous arguments occur as the result of the argument-finding rule for PPs, which states that the first non-PRN, non-part-of-speech tag that occurs after the head of a PP should be marked as an argument, and therefore nodes that are not one of the four named types can be marked.
    As mentioned above, after a head-child and its left and right subcats are generated, modifiers are generated from the head outward, as indicated by the modifier nonterminal indices in Figure 1.
    A fully lexicalized nonterminal has three components: the nonterminal label, the headword, and the headword&#8217;s part of speech.
    Fully lexicalized modifying nonterminals are gen
