 acquired from corpus analysis.
    As mentioned in the previous section, the power of a generative lexicon is that it takes much of the burden of semantic interpretation off of the verbal system by supplying a much richer semantics for nouns and adjectives.
    This makes the lexical structures ideal as an initial representation for knowledge acquisition and subsequent information retrieval tasks.
  
  
    A machine-readable dictionary provides the raw material from which to construct computationally useful representations of the generic vocabulary contained within it.
    The lexical structures discussed in the previous section are one example of how such information can be exploited.
    Many sublanguages, however, are poorly represented in on-line dictionaries, if represented at all.
    Vocabularies geared to specialized domains will be necessary for many applications, such as text categorization and information retrieval.
    The second area of our research program that we discuss is aimed at developin
