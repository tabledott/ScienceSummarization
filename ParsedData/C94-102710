 types, the tagging of a single word is performed by copying the tag probabilities of the current word and its neighbours into the input units, propagating the activations through the network to the output units and determining the output unit which has the highest activation.
  The tag correspond- ing to this unit is then attached to the current word.
  If the second strongest activation in the output layer is close to the strongest one, tile tag corresponding to the second strongest activation may be given as an alternative output.
  No additional computation is required for this.
  Further, it is possible to give a scored list of all tags as output.
  aThe output  act ivat ions  of the network do not necessar- ily sum to 1.
  Therefore,  they should not he interpreted as probabi l i t ies.
  40verlearning means  that  irrelevant features of the t ra in ing set are learned.
  As a result ,  the uetwork is unable to generalize.
