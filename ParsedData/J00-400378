above, we implemented two versions of the system.
    Version 1 only resolves direct anaphora and identifies discourse-new descriptions; Version 2 also deals with bridging descriptions.
    Both versions of the system have at their core a decision tree in which the heuristics discussed in the previous sections are tried in a fixed order to classify a certain definite description and find its anchor.
    Determining the optimal order of application of the heuristics in the decision tree is crucial to the performance of the system.
    In both versions of the system we used a decision tree developed by hand on the basis of extensive evaluation; we also attempted to determine the order of application automatically, by means of decision tree learning algorithms (Quinlan 1993).
    In this section we first present the hand-crafted decision tree and the results obtained using this decision tree for Version 1 and Version 2; we then present the results concerning the agreement between system and annotators, and we br
