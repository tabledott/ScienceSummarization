s assigned boundaries and the size of segments varied widely.
    Figure 2 shows the subjects' responses for the excerpt corresponding to Figure 1.
    The potential boundary sites are between the text lines corresponding to prosodic phrases.
    The left column shows the prosodic phrase numbers, which are explained later.
    There are 19 phrases, hence 18 boundary sites.
    The seven subjects are differentiated by distinct letters of the alphabet.
    Note that a majority of subjects agreed on only 3 of the 18 possible boundary sites, corresponding to the segmentation illustrated in Figure 1.
    In general, subjects assigned boundaries at quite distinct rates, thus agreement among subjects is necessarily imperfect.
    All subjects assigned boundaries relatively infrequently.
    On average, subjects assigned boundaries at only 16.1% of the potential boundary sites (mm = 5.5%; max = 41.3%) in any one narrative.
