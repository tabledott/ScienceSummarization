 enrichment of CTB annotation was a refinement of punctuation tags along ETB lines, which achieved an Fl of 80.7%.
    To assess the major sources of parsing difficulty for Chinese, we tabulated frequencies of major types of parsing errors in a 100-sentence subset of our development set.
    Table 3 gives a breakdown of the major error types found; Figure 4 gives examples of unfamiliar major error types.5 In the next section we describe each major error type, analyze its causes, and suggest simple PCFG enhancements that can be used to address it.
    4.1 Analysis by error type and PCFG-enrichment fixes Multilevel VP adjunction errors (Figure 5) are common in models without parent annotation, although even with parent annotation the presence of VP coordination would give multilevel VP adjunction nonzero probability.
    We address this error by taking advantage of the CTB's principled VP annotation practices, marking adjunction, complementation, and coordination VP levels, which builds the flat adjunction cons
