act (Sherali and Adams, 1994; Sontag et al., 2008).
    The structure of this paper is as follows.
    We first give two examples as an illustration of the approach: 1) integrated parsing and trigram part-ofspeech (POS) tagging; and 2) combined phrasestructure and dependency parsing.
    In both settings, it is possible to solve the integrated problem through an &#8220;intersected&#8221; dynamic program (e.g., for integration of parsing and tagging, the construction from Bar-Hillel et al. (1964) can be used).
    However, these methods, although polynomial time, are substantially less efficient than our algorithms, and are considerably more complex to implement.
    Next, we describe exact polyhedral formulations for the two problems, building on connections between dynamic programming algorithms and marginal polytopes, as described in Martin et al. (1990).
    These allow us to precisely characterize the relationship between the exact formulations and the LP relaxations that we solve.
    We then give guaran
