ity repre sents this constraint.
			k? i=1 zji?
			= k ? 1 Constraint 5: No duplicate argument classesWithin the same sentence, several types of argu ments cannot appear more than once.
			For example, a predicate can only take one A0.
			This constraint can be represented using the following inequality.
			M? i=1 ziA0 ? 1 Constraint 6: Exactly one V argument For each verb, there is one and has to be one V argument,which represents the active verb.
			Similarly, this con straint can be represented by the following equality.
			M? i=1 ziV = 1Constraint 7: V?A1?C-V pattern This constraint is only useful when there are three consec utive candidate arguments in a sentence.
			Suppose arguments Sj1 , Sj2 , Sj3 are consecutive.
			If Sj3 isC-V, then Sj1 and Sj2 have to be V and A1, respec tively.
			This if-then constraint can be represented by the following two linear inequalities.
			zj3C-V ? zj1V, and zj3C-V ? zj2A1 Constraint 8: R-XXX arguments Suppose the referenced argument type is A0 and the reference type i
