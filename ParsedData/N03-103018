 bottom-up manner for the DS-LST in Figure 2.
    Tuple ENABLEMENT-NS[2,2,3] has a score of 0.40, obtained ATTRIBUTION-SN[1,1,3] has a score of 0.37 for the structure, and a score of 0.009 for the relation.
    The final score for the entire discourse structure is 0.001.
    All probabilities used were estimated from our training corpus.
    According to our discourse model, the discourse structure in Figure 5 is the most likely among all the legal discourse structures for our example sentence.
  
  
    In this section we present the evaluations carried out for both the discourse segmentation task and the discourse parsing task.
    For this evaluation, we re-trained Charniak&#8217;s parser (2000) such that the test sentences from the discourse corpus were not seen by the syntactic parser during training.
    We train our discourse segmenter on the Training section of the corpus described in Section 2, and test it on the Test section.
    The training regime uses syntactic trees from the Penn Treebank.
