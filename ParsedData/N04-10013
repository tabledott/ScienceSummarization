    The EDT task is arguably harder than traditional named entity recognition, because of the additional complexity involved in extracting non-named mentions (nominals and pronouns) and the requirement of grouping mentions into entities.
    We present and evaluate empirically statistical models for both mention detection and entity tracking problems.
    For mention detection we use approache
