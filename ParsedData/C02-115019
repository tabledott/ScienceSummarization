chical classifier in classifying fine classes, we hope to know whether the hierarchical classifier hasany advantage in performance, in addition to the ad vantages it might have in downstream processing and comprehensibility.
			4.1 Data.
			Data are collected from four sources: 4,500 English questions published by USC (Hovy et al, 2001), about 500 manually constructed questions for a few rare classes, 894 TREC 8 and TREC 9 questions, and also 500 questions from TREC 10 which serves as our test set3.These questions were manually labeled accord ing to our question hierarchy.
			Although we allow multiple labels for one question in our classifiers, in our labeling, for simplicity, we assigned exactly 3The annotated data and experimental results are available from http://L2R.cs.uiuc.edu/cogcomp/one label to each question.
			Our annotators were requested to choose the most suitable class accord ing to their own understanding.
			This methodology might cause slight problems in training, when the labels are ambiguo
