contributors as possible is crucial to collecting a large volume of data.
    With that goal, Open Mind Word Expert tracks, for each contributor, the number of items tagged for each topic.
    When tagging items, a contributor is shown the number of items (for this word) she has tagged and the record number of items tagged (for this word) by a single user.
    If the contributor sets a record, it is recognized with a congratulatory message on the contribution screen, and the user is placed in the Hall of Fame for the site.
    Also, the user can always access a real-time graph summarizing, by topic, their contribution versus the current record for that topic.
    Interestingly, it seems that relatively simple word games can enjoy tremendous user acceptance.
    For example, WordZap (http://wordzap.com), a game that pits players against each other or against a computer to be the first to make seven words from several presented letters (with some additional rules), has been downloaded by well over a million use
