1; as the skeleton, aligning &#8220;cat sitting on the mat&#8221; and &#8220;hat on a mat&#8221; against it might yield the following alignments: where represents a NULL word.
    In graphical form, the resulting confusion network is shown in Figure 1.
    Each arc represents an alternative word at that position in the sentence and the number of votes for each word is marked in parentheses.
    Confusion network decoding usually requires finding the path with the highest confidence in the network.
    Based on vote counts, there are three alternatives in the example: &#8220;cat sat on the mat&#8221;, &#8220;cat on the mat&#8221; and &#8220;cat sitting on the mat&#8221;, each having accumulated 10 votes.
    The alignment procedure plays an important role, as by switching the position of the word &#8216;sat&#8217; and the following NULL in the skeleton, there would be a single highest scoring path through the network; that is, &#8220;cat on the mat&#8221;.
    Different alignment methods yield different confus
