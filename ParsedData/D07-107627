 annotators ).
			Moreover, we only model explicit relations and explicitly model the argument order of the two mentions in volved.
			733Finally, we compare our system with the state-of the-art systems in the literature.
			Context-Sensitive Convolution Tree Kernel In this paper, the m parameter of our context-sensitive convolution tree kernel as shown in Equation (3) indicates the maximal length of root node paths and is optimized to 3 using 5-fold cross validation on the ACE RDC 2003 training data.
			Table 1 compares the impact of different m in context-sensitive convolution tree kernels using the Shortest Path-enclosed Tree (SPT) (as described in Zhang et al(2006)) on the major relation types of the ACE RDC 2003 and 2004 corpora, in details.
			It also shows that our tree kernel achieves best performance on the test data using SPT with m = 3, which outperforms the one with m = 1 by ~2.3 in F-measure.
			This suggests the parent and grandparent nodes of a sub-tree contains much information for relation ex
