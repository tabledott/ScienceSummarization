 preprocessing reordering approaches.
    In the rest of the paper, we first introduce our dependency parser based reordering approach based on the analysis of the key issues when translating SVO languages to SOV languages.
    Then, we show experimental results of applying this approach to phrasebased SMT systems for translating from English to five SOV languages (Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Urdu and Turkish).
    After showing that this approach can also be beneficial for hierarchical phrase-based systems, we will conclude the paper with future research directions.
  
  
    In linguistics, it is possible to define a basic word order in terms of the verb (V) and its arguments, subject (S) and object (O).
    Among all six possible permutations, SVO and SOV are the most common.
    Therefore, translating between SVO and SOV languages is a very important area to study.
    We use English as a representative of SVO languages and Korean as a representative for SOV languages in our discussion about the word orders.
