l 3 which shows the importance of first-order align- ment models.
  The best t)erformanee is achieved with Model 4.
  The improvement by using a dictio- nary is small eomI)ared to the effect of using 1)etter a.lignmellt models.
  We see a significant dillerence in alignment quality if we exchange source and tar- get languages.
  This is due to the restriction in all alignment models that a source language word can 1)e aligned to at most one target language word.
  If German is source language the trequelltly occurring German word coml)ounds, camlot be aligned cor- rectly, as they typically correspond to two or more English words.
  WaNe 3 shows the effect of including a det)endence on word classes in the aligmnent model of ItMM or Model 4.
  By using word classes the results can be Table 3: Eftcot of including a det)endence on word classes in the aligmnent model.
