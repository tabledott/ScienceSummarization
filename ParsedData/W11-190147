us gold mention boundaries, and iii) Predicted plus gold mentions For the official test, beyond the raw source text, coreference systems were provided only with the predictions from automatic engines as to the other annotation layers (parses, semantic roles, word senses, and named entities).
    In this evaluation it is important to note that the mention detection score cannot be considered in isolation of the coreference task as has usually been the case.
    This is mainly owing to the fact that there are no singleton entities in the OntoNotes data.
    Most systems removed singletons from the response as a post-processing step, so not only will they not get credit for the singleton entities that they correctly removed from the data, but they will be penalized for the ones that they accidentally linked with another mention.
    What this number does indicate is the ceiling on recall that a system would have got in absence of being penalized for making mistakes in coreference resolution.
