same part of speech, the algorithm continues until a free slot is found.
    The exception is when the highest ranking free form is several orders of magnitude lower than the first choice; here the first-choice alignment is assumed to be correct, but a variant form.
  
  
    Current empirical evaluation of this work focuses on its accuracy in analyzing the often highly irregular past tense of English verbs.
    Consistent with prior empirical studies in this field, evaluation was performed on a test set of 3888 inflected words, including 128 highly irregular inflections, 1877 cases where the past tense was formed by simple concatenative suffixation, and 1883 inflections exhibiting a non-concatenative stem change such as gemination or elision.
    In execution, for each test inflected form, the analysis algorithm was free to consider alignment to any word in the corpus which had been identified as a potential root verb by the part-of-speech tagging process or occurrence in a dictionaryderived rootlist, not ju
