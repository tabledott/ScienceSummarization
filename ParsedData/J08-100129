ing two types of models: The first model treats all entities uniformly, whereas the second one discriminates between transitions of salient entities and the rest.
    We identify salient entities based on their frequency,3 following the widely accepted view that frequency of occurrence correlates with discourse prominence (Givon 1987; Ariel 1988; Hoey 1991; Morris and Hirst 1991).
    To implement a salience-based model, we modify our feature generation procedure by computing transition probabilities for each salience group separately, and then combining them into a single feature vector.
    For n transitions with k salience classes, the feature space will be of size n &#215; k. While we can easily build a model with multiple salience classes, we opt for a binary distinction (i.e., k = 2).
    This is more in line with theoretical accounts of salience (Chafe 1976; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) and results in a moderate feature space for which reliable parameter estimation is possible.
