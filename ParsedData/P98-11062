the governor.
    The latter will be noted, when convenient, X+T (X+ when unambiguous).
    The notations t- and x+ are unambiguous because a node x has at most one governor in a tree.
    As usual, an ordered tree is a tree enriched with a linear order over the set of its nodes.
    Finally, if 1 is an arc of an ordered tree T, then Supp(1) represents the support of 1, i.e. the set of the nodes of T situated between the extremities of 1, extremities included.
    We will say that the elements of Supp(1) are covered by 1.
    The notion of projectivity was introduced by (Lecerf, 1960) and has received several different definitions since then.
    The definition given here is borrowed from (Marcus, 1965) and (Robinson, 1970): Definition: An arc t- is projective if and only if for every y covered by y x+ .
    A tree T is projective if and only if every arc of T is projective A projective tree has been represented in Figure 1.
    A projective dependency tree can be associated with a phrase structure tree whose
