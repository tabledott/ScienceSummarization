attern can be represented as a binary vector in which an element with value 1 denotes that the pattern contains a particular pair and 0 that it does not.
    The similarity of two pattern vectors can be compared using the measure shown in Equation 1.
    Here d andb are pattern vectors, bT &#65533; the transpose ofb and The semantic similarity matrix W contains information about the similarity of each pattern elementfiller pair stored as non-negative real numbers and is crucial for this measure.
    Assume that the set of patterns, P, consists of n element-filler pairs denoted by p1, p2, ...pn.
    Each row and column of W represents one of these pairs and they are consistently labelled.
    So, for any i such that 1 &#8804; i &#8804; n, row i and column i are both labelled with pair pi.
    If wij is the element of W in row i and column j then the value of wij represents the similarity between the pairs pi and pj.
    Note that we assume the similarity of two element-filler pairs is symmetric, so wij = wji a
