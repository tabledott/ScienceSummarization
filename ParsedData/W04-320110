    Such factored models have shared substructure properties which permit dynamic programming decompositions.
    In this section, we describe how this kind of decomposition can be done over the dual &#945; distributions.
    The idea of this decomposition has previously been used for sequences and other Markov random fields in Taskar et al. (2003), but the present extension to CFGs is novel.
    For clarity of presentation, we restrict the grammar to be in Chomsky normal form (CNF), where all rules in the grammar are of the form hA &#8594; B Ci or hA &#8594; ai, where A, B and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is some terminal symbol.
    For example figure 1(a) shows a tree in this form.
    We will represent each parse as a set of two types of parts.
    Parts of the first type are single constituent tuples (A, s, e, i), consisting of a non-terminal A, start-point s and end-point e, and sentence i, such as r in figure 1(b).
    In this representation, indices s and e refer to positions between words,
