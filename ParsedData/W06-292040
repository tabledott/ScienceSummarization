 for Arabic and Turkish, which are larger.
    Interestingly, although the treebank text comes from a single source (a translation of Orwell&#8217;s novel &#8220;1984&#8221;), there is quite a high proportion of new FORM and LEMMA values in the test set.
    The fourth-most difficult data set is Czech in terms of the average score and Dutch in terms of the top score.
    The diffence in ranking for Czech is probably due to the fact that it has by far the largest training set and ironically, several participants could not train on all data within the limited time, or else had to partition the data and train one model for each partition.
    Likely problems with the Dutch data set are: noisy (C)POSTAG and LEMMA, (C)POSTAG for multiwords, and the highest proportion of nonprojectivity.
    Factors that have been discussed so far are: the size of the training data, the proportion of new FORM and LEMMA values in the test set, the ratio of (C)POSTAG to DEPREL values, the average length of the parsing unit the propor
