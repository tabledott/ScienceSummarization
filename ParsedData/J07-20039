tly proposed before in various settings.
    The method of Block (2000) is the earliest instance we are aware of, though it is restricted to rules with one variable.
    The same method has also been used by Probst et al. (2002) and Xia and McCord (2004) in conjunction with syntactic annotations to extract rules that are used for reordering prior to translation.
    Finally, Galley et al. (2004) use the same method to extract a very large grammar from syntactically annotated data.
    The discontinuous phrases used by Simard et al. (2005) have a similar purpose to synchronous grammar rules; but they have variables that stand for single words rather than subderivations, and they can interleave in non-hierarchical ways.
  
  
    The model is based on a synchronous CFG, elsewhere known as a syntax-directed transduction grammar (Lewis and Stearns 1968).
    We give here an informal definition and then describe in detail how we build a synchronous CFG for our model.
    In a synchronous CFG the elementary structu
