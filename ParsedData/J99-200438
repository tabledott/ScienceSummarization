ded only to combine the individual supertags to arrive at the parse of the input.
    Tested on about 1,300 WSJ sentences with each word in the sentence correctly supertagged, the LTAG parser took approximately 4 seconds per sentence to yield a parse (combine the supertags and perform feature unification).
    In contrast, the same 1,300 WSJ sentences without the supertag annotation took nearly 120 seconds per sentence to yield a parse.
    Thus the parsing speedup gained by this integration is a factor of about 30.
    In the XTAG system, we have integrated the trigram supertagger as a front end to an LTAG parser to pick the appropriate supertag for each word even before parsing begins.
    However, a drawback of this approach is that the parser would fail completely if any word of the input is incorrectly tagged by the supertagger.
    This problem could be circumvented to an extent by extending the supertagger to produce n-best supertags for each word.
    Although this extension would increase the load on
