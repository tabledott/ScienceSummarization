orms at a total word accuracy of 96.5% and an unknown word accuracy of 85%.
    (Brill, 1994).
    The TBL representation of the surrounding word context is almost the same7 and the TBL representation of unknown words is a superset8 of the unknown word representation in this paper.
    However, since TBL is non-statistical, it does not provide probability distributions and 7 (Brill, 1994) looks at words &#177;3 away from the current, whereas the feature set in this paper uses a window of &#177;2.
    8(Brill, 1994) uses prefix/suffix additions and deletions, which are not used in this paper. unlike MaxEnt, cannot be used as a probabilistic component in a larger model.
    MaxEnt can provide a probability for each tagging decision, which can be used in the probability calculation of any structure that is predicted over the POS tags, such as noun phrases, or entire parse trees, as in (Jelinek et al., 1994, Magerman, 1995).
    Thus MaxEnt has at least one advantage over each of the reviewed POS tagging techniqu
