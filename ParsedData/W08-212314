  After the submission deadline, we corrected a bug in the predicate identification method.
  This re- sulted in improved results shown in the lower part.

  5.1 Syntactic Results Table 4 shows the effect of adding second-order features to the parser in terms of accuracy as well as training and parsing time on a Mac Pro, 3.2 GHz.
  The training times were measured on the complete training set and the parsing time and ac- curacies on the development set.
  Similarly to Car- reras (2007), we see that these features have a very large impact on parsing accuracy, but also that the parser pays dearly in terms of efficiency as the search complexity increases fromO(n3) toO(n4).
  186 Since the low efficiency o
