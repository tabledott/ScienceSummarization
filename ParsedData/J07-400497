e the coverage of the parser, so that the evaluation is performed on as much of the unseen data as possible.
    This was also the threshold parameter used for the speed experiments in Section 10.3.
    All of the intermediate results were obtained using Section 00 of CCGbank as development data.
    The final test result, showing the performance of the best performing model, was obtained using Section 23.
    Evaluation was performed by comparing the dependency output of the parser against the predicate&#8211;argument dependencies in CCGbank.
    We report precision, recall, and F-scores for labeled and unlabeled dependencies, and also category accuracy.
    The category accuracy is the percentage of words assigned the correct lexical category by the parser (including punctuation).
    The labeled dependency scores take into account the lexical category containing the dependency relation, the argument slot, the word associated with the lexical category, and the argument head word: All four must be correct to
