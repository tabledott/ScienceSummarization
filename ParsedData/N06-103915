ity within one article and mentions(e) and firstsent(e) are the number of mentions of entity e in a document and the position of the sentence where entity e first appeared, respectively.
    C is a constant value which was 0.5 in this experiment.
    To reduce combinatorial complexity, we took only the five most highly weighted entities from each basic cluster to generate basic patterns.
    We observed these five entities can cover major relations that are reported in a basic cluster.
    Next, we obtain basic patterns from the GLARF structures.
    We used only the first ten sentences in each article for getting basic patterns, as most important facts are usually written in the first few sentences of a news article.
    Figure 5 shows all the basic patterns obtained from the sentence &#8220;Katrina hit Louisiana&#8217;s coast.&#8221; The shaded nodes &#8220;Katrina&#8221; and &#8220;Louisiana&#8221; are entities from which each basic pattern originates.
    We take a path of GLARF nodes from each entity nod
