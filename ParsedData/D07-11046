ences of these ter minals.
			We will additionally use ? and ? to denote(possibly empty) sequences containing both termi nals and nonterminals.
			A translation rule is written X ? ?/?.
			This rule states that a span of the input matching ? is replacedby ? in translation.
			We require that ? and ? con tain an equal number (possibly zero) of coindexed nonterminals.
			An example rule with coindexes is X ? uX 1 vX 2w/u ?X 2 v ?X 1w ?.
			When discussing only the source side of such rules, we will leave out the coindexes.
			For instance, the source side of the above rule will be written uXvXw.
			3 For the purposes of this paper, we adhere to therestrictions described by Chiang (2007) for rules ex tracted from the training data.
			Rules can contain at most two nonterminals.
			Rules can contain at most five terminals.
			Rules can span at most ten words.
			2A sample size of 100 is actually quite small for many phrases, some of which occur tens or hundreds of thousands of times.
			It is perhaps surprising t
