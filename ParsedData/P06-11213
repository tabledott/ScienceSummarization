nd target languages (Fox, 2002): for any given (pi, f ,a) triple, it is useful to produce a derivationthat minimally explains the transformation be tween pi and f , while remaining consistent with a. Galley et al (2004) present one such formalism (henceforth ?GHKM?).
			2.1 Tree-to-string alignments.
			It is appealing to model the transformation of pi into f using tree-to-string (xRs) transducers, sincetheir theory has been worked out in an exten sive literature and is well understood (see, e.g.,(Graehl and Knight, 2004)).
			Formally, transfor mational rules ri presented in (Galley et al, 2004) are equivalent to 1-state xRs transducers mapping a given pattern (subtree to match in pi) to a right hand side string.
			We will refer to them as lhs(ri) and rhs(ri), respectively.
			For example, some xRs 961 rules may describe the transformation of does not into ne ... pas in French.
			A particular instance may look like this: VP(AUX(does), RB(not), x0:VB) ? ne, x0, pas lhs(ri) can be any arbitrary syntax tree f
