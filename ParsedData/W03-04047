ignment.
    For example, the pattern &#8220;&lt;subject&gt; was hired&#8221; would apply to sentences that contain the verb &#8220;hired&#8221; in the passive voice.
    The subject would be extracted as the hiree.
    Meta-Bootstrapping and Basilisk were designed to learn words that belong to a semantic category (e.g., Tagger A Subj Obj &#8220;truck&#8221; is a VEHICLE and &#8220;seashore&#8221; is a LOCATION).
    Both algorithms begin with unannotated texts and seed words that represent a semantic category.
    A bootstrapping process looks for words that appear in the same extraction patterns as the seeds and hypothesizes that those words belong to the same semantic class.
    The principle behind this approach is that words of the same semantic class appear in similar pattern contexts.
    For example, the phrases &#8220;lived in&#8221; and &#8220;traveled to&#8221; will co-occur with many noun phrases that represent LOCATIONS.
    In our research, we want to automatically identify words that are subjec
