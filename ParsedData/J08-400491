ct tagging the same categories are used to classify all units, in the case of word sense tagging different categories must be used for each word, which makes writing a single coding manual specifying examples for all categories impossible: The only option is to rely on a dictionary.
    Unfortunately, different dictionaries make different distinctions, and often coders can&#8217;t make the fine-grained distinctions that trained lexicographers can make.
    The problem is particularly serious for verbs, which tend to be polysemous rather than homonymous (Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum 2007).
    These difficulties, and in particular the difficulty of tagging senses with a finegrained repertoire of senses such as that provided by dictionaries or by WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), have been highlighted by the three SENSEVAL initiatives.
    Already during the first SENSEVAL, V&#180;eronis (1998) carried out two studies of intercoder agreement on word sense tagging in the so-called ROMANSEVAL task.
    One study was concern
