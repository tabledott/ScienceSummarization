ses where more than one test instance came from the same numbered category.)
    Two human judges were independently given the test cases to disambiguate.
    For each case, they were given the full set of nouns in the numbered category (as shown above) together with descriptions of the WordNet senses for the word to be disambiguated (as, for example, the list of 25 senses for line given in the previous section, though thankfully few words have that many senses!).
    It was a forced-choice task; that is, the judge was required to choose exactly one sense.
    In addition, for each judgment, the judge was required to provide a confidence value for this decision, ranging from 0 (not at all confident) to 4 (highly confident).
    Results are presented here individually by judge.
    For purposes of evaluation, test instances for which the judge had low confidence (i.e. confidence ratings of 0 or 1) were excluded.
    For Judge 1, there were 99 test instances with sufficiently high confidence to be considered.
