of text not because the pronoun them is used but because they jointly describe a set of cooking instructions&amp;quot; (emphasis added).
    This is an example of lumping cohesion and coherence together as one phenomenon.
    Pronominal reference is defined as a type of cohesion (Halliday and Hasan 1976).
    Therefore the them in example 11 is an instance of it.
    The important point is that both cohesion and coherence are distinct phenomena creating unity in text.
    Reichman also writes (1985, p. 179) &amp;quot;that similar words (apples, them, apples) appear in a given stretch of discourse is an artifact of the content of discussion.&amp;quot; It follows that if content is related in a stretch of discourse, there will be coherence.
    Lexical cohesion is a computationally feasible clue to identifying a coherent stretch of text.
    In example 12, it is computationally trivial to get the word relationship between apples and apples, and this relation fits the definition of lexical cohesion.
