	What is the Jeopardy Model? A Quasi-Synchronous Grammar for QA
		This paper presents a syntax-driven ap proach to question answering, specifically the answer-sentence selection problem forshort-answer questions.
		Rather than using syntactic features to augment exist ing statistical classifiers (as in previouswork), we build on the idea that ques tions and their (correct) answers relate toeach other via loose but predictable syntactic transformations.
		We propose a probabilistic quasi-synchronous grammar, inspired by one proposed for machine translation (D. Smith and Eisner, 2006), and parameterized by mixtures of a robust non lexical syntax/alignment model with a(n optional) lexical-semantics-driven log-linear model.
		Our model learns soft alignments as a hidden variable in discriminative training.
		Experimental results using the TREC dataset are shown to significantly outperform strong state-of-the-art baselines.
