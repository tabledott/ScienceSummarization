the target language.
    As a syntactic tuple is defined by both its syntactic relation and the words that appear in it, we need to map both components to the target language.
    By definition, every ambiguous source language word maps to several target language words.
    We thus get several alternative target language tuples for each source language tuple that involves an ambiguous word.
    For example, for tuple 3 in (7) we obtain three alternatives, corresponding to the three different translations of the word hitqaddmut.
    For tuple 4 we obtain nine alternative target tuples, since each of the words hit qaddmut and say maps to three different English words.
    The full mapping of the Hebrew tuples in (7) to English tuples appears in Table 1 (the rightmost column should be ignored for the moment).
    Each of the tuple sets (a&#8211;d) in this table denotes the alternatives for translating the corresponding Hebrew tuple.
    From a theoretical point of view, the mapping of syntactic relations is more
