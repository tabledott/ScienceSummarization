    To develop the algorithm for computing the upper envelope of all translation hypotheses that are encoded in a phrase lattice, we first consider a node vPVf with some incoming and outgoing arcs: Each path that starts at the source node s and ends in v defines a partial translation hypothesis which can be represented as a line (cf.
    Eq.
    (5)).
    We now assume that the upper envelope for these partial translation hypotheses is known.
    The lines that constitute this envelope shall be denoted by f1, ..., fN.
    Next we consider continuations of these partial translation candidates by following one of the outgoing arcs Algorithm 2 Lattice Envelope input: a phrase lattice 9f~pVf, Efq output: upper envelope of 9f Eoutpvq.
    Each such arc defines another line denoted by gpE.
    If we add the slope and y-intercept of gpEto each line in the setf1, ..., fNu, then the upper envelope will be constituted by segments of fi + gp(E), ..., fN + gp(E).
