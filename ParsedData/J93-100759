    Such lexicographic tools could, for example, help readers retrieve sublanguage-specific expressions by providing them with lists of candidate collocations.
    The lexicographer then manually examines the list to remove the irrelevant data.
    Even low precision is useful for lexicographers, as manual filtering is much faster than manual scanning of the documents (Marcus 1990).
    Such techniques are not able to replace readers, though, as they are not designed to identify low-frequency expressions, whereas a human reader immediately identifies interesting expressions with as few as one occurrence.
    The second stage of this experiment was to use Xtract stage 3 to filter out and label the sample set of collocations.
    As described in Section 8, there are several valid labels (VO, VS, NN, etc.).
    In this experiment, we grouped them under a single label: T. There is only one nonvalid label: U (for unlabeled).
    A T collocation is thus accepted by Xtract stage 3, and a U collocation
