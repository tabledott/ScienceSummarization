03) investigated the validity of web counts for a range of predicate-argument bigrams (verbobject, adjective-noun, and noun-noun bigrams).
    They presented a simple method for retrieving bigram counts from the web by querying a search engine and demonstrated that web counts (a) correlate with frequencies obtained from a carefully edited, balanced corpus such as the 100M words British National Corpus (BNC), (b) correlate with frequencies recreated using smoothing methods in the case of unseen bigrams, (c) reliably predict human plausibility judgments, and (d) yield state-of-the-art performance on pseudo-disambiguation tasks.
    Keller and Lapata&#8217;s (2003) results suggest that webbased frequencies can be a viable alternative to bigram frequencies obtained from smaller corpora or recreated using smoothing.
    However, they do not demonstrate that realistic NLP tasks can benefit from web counts.
    In order to show this, web counts would have to be applied to a diverse range of NLP tasks, both syntactic
