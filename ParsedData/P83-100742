enotation&#8212;in other words, the distinction between value-free and value-loaded interpretations.
    As noted, a distinction of this sort can be effected within the framework of 'possible-worlds' approaches to the semantics of natural language.
    In addition, we see the need for interpretations of definite noun phrases to be dependent on their discourse context.
    Once again, this is a feature of interpretations that is accommodated in the relational approach to semantics advocated by Barwise and Perry, but it might be accommodated within other approaches as wel1.8 Given that Cb(S), the center of sentence S in a discourse, is the interpretation of a definite noun phrase, how does it become related to S?
    In a typical example, S will contain a full definite noun phrase or pronoun that realizes the center.
    The realization relation is neither semantic nor pragmatic.
    For example, N realizes c may hold in cases where N is a definite description and e is its denotation, its value-free interpretat
