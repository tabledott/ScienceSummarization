rm Choi&#8217;s algorithm on the synthetic data.
    This again can be attributed to the discrepancy in distributional properties of the synthetic corpus which lacks coherence in its thematic shifts and the lecture corpus of spontaneous speech with smooth distributional variations.
    We also note that we did not try to adjust our model to optimize its performance on the synthetic data.
    The smoothing method developed for lecture segmentation may not be appropriate for short segments ranging from three to eleven sentences that constitute the synthetic set.
    We also compared our method with another state-of-the-art algorithm which does not explicitly rely on pairwise similarity analysis.
    This algorithm (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001) (UI) computes the optimal segmentation by estimating changes in the language model predictions over different partitions.
    We used the publicly available implementation of the system that does not require parameter tuning on a heldout development set.
    Again, our meth
