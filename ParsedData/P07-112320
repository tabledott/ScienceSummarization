sing the MPQA annotation guidelines (Wiebe et al., 2005).
    The tagset consists of S(ubjective), O(bjective) and U(ncertain).
    For the U tags, a class was also given; OU means, for instance, that the annotator is uncertain but she is leaning toward O.
    Table 4 shows the pairwise agreement figures and the Kappa (K) calculated for the three annotators.
    The table also shows the agreement when the borderline uncertain cases are removed.
    Annotations performed by three annotators: one native English speaker (En) and two native Romanian speakers (Rol and Roe) When all the sentences are included, the agreement between the two Romanian annotators is measured at 0.83 (K = 0.67).
    If we remove the borderline cases where at least one annotator&#8217;s tag is Uncertain, the agreement rises to 0.89 with K = 0.77.
    These figures are somewhat lower than the agreement observed during previous subjectivity annotation studies conducted on English (Wiebe et al., 2005) (the annotators were more extensively t
