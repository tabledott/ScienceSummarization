(Mihalcea et al., 2007) requires a large amount of manual labor, one of the reasons behind our experiments was to asses the ability of machine translation to transfer subjective content into a target language with minimal effort.
    As demonstrated by our experiments, machine translation offers a viable alternative in the construction of resources and tools for subjectivity classification in a new target language, with only a small decrease in performance as compared to the case when a parallel corpus is available and used.
    To gain further insights, two additional experiments were performed.
    First, we tried to isolate the role played by the quality of the subjectivity annotations in the source-language for the cross-lingual projections of subjectivity.
    To this end, we used the high-precision OpinionFinder classifier to annotate the English datasets.
    As shown in Table 1, this classifier has higher precision but lower recall as compared to the high-coverage classifier we used in our previous ex
