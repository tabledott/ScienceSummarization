iption as anaphoric, but then find the wrong antecedent.
    We used this set of heuristics when evaluating the heuristics for discourse-new and bridging descriptions in the rest of the paper.
    The column headed # represents the number of cases of descriptions classified as anaphora in the standard annotation; + indicates the total number of anaphora (classification and resolution) correctly identified; &#8212; indicates the total number of errors.
    5.2.5 Errors in Anaphora Resolution.
    Before discussing the results of the other heuristics used by the system, we will discuss in more detail some of the errors in the resolution of anaphoric descriptions made by using the heuristics just discussed.
    Some errors are simply caused by misspellings in the Treebank, as in the example below, where the antecedent is misspelled as spokewoman.
    The most common problems are due to the heuristics limiting the search for antecedents.
