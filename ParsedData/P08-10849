ate this assumption.
    The main benefit of joint multilingual analysis is that morphological structure ambiguous in one language is sometimes explicitly marked in another language.
    For example, in Hebrew, the preposition meaning &#8220;in&#8221;, b-, is always prefixed to its nominal argument.
    On the other hand, in Arabic, the most common corresponding particle is fy, which appears as a separate word.
    By modeling crosslingual morpheme alignments while simultaneously segmenting, the model effectively propagates information between languages and in this case would be encouraged to segment the Hebrew prefix b-.
    Cognates are another important means of disambiguation in the multilingual setting.
    Consider translations of the phrase &#8220;...and they wrote it...&#8221;: In both languages, the triliteral root ktb is used to express the act of writing.
    By considering the two phrases simultaneously, the model can be encouraged to split off the respective Hebrew and Arabic prefixes w- and f- i
