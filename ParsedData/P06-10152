    The main algorithmic contribution is a novel method for exploiting generic patterns, which are broad coverage noisy patterns &#8211; i.e., patterns with high recall and low precision.
    Insofar, difficulties in using these patterns have been a major impediment for minimally supervised algorithms resulting in either very low precision or recall.
    We propose a method to automatically detect generic patterns and to separate their correct and incorrect instances.
    The key intuition behind the algorithm is that given a set of reliable (high precision) patterns on a corpus, correct instances of a generic pattern will fire more with reliable patterns on a very large corpus, like the Web, than incorrect ones.
    Below is a summary of the main contributions of this paper: Espresso addresses the desiderata as follows: Previous work like (Girju et al. 2006) that has made use of generic patterns through filtering has shown both high precision and high recall, at the expensive cost of much manual semant
