tern ranking/selection, and instance extraction.
    The algorithm begins with seed instances of a particular binary relation (e.g., is-a) and then iterates through the phases until it extracts ti1 patterns or the average pattern score decreases by more than ti2 from the previous iteration.
    In our experiments, we set ti1 = 5 and ti2 = 50%.
    For our tokenization, in order to harvest multiword terms as relation instances, we adopt a slightly modified version of the term definition given in (Justeson 1995), as it is one of the most commonly used in the NLP literature: ((Adj|Noun)+|((Adj|Noun)*(NounPrep)?
    )(Adj|Noun)*)Noun In the pattern induction phase, Espresso infers a set of surface patterns P that connects as many of the seed instances as possible in a given corpus.
    Any pattern learning algorithm would do.
    We chose the state of the art algorithm described in (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002) with the following slight modification.
    For each input instance {x, y}, we first retrieve all senten
