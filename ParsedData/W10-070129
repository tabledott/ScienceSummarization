r?s famous exhortation ?Pre 7 diction is very difficult, especially if it?s about the future,?
			we attempt to draw some conclusions and predict future directions and impact on the field.
			Some have predicted that access to low cost, highly scalable methods for creating language andspeech annotations means the end of work on unsupervised learning.
			Many a researcher has advocated his or her unsupervised learning approach because of annotation costs.
			However, if 100 exam ples for any task are obtainable for less than $100,why spend the time and effort developing often infe rior unsupervised methods?
			Such a radical change is highly debatable, in fact, one of this paper?s authors is a strong advocate of such a position while the other disagrees, perhaps because he himself works on unsupervised methods.
			Certainly, we can agree that the potential exists for a change in focus in a number of ways.In natural language processing, data drives re search.
