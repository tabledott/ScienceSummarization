east one terminal node.
    The d-trees of a grammar two additional annotations: subsertion-insertion constraints and sister-adjoining constraints.
    These will be described below, but first we define simultaneously and subsertion-adjoining trees (SAtrees), which are partial derivation structures that can be interpreted as representing dependency in
  
  
    We define a new grammar formalism, called D-Tree Grammars (DTG), which arises from work on TreeAdjoining Grammars (TAG) (Joshi et al., 1975).
    A salient feature of TAG is the extended domain of locality it provides.
    Each elementary structure can be associated with a lexical item (as in Lexicalized TAG (LTAG) (Joshi &amp; Schabes, 1991)).
    Properties related to the lexical item (such as subcategorization, agreement, certain types of word order variation) can be expressed within the elementary structure (Kroch, 1987; Frank, 1992).
    In addition, TAG remain tractable, yet their generative capacity is sufficient to account for certain syntactic
