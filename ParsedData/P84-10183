t to be able to use identical interpreters in corresponding places in all machines of similar design because the information they embody comes from general lingusitic theory and not from particular languages.
    The scheme therefore has the advantage of modularity.
    The linguistic descriptions are independent of the leg of the machine they are used in and the programs are independent of the languages to which they are applied.
    For all the advantgages of the classical design, it is not hard to imagine improvements.
    In the best all possible worlds, there would only be one formalism in which all the facts about a language&#8212;morphological, syntactic, semantic, or whatever&#8212;could he stated.
    A formalism powerful enough to accommodate the various different kinds of linguistic phenomena with equal facility might be unappealing to theoretical linguists because powerful formal systems do not make powerful claims.
    But the engineering advantages are clear to see.
    A single formalism would
