200 are known to describe interactions between human proteins, while the other 25 do not refer to any interaction.
    There are 4,084 protein references and around 1,000 tagged interactions in this data set.
    In this data set there is no distinction between genes and proteins and the relations are symmetric.
    This data set was used in the Learning Language in Logic (LLL) challenge on Genic Interaction extraction5 (Ned&#180;ellec, 2005).
    The objective of the challenge was to evaluate the performance of systems based on machine learning techniques to identify gene/protein interactions and their roles, agent or target.
    The data set was collected by querying Medline on Bacillus subtilis transcription and sporulation.
    It is divided in a training set (80 sentences describing 271 interactions) and a test set (87 sentences describing 106 interactions).
    Differently from the training set, the test set contains sentences without interactions.
    The data set is decomposed in two subsets of increa
