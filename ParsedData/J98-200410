l advantage that it is easy to compute during chart parsing.
    Appendix A gives details of our on-line computation of 0.
    The inside probability of the constituent Nip( is defined as: where Ni represents the ith nonterminal symbol. a includes the entire context of the constituent.
    In terms of our earlier discussion, our &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; figure of merit can be rewritten as: We apply the usual independence assumption that given a nonterminal, the tag sequence it generates depends only on that nonterminal, giving: The first term in the numerator is just the definition of the outside probability a of the constituent.
    Outside probability a of a constituent Nip&lt; is defined as the probability of that constituent and the rest of the words in the sentence (or rest of the tags in the tag sequence, in our case); see Figure 3.
    In this equation, we can see that a(Nihk) and p(to,n) represent the influence of the surrounding words.
    Thus using 13 alone assumes that a and p(to,n) can be ignore
