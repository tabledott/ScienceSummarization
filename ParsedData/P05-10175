e (2000) used a learning method to collect subjective adjectives from corpora.
    Riloff et al. (2003) focused on the collection of subjective nouns.
    We later compare our method with Turney and Littman&#8217;s method and Kamps et al.&#8217;s method.
    The other pieces of research work mentioned above are related to ours, but their objectives are different from ours.
  
  
    We give a brief introduction to the spin model and the mean field approximation, which are wellstudied subjects both in the statistical mechanics and the machine learning communities (Geman and Geman, 1984; Inoue and Carlucci, 2001; Mackay, 2003).
    A spin system is an array of N electrons, each of which has a spin with one of two values &#8220;+1 (up)&#8221; or &#8220;&#8722;1 (down)&#8221;.
    Two electrons next to each other energetically tend to have the same spin.
    This model is called the Ising spin model, or simply the spin model (Chandler, 1987).
    The energy function of a spin system can be represented as where xi
