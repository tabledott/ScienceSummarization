s; namely, verbs that specify the manner of an action that results in a change of state of an object.
    As useful and informative as the research on verb classification is, there is a major shortcoming with this approach.
    Unlike the theories of Katz and Fodor (1963), Wilks (1975a), and Quillian (1968), there is no general coherent view on what the entire lexicon will look like when semantic structures for other major categories are studied.
    This can be essential for establishing a globally coherent theory of semantic representation.
    On the other hand, the semantic distinctions captured by these older theories were often too coarse-grained.
    It is clear, therefore, that the classifications made by Levin and her colleagues are an important starting point for a serious theory of knowledge representation.
    I claim that lexical semantics must build upon this research toward constructing a theory of word meaning that is integrated into a linguistic theory, as well as interpreted in a real knowle
