able 6: On the Chinese&#8211;English task, there is an additional gain of more than 1% absolute in correlation over CDER alone.
    The combined error measure is the best method in both cases.
    The last line in Table 6 shows the 95%confidence interval for the correlation.
    We see that the new measure CDER, combined with PER, has a significantly higher correlation with human evaluation than the existing measures BLEU, TER, and WER on both corpora.
  
  
    We presented CDER, a new automatic evaluation measure for MT, which is based on edit distance extended by block movements.
    CDER allows for reordering blocks of words at constant cost.
    Unlike previous block movement measures, CDER can be exactly calculated in quadratic time.
    Experimental evaluation on two different translation tasks shows a significantly improved correlation with human judgment in comparison with state-of-the-art measures such as BLEU.
    Additionally, we showed how word-dependent substitution costs can be applied to enhan
