lowing derivation shows that if p(v  |c'i, r) = k for each child c'i of c', and p(v  |c', r) = k, then p(v  |c', r) is also equal to k: Note that the proof applies only to a tree, since the proof assumes that c' is partitioned by c' and the sets of concepts dominated by each of the daughters of c', which is not necessarily true for a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
    WordNet is a DAG but is a close approximation to a tree, and so we assume this will not be a problem in practice.6 The derivation in (4)&#8211;(9) shows how probabilities conditioned on sets of concepts can remain constant when moving up the hierarchy, and this suggests a way of finding a suitable set, c', as a generalization for concept c: Initially set c' equal to c and move up the hierarchy, changing the value of c', until there is a significant change in p(v | c', r).
    Estimates of p(v  |ci, r), for each child ci of c', can be compared to see whether p(v  |c', r) has significantly changed.
    (We ignore the probability p(v  |c', r) and co
