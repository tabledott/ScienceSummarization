ng) data.
    While the AGGRESSIVE approach which uses a structured learner sees a bigger improvement, reaching 82.4% and 73.2% respectively.
    This is only 7% below the fully SUPERVISED upper bound of the model.
    To answer the second question, we compare a supervised version of our model to existing semantic parsers.
    The results are in Table 2.
    Although the numbers are not directly comparable due to different splits in the data7, we can see that with a similar number of logical forms for training our SUPERVISED approach outperforms existing systems (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Wong and Mooney, 2007), while the AGGRESSIVE approach remains competitive without using any logical forms.
    Our SUPERVISED model is still very competitive with other approaches (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Wong and Mooney, 2007), which used considerably more annotated logical forms in the training phase.
    In order to answer the third question, we turn our attention to the differences between the two response driven lea
