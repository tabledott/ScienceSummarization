ed this notion of triangulation typically create several candidate sentential target translations for source sentences via different languages.
    A single translation is then selected by finding the candidate that yields the best overall score (Och and Ney, 2001; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007) or by cotraining (Callison-Burch and Osborne, 2003).
    This ties in with recent work on ensemble combinations of SMT systems, which have used alignment techniques (Matusov et al., 2006) or simple heuristics (Eisele, 2005) to guide target sentence selection and generation.
    Beyond SMT, the use of an intermediate language as a translation aid has also found application in cross-lingual information retrieval (Gollins and Sanderson, 2001).
    Callison-Burch et al. (2006) propose the use of paraphrases as a means of dealing with unseen source phrases.
    Their method acquires paraphrases by identifying candidate phrases in the source language, translating them into multiple target languages, and then back to the source.
