til no more rules could be learned.
    Table 2 shows the results of the experiments.
    Again, the ICA algorithm learns the rules very fast, but has a slightly lower performance than the other two TBL systems.
    Since the samples are inherently independent, there is no performance loss because of the independence assumption; therefore the performance penalty has to come from the commitment assumption.
    The Fast TBL algorithm runs, again, in a order of magnitude faster than the original TBL while preserving the performance; the time ratio is only 13 in this case due to the small training size (only 13000 samples).
    Text chunking is a subproblem of syntactic parsing, or sentence diagramming.
    Syntactic parsing attempts to construct a parse tree from a sentence by identifying all phrasal constituents and their attachment points.
    Text chunking simplifies the task by dividing the sentence into non-overlapping phrases, where each word belongs to the lowest phrasal constituent that dominates it.
