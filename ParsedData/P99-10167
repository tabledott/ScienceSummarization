e that the word could describe this class of nouns.
    Not every node has sufficient data to be assigned a hypernym.
  
  
    The labeled tree constructed in the previous section tends to be extremely redundant.
    Recall that the tree is binary.
    In many cases, a group of nouns really do not have an inherent tree structure, for example, a cluster of countries.
    Although it is possible that a reasonable tree structure could be created with subtrees of, say, European countries, Asian countries, etc., recall that we are using single-word hypernyms.
    A large binary tree of countries would ideally have &amp;quot;country&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;nation&amp;quot;) as the best hypernym at every level.
    We would like to combine these subtrees into a single parent labeled &amp;quot;country&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;nation&amp;quot;, with each country appearing as a leaf directly beneath this parent.
    (Obviously, the tree will no longer be binary).
    Another type of redundancy can occur when an internal
