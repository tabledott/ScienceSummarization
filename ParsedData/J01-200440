,a) and P(A, c).
    The same empirical probability, P(A, Xoe), is collected for every preterminal X as well.
    The LAP approximation for a given stack state and look-ahead terminal is: where PG(Aj Wia) AAjP(Ai Wice) + (1 - AA,) E Po; xcoti(x wi) (11) XEV The lambdas are a function of the frequency of the nonterminal A1, in the standard way (Jelinek and Mercer 1980).
    The beam threshold at word w, is a function of the probability of the top-ranked candidate analysis on priority queue kiwi, and the number of candidates on H1+1.
    The basic idea is that we want the beam to be very wide if there are few analyses that have been advanced, but relatively narrow if many analyses have been advanced.
    If p is the probability of the highest-ranked analysis on H1&#177;1, then another analysis is discarded if its probability falls below pf(-y, IH,+11), where -y is an initial parameter, which we call the base beam factor.
    For the current study, ,y was 10-11, unless otherwise noted, and f ('-y,1H,+11) = -y11-
