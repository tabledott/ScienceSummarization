 dataset are fairly heavy Twitter users, posting an average of 40 messages per day (although we see only 15% of this total).
    We have little information about their demographics, though from the text it seems likely that this user set skews towards teens and young adults.
    The dataset covers each of the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia.
  
  
    We develop a model that incorporates two sources of lexical variation: topic and geographical region.
    We treat the text and geographic locations as outputs from a generative process that incorporates both topics and regions as latent variables.6 During inference, we seek to recover the topics and regions that best explain the observed data.
    At the base level of model are &#8220;pure&#8221; topics (such as &#8220;sports&#8221;, &#8220;weather&#8221;, or &#8220;slang&#8221;); these topics are rendered differently in each region.
    We call this general modeling approach a cascading topic model; we describe it first in general term
