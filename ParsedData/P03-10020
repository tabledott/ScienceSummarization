  Using Predicate-Argument Structures For Information Extraction
  
    In this paper we present a novel, customizable IE paradigm that takes advantage of predicate-argument structures.
    We also introduce a new way of automatically identifying predicate argument structures, which is central to our IE paradigm.
    It is based on: (1) an extended set of features; and (2) inductive decision tree learning.
    The experimental results prove our claim that accurate predicate-argument structures enable high quality IE results.
  
  
    The goal of recent Information Extraction (IE) tasks was to provide event-level indexing into news stories, including news wire, radio and television sources.
    In this context, the purpose of the HUB Event-99 evaluations (Hirschman et al., 1999) was to capture information on some newsworthy classes of events, e.g. natural disasters, deaths, bombings, elections, financial fluctuations or illness outbreaks.
