 as Ack by both coders, and 126 to 150 differ in their labels.
    1 To be precise, Krippendorff uses a computation very similar to Siegel and Castellan&#8217;s to produce a statistic called alpha.
    Krippendorff computes P(E) (called 1 &#8722; De in his terminology) with a sampling-without-replacement methodology.
    The computations of P(E) and of 1 &#8722; De show that the difference is negligible: Cohen&#8217;s contingency tables (left) and Siegel and Castellan&#8217;s agreement table (right).
    Agreement tables lose information.
    When the coders disagree, we cannot reconstruct which coder picked which category.
    Consider Example 2 in Figure 1.
    The two coders still disagree on 25 occurrences of Okay.
    However, one coder now labels 10 of those as Accept and the remaining 15 as Ack, whereas the other labels the same 10 as Ack and the same 15 as Accept.
    The agreement table does not change, but the contingency table does.
    Turning now to computing P(E), Figure 2 shows, for Example 1,
