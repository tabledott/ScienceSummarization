nificance testing: For seen bigrams, we found that the AltaVista correlation coefficients were significantly higher than correlation coefficients obtained using smoothing, for all three types of bigrams (t(87) = 3.31, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 4.11, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 4.32, p &lt; .01).
    This also held for Google counts (t(87) = 3.16, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 4.02, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 4.03, p &lt; .01).
    For unseen bigrams, the AltaVista coefficients and the coefficients obtained using smoothing were not significantly different for adjective-noun bigrams, but the difference reached significance for noun-noun and verb-object bigrams (t(87) = 2.08, p &lt; .05; t(87) = 2.53, p &lt; .01).
    For Google counts, the difference was again not significant for adjective-noun bigrams, but it reached significance for noun-noun and verb-object bigrams (t(87) = 2.34, p &lt; .05; t(87) = 2.15, p &lt; .05).
    Finally, we conducted a small study to investigate the validity of the counts that were re-created using class-based s
