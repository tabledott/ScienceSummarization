ka on the training data (10fold cross-validation).
    The system submission uses the M5P (regression with decision trees) algorithm which performed best.
    Contrary to what had been observed on the training data using cross-validation, &#8220;TCD M5P-resourcesonly&#8221; performs better than &#8220;TCD M5P-all&#8221; on the test data.
    PRHLT-UPV (R, S): The system addresses the task using a regression algorithm with 475 features, including the 17 the baseline features.
    Most of the features are defined as word scores.
    Among them, the features obtained form a smoothed naive Bayes classifier have shown to be particularly interesting.
    Different methods to combine word-level scores into sentencelevel features were investigated.
    For model building, SVM regression was used.
    Given the large number of features, the training data provided as part of the task was insufficient yielding unstable systems with not so good performance.
    Different feature selection methods were implemented to dete
