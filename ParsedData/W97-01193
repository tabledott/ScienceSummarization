tion method matching co-occurrence patterns in two non-parallel texts, but noted that computational limitations hamper further extension of this method.
    Using the same idea, (Tanaka &amp; Iwasaki 1996) demonstrated how to eliminate candidate words in a bilingual dictionary.
    All the above works point to a certain discriminatory feature in monolingual texts &#8212; context and word relations.
    However, these works remain in the realm of solving ambiguities or choosing the best candidate among a small set of possibilities.
    It is argued in (Gale &amp; Church 1994) that feature vectors of 100,000 dimensions are likely to be needed for high resolution discriminant analysis.
    It is so far questionable whether feature vectors of lower dimensions are discriminating enough for extracting bilingual lexical pairs from nonparallel corpora with a large number of candidates.
    Is it possible to achieve bilingual lexicon translation by looking at words in relation to other words?
    In this paper, we hop
