t possibilities at each dynamic programming state, rather than keeping just first best.
    When combining two constituents to form a larger constituent, we keep the best 50 of the 2500 possibilities they offer.
    Naturally, if we keep each 50-best list sorted, we do nothing like 2500 operations.
    The experimental question is whether, in practice, the coarse-to-fine architecture keeps the number of dynamic programming states sufficiently low that space considerations do not defeat us.
    The answer seems to be yes.
    We ran the algorithm on section 24 of the Penn WSJ tree-bank using the default pruning settings mentioned above.
    Table 1 shows how the number of fine-grained dynamic programming states increases as a function of sentence length for the sentences in section 24 of the Treebank.
    There are no sentences of length greater than 69 in this section.
    Columns two to four show the number of sentences in each bucket, their average length, and the average number of fine-grained dynamic prog
