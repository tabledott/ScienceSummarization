nerated by these system variants was conducted.
    Two human judges were presented with the uncondensed surface string and five condensed strings that were displayed in random order for each test example.
    The five condensed strings presented to the human judges contained (1) strings generated from three randomly selected fstructures, (2) the strings generated from the f-structures which were selected by the stochastic model, and (3) the manually created gold-standard condensations extracted from the Ziff-Davis abstracts.
    The judges were asked to judge summarization quality on a scale of increasing quality from 1 to 5 by assessing how well the generated strings retained the most salient information of the original uncondensed sentences.
    Grammaticality of the system output is optimal and not reported separately.
    Results for both evaluations are reported for two test corpora of 32 examples each.
    Testset I contains the sentences and condensations used to evaluate the system described in Knigh
