isted in Table 2 shows that this model obtains higher accuracy than the best of SIGHAN Bakeoff 2 in three corpora (AS, CityU and MSR).
    On the three corpora, it also outperformed the word-based perceptron model of Zhang and Clark (2007).
    However, the accuracy on PKU corpus is obvious lower than the best score SIGHAN reported, we need to conduct further research on this problem.
    We turned to experiments on CTB 5.0 to test the performance of the cascaded model.
    According to the usual practice in syntactic analysis, we choose chapters 1 &#8722; 260 (18074 sentences) as training set, chapter 271 &#8722; 300 (348 sentences) as test set and chapter 301 &#8722; 325 (350 sentences) as development set.
    At the first step, we conducted a group of contrasting experiments on the core perceptron, the first concentrated on the segmentation regardless of the POS information and reported the F-measure on segmentation only, while the second performed Joint S&amp;T using POS information and reported the F-mea
