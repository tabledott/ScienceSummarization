nts described in Section 6.
    For the dependency model we returned the dependency structure with the highest expected labelled recall score.
    Following Clark et al. (2002), evaluation is by precision and recall over dependencies.
    For a labelled dependency to be correct, the first 4 elements of the dependency tuple must match exactly.
    For an unlabelled dependency to be correct, the heads of the functor and argument must appear together in some relation in the gold standard (in any order).
    The results on section 00, using the feature sets described earlier, are given in Table 1, with similar results overall for the normal-form model and the dependency model.
    Since experimentation is easier with the normal-form model than the dependency model, we present additional results for the normalform model.
    Table 2 gives the results for the normal-form model for various feature sets.
    The results show that each additional feature type increases performance.
