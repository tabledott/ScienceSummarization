rgument structures in which all arguments have been instantiated.
    Because inactive parts will not change during the rest of the parsing process, they can be placed in a conjunctive node.
    By placing newly generated inactives into corresponding conjunctive nodes, a set of predicate&#8211;argument structures can be represented in a feature forest by packing local ambiguities, and non-local dependencies are preserved.
    Lexical entries including non-local relations. and fact may optionally take a complementizer phrase.7 The predicate&#8211;argument structures for dispute1 and dispute2 are shown in Figure 17.
    Curly braces express the ambiguities of partially constructed predicate&#8211;argument structures.
    The resulting feature forest is shown in Figure 18.
    The boxes denote conjunctive nodes and dx represent disjunctive nodes.
    The clause I wanted to dispute has two possible predicate&#8211;argument structures: one corresponding to dispute1 (&#945; in Figure 16) and the other corresponding
