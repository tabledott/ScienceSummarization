very specific features over words and partof-speech tags to less sparse features over just partof-speech tags.
    These features are added for both the entire words as well as the 5-gram prefix if the word is longer than 5 characters.
    Using just features over the parent-child node pairs in the tree was not enough for high accuracy, because all attachment decisions were made outside of the context in which the words occurred.
    To solve this problem, we added two other types of features, which can be seen in Table 1c.
    Features of the first type look at words that occur between a child and its parent.
    These features take the form of a POS trigram: the POS of the parent, of the child, and of a word in between, for all words linearly between the parent and the child.
    This feature was particularly helpful for nouns identifying their parent, since node. p-pos: POS of parent node. c-pos: POS of child node. p-pos+1: POS to the right of parent in sentence. p-pos-1: POS to the left of parent. c-pos+1
