 lower value of &#945;.
    We also see that, for some cases, the value of &#945; has little effect on the level.
    We would expect there to be less change in the level of generalization for strongly selecting verbs, such as drink and eat, and a greater range of levels for weakly selecting verbs such as see.
    This is because any significant difference in probabilities is likely to be more marked for a strongly selecting verb, and likely to be significant over a wider range of &#945; values.
    The table only provides anecdotal evidence, but provides some support to this argument.
    To investigate more generally how the level of generalization varies with changes in &#945;, and also with changes in sample size, we took 6, 000 (c, v, obj) triples and calculated the difference in depth between c and top(c, v, r) for each triple.
    The 6, 000 triples were taken from the first experimental test set described in Section 7, and the training data from this experiment were used to provide the counts.
