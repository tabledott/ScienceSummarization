    PATR-II rules describe how to combine a sequence of constituents.
    X1 V, to form a constituent No, stating mutual constraints on the dags associated with the n + 1 constituents as unifications of various parts of the dags.
    For instance, we might have the following rule: By notational convention, we can eliminate unifications for the special feature cat (the atomic major category feature) recording this information implicitly by using it in the &amp;quot;name&amp;quot; of the constituent, e.g., If we require that this notational convention always be used (in so doing, guaranteeing that each constituent have an atomic major category associated with it), we have thereby mandated a context-free backbone to the grammar, and can then use standard context-free parsing algorithms to parse sentences relative to grammars in this formalism.
    Limiting to a context-free-based PATR-II is the solution that previous implementations have incorporated.
