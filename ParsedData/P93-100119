ath, and the candidate path with the best score is returned.
    Admittedly, this criterion may seem a bit ad hoc, but it seems to work well in practice.
    It has the desirable property that it favors paths with more matches over paths with fewer matches.
    It also favors shorter paths over longer paths.
    It might be possible to justify the optimization criterion using a model where the weights are interpreted as variances.
  
  
    The performance of char align is encouraging.
    The error rates are often very small, usually well within the length of a sentence or the length of a concordance line.
    The program is currently being used by translators to produce bilingual concordances for terminology research.
    For this application, it is necessary that the alignment program accept noisy (realistic) input, e.g., raw OCR output, with little or no manual cleanup.
    It is also highly desirable that the program produce constructive diagnostics when confronted with texts that don't align very well b
