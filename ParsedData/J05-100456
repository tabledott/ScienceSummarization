(2001) aim to automatically classify verbs into one of three categories: unergative, unaccusative, and object-drop.
  These three categories, more coarse-grained than the classes of Levin or VerbNet, are defined by the semantic roles they assign to a verb?s subjects and objects in both transitive and intransitive sentences, as illustrated by the following examples: Unergative: [ Causal Agent The jockey] raced [ Agent the horse] past the barn.
  [ Agent The horse] raced past the barn.
