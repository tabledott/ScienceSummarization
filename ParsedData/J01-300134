 This method would tag all content words in a sentence with their senses from a dictionary that contains textual definitions.
    However, it was found that the computations which would be necessary to test every combination of senses, even for a sentence of modest length, was prohibitive.
    The approach was made practical by Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthrie (1992) (see also (Wilks, Slator, and Guthrie 1996)).
    Rather than computing the overlap for all possible combinations of senses, an approximate solution is identified by the simulated annealing optimization algorithm (Metropolis et al. 1953).
    Although this algorithm is not guaranteed to find the global solution to an optimization problem, it has been shown to find solutions that are not significantly different from the optimal one (Press et al. 1988).
    Cowie et al. used LDOCE for their implementation and found it correctly disambiguated 47% of words to the sense level and 72% to the homograph level Bruce and Guthrie's hierarchy of LDOCE semantic co
