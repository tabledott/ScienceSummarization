ce the new error measure as well as existing approaches.
    The highest correlation with human assessment was achieved through linear interpolation of the new CDER with PER.
    Future work will aim at finding a suitable length penalty for CDER.
    In addition, more sophisticated definitions of the word-dependent substitution costs will be investigated.
    Furthermore, it will be interesting to see how this new error measure affects system development: We expect it to allow for a better sentence-wise error analysis.
    For system optimization, preliminary experiments have shown the need for a suitable length penalty.
