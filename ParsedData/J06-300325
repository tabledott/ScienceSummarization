er (2004) achieved improved results on this task by using the database of AltaVista&#8217;s search engine as a corpus.
    We believe that the intended sense of a polysemous word is determined by its semantic relations with the other words in the surrounding text.
    If we can identify the semantic relations between the given word and its context, then we can disambiguate the given word.
    Yarowsky&#8217;s (1993) observation that collocations are almost always monosemous is evidence for this view.
    Federici, Montemagni, and Pirrelli (1997) present an analogybased approach to word sense disambiguation.
    For example, consider the word plant.
    Out of context, plant could refer to an industrial plant or a living organism.
    Suppose plant appears in some text near food.
    A typical approach to disambiguating plant would compare the attributional similarity of food and industrial plant to the attributional similarity of food and living organism (Lesk 1986; Banerjee and Pedersen 2003).
