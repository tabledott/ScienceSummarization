additional advantages over previously presented isolated solutions.
    Most probabilistic parsers are based on a generalization of bottom-up chart parsing, such as the CYK algorithm.
    Partial parses are assembled just as in nonprobabilistic parsing (modulo possible pruning based on probabilities), while substring probabilities (also known as &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot; probabilities) can be computed in a straightforward way.
    Thus, the CYK chart parser underlies the standard solutions to problems (1) and (4) (Baker 1979), as well as (2) (Jelinek 1985).
    While the Jelinek and Lafferty (1991) solution to problem (3) is not a direct extension of CYK parsing, the authors nevertheless present their algorithm in terms of its similarities to the computation of inside probabilities.
    In our algorithm, computations for tasks (1) and (3) proceed incrementally, as the parser scans its input from left to right; in particular, prefix probabilities are available as soon as the prefix has been seen, and are upda
