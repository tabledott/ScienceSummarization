productions of the given rank.
    Figures 6 and 5 exemplify highest-cardinality productions of ranks 3 and 4, respectively.
    As we shall see in Section 5, however, bad binarization can worsen recognition complexity.
    The Binarization Rules apply deterministically,' but there are multiple ways to decompose the RHS of a non- DEPEND production into nested Some decompositions may give rise to more discontinuities than others.
    Let the cardinality of an RTV be the total number of partitions in all its components, and let the cardinality of a decomposithe cardinality of the RTVs that it contains.
    A minimizing decomposition for a given production is one of those with lowest cardi- Then, the cardinality of a production cardinality of its minimizing decomposition. cardinality of a production is bounded by its rank, as Table 1 shows for the 2D case.
    Finally, the caran MTG the maximum of the cardinalities of its productions.
