he backoff analysis, unanalyzed words are distinguished for us only by the larger number of possible analyses (making it harder to choose the correct analysis).
    There are not many unanalyzed words in our corpus.
    In TR1, there are only 22 such words, presumably because the Buckwalter lexicon our morphological analyzer uses was developed onTR1.
    In TR2, we have 737 words without analysis (0.61% of the entire corpus, giving us a coverage of about 99.4% on domainsimilar text for the Buckwalter lexicon).
    In ATB1, and to a lesser degree in ATB2, some words have been given no morphological analysis.
    (These cases are not necessarily the same words that our morphological analyzer cannot analyze.)
    The POS tag assigned to these words is then NO FUNC.
    In TR1 (138,756 words), we have 3,088 NO FUNC POS labels (2.2%).
    In TR2 (168,296 words), the number of NO FUNC labels has been reduced to 853 (0.5%).
    Since for these cases, there is no meaningful solution in the data, we have removed them
