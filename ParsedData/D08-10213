umber of research efforts have focused on employing syntactic constraints in statistical machine translation.
    Wu (1997) introduced the inversion transduction grammar formalism which treats translation as a process of parallel parsing of the source and target language via a synchronized grammar.
    The synchronized grammar places constraints on which words can be aligned across bilingual sentence pairs.
    To achieve computational efficiency, the original proposal used only a single non-terminal label rather than a linguistic grammar.
    Subsequent work used more articulated parses to improve alignment quality by applying cohesion constraints (Fox, 2002; Lin and Cherry, 2002).
    If two English phrases are in disjoint subtrees in the parse, then the phrasal cohesion constraint prevents them from being aligned to overlapping sequences in the foreign sentence.
    Other recent work has incorporated constituent and dependency subtrees into the translation rules used by phrase-based systems (Galley et al.,
