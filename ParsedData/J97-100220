 is to give enough information to study relationships between game structure and other aspects of dialogue while keeping those relationships simple enough to code.
    Transaction coding gives the subdialogue structure of complete task-oriented dialogues, with each transaction being built up of several dialogue games and corresponding to one step of the task.
    In most Map Task dialogues, the participants break the route into manageable segments and deal with them one by one.
    Because transaction structure for Map Task dialogues is so closely linked to what the participants do with the maps, the maps are included in the analysis.
    The coding system has two components: (1) how route givers divide conveying the route into subtasks and what parts of the dialogue serve each of the subtasks, and (2) what actions the route follower takes and when.
    The basic route giver coding identifies the start and end of each segment and the subdialogue that conveys that route segment.
    However, Map Task participa
