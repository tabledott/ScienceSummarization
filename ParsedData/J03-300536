    The experiments reported in this article were carried out using the WebExp software package (Keller et al. 1998).
    A series of previous studies has shown that data obtained using WebExp closely replicate results obtained in a controlled laboratory setting; this has been demonstrated for acceptability judgments (Keller and Alexopoulou 2001), coreference judgments (Keller and Asudeh 2001), and sentence completions (Corley and Scheepers 2002).
    In the present experiments, subjects were presented with bigram pairs and were asked to rate the degree of plausibility proportional to a modulus item.

    The concept of plausibility was not defined, but examples of plausible and implausible bigrams were given (different examples for each stimulus set).
    Then subjects were asked to fill in a questionnaire with basic demographic information.
    The experiment proper consisted of three phases: (1)
