implication that these sentences function together coherently as a full paragraph.
    As with the other statistical approaches, this work is aimed at summarization of single articles.
    Work presented at the 1997 ACL Workshop on Intelligent Scalable Text Summarization primarily focused on the use of sentence extraction.
    Alternatives to the use of frequency of key phrases included the identification and representation of lexical chains (Halliday and Hasan 1976) to find the major themes of an article followed by the extraction of one or two sentences per chain (Barzilay and Elhadad 1997), training over the position of summary sentences in the full article (Hovy and Lin 1997), and the construction of a graph of important topics to identify paragraphs that should be extracted (Mitra, Singhal, and Buckley 1997).
    While most of the work in this category focuses on summarization of single articles, early work is beginning to emerge on summarization across multiple documents.
