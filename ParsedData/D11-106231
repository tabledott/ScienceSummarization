; methodology based on crowdsourcing.
    Our approach presents several key innovations with respect to the related works on TE data acquisition.
    These include the decomposition of a complex content generation task in a pipeline of simpler subtasks accessible to a large crowd of non-experts, and the integration of quality control mechanisms at each stage of the process.
    The result of our work is the first large-scale dataset containing both monolingual and cross-lingual corpora for several combinations of texts-hypotheses in English, Italian, and German.
    Among the advantages of our method it is worth mentioning: i) the full alignment between the created corpora, ii) the possibility to easily extend the dataset to new languages, and iii) the feasibility of creating general-purpose corpora, featuring multi-directional entailment relations, that subsume the traditional RTE-like annotation.
