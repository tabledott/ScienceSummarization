 into c, in particular the edge (b, c)c. Thus, for any node a, there is a single path directed out of it to a single leaf c E C. We can then state that the only non-zero weighted dependency graph is one where each a E A, b E B and c E C occurs in exactly one of m disjoint paths from the root of the form 0 &#8212;* a &#8212;* b &#8212;* c. This is because the label of the single edge going into node a will determine exactly the node b that the one outgoing edge from a must go into.
    The label of that edge determines exactly the single outgoing edge from b into some node c. Now, since the weighting function ensures that the only non-zero weighted paths into any leaf node c correspond directly to elements of S, each of the m disjoint paths represent a single tuple in a 3DM.
    Thus, if there is a non-zero weighted graph in T(G), then it must directly correspond to a valid 3DM, which concludes the proof.
    Note that any dth order Markovization can be embedded into a d + 1th Markovization.
    Thus, this res
