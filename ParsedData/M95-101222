pened because we did not successfully identify "McCann" as an organization, thus precluding the formation of the job-out phrase .
  Learning Phrase Rules We have applied the same general error-reduction learning approach that Brill designed for generating part-of-speech rules to the problem of learning phraser rules in support of the NE task.
  The official version of Alembic for MUC-6 did not use any of the rule sequences generated by this phrase rule learner, but we hav e since generated unofficial scores .
  In these runs we used phrase rules that had been learned for the ENAMEX expressions only?we still used the hand-coded pre-processors and phraser rules for recognizing TIMEX and NUMEX phrases .
  Our performance on this task is shown in Fig .
  These rules yield six fewer points o f P&amp;R than the hand-coded ENAMEX rules?still an impressive result for machine-learned rules .
  Interestingly, the bulk of the additional error in the machine-learned rules is not with the "hard" organization names, but wi
