replaces the type in the pair.
    Since we do this replacement for entity types, we also add a similar feature for mention types here.
    These features are boolean: For any given pair, a feature is active if that pair describes the example.
  
  
    Many of our features are similar to those described in Culotta et al. (2007).
    This includes Mention Types, String Relation Features, Gender and Number Match, WordNet Features, Alias, Apposition, Relative Pronoun, and Both Mentions Speak.
    The implementations of those features may vary from those of other systems.
    Anaphoricity has been proposed as a part of the model in several systems, including Ng and Cardie (2002a), but we are not aware of it being used as a feature for a learning algorithm.
    Distances have been used in e.g.
    Luo et al. (2004).
    However, we are not aware of any system using the number of compatible mentions as a distance.
  
  
    We use the official ACE 2004 English training data (NIST, 2004).
