ll discuss only one segmentation.
    Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 Figure 3 lists the primary component of the DSP for each of these segments and Figure 4 shows the dominance relationships that hold among these intentions.
    In Section 7 we discuss additional components of the discourse segment purpose; because these additional components are more important for completeness of the theory than for determining the essential dominance and satisfaction-precedence relationships between DSPs, we omit such details here.
