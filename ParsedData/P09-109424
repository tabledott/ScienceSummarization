a uniform model, rather than presenting distinct methods for each application.
    (3) It uses multiple resources, including paraphrase phrases, patterns, and collocations, to relieve data shortage and generate more varied and interesting paraphrases.
    Our future work will be carried out along two directions.
    First, we will improve the components of the method, especially the paraphrase planning algorithm.
    The algorithm currently used is simple but greedy, which may miss some useful paraphrase units.
    Second, we will extend the method to other applications, We hope it can serve as a universal framework for most if not all applications.
