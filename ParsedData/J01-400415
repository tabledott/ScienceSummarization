his inaccuracy by first preprocessing a headline to correct the capitalization before passing it into the pipeline of NLP modules.
    Only those markables in the headline that appear in the text body as proper names have their capitalization changed to match those found in the text body.
    All other headline markables are changed to lowercase.
    Consider a coreference chain Al - A2 - A3 - A4 found in an annotated training document.
    Only pairs of noun phrases in the chain that are immediately adjacent (i.e., Al A2, A2 - A3, and A3 - A4) are used to generate the positive training examples.
    The first noun phrase in a pair is always considered the antecedent, while the second is the anaphor.
    On the other hand, negative training examples are extracted as follows.
    Between the two members of each antecedent-anaphor pair, there are other markables extracted by our language-processing modules that either are not found in any coreference chain or appear in other chains.
    Each of them is then pai
