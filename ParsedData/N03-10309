rpus to estimate the likelihood of inserting a discourse boundary between word and the next word using formula (1), where the numerator represents all the counts of the rule for which a discourse boundary has been inserted after word , and the denominator represents all the counts of the rule.
    Because we want to account for boundaries that are motivated lexically as well, the counts used in formula (1) are defined over lexicalized rules.
    Without lexicalization, the syntactic context alone is too general and fails to distinguish genuine cases of discourse boundaries from incorrect ones.
    As can be seen in Figure 3, the same syntactic context may indicate a discourse boundary when the lexical heads passed and without are present, but it may not indicate a boundary when the lexical heads priced and at are present.
    The discourse segmentation model uses the corpus presented in Section 2 in order to estimate probabilities for inserting discourse boundaries using equation (1).
    We also use a simple
