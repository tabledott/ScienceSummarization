ion of categories (for &#960;) and the priors for the individual coders (for &#954;) have to be estimated from the observed data.
    Table 2 demonstrates the effect of the different chance models on the coefficient values.
    The remainder of this section explains how the three coefficients are calculated when the reliability data come from two coders; we will discuss a variety of proposed generalizations starting in Section 2.5.
    2.4.1 All Categories Are Equally Likely: S. The simplest way of discounting for chance is the one adopted to compute the coefficient S (Bennett, Alpert, and Goldstein 1954), also known in the literature as C, &#954;n, G, and RE (see Zwick 1988; Hsu and Field 2003).
    As noted previously, the computation of S is based on an interpretation of chance as a random choice of category from a uniform distribution&#8212;that is, all categories are equally likely.
    If coders classify the items into k categories, then the chance P(k|ci) of any coder assigning an item to category k un
