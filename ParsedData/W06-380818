labeled examples.
    Note that the SSL algorithm appears to be quite sensitive to the similarity measure used to form the graph on which it is based.
    In the experiments where we used mutual-information weighted word vector similarity (reg+WV and SSL+WV), we notice that reg+WV remained on par with reg+PSP at high labeled set sizes, whereas SSL+WV appears significantly worse in most of these cases.
    It is clear that PSP is the more reliable similarity measure.
    SSL uses the similarity measure in more ways than the metric labeling approaches (i.e., SSL&#8217;s graph is denser), so it is not surprising that SSL&#8217;s accuracy would suffer more with an inferior similarity measure.
    Unfortunately, our SSL approach did not do as well with large labeled set sizes.
    We believe this is due to two factors: a) the baseline SVM regressor trained on a large labeled set can achieve fairly high accuracy for this difficult task without considering pairwise relationships between examples; b) PSP similarity i
