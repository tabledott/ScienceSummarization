 cutoff points on S(i) were set to &#964; = 0.4 for TREC and &#964; = 0.3 for CHEM.
    The figures show that this cutoff is far from the maximum F-score.
    An interesting avenue of future work would be to automatically determine the proper threshold for each individual generic pattern instead of setting a uniform threshold.
    5 We can directly compute recall here since we built a gold standard for each set of 100 samples.
  
  
    We proposed a weakly-supervised, generalpurpose, and accurate algorithm, called Espresso, for harvesting binary semantic relations from raw text.
    The main contributions are: i) a method for exploiting generic patterns by filtering incorrect instances using the Web; and ii) a principled measure of pattern and instance reliability enabling the filtering algorithm.
    We have empirically compared Espresso&#8217;s precision and recall with other systems on both a small domain-specific textbook and on a larger corpus of general news, and have extracted several standard and spe
