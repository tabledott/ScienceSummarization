and English sounds.
    For example, English P and B are both mapped into Arabic &#8220; b&#8221;; Arabic &#8220; h. &#8221; and &#8220; h-&#8221; into English H; and so on.
    Stalls and Knight (1998) present an Arabic-toEnglish back-transliteration system based on the source-channel framework.
    The transliteration process is based on a generative model of how an English name is transliterated into Arabic.
    It consists of several steps, each is defined as a probabilistic model represented as a finite state machine.
    First, an English word is generated according to its unigram probabilities .
    Then, the English word is pronounced with probability , which is collected directly from an English pronunciation dictionary.
    Finally, the English phoneme sequence is converted into Arabic writing with probability The transliterations proposed by this model are generally accurate.
    However, one serious limitation of this method is that only English words with known pronunciations can be produced.
