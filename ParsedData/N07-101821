dure using the yields alone, the accuracy of the parses uniformly decreases while the (posterior) likelihood uniformly in creases with each iteration, demonstrating that improving the (posterior) likelihood of such models does not improve parse accuracy.
			144 We used an implementation of the Hastings sampler described in Section 5 to infer morphological parses t for a corpus w of 2,283 unsegmented Sesothoverb types extracted from the Sesotho corpus avail able from CHILDES (MacWhinney and Snow, 1985; Demuth, 1992).
			We chose this corpus because thewords have been morphologically segmented manually, making it possible for us to evaluate the morphological parses produced by our system.
			We constructed a CFG G containing the following produc tions Word ? V Word ? V M Word ? SM V M Word ? SM T V M Word ? SM T OM V Mtogether with productions expanding the preterminals SM,T,OM,V and M to each of the 16,350 dis tinct substrings occuring anywhere in the corpus, producting a grammar with 81,755 productions inall.
