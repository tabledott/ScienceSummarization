loped a methodology for producing such a corpus at 90% inter-annotator agreement, and will release completed segments beginning in early 2007.
    The OntoNotes project focuses on a domain independent representation of literal meaning that includes predicate structure, word sense, ontology linking, and coreference.
    Pilot studies have shown that these can all be annotated rapidly and with better than 90% consistency.
    Once a substantial and accurate training corpus is available, trained algorithms can be developed to predict these structures in new documents.
    This process begins with parse (TreeBank) and propositional (PropBank) structures, which provide normalization over predicates and their arguments.
    Word sense ambiguities are then resolved, with each word sense also linked to the appropriate node in the Omega ontology.
    Coreference is also annotated, allowing the entity mentions that are propositional arguments to be resolved in context.
    Annotation will cover multiple languages (Engl
