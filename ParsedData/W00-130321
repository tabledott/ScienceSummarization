e want to reconsider them, all we have to do is just to change the Kernel function.
    The computational complexity depends on the number of support vectors not on the dimension of the Kernel function.
    The simplest and most effective way to achieve better accuracy is to increase the training data.
    However, the proposed method that uses all candidates that form dependency relation requires a great amount of time to compute the separating hyperplane as the size of the training data increases.
    The experiments given in this paper have actually taken long training time 3.
    To handle large size of training data, we have to select only the related portion of examples that are effective for the analysis.
    This will reduce the training overhead as well as the analysis time.
    The committee-based approach discussed section 4.7 is one method of coping with this problem.
    For future research, to reduce the computational overhead, we will work on methods for sample selection as follows: Some pairs
