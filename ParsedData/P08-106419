easily explained by the fact that when h = 1, only monotonic search is conducted, while h =2 allows non-terminals to be leaf nodes, thus introducing preliminary structure features to the search and allowing non-monotonic search.
    2) Internal structures and large span (due to h increasing) are also useful as attested by the gain of 0.86 (26.14-25.28) Blue score when the value of h increases from 2 to 4.
    Fig.
    6 studies the impact on performance by setting different maximal tree number (d) in a rule.
    It further indicates that: 1) Tree sequence rules (d &gt;1) are useful and even more helpful if we limit the tree depth to no more than two (lower line, h=2).
    However, tree sequence rules consisting of more than three subtrees have almost no contribution to the performance improvement.
    This is mainly due to data sparseness issue when d &gt;3.
    2) Even if only two-layer sub-trees (lower line) are allowed, our method still outperforms STSG and Moses when d&gt;1.
    This further validates the
