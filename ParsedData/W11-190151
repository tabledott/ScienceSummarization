cumentation that comes with the SEMEVAL data package from LDC (LDC2011T01) states: &#8220;Only nominal mentions and identical (IDENT) types were taken from the OntoNotes coreference annotation, thus excluding coreference We also explored performance when the systems were provided with the gold mention boundaries, that is, with the exact spans (expressed in terms of token offsets) for all of the NP constituents in the human-annotated parse trees for the test data.
    Systems could use this additional data to ensure that the output mention spans in their entity chains would not clash with those in the answer set.
    Since this was a secondary evaluation, it was an optional element, and not all participants ran their systems on this task variation.
    The results for those systems that did participate in this optional task are shown in Tables 14 (closed track) and 15 (open track).
    Most of the better scoring systems did supply these results.
    While all systems did slightly better here in terms of raw sc
