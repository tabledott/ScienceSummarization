7%, respectively (as compared to a gold standard generate from an idiom dictionary&#8212;but see below for discussion).
    Schone &amp; Jurafsky (2001) evaluated a number of co-occurrence-based metrics for identifying MWEs, showing that, as suggested by Lin&#8217;s results, there was need for improvement in this area.
    Since LSA has been used in a number of meaning-related language tasks to good effect (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Landauer and Psotka, 2000; Cederberg and Widdows, 2003), they had hoped to improve their results by identify non-compositional expressions using a method similar to that which we are exploring here.
    Although they do not demonstrate that this method actually identifies non-compositional expressions, they do show that the LSA similarity technique only improves MWE identification minimally.
    Baldwin et al., (2003) focus more narrowly on distinguishing English noun-noun compounds and verb-particle constructions which are compositional from those which are not compositional.
