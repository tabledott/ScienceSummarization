    We conjecture this is because methods based on compositional semantics can handle the scope of negators more adequately.
    &#8226; Among the learning-based methods, those that involve compositional inference (CCI-COMPO) always perform better than those that do not (SC) for any boundaries.
    And learning with compositional inference tend to perform better than the rigid application of heuristic rules (COMPO), although the relative performance gain decreases once the boundaries are relaxed.
  
  
    The task focused on in this paper is similar to that of Wilson et al. (2005) in that the general goal of the task is to determine the polarity in context at a subsentence level.
    However, Wilson et al. (2005) formulated the task differently by limiting their evaluation to individual words that appear in their polarity lexicon.
    Also, their approach was based on a flat bag of features, and only a few examples of what we call content-word negators were employed.
    Our use of compositional semantics f
