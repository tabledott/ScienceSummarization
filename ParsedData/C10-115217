llowing the work of Yamada and Knight (2001), we train our model by maximizing P (s|c) over the training corpuswith the EM algorithm described in Alg.
			2, us ing a constructed graph structure.
			We develop the Training Tree (Fig.
			6) to calculate P (s|c).
			P (s|c) is equal to the inside probability of the root in theTraining Tree.
			Alg.
			3 and Alg.
			4 are used to calculate the inside and outside probabilities.
			We re fer readers to Yamada and Knight (2001) for more details.
