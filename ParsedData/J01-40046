    The nested noun phrase extraction module subsequently accepts the noun phrases and determines the nested phrases for each noun phrase.
    The nested noun phrases are divided into two groups: Finally, the markables needed for coreference resolution are the union of the noun phrases, named entities, and nested noun phrases found.
    For markables without any named entity type, semantic class is determined by the semantic class determination module.
    More details regarding this module are given in the description of the semantic class agreement feature.
    To achieve acceptable recall for coreference resolution, it is most critical that the eligible candidates for coreference be identified correctly in the first place.
    In order to test our system's effectiveness in determining the markables, we attempted to match the markables generated by our system against those appearing in the coreference chains annotated in 100 SGML documents, a subset of the training docume
