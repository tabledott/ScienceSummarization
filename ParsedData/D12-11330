  A Transition-Based System for Joint Part-of-Speech Tagging and Labeled Non-Projective Dependency Parsing
  
    Most current dependency parsers presuppose that input words have been morphologically disambiguated using a part-of-speech tagger before parsing begins.
    We present a transitionbased system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with nonprojective trees.
    Experimental evaluation on Chinese, Czech, English and German shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy when compared to a pipeline system, which lead to improved state-of-theart results for all languages.
  
  
    Dependency-based syntactic parsing has been the focus of intense research efforts during the last decade, and the state of the art today is represented by globally normalized discriminative models that are induced using structured learning.
    Graphbased models parameterize the parsing problem by the structure of the dependency graph and normally use dynamic programming for inf
