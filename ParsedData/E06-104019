 disagree on their quality.
    This appears to indicate that corpus quality is not ideal.
    If an imperfect corpus is used as the gold standard for the automatic metrics, then high correlation with human judgments is less likely, and this may explain the difference in human and automatic scores for SUMTIME-Hybrid.
  
  
    If we assume that the human evaluation scores are the most valid, then the automatic metrics do not do a good job of comparing the knowledge-based SUMTIME system to the statistical systems.
    One reason for this could be that there are cases where SUMTIME deliberately does not choose the most common option in the corpus, because its developers believed that it was not the best for readers.
    For example, in Table 1, the human forecasters and pCRU-greedy use the phrase by late evening to refer to 0000, pCRU-2gram uses the phrase later, while SUMTIME-Hybrid uses the phrase by midnight.
    The pCRU choices reflect frequency in the SUMTIME corpus: later (837 instances) and by late even
