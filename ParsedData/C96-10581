  1 In t roduct ion In recent years, the statistical parsing community has begun to reach out; for syntactic formalisms that recognize the individuality of words, l,ink grammars (Sleator and Pemperley, 1991) and lex- icalized tree-adjoining ranunars (Schabes, 1992) have now received stochastic treatments.
  Other researchers, not wishing to abandon context-flee grammar (CI"G) but disillusioned with its lexica] blind spot, have tried to re-parameterize stochas- tic CI"G in context-sensitive ways (Black et al., 1992) or have augmented the formalism with lex- ical headwords (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 11996).
  In this paper, we 1)resent a [lexible l)robat)ilistic parser that simultaneously assigns both part-of- sl)eech tags and a bare-bones dependency struc- ture (illustrate.d in l!igure 1).
  The choice o t a simple syntactic structure is deliberate: we would like to ask some basic questions about where hx- ical relationships al)pear and how best, to exploit *This ma
