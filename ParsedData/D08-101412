, which is then used to label the test data.
    We evaluate the results against a gold-standard corpus consisting of 504 Romanian sentences manually annotated for subjectivity.
    These sentences represent the manual translation into Romanian of a small subset of the SemCor corpus, which was removed from the training corpora used in experiments two and three.
    This is the same evaluation dataset as used in (Mihalcea et al., 2007).
    Two Romanian native speakers annotated the sentences individually, and the differences were adjudicated through discussions.
    The agreement of the two annotators is 0.83% (&#954; = 0.67); when the uncertain annotations are removed, the agreement rises to 0.89 (&#954; = 0.77).
    The two annotators reached consensus on all sentences for which they disagreed, resulting in a gold standard dataset with 272 (54%) subjective sentences and 232 (46%) objective sentences.
    More details about this dataset are available in (Mihalcea et al., 2007).
