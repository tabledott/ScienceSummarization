ments we obtained training data cheaply, this will not generally be the case and some effort will have to be invested in collecting appropriate data with coherence ratings.
    We thus address two questions: (1) How much training data is required for achieving satisfactory performance?
    (2) How domain sensitive are the entity-grid models?
    In other words, does their performance degrade gracefully when applied to out-of-domain texts?
    Figure 1 shows learning curves for the best performing model (Coreference+ Syntax+Salience+) on the Earthquakes and Accidents corpora.
    We observe that the amount of data required depends on the domain at hand.
    The Accidents texts are more repetitive and therefore less training data is required to achieve good performance.
    The Learning curves for the entity-based model Coreference+Syntax+Salience+ on the Earthquakes and Accidents corpora. learning curve is steeper for the Earthquakes documents.
    Irrespective of the domain differences, the model reaches good
