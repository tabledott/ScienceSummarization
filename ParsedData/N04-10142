    It is useful to understand generic algorithms that may support all these tasks and more.
    (Rounds, 1970) and (Thatcher, 1970) independently introduced tree transducers as a generalization of FSTs.
    Rounds was motivated by natural language.
    The Rounds tree transducer is very similar to a left-to-right FST, except that it works top-down, pursuing subtrees in parallel, with each subtree transformed depending only on its own passed-down state.
    This class of transducer is often nowadays called R, for &#8220;Root-to-frontier&#8221; (G&#233;cseg and Steinby, 1984).
    Rounds uses a mathematics-oriented example of an R transducer, which we summarize in Figure 1.
    At each point in the top-down traversal, the transducer chooses a production to apply, based only on the current state and the current root symbol.
    The traversal continues until there are no more state-annotated nodes.
    Nondeterministic transducers may have several productions with the same lef
