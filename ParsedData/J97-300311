I VBD VBN).
    Since the mutative segment can be an empty string, regular morphological formations can be captured as well.
    For instance, the rule says that if segmenting the prefix un from an unknown word results in a word that is found in the lexicon as a past verb and participle (VBD VBN), we conclude that the unknown word is an adjective (n).
    This rule will, for instance, correctly classify the word unscrewed if the word screwed is listed in the lexicon as (VBD VBN).
    When setting the S segment to an empty string and the M segment to a non-empty string, the schemata allows for cases when a secondary form is listed in the lexicon and the base form is not.
    For instance, the rule e[&#8212;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; +ed ?
    (VBD VBN) &#8212;(VB VBP)] says that if adding the segment ed to the end of an unknown word results in a word that is found in the lexicon as a past verb and participle (VBD VBN), then the unknown word is a base or non-3d present verb (VB VBP).
    The general schemata can also
