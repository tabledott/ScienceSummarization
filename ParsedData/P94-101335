al-purpose algorithm for lexical ambiguity resolution that is perspicuous, easy to implement, flexible and applied quickly to new domains.
    It incorporates class-based models at several levels, and while it requires no special lexical resources or linguistic knowledge, it effectively and transparently incorporates those which are available.
    It successfully integrates part-of-speech patterns with local and longer-distance collocational information to resolve both semantic and syntactic ambiguities.
    Finally, although the case study of accent restoration in Spanish and French was chosen for its diversity of ambiguity types and plentiful source of data for fully automatic and objective evaluation, the algorithm solves a worthwhile problem in its own right with promising commercial potential.
