 assume the language-independent value c 1, which simplifies the program considerably.
    This value would clearly be inappropriate for English&#8212;Chinese alignment, but it seems likely to be useful for most pairs of European languages. s2 is estimated from Figure 3.
    The model assumes that s2 is proportional to length.
    The constant of proportionality is determined by the slope of the robust regression line shown in the figure.
    The result for English&#8212;German is s2 = 7.3, and for English&#8212; French is s2 5.6.
    Again, we will see that the difference in the two slopes is not too important.
    Therefore, we can combine the data across languages, and adopt the simpler language-independent estimate s2 6.8, which is what is actually used in the program.
    We now appeal to Bayes Theorem to estimate Prob(match I S) as a constant times Prob(S I match) Prob(match).
    The constant can be ignored since it will be the same for where Prob(I6I) is the probability that a random variable, z, with
