t al. (2005); we compute external features from the same unlabeled data, 1.1 million sentence pairs.
    Our second is the Chinese-English hand-aligned portion of the 2002 NIST MT evaluation set.
    This dataset has 491 sentences, which we split into a training set of 150 and a test set of 191.
    When we trained external Chinese models, we used the same unlabeled data set as DeNero and Klein (2007), including the bilingual dictionary.
    For likelihood based models, we set the L2 regularization parameter, U2, to 100 and the threshold for posterior decoding to 0.33.
    We report results using the simple ITG grammar (ITG-S, Section 2.2) where summing over derivations double counts alignments, as well as the normal form ITG grammar (ITG-N,Section 4.1) which does not double count.
    We ran our annealed lossaugmented MIRA for 15 iterations, beginning with A at 0 and increasing it linearly to 0.5.
    We compute Viterbi alignments using the averaged weight vector from this procedure.
