ocally consistent: e.g., the beliefs at factors TAGLINKij and TAGLINKik must both imply9 the same belief about variable Ti, their common neighbor.
    This iterated negotiation among the factors is handled by message passing along the edges of the factor graph.
    A message to or from a variable is a (possibly unnormalized) probability distribution over the values of that variable.
    The variable V sends a message to factor F, saying &#8220;My other neighboring factors G jointly suggest that I have posterior distribution qV ,F (assuming that they are sending me independent evidence).&#8221; Meanwhile, factor F sends messages to V , saying, &#8220;Based on my factor function and the messages received from my other neighboring variables U about their values (and assuming that those messages are independent), I suggest you have posterior distribution rF,V over your values.&#8221; To be more precise, BP at each iteration k (until convergence) updates two kinds of messages: from factors to variables.
