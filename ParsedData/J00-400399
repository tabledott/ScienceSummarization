    Definite descriptions are represented as quantified terms.
    The referential readings of definite descriptions are handled by proposing referents from the external application context (larger situation uses) as well as the CLE context model (anaphoric uses).
    Attributive readings may also be proposed during QLF resolution; some of these seem to correspond to our unfamiliar uses.
    Thus, the CLE seems to account for discourse-new descriptions, although they are not explicitly mentioned, and the methods used for choosing a referential or an attributive interpretation are not discussed.
    To our knowledge, no analysis of the performance of the system has been published.
    The seven systems that participated in the MUC-6 competition can all be quantitatively evaluated; they achieved recall scores ranging from 35.69% to 62.78% and precision scores ranging from 4-4.23% to 71.88% on nominal coreference.
    It is important to note that the evaluation in MUC-6 differed from ours in three
