oject4.
    They then sent training and testing queries to internet search engines to retrieve the top pages in these directories.
    The positions of the result pages in the directory hierarchies as well as the words in the pages are used to classify the queries.
    With phrasal clusters, we can achieve top-level performance without manually constructed resources, or having to rely on internet search results.
  
  
    In earlier work on semi-supervised learning, e.g., (Blum and Mitchell 1998), the classifiers learned from unlabeled data were used directly.
    Recent research shows that it is better to use whatever is learned from the unlabeled data as features in a discriminative classifier.
    This approach is taken by (Miller et. al.
    2004), (Wong and Ng 2007), (Suzuki and Isozaki 2008), and (Koo et. al., 2008), as well as this paper.
    Wong and Ng (2007) and Suzuki and Isozaki (2008) are similar in that they run a baseline discriminative classifier on unlabeled data to generate pseudo examples,
