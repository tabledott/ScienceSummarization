turally occurring coherent texts, by their nature, contain many instances of related pairs of words (Halliday and Hasan 1976; Morris and Hirst 1991; Hoey 1991; Morris and Hirst 2004).
  That is, they implicitly contain human judgments of relatedness that we could use in the evaluation of our relatedness measures.
  But, of course, we don?t know in practice just which pairs of words in a text are and aren?t related.
  We can get around this problem, however, by deliberately perturbing the coherence of the text ?
  that is, introduding semantic anomalies such as malapropisms ?
  and looking at the ability of the different relatedness measures to detect and correct the perturbations.
  5.1 Malapropism Detection and Correction as a Testbed Our malapropism corrector (Hirst and Budanitsky 2005) is based on the idea behind that of Hirst and St-Onge (1998): Look for semantic anomalies that can be removed by small changes to spelling.16 Words are (crudely) disambiguated where possible by accepting senses that are sema
