 together in the corpus.
    Ideally, in order to identify lexical relations in a corpus one would need to first parse it to verify that the words are used in a single phrase structure.
    However, in practice, free-style texts contain a great deal of nonstandard features over which automatic parsers would fail.'
    Fortunately, there is strong lexicographic evidence that most syntagmatic lexical relations relate words separated by at most five other words (Martin, Al, and Van Sterkenburg 1983).
    In other words, most of the lexical relations involving a word w can be retrieved by examining the neighborhood of w, wherever it occurs, within a span of five (-5 and +5 around w) words.'
    In the work presented here, we use this simplification and consider that two words co-occur if they are in a single sentence and if there are fewer than five words between them.
    In this first stage, we thus use only statistical methods to identify relevant pairs of words.
    These techniques are based on the assumptio
