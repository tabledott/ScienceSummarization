 a scale relative to the neutral element or to the extremes of the scale (Bolinger, 1977).
    The common problem with these methods is that they are designed to be applied by a human who incorporates the two adjectives in specific sentential frames (e.g.
    &amp;quot;X is warm, even hot&amp;quot;) and assesses the semantic validity of the resulting sentences.
    Such tests cannot be used computationally to identify scales in a domain, since the specific sentences do not occur frequently enough in a corpus to produce an adequate description of the adjectival scales in the domain (Smadja, 1991).
    As scales vary across domains, the task of compiling such information is compounded.
  
  
    Our algorithm, whose overall architecture is depicted in Figure 1, operates in four stages.
    First, we extract linguistic data from the parsed corpus in the form of syntactically related word pairs, or, more generally, sequences of syntactically related words; this co-occurrence information is processed by a morpholo
