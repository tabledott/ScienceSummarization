ld place an enormous additional load on the analyst.
    Leech and Garside (1991) discuss the problems that arise in manual parsing of corpora concerning accuracy and consistency of analyses across time and analyst, the labor-intensive nature of producing detailed analyses, and so forth.
    They advocate an approach in which simple 'skeleton' parses are produced by hand from previously tagged material, with checking for consistency between analysts.
    These skeleton analyses can then be augmented automatically with further information implicit in the lexical tags.
    While this approach may well be the best that can be achieved with fully manual techniques, it is still unsatisfactory in several respects.
    Firstly, the analyses are crude, while we would like to automatically parse with a grammar capable of assigning sophisticated semantically interpretable ones; but it is not clear how to train an existing grammar with such unrelated analyses.
    Secondly, the quality of any grammar obtained automatica
