re of our model suits languages that exhibit less monotone reordering.
    Figure 5 shows the projected alignment of a headline from the thousandth sample on the NIST Chinese data set.
    The effect of the grammar based alignment can clearly be seen.
    Where the combination of GIZA++ and the heuristics creates outlier alignments that impede rule extraction, the SCFG imposes a more rigid hierarchical structure on the alignments.
    We hypothesise that this property may be particularly useful for syntactic translation models which often have difficulty with inconsistent word alignments not corresponding to syntactic structure.
    The combined evidence of the ability of our Gibbs sampler to improve posterior likelihood (Figure 6) and our translation experiments demonstrate that we have developed a scalable and effective method for performing inference over phrasal SCFG, without compromising the strong theoretical underpinnings of our model.
