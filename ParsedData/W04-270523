Manville, ARGM-ADV = possible A procedure can compare the NOMLEX-PLUS entry for each noun to each annotated instance of that noun to check for incompatibilities.
    Illformedness Impossible instances are ruled out.
    Checks are made to make sure obligatory labels (REL) are present and illegal labels are not.
    Similarly, procedures make sure that infinitive arguments are marked with the -PRD function tag (a PropBank convention).
    Probable Illformedness Certain configurations of role labels are possible, but very unlikely.
