    This greedy algorithm gave an initial segmentation score of F=48.2 on the test set.
    Our rule-based algorithm learned a sequence of 731 transformations which improved the score from 48.2 to 63.6, a 29.7% error reduction.
    While the alphabetic system is obviously harder to segment, we still see a significant reduction in the segmenter error rate using the transformation-based algorithm.
    Nevertheless, it is doubtful that a segmentation with a score of 63.6 would be useful in too many applications, and this result will need to be significantly improved.
    Although English is not an unsegmented language, the writing system is alphabetic like Thai and the average word length is similar.'
    Since English language resources (e.g. word lists and morphological analyzers) are more readily available, it is instructive to experiment with a de-segmented English corpus, that is, English texts in which the spaces have been removed and word boundaries are not explicitly indicated
