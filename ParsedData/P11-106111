    A very small excerpt from an Italian-English graph is shown in Figure 1.
    As one can see, only the trigrams [suo incarceramento ,], [suo iter ,] and [suo carattere ,] are connected to English words.
    In this particular case, all English vertices are labeled as nouns by the supervised tagger.
    In general, the neighborhoods can be more diverse and we allow a soft label distribution over the vertices.
    It is worth noting that the middle words of the Italian trigrams are nouns too, which exhibits the fact that the similarity metric connects types having the same syntactic category.
    In the label propagation stage, we propagate the automatic English tags to the aligned Italian trigram types, followed by further propagation solely among the Italian vertices. the Italian vertices are connected to an automatically labeled English vertex.
    Label propagation is used to propagate these tags inwards and results in tag distributions for the middle word of each Italian trigram.
