teresting correlations between some pairs of frequent words in the two languages using Models 1 and 2, as we will see later (in Figure 5), these models often lead to unsatisfactory alignments.
    In Models 3, 4, and 5, we develop the French string by choosing, for each word in the English string, first the number of words in the French string that will be connected to it, then the identity of these French words, and finally the actual positions in the French string that these words will occupy.
    It is this last step that determines the connections between the English string and the French string and it is here that these three models differ.
    In Model 3, as in Model 2, the probability of a connection depends on the positions that it connects and on the lengths of the English and French strings.
    In Model 4 the probability of a connection depends in addition on the identities of the French and English words connected and on the positions of any other French words that are connected to the same Englis
