    Some translation examples of the Verbmobil task are shown in Tab.
    6.
    We have to keep in mind, that the Verbmobil task consists of transcriptions of spontaneous speech.
    Therefore, the source sentences as well as the reference translations may have an unorthodox grammatical structure.
    In the first example, the German verb-group (&#8220;w&#168;urde vorschlagen&#8221;) is split into two parts.
    The search with the ITG constraints is able to produce a correct translation.
    With the IBM constraints, it is not possible to translate this verb-group correctly, because the distance between the two parts is too large (more than four words).
    As we see in the second example, in German the verb of a subordinate clause is placed at the end (&#8220;&#168;ubernachten&#8221;).
    The IBM search is not able to perform the necessary long-range reordering, as it is done with the ITG search.
  
  
    The ITG constraints were introduced in (Wu, 1995).
