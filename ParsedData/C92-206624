			OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 set of the Air Travel hfformation System (ATIS) corpus (Hemphill, Godfrey, and Doddington, 1990).
			This cor- pus is of interest since it has been used for infcrring stochastic ontext-free grammars from partially brack- eted corpora (Pereira and Sehabes, 1992).
			We use the data given by Pereira and Schabes (1992) on raw text and compare with an inferred SLTAG.
			The initial grammar consists of all trees (96) of the form fl~, a ~ for all 48 terminal symbols for part-of- speech.
			As shown in Figure 2, the grannnar converges very rapidly to a lower value of the log probability than the stochastic ontext-free grammar eported by Pereira and Schabes (1992).
