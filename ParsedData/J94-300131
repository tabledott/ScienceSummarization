r language.
    (It is well known that the images under a regular relation of languages in other classes, for example the context-free languages, also remain within those classes (e.g.
    Harrison 1978), but these other results do not concern us here.)
    That is, if L is a regular language and R is an arbitrary regular relation, then the languages L/R and R/L are both regular.
    If L is a regular language, we know there exists a regular relation Id(L) that takes all and only members of L into themselves.
    Since L = Range(Id(L)) it follows that Id(L)oR is regular and we have already observed that the range of any regular relation is a regular language.
    By symmetry of argument we know that R/L is also regular.
    Just like the class of regular languages, the class of regular relations is by definition closed under the operations of union, concatenation, and repeated concatenation.
    Also, the Pumping Lemma for regular languages immediately generalizes to regular relations, given the definitions o
