tion only helps when updating the parameters for a block of features that are occur in many sequences; for SGD, with batches of size one, this parallelization policy is useless.
    Most existing implementations of CRFs, eg.
    CRF++ and CRFsgd perform the forwardbackward recursions in the log-domain, which guarantees that numerical over/underflows are avoided no matter the length T(&#65533;) of the sequence.
    It is however very inefficient from an implementation point of view, due to the repeated calls to the exp() and log() functions.
    As an alternative way of avoiding numerical problems, our implementation, like crfSuite&#8217;s, resorts to &#8220;scaling&#8221;, a solution commonly used for HMMs.
    Scaling amounts to normalizing the values of &#945;t and &#946;t to one, making sure to keep track of the cumulated normalization factors so as to compute ZB(x) and the conditional expectations Epo(y|x).
    Also note that in our implementation, all the computations of exp(x) are vectorized, which prov
