    More work on language-specific smoothing may also be needed.
    With 10-fold cross-validation, the French model obtained a mean correlation of 0.64 with labeled difficulty.
    For comparison, using the type/token ratio gave a mean correlation of 0.48.
    While further work and better training data are needed, the results seem promising given that only a few hours of effort were required to gather the French data and adjust the classifier&#8217;s feature selection.
  
  
    While word difficulty is well-known to be an excellent predictor of reading difficulty (Chall &amp; Edgar, 1995), it was not at all clear how effective our language model approach would be for predicting Web page reading difficulty.
    It was also unknown how much training data would be required to get good vocabulary coverage on Web data.
    Although retraining for other applications or domains may be desirable, two factors appear responsible for the fact that our classifier, trained on Web data, generalizes rea
