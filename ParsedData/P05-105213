ken, such as Bashar_Assad.
    So in a relation example R whose seq is (t1, t2, ..., tn), it is always true that arg1=t1 and arg2=tn.
    For names, the base form of an entity is its ACE type (person, organization, etc.).
    To introduce dependencies, we define a dependency token to be a token augmented with a vector of dependency arcs, DT=(word, pos, base, dseq), where dseq = (arc1, ... , arcn ).
    A dependency arc is ARC = (w, dw, label, e), where w is the current token; dw is a token connected by a dependency to w; and label and e are the role label and direction of this dependency arc respectively.
    From now on we upgrade the type of tk in arg1 and arg2 to be dependency tokens.
    Finally, path is a vector of dependency arcs, where l is the length of the path and arci (1&lt;i&lt;l) satisfies arc1.w=arg1.tk, arci+1.w=arci.dw and arcl.dw=arg2.tk.
    So path is a chain of dependencies connecting the two arguments in R. The arcs in it do not have to be in the same direction.
