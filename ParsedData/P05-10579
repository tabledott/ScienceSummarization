ating English as source language and French as target language or vice versa.
    A conventional bilingual dictionary can be considered an additional knowledge source.
    We could use a feature that counts how many entries of a conventional lexicon co-occur in a given alignment between the source sentence and the target sentence.
    Therefore, the weight for the provided conventional dictionary can be learned.
    The intuition is that the conventional dictionary is expected to be more reliable than the automatically trained lexicon and therefore should get a larger weight.
    We define a bilingual dictionary as a set of entries: D = {(e, f, conf)}. e is a source language word, f is a target langauge word, and conf is a positive real-valued number (usually, conf = 1.0) assigned by lexicographers to evaluate the validity of the entry.
    Therefore, the feature function using a bilingual dictionary is: where
  
  
    We use the GIS (Generalized Iterative Scaling) algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) to t
