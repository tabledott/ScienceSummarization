an support the current evaluation, but also can provide an ongoing resource for comparing different coreference algorithms and approaches.
    The CoNLL-2011 shared task was based on the English portion of the OntoNotes 4.0 data.
    The task was to automatically identify mentions of entities and events in text and to link the coreferring mentions together to form entity/event chains.
    The target coreference decisions could be made using automatically predicted information on the other structural layers including the parses, semantic roles, word senses, and named entities.
    As is customary for CoNLL tasks, there were two tracks, closed and open.
    For the closed track, systems were limited to using the distributed resources, in order to allow a fair comparison of algorithm performance, while the open track allowed for almost unrestricted use of external resources in addition to the provided data.
    In the closed track, systems were limited to the provided data, plus the use of two pre-specified exte
