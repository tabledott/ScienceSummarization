    For BoosTexter and TiMBL, the improvements in accuracy over both baselines are significant.
    Also for all algorithms, using the polarity features gives the highest positive and negative F-measures.
    Because the set of polarity instances being classified by each algorithm is different, we cannot directly compare the results from one algorithm to the next.
    Although the two-step approach to recognizing contextual polarity allows us to focus our investigation on the performance of features for both neutral&#8211;polar classification and polarity classification, the question remains: How does the two-step approach compare to recognizing contextual polarity in a single classification step?
    The results shown in Table 20 help to answer this question.
    The first row in Table 20 for each algorithm shows the combined result for the two stages of classification.
    For BoosTexter, TiMBL, and Ripper, this is the combination of results from using all the neutral&#8211;polar features for step one,
