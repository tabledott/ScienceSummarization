e HMM-based content modes is comparable to the grid model on the Earthquakes corpus (the difference is not statistically significant) but is significantly lower on the Accidents texts (see Table 5).
    Although the grid model yields similar performance on the two domains, content models exhibit high variability.
    These results are not surprising.
    The analysis presented in Barzilay and Lee (2004) shows that the Earthquakes texts are quite formulaic in their structure, following the editorial style of the Associated Press.
    In contrast, the Accidents texts are more challenging for content models&#8212;reports in this set do not undergo centralized editing and therefore exhibit more variability in lexical choice and style.
    The LSA model also significantly outperforms the content model on the Earthquakes domain (p &lt; .01 using a Sign test).
    Being a local model, LSA is less sensitive to the way documents are structured and is therefore more likely to deliver consistent performance across domai
