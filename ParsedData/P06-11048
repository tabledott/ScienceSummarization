tures: entity headword, entity type and subtype (only for GPE), and mention type while the ACE 2004 data makes some modifications and introduces a new feature &#8220;LDC mention type&#8221;.
    Our statistics on the ACE data reveals that the entity features impose a strong constraint on relation types.
    Therefore, we design a linear kernel to explicitly capture such features: where R1 and R2 stands for two relation instances, Ei means the ith entity of a relation instance, and KE(&#8226;,&#8226;) is a simple kernel function over the features of entities: where fi represents the ith entity feature, and the function C(&#8226;,&#8226;) returns 1 if the two feature values are identical and 0 otherwise.
    KE(&#8226;,&#8226;) returns the number of feature values in common of two entities.
    (2) Convolution Parse Tree Kernel: A convolution kernel aims to capture structured information in terms of substructures.
    Here we use the same convolution parse tree kernel as described in Collins and Duffy (2001) fo
