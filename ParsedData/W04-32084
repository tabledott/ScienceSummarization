effective Bootstrapping method to accomplish our task (Figure 1).
    We also apply the IBM Model 4 EM lexical learning to find unknown word translations from the extracted parallel sentences from our system.
    The IBM models are commonly used for word alignment in statistical MT systems.
    This EM method differs from some previous work, which used a seed-word lexicon to extract new word translations or word senses from comparable corpora (Rapp 1995, Fung &amp; McKeown 1997, Grefenstette 1998, Fung and Lo 1998, Kikui 1999, Kaji 2003).
  
  
    There have been conflicting definitions of the term &#8220;comparable corpora&#8221; in the research community.
    In this paper, we contrast and analyze different bilingual corpora, ranging from the parallel, noisy parallel, comparable, to very-non-parallel corpora.
    A parallel corpus is a sentence-aligned corpus containing bilingual translations of the same document.
    The Hong Kong Laws Corpus is a parallel corpus with manually aligned sentences, and is us
