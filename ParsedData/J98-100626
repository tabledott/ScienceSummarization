orted.
    Examples containing the string escorted were collected to train on one sense of the pseudoword and examples containing the string abused were collected to train on the other sense.
    In addition, Yarowsky (1993) used homophones (e.g., cellar/seller) and Yarowsky (1994) created homographs by stripping accents from French and Spanish words.
    Although these latter techniques are useful in their own right (e.g., spoken language systems or corrupted transmissions), the resulting materials do not generalize to the acquisition of tagged training for real polysemous or even homographic words.
    The results of disambiguation strategies reported for pseudowords and the like are consistently above 95% overall accuracy, far higher than those reported for disambiguating three or more senses of polysemous words (Wilks et al. 1993; Leacock, Towel!, and Voorhees 1993).
    Yarowsky (1992) used a thesaurus to collect training materials.
    He tested the unsupervised training materials on 12 nouns with almos
