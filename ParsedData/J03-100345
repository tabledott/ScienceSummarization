    In this article, we have presented a new approach to the content determination problem for referring expressions.
    We proposed to model scenes as labeled directed graphs, in which objects are represented as vertices and the properties and relations of these objects are represented as edges.
    The problem of finding a referring expression for an object is treated as finding a subgraph of the scene graph that is isomorphic to the intended referent but not to any other object.
    The theoretical complexity of this reformulation of the content determination problem is NP-complete, but there exist various restrictions (planar graphs, decision trees for fixed scene graphs, upper bound to the number of edges in a distinguishing graph) that have a polynomial complexity.
    We have described a general and fully implemented algorithm, based on the subgraph isomorphism idea, consisting of two main functions: one that constructs referring graphs and one that tests for subgraph isomorphisms.
