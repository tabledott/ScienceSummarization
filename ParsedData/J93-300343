well were almost identical to results from the earlier study of now, described above.
    Briefly, of the 52 instances of well we examined, all but one token fit the model constructed from the results of the now study, depicted in Figure 6.
    In particular, of the 25 sentential uses of well, none constituted a single intermediate or intonational phrase.
    Only two sentential tokens were first-in-phrase, and both of these bore H* pitch accents.
    However, of the 27 discourse tokens of well, 14 were indeed alone in their intonational or intermediate phrases.
    All of the remaining 13 occurred first-in-phrase, and, of these 12 were deaccented.
    In all, 51(98.1%) of the tokens in this study fit our model; the single counter-example was one discourse token, which bore a H* pitch accent and was part of a larger phrase.
    Our study of well thus appeared to confirm our earlier results, and, in particular, to lend support to our hypothesis that cue phrases can be distinguished intonationally.
