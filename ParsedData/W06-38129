r k steps that can be interpreted as a clustering of G. This is achieved by alternating an expansion step and an inflation step.
    The expansion step is a matrix multiplication of MG with the current transition matrix.
    The inflation step is a column-wise non-linear operator that increases the contrast between small and large transition probabilities and normalizes the columnwise sums to 1.
    The k matrix multiplications of the expansion step of MCL lead to its time-complexity of O(k&#8226;n2).
    It has been observed in (van Dongen, 2000), that only the first couple of iterations operate on dense matrices &#8211; when using a strong inflation operator, matrices in the later steps tend to be sparse.
    The author further discusses pruning schemes that keep only some of the largest entries per column, leading to drastic optimization possibilities.
    But the most aggressive sort of pruning is not considered: only keeping one single largest entry.
    Exactly this is conducted in the basic CW process.
