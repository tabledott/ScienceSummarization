    For the training and test data, in addition to the underlying text, predicted versions of all the supplementary layers of annotation were provided, where those predictions were derived using off-the-shelf tools (parsers, semantic role labelers, named entity taggers, etc.) as described in Section 4.4.2.
    For the training data, however, in addition to predicted values for the other layers, we also provided manual gold-standard annotations for all the layers.
    Participants were allowed to use either the gold-standard or predicted annotation for training their systems.
    They were also free to use the gold-standard data to train their own models for the various layers of annotation, if they judged that those would either provide more accurate predictions or alternative predictions for use as multiple views, or wished to use a lattice of predictions.
