hed in the theoretical framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard &amp; Sag 1994), with semantic representations in Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al. 2001).
    HPSG is well suited to the task of multilingual development of broad coverage grammars: It is flexible enough (analyses can be shared across languages but also tailored as necessary), and has a rich theoretical literature from which to draw analyzes and inspiration.
    The characteristic type hierarchy of HPSG also facilitates the development of grammars that are easy to extend.
    MRS is a flat semantic formalism that works well with typed feature structures and is flexible in that it provides structures that are under-specified for scopal information.
    These structures give compact representations of ambiguities that are often irrelevant to the task at hand.
    HPSG and MRS have the further advantage that there are practical and useful open-source tools for writing, testing, and efficiently processing g
