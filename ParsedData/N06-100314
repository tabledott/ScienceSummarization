    In addition to judging the accuracy of 100 phrases for each of the translated sets, we measured how much our paraphrase method increased the coverage of the translation system.
    Because we focus on words that the system was previously unable to translate, the increase in coverage and the translation quality of the newly covered phrases are the two most relevant indicators as to the efficacy of the method.
  
  
    We produced translations under five conditions for each of our training corpora: a set of baseline translations without any additional entries in the phrase table, a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases for unseen source words along with paraphrase probabilities, a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases of multi-word phrases along with paraphrase probabilities, and two additional conditions where we added the translations of paraphrases of single and multi-word paraphrase without paraphrase probabilities.
