iversion requiring physical exertion and competition, which yields the logic representation: active JJ(x1) &amp; diversion NN(x1) &amp; require VB(e1,x1,x2) &amp; or CC(x2,x3,x4) &amp; physical JJ(x3) &amp; exertion NN(x3) &amp; competition NN(x4) A much improved source of world knowledge is obtained when the gloss words are semantically disambiguated (Moldovan and Noviscki 2002).
    By doing this, the connectivity between synsets is dramatically increased.
    Lexical chains can be established between synsets in different hierarchies.
    These are sequences of semantically related words that link two concepts.
    Lexical chains improve the performance of question answering systems in two ways: (1) increase the document retrieval recall and (2) improve the answer extraction by providing the much needed world knowledge axioms that link question keywords with answers concepts.
    We developed software that automatically provides connecting paths between any two WordNet synsets and up to a certain distance (
