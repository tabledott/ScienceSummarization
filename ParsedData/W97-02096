ated using maximum likelihood; the use of word classes is itself a form of smoothing (cf.
    Pereira et al. (1993)).1 This estimation method is similar to that used by Yarowsky (1992) for Roget's thesaurus categories, and works for similar reasons.
    As an example, consider two instances of the verb-object relationship in a training corpus, drink coffee and drink wine.
    Coffee has 2 senses in the WordNet 1.4 noun taxonomy, and belongs to 13 classes in all, and wine has 2 senses and belongs to a total of 16 classes.
    This means that the observed countverb-obj (drink, coffee) = 1 will be distributed by adding A to the joint frequency with drink for each of the 13 classes containing coffee.
    Similarly, the joint frequency with drink will be incremented by for each of the 16 classes containing wine.
    Crucially, although each of the two words is ambiguous, only those taxonomic classes containing both words &#8212; e.g., (beverage) &#8212; receive credit for both observed instances.
    In general, b
