ue is obtained by adding dictionary features, at least in this order of adding features.
    For English, we investigated in more detail the way features interact.
    Figure 1 presents a hierarchical direct comparison between the performance of the RRM model and the MaxEnt model.
    We can observe that the RRM model makes better use of gazetteers, and manages to close the initial performance gap to the MaxEnt model.
    Table 4 presents the results obtained by running the entity tracking algorithm on true mentions.
    It is interesting to compare the entity tracking results with inter-annotator agreements.
    LDC reported (NIST, 2003b) that the interannotator agreement (computed as ACE-values) between annotators are %, % and % for Arabic, Chinese and English, respectively.
    The system performance is very close to human performance on this task; this small difference in performance highlights the difficulty of the entity tracking task.
    Finally, Table 5 presents the results obtained by running both m
