    The average score of HMM Hedge was 3.01 with standard deviation of 1.11.
    The average score of Hedge Trimmer was 3.72 with standard deviation of 1.26.
    Using a t-score, the difference is significant with greater than 99.9% confidence.
    The types of problems exhibited by the two systems are qualitatively different.
    The probabilistic system is more likely to produce an ungrammatical result or omit a necessary argument, as in the examples below.
    In contrast, the parser-based system is more likely to fail by producing a grammatical but semantically useless headline.
    Finally, even when both systems produce acceptable output, Hedge Trimmer usually produces headlines which are more fluent or include more useful information. demanding that Chinese authorities respect culture.
  
  
    We have shown the effectiveness of constructing headlines by selecting words in order from a newspaper story.
