nitication which provides avery powerful and semantically (:lear means of specifying and cornput- irlg relations between classes of objects.
  lThe possibility of defining types as (conditional) ex= pressions of typed FSs encourages a very different approach to grammar specification than integrated CF based approaches like DCG or LFG: the gram- mar writer has to deline the set of linguistic objects relevant for the problem, define the possible rela- tions between these objects, and specify explicitly the constraints between objects and relations.
  The TFS system has been implemented in Common- Lisp and has been tested on Symbolics, TI Explorer, VAX and Allegro Common-Lisp.
  Sample grammars have been developed([6], [18]) in order to demon- strate the feasibility of the approach.
  Acknowledgments  The current system is based ol~ a previous implementation carried out by the au- thors at ATR, Kyoto, as a part of a visiting research program.
