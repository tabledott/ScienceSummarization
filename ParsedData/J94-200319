lization of the relation REALIZE is the relation DIRECTLY REALIZE.
  A center is directly realized if it corresponds to a phrase in an utterance.
  We restrict our focus to entities realized by noun phrases; however, it is clear that propositions can be centers, so we assume that the account given here can be extended to propositional entities as well (Webber 1978; Sidner 1979; Prince 1986, 1978b; Ward 1985).
  4 The notion of PREFERRED CENTER corresponds toSidners notion of EXPECTED FOCUS (Sidner 1983).
  5 This could possibly be rephrased as: Assume the Cp(Ui-1 is the Cb(Ui) unless there is evidence to the contrary (Carter 1987).

  These arguments must  be interpreted and thus acquire a degree of discourse salience t
