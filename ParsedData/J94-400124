 example of detecting conjunctive structures.
    In a long Japanese sentence two or more CSs often exist, overlapping with each other.
    In such cases, we have to adjust their relations in a sentence after their scopes have been detected.
    This adjustment is done by checking relations in all pairs of CSs and merging all the relations.
    Through this adjustment process, CSs consisting of three or more conjuncts are detected.
    Furthermore, CSs with incorrect relations, if they exist, are found, and retrials of detecting their scopes are done.
    As a result of this adjustment process, we get a reduced sentence form.
    The details of these processes will be given in the following section.
    The scope of a CS is represented by a three-tuple: {position of SB, position of KB, position of EB}.
    Let us suppose that two CSs exist in a sentence; the prior one, X, has a scope represented by {xl, x2, x3}, and the posterior one, Y, has a scope represented by {yl, y2, y3} (see Figure 9).
    When two CSs
