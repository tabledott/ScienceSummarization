    These shifts, though indicated by linguistic expressions typically used for centering (pronouns), correspond to a shift in global focus.
  
  
    The main purpose of the paper was to sort out the confusion about the roles of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic factors in the interpretation and generation of definite noun phrases in discourse.
    Specific mechanisms that account for the interactions among these factors were presented.
    Discourses were shown to be coherent at two different levels, i.e., with referring expressions used to identify entities that are centered locally and those focused upon more globally.
    The differences between references at the global and local levels were discussed, and the interaction of th
