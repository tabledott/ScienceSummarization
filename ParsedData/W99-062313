 less than 0.5, we expect to incur more errors' than we will remove by adding those constituents to the parse.
    We show the results of three of the experiments we conducted to measure isolated constituent precision under various partitioning schemes.
    In Table 1 we see with very few exceptions that the isolated constituent precision is less than 0.5 when we use the constituent label as a feature.
    The counts represent portions of the approximately 44000 constituents hypothesized by the parsers in the development set.
    In the cases where isolated constituent precision is larger than 0.5 the affected portion of the hypotheses is negligible.
    Similarly Figures 1 and 2 show how the isolated constituent precision varies by sentence length and the size of the span of the hypothesized constituent.
    In each figure the upper graph shows the isolated constituent precision and the bottom graph shows the corresponding number of hypothesized constituents.
    Again we notice that the isolated constituent
