above and to the fact that with a binomial dis- tribution, the standard eviation is a flmction of the number of samples and the mean wflue.
  2.2 Using cont ingency tab les  and  X 2 to test  precis ion A test that does not use equation 1 but still makes an assunlption of independence l)etween a:l and a:u is that of using contingency tables with the chi-squared 0,52) distribution (Box et al., 1978, Sec.
  When tile assmnption is valid, this test is good for comparing differences ill the precision metric.
  Precision is the fraction of the items "Ibund" 1)y some technique that are actually of interest.
  Precision = l~,/(I~, + S), where R is the number of items that are of inter- est and me Recalled (fbund) by tile technique, and S is the munber of items that are found by tile technique that turn out to be Spurious (not of interest).
  One can test whether the precision results from two techniques are different by us- ing a 2 x 2 contingency table to test whether the ratio R/S  is different for the two techniq
