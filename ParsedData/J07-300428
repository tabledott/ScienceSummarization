g]\NP is combined with the auxiliary (S[dcl]\NP1)/(S[ng]\NP)2.
    The NP in the (S[ng]\NP)2 argument of the auxiliary unifies with the (uninstantiated) NP1 argument of passing.
    Because the NP in the (S[ng]\NP)2 is also coindexed with the subject NP1 of the auxiliary, the NP of the resulting S[dcl]\NP now has two unfilled dependencies to the subject NP1 of is and passing.
    When the entire verb phrase is combined with the subject, He fills both slots: Figure 2 shows the resulting CCG derivation and the corresponding list of word&#8211; word dependencies for our example sentence.
    It is the latter structure that we claim approximates for present purposes the predicate&#8211;argument structure or interpretation of the sentence, and provides the gold standard against which parsers can be evaluated.
    In order to deal with coordination, both the tree binarization and the category assignment have to be modified.
    In CCGbank, coordination is represented by the following binary rule schemata, rather th
