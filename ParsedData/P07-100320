g is to improve alignment quality for hard unions.
    It also impacts rule extraction substantially.
    While its competitive AER certainly speaks to the potential utility of our syntactic distortion model, we proposed the model for a different purpose: to minimize the particularly troubling alignment errors that cross constituent boundaries and violate the structure of English parse trees.
    We found that while the HMM and Syntactic models have very similar AER, they make substantially different errors.
    To investigate the differences, we measured the degree to which each set of alignments violated the supplied parse trees, by counting the frequency of interior nodes that are not null aligned.
    Figure 4 summarizes the results of the experiment for French: the Syntactic distortion with competitive thresholding reduces tree violations substantially.
    Interior node frequency is reduced by 56% overall, with the most dramatic improvement observed for clausal constituents.
    We observed a similar 50
