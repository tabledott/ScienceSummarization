r blocks fails to improve translation performance.
    (Wu, 1996; Zens and Ney, 2003) present re-ordering models that make use of a straight/inverted orientation model that is related to our work.
    Here, we investigate in detail the effect of restricting the word re-ordering to neighbor block swapping only.
    In this paper, we assume a block generation process that generates block sequences from bottom to top, one block at a time.
    The score of a successor block depends on its predecessor block and on its orientation relative to the block .
    In Fig.
    1 for example, block is the predecessor of block , and block is the predecessor of block .
    The target clump of a predecessor block is adjacent to the target clump of a successor block .
    A right adjacent predecessor block is a block where additionally the source clumps are adjacent and the source clump of occurs to the right of the source clump of .
    A left adjacent predecessor block is defined accordingly.
    During decoding, we compute
