l data is 70.1.5 The scorer also reports an F-score based on full or partial match of relations to the keys.
    The unweighted F-score for this test produced by the ACE scorer on all data is 76.0%.
    For this evaluation we used nearest neighbor to determine argument ordering and relation subtypes.
    The classification scheme in our experiments is one-against-all.
    It turned out there is not so much confusion between relation types.
    The confusion matrix of predictions is fairly clean.
    We also tried pairwise classification, and it did not help much.
  
  
    In this paper, we have shown that using kernels to combine information from different syntactic sources performed well on the entity relation detection task.
    Our experiments show that each level of syntactic processing contains useful information for the task.
    Combining them may provide complementary information to overcome errors arising from linguistic analysis.
    Especially, low level information obtained with high reliability
