ctions on the input text, and with very modest space and time requirements.
    Perhaps the most important indication of success is that many of these statistical tagging programs are now being used on large volumes of data (hundreds of millions of words of text) in a number of different application areas including speech synthesis (Sproat, personal communication; Liberman and Church 1991), speech recognition (Jelinek 1985; Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos 1991), information retrieval (Salton, Zhao, and Buckley 1990; Croft, Turtle, and Lewis 1991), sense disambiguation (Hearst 1991), and computational lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990a, 1990b; Church and Gale 1991).
    Apparently, these programs must be addressing some important needs of the research community or else they wouldn't be as widely cited as they are.
    Many of the papers in this special issue refer to these taggers.
    As in speech recognition, data collection efforts have played a pivotal role in advancing data-intensive approaches to pa
