 using the quality of tlle Viterbi alignment compared to a manually-produced align- ment.
  This has the advantage that once having pro- duced a reference alignlnent, the evaluation itself can be performed automatically.
  In addition, it results in a very precise and relia.ble valuation criterion which is well suited to assess various design decisions in modeling and training of statistical alignment mod- els.
  It, is well known that manually pertbrming a word aligmnent is a COlnplicated and ambiguous task (Melamed, 1998).
  Therefore, to produce tlle refer- ence alignment we use a relined annotation scheme which reduces the complications and mnbiguities oc- curring in the immual construction of a word align- ment.
  As we use tile alignment models for machine translation purposes, we also evahlate the resulting translation quality of different nlodels.
