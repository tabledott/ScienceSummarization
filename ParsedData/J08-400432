    A weighted variant of Cohen&#8217;s &#954; is presented in Cohen (1968).
    The implementation of weights is similar to that of Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945;&#8212;each pair of categories ka, kb &#8712; K is associated with a weight dkakb, where a larger weight indicates more disagreement (Cohen uses the notation v; he does not place any general constraints on the weights&#8212;not even a requirement that a pair of identical categories have a weight of zero, or that the weights be symmetric across the diagonal).
    The coefficient is defined for two coders: The disagreement for a particular item i is the weight of the pair of categories assigned to it by the two coders, and the overall observed disagreement is the (normalized) mean disagreement of all the items.
    Let k(cn,i) denote the category assigned by coder cn to item i; then the disagreement for item i is disagri = dk(c1,i)k(c2,i).
    The observed disagreement Do is the mean of disagri for all items i, normalized to the interval [0, 1] throug
