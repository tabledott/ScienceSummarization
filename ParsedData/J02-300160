ed to prevent overfitting of the training data.
    We are interested only in the clusters of nouns given by the distribution P(n  |c): the verbs and the distribution P(v  |c) are thrown away once training is complete.
    Other grammatical relations besides direct object could be used, as could a set of relations.
    We used the direct object (following other clustering work such as Pereira, Tishby, and Lee [1993]) because it is particularly likely to exhibit semantically significant selectional restrictions.
    A total of 2,610,946 verb-object pairs were used as training data for the clustering, with a further 290,105 pairs used as a cross-validation set to control the parameters of the clustering algorithm.
    Direct objects were identified as noun phrases directly under a verb phrase node&#8212;not a perfect technique, since it also finds nominal adjuncts such as &#8220;I start today.&#8221; Forms of the verb to be were excluded from the data, as its cooccurrence patterns are not semantically informati
