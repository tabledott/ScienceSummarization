el and assuming Bayes decision rule, Equation (2), we obtain the following search criterion: For the preceding equation, we assumed the segmentation probability p(S|eI1) to be constant.
    The result is a simple translation model.
    If we interpret this model as a feature function in the direct approach, we obtain: We use the maximum approximation for the hidden variable S. Therefore, the feature functions are dependent on S. Although the number of phrases K is implicitly given by the segmentation S, we used both S and K to make this dependency more obvious.
    In this section, we will describe refinements of the phrase-based translation model.
    First, we will describe two heuristics: word penalty and phrase penalty.
    Second, we will describe a single-word based lexicon model.
    This will be used to smooth the phrase translation probabilities.
    In addition to the baseline model, we use two simple heuristics, namely word penalty and phrase penalty: The word penalty feature is simply the target s
