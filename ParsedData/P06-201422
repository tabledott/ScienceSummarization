precision, though recall has also gone up.
    This indicates that these cohesion constraints are a strong alignment feature.
    The ITG row shows that the weaker ITG constraints are also valuable, but the cohesion constraint still improves on them.
    We now test the performance of our SVM ITG with soft cohesion constraint, or SD-ITG, which is described in Section 4.2.2.
    We will test against two strong baselines.
    The first baseline, matching is the matching SVM described in Section 4.2.1, which is a re-implementation of the state-of-theart work in (Taskar et al., 2005)3.
    The second baseline, D-ITG is an ITG aligner with hard cohesion constraints, but which uses the weights trained by the matching SVM to assign link values.
    This is the most straight-forward way to combine discriminative training with the hard syntactic constraints.
    The results are shown in Table 2.
    The first thing to note is that our Matching baseline is achieving scores in line with (Taskar et al., 2005), which repo
