uckwalter, 2002).
    The first version is fully consistent with neither ATB1 nor ATB2.
    Our training data consists of a set of all possible morphological analyses for each word, with the unique correct analysis marked.
    Since we want to learn to choose the correct output using the features generated by ALMORGEANA, the training data must also be in the ALMORGEANA output format.
    To obtain this data, we needed to match data in the ATB to the lexeme-and-feature representation output by ALMORGEANA.
    The matching included the use of some heuristics, since the representations and choices are not always consistent in the ATB.
    For example, nHw &#8216;towards&#8217; is tagged as AV, N, or V (in the same syntactic contexts).
    We verified whether we introduced new errors while creating our data representation by manually inspecting 400 words chosen at random from TR1 and TR2.
    In eight cases, our POS tag differed from that in the ATB file; all but one case were plausible changes among Noun, Adject
