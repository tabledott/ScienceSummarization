and Weir (2002).
    We were also able to show that a Web-based approach is able to achieve the same performance as an EM-based smoothing model proposed by Rooth et al. (1999).
    However, the Web-based approach was not able to outperform the more sophisticated EM-based model of Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth (2000).
    Another result we obtained is that Web-based models that use conditional probabilities (where unigram frequencies are used to normalize the bigram frequencies) generally outperform a more simple-minded approach that relies directly on bigram frequencies for pseudodisambiguation.
    There are a number of reasons why our results regarding pseudodisambiguation have to be treated with some caution.
    First of all, the two smoothing methods (i.e., EM-based clustering and class-based probability estimation using WordNet) were not evaluated on the same data set, and therefore the two results are not directly comparable.
    For instance, Clark and Weir&#8217;s (2002) data set is substantially less
