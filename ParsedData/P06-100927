ised training sets.
    Moreover, we showed how the CRF&#8217;s inference and estimation methods allowed for efficient processing without sacrificing optimality, improving on previous heuristic based approaches.
    On both French-English and Romanian-English we showed that many highly predictive features can be easily incorporated into the CRF, and demonstrated that with only a few hundred wordaligned training sentences, our model outperforms the generative Model 4 baseline.
    When no features are extracted from the sentence aligned corpus our model still achieves a low error rate.
    Furthermore, when we employ features derived from Model 4 alignments our CRF model achieves the highest reported results on both data sets.
