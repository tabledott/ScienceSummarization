s a function to represent immediate-dominance relations.
    Our representation of a chart can be interpreted as an instance of a feature forest.
    We map the tuple (em, el, er), which corresponds to (m, l, r), into a conjunctive node.
    Figure 13 shows (a part of) the HPSG parse trees in Figure 12 represented as a feature forest.
    Square boxes (ci) are conjunctive nodes, and di disjunctive nodes.
    A solid arrow represents a disjunctive daughter function, and a dotted line expresses a conjunctive daughter function.
    Formally, a chart (E, Er, o ) is mapped into a feature forest (C, D, R,-y, b) as follows.6 5 We assume that CONT and DTRS (a feature used to represent daughter signs) are restricted (Shieber 1985), and we will discuss a method for encoding CONT in a feature forest in Section 4.3.
    We also assume that parse trees are packed according to equivalence relations rather than subsumption relations (Oepen and Carroll 2000).
    We cannot simply map parse forests packed under subsumption in
