here the subtopic changes occur, I make use of lexical cohesion relations (Halliday &amp; Hasan 1976) in a manner similar to that suggested by Skorochod'ko.
    Morris and Hirst's pioneering work on computing discourse structure from lexical relations (Morris &amp; Hirst 1991), (Morris 1988) is a precursor to the work reported on here.
    Influenced by Halliday &amp; Hasan's (1976) theory of lexical coherence, Morris developed an algorithm that finds chains of related terms via a comprehensive thesaurus (Roget's Fourth Edition).3 For example, the 2Interestingly, Chafe arrived at the Flow Model after working extensively with, and then becoming dissatisfied with, a hierarchical model of paragraph structure like that of Longacre (1979). words residential and apartment both index the same thesaural category and can thus be considered to be in a coherence relation with one another.
    The chains are used to structure texts according to the attentional/intentional theory of discourse structure (Grosz Sidner 1986)
