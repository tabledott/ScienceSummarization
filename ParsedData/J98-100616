ore reliable than topical context as an indicator of sense for this verb and this adjective, but slightly less reliable for this noun.
    The combination of local and topical context showed improved or equal performance for all three words.
    Performance for all of the classifiers improved with increased training size.
    All classifiers performed best with at least 200 training examples per sense, but the learning curve tended to level off beyond a minimum 100 training examples.
    These results are consistent with those of Yarowsky (1993), based on his experiments with pseudowords, homophones, and homonyms (discussed below).
    He observed that performance for verbs and adjectives dropped sharply as the window increased, while distant context remained useful for nouns.
    Thus one is tempted to conclude that nouns depend more on topic than do verbs and adjectives.
    But such a conclusion is probably an overgeneralization, inasmuch as some noun senses are clearly nontopical.
