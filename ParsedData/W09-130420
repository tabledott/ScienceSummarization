% of the cases or is not a hedge cue.
    The system that uses preprocessing produces 938 false positives and 4 false negatives, whereas the other system produces 21 false positives and 108 false negatives.
    In the papers subcorpus, the hedge cues if, or, can, indicate and estimate cause 67.38% of the false positives.
    In the clinical subcorpus the hedge cues evidence, evidence of, no and appear cause 88.27% of the false positives.
    In contrast with the abstracts subcorpus, the hedge cue or has only 5 false positives and scores an F1 of 99.10.
    So, in the clinical corpus or is not ambiguous, whereas in the abstracts subcorpus it is very ambiguous.
    An example of or as hedge cue in the clinical subcorpus is shown in (6).
    An example of or as hedge cue in the abstracts subcorpus is shown in (7), and as a non cue in (8). macrophages, induction of NF-KB occurred only if the cells were previously infected with HIV-1.
