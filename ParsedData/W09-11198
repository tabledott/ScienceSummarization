 of xi (5) tokens in the window c = (xi&#8722;2, xi&#8722;1, xi, xi+1, xi+2) (6) capitalization pattern in the window c (7) conjunction of c and yi&#8722;1.
    Most NER systems use additional features, such as POS tags, shallow parsing information and gazetteers.
    We discuss additional features in the following sections.
    We note that we normalize dates and numbers, that is 12/3/2008 becomes *Date*, 1980 becomes *DDDD* and 212-325-4751 becomes *DDD*-*DDD*-*DDDD*.
    This allows a degree of abstraction to years, phone numbers, etc.
    Our baseline NER system uses a regularized averaged perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1999).
    Systems based on perceptron have been shown to be competitive in NER and text chunking (Kazama and Torisawa, 2007b; Punyakanok and Roth, 2001; Carreras et al., 2003) We specify the model and the features with the LBJ (Rizzolo and Roth, 2007) modeling language.
    We now state the four fundamental design decisions in NER system which define the structure of this paper.
