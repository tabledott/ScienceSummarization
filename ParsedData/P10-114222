a) also investigate the entity-mention model, which produces results that are only marginally better than those of the mention-pair model.
    However, it appears that they are not fully exploiting the expressiveness of the entity-mention model, as cluster-level features only comprise a small fraction of their features.
    Variants of the entity-mention model have been investigated.
    For example, Culotta et al. (2007) present a first-order logic model that determines the probability that an arbitrary set of NPs are all co-referring.
    Their model resembles the entitymention model in that it enables the use of clusterlevel features.
    Daum&#180;e III and Marcu (2005) propose an online learning model for constructing coreference chains in an incremental fashion, allowing later coreference decisions to be made by exploiting cluster-level features that are computed over the coreference chains created thus far.
    While the entity-mention model addresses the expressiveness problem with the mention-pair mo
