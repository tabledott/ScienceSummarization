actable precursor to full parsing, since it provides a foundation for further levels of analysis including verb-argument identification, while still allowing more complex attachment decisions to be postponed to a later phase.
    Since chunking includes identifying the non-recursive portions of noun phrases, it can also be useful for other purposes including index term generation.
    Most efforts at superficially extracting segments from sentences have focused on identifying low-level noun groups, either using hand-built grammars and finite state techniques or using statistical models like HMMs trained from corpora.
    In this paper, we target a somewhat higher level of chunk structure using Brill's (1993b) transformation-based learning mechanism, in which a sequence of transformational rules is learned from a corpus; this sequence iteratively improves upon a baseline model for some interpretive feature of the text.
    This technique has previously been used not only for part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1994
