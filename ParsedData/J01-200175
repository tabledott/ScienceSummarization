 a 350,000-word corpus in Table 5.
    It is instructive to consider the signature a.aient.ait.ant.e. ent.er.es.erent.e.ee.es, which is ranked ninth among signatures.
    It contains a large part of the suffixal pattern from the most common regular conjugation, the first conjugation.
    Within the scope of the effort covered by this project, the large-scale generalizations extracted about these languages appear to be quite accurate (leaving for further discussion below the questions of how to link related signatures and related stems).
    It is equally important to take a finer-grained look at the results and quantify them.
