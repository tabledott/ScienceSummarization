nly affects the output labels, T' and T&amp;quot; have the same set of states: Q' = Q&amp;quot;.
    Hence Si and S2 are also states of T'.
    The states of T' can be viewed as weighted subsets whose state elements belong to T,, because T' is obtained by determinization of T. Let (q, c) E Qi X R. be a pair of the subset Si.
    Since Ti is trim there exists w E E* such that Si (ii, w) = q, so Si(Si, w) E F'.
    Since Si and S2 are equivalent, we also have: 21 The theorem also holds in the case of string-to-string bideterminizable transducers.
    We give the proof in the more complex case of string-to-weight transducers.
    Minimal transducer 04 obtained by reversing 03 and applying determinization.
    6'(S2, 7.1)) E F'.
    Since T1 is subsequential, there exists only one state of Tf admitting a path labeled with w to ii; that state is q.
    Thus, q E S2.
    Therefore any state q member of a pair of Si is also member of a pair of S2.
    By symmetry the reverse is also true.
    Thus exactly the same s
