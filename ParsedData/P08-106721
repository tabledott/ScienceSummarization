ures.6 Shown in Figure 4, these forests have an forest oracle of 97.8, which is 1.1% higher than the 50-best oracle (96.7), and are 8 times smaller in size.
    Table 3 compares the performance of forest reranking against standard n-best reranking.
    For both systems, we first use only the local features, and then all the features.
    We use the development set to determine the optimal number of iterations for averaged perceptron, and report the F1 score on the test set.
    With only local features, our forest reranker achieves an F-score of 91.25, and with the addition of noning on sec.
    23.
    The pre-comp. column is for feature extraction, and training column shows the number of perceptron iterations that achieved best results on the dev set, and average time per iteration. local features, the accuracy rises to 91.69 (with beam size k = 15), which is a 0.26% absolute improvement over 50-best reranking.7 This improvement might look relatively small, but it is much harder to make a similar progress w
