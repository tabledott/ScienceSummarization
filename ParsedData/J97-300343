xts and words unseen at the training phase showed that tagging with the automatically induced cascading guesser was consistently more accurate than previously quoted results known to the author (85%).
    Tagging accuracy on unknown words using the cascading guesser was 87.7-88.7%.
    The cascading guesser outperformed the guesser supplied with the Xerox tagger and the guesser supplied with Brill's tagger both on unknown proper nouns (which is a relatively easy-to-guess category of words) and on the rest of the unknown words, where it had an advantage of 6.5-8.5.%.
    When the unknown words were made known to the lexicon, the accuracy of tagging was 93.6-94.3% which makes the accuracy drop caused by the cascading guesser to be less than 6% in general.
    Another important conclusion from the evaluation experiments is that the morphological guessing rules do improve guessing performance.
    Since they are more accurate than ending-guessing rules they were applied first and improved the precision of the gue
