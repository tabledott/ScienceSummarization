 a&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;rewrite picture as pictures&amp;quot;.
    Since the error involves operations on both the article and the noun, which our article correction module is not designed to cover, we eliminated the sentence from the data.
    (This last step eliminated 31% of the sentences annotated with preposition errors and 29% or the sentences annotated with article errors.)
    Sentences that were flagged for a replacement error but contained no replacement were also eliminated from the data.
    The final training, tuning and test set sizes are as follows (note that for prepositions we had to reduce the size of the training set by an additional 20% in order to avoid memory limitations of our decision tree tools).
    Prepositions: train: 584,485 sentences, 68,806 prep errors tuning: 105,166 sentences, 9918 prep errors test: 208,724 sentences, 19,706 prep errors Articles: train: 737,091 sentences, 58,356 article errors tuning: 106,052 sentences, 8341 article errors test: 210,577 sentences, 16,742 ar
