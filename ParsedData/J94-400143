entences are longer and more complex than sentences in common usage and consist of 50 sentences composed of 30 to 50 characters, 50 sentences of 50 to 80 characters, and 50 sentences of over 80 characters.8 All the example sentences shown in this paper belong to these test sentences.
    We evaluated the results of analyzing 150 Japanese sentences.
    First, as shown in Table 4, we classified all the bunsetsus in the 150 sentences into five types: KBs of conjunctive noun phrases, KBs of conjunctive predicative clauses, KBs of incomplete conjunctive structures, bunsetsus that depend on NBs, and bunsetsus that depend on PBs.
    Then we manually checked these KBs to see whether their corresponding EBs were analyzed correctly; for other bunsetsus, we manually checked whether their heads were analyzed correctly.
    Table 4 shows a high success ratio for the detection of CSs and a very high success ratio of the dependency analysis on bunsetsu level.
    These results suggest that the simple heuristic rules for h
