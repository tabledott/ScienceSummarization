the quantities in the first column of Table 2 and incorrectness values for the quantities in the second column of Table 2.
    Furthermore, the summation is performed over all pairs reported or not reported by the system for quantities in the first or second row of Table 2 respectively.
    Consequently, the information theoretic measures represent the generalized counterparts of their original definitions.
    In the case of perfect agreement between the models, or of only one model, the generalized measures reduce to their original definitions.
    We also compute a combined measure for recall and precision, the F-measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1979), which always takes a value between the values of recall and precision, and is higher when recall and precision are closer; it is defined as where 3 is the weight of recall relative to precision; we use 13.1.0, which corresponds to equal weighting of the two measures.
    The results of applying our evaluation method to the system output (Figure 3) are shown in Table
