tead of VBD in 13 of its 33 uses in the corpus.
    After correcting only the VBN feature of these two verbs to reflect the actual part of speech, overall accuracy in classification increases by almost 10%, illustrating the importance of both accurate counts and accurate annotation of the corpora.
    We can further use the single hold-out results to determine the contribution of each feature to accuracy within each class.
    We do this by comparing the class labels assigned using the full set of five features (TRANS, PASS, VBN, CAUS, ANIIVI) with the class labels assigned using each size 4 subset of features.
    The difference in classifications between each four-feature subset and the full set of features indicates the changes in class labels that we can attribute to the added feature in going from the four-feature to five-feature set.
    Thus, we can see whether the features indeed contribute to discriminating the classes in the manner predicted in Section 2.2, and summarized here in Table 13.
