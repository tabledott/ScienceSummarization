a rule refer to input paths that do not exist in the input, then the rule cannot apply (because a &#8595; (i &#183; (1) &#183; i&#8242;) would not exist).
    In the traditional statement of R, sources(rhs) is always {(1), ... , (n)}, writing xi instead of (i), but in xR, we identify mapped input subtrees by arbitrary (finite) paths.
    An input tree is transformed by starting at the root in the initial state, and recursively applying outputgenerating rules to a frontier of (copies of) input subtrees (each marked with their own state), until (in a complete derivation, finishing at the leaves with terminal rules) no states remain.
    Let &#8658;&#8727; X, &#8658;L&#8727;X , and wX(a, b) follow from &#8658;X exactly as in Section 3.
    Then the weight of (i, o) in X is WX(i,o) &#8801; wX(Qi(i),o).
    The weighted tree transduction given by X is XX &#8801; {(i, o, w) &#8712; TE &#215; To &#215; R+|WX(i, o) = w}.
  
  
    Derivation trees for a transducer X = (E, A, Q, Qi, R) are trees labeled by rules (R) t
