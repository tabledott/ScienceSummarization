 no confidence intervals.
    Among the unsupervised methods introduced in this paper, the context window produced the best reported Spearman correlation, although the 0.95 confidence intervals are too large to allow us to accept the hypothesis that it is better than all others methods.
    The supervised combination produces the best results reported so far.
    For the benefit of future research, our results for the MC subset are displayed in Table 8.
    Comparison on the WordSim353 dataset is easier, as all researchers have used Spearman.
    The figures in Table 9) show that our WordNet-based method outperforms all previously published WordNet methods.
    We want to note that our WordNetbased method outperforms that of Hughes and Ramage (2007), which uses a similar method.
    Although there are some differences in the method, we think that the main performance gain comes from the use of the disambiguated glosses, which they did not use.
    Our distributional methods also outperform all other corpus-ba
