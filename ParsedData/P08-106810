tled on a simple but effective methodology.
    First, we found that it was helpful to employ two different types of word clusters: 2.
    Full bit strings,3 which we used as substitutes for word forms.
    Using these two types of clusters, we generated new features by mimicking the template structure of the original baseline features.
    For example, the baseline feature set includes indicators for word-to-word and tag-to-tag interactions between the head and modifier of a dependency.
    In the cluster-based feature set, we correspondingly introduce new indicators for interactions between pairs of short bit-string prefixes and pairs of full bit strings.
    Some examples of cluster-based features are given in Table 1.
    Second, we found it useful to concentrate on &#8220;hybrid&#8221; features involving, e.g., one bit-string and one part of speech.
    In our initial attempts, we focused on features that used cluster information exclusively.
    While these cluster-only features provided some benefit, w
