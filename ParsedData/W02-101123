ey, 2002)13, we looked at the performance of using adjectives alone.
    Intuitively, we might expect that adjectives carry a great deal of information regarding a document&#8217;s sentiment; indeed, the human-produced lists from Section 4 contain almost no other parts of speech.
    Yet, the results, shown in line (6) of Figure 3, are relatively poor: the 2633 adjectives provide less useful information than unigram presence.
    Indeed, line (7) shows that simply using the 2633 most frequent unigrams is a better choice, yielding performance comparable to that of using (the presence of) all 16165 (line (2)).
    This may imply that applying explicit feature-selection algorithms on unigrams could improve performance.
    Position An additional intuition we had was that the position of a word in the text might make a difference: movie reviews, in particular, might begin with an overall sentiment statement, proceed with a plot discussion, and conclude by summarizing the author&#8217;s views.
    As a rough appro
