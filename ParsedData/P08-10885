he arbitrary covariance parameter FS &#65533;: 0 explains the sourcespecific variations which are not captured by WS; it does not play an explicit role in inference.
    The target fT (tj) is generated analogously using WT and FT, conditionally independent of the source given zi,j (see figure 2).
    For each of the remaining unmatched source word types si which have not yet been generated, we draw the word type features from a baseline normal distribution with variance &#963;2IdS, with hyperparameter &#963;2 &#187; 0; unmatched target words are similarly generated.
    If two word types are truly translations, it will be better to relate their feature vectors through the latent space than to explain them independently via the baseline distribution.
    However, if a source word type is not a translation of any of the target word types, we can just generate it independently without requiring it to participate in the matching.
  
  
    Given our probabilistic model, we would like to maximize the log-likelihoo
