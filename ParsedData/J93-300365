ncracy, such an approach may prove more reliable than orthography alone in the general case.
    And, for text-to-speech applications, it is not clear how closely orthographic conventions for unrestricted written text will approximate the regularities we have observed in our transcribed corpora.
    Our findings for our single-speaker multi-cue phrase study support the intonational model of discourse/sentential characteristics of cue phrases that we proposed based on our earlier multispeaker single-cue phrase studies of now and well (Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Hirschberg 1990).
