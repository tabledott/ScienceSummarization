han clustering objects in a multidimensional space: There is no distance metric; the similarity between objects is encoded in the edges.
    Objects that do not share an edge cannot be compared, which gives rise to optimization techniques.
    There is no centroid or &#8216;average cluster member&#8217; in a graph, permitting centroid-based techniques.
    As data sets in NLP are usually large, there is a strong need for efficient methods, i.e. of low computational complexities.
    In this paper, a very efficient graph-clustering algorithm is introduced that is capable of partitioning very large graphs in comparatively short time.
    Especially for smallworld graphs (Watts, 1999), high performance is reached in quality and speed.
    After explaining the algorithm in the next section, experiments with synthetic graphs are reported in section 3.
    These give an insight about the algorithm&#8217;s performance.
    In section 4, experiments on three NLP tasks are reported, section 5 concludes by discussing e
