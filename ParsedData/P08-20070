  The Complexity of Phrase Alignment Problems
  
    Many phrase alignment models operate over combinatorial space of phrase We prove that finding an optimal alignment in this space is NP-hard, while computing alignment expectations is #P-hard.
    On the other hand, we show that the problem of finding an optimal alignment can be cast as an integer linear program, which provides a simple, declarative approach to Viterbi inference for phrase alignment models that is empirically quite efficient.
  
  
    Learning in phrase alignment models generally requires computing either Viterbi phrase alignments or expectations of alignment links.
    For some restricted combinatorial spaces of alignments&#8212;those that arise in ITG-based phrase models (Cherry and Lin, 2007) or local distortion models (Zens et al., 2004)&#8212;inference can be accomplished using polynomial time dynamic programs.
    However, for more permissive models such as Marcu and Wong (2002) and DeNero et al. (2006), which operate over the full s
