    The significance of Sidner (1983) and Grosz and Sidner (1986) for the current enterprise is that: Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 2, June 1988 63 Bonnie Lynn Webber Tense as Discourse Anaphor I reinterpret this in the current framework in terms of the anaphoric function a(NPb,Ea).
    Within a discourse segment, the entity that is the DF is the most likely Ea.
    Over the discourse segment, other discourse entities in the segment's focus space may in turn become DF.
    With a change in discourse segment, however, the DF can change radically to an entity in the focus space associated with the new segment.
    To hint again at what is to come: in Section 3.2, I will propose a temporal analogue of DF, which I have called temporal focus (TF).
    In Section 3.3, I will show how gradual movements of the TF are tied in with the ontology of what a tensed clause specifies&#8212;i.e., an ontology of events and situations&#8212;while more radical movements r
