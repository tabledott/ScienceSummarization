demonstrated that using two independent sources of information (transliteration and temporal similarity) together to guide NE extraction gives better performance than using either of them alone (see Figure 3).
    We developed a linear discriminative transliteration model, and presented a method to automatically generate features.
    For time sequence matching, we used a scoring metric novel in this domain.
    We provided experimental evidence that this metric outperforms other scoring metrics traditionally used.
    In keeping with our objective to provide as little language knowledge as possible, we introduced a simplistic approach to identifying transliteration equivalence classes, which sometimes produced erroneous groupings (e.g. an equivalence class for NE congolese in Russian included both congo and congolese on Figure 6).
    We expect that more language specific knowledge used to discover accurate equivalence classes would result in performance improvements.
    Other type of supervision was in the
