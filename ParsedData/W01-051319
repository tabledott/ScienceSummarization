  To find out, we must select g, h, and T. Since we want to eliminate MWUs that are compositional, we want h&#8217;s output to correlate well with C when there is compositionality and correlate poorly otherwise.
    Frequently, LSA vectors are correlated using the cosine between them: A large cosine indicates strong correlation, so large values for g(a,b)=1-|cos(a,b) |should signal weak correlation or non-compositionality. h could represent a weighted vector sum of the components&#8217; required for this task.
    This seems to be a significant semantic vectors with weights (wi) set to either 1.0 component.
    Yet there is still another: maybe or the reciprocal of the words&#8217; frequencies. semantic compositionality is not always bad.
    Table 5 indicates several results using these Interestingly, this is often the case.
    Consider settings.
    As the first four rows indicate and as vice_president, organized crime, and desired, non-compositionality is more apparent for Marine_Corps.
    Although these
