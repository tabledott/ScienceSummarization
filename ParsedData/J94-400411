ceived state of affairs by providing a detailed description of a solution to all of the (potentially interacting) divergences shown in Figure 1, not just a subset of them as would typically be found in the description of most translation systems.
  The framework assumed for the current approach makes use of a linguis- tically grounded classification of divergence types that can be formally defined and systematically resolved.
  We now turn to a formal description of the terminology used to define the diver- gence problem.
  Definitions This section formally defines the lexical-semantic representation that serves as the interlingua of the system (Definitions 1-3).
  This representation, which is influenced primarily by Jackendoff (1983, 1990), has been described in detail elsewhere (see, for example, Dorr 1992b, 1993a) and thus will not be the focus of this paper.
  In addition to a formal description of the lexical-semantic representation, definitions are provided for syntactic phrases (Definition 4) and two
