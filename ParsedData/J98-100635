were substituted for the novel ones in the test sets.
    Thus the sentence &amp;quot;Dinner is usually served with bacon&amp;quot; was substituted for the original sentence.
    Augmentation of the local .context classifier with WordNet similarity measures showed a small but consistent improvement in the classifier's performance.
    The improvement was greater with the smaller training sets.
    Resnik (1992) uses an information-based measure, the most informative class, on the WordNet taxonomy.
    A class consists of the synonyms found at a node and the synonyms at all the nodes that it dominates (all of its hyponyms).
    Based on verb/object pairs collected from a corpus, Resnik found, for example, that the objects for the verb open fall into two classes: receptacle and oral communication.
    Conversely, the class of a verb's object could be used to determine the appropriate sense of that verb.
    The experiments in the next section depend on a subset of the WordNet lexical relations, those involving
