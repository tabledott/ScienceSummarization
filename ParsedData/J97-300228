entence.
    Matters are made still worse by unpredictable omissions in the translation lexicon, even for valid compounds.
    We therefore extend the algorithm to optimize the Chinese sentence segmentation in conjunction with the bracketing process.
    Note that the notion of a Chinese &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; is a longstanding linguistic question, that our present notion of segmentation does not address.
    We adhere here to a purely task-driven definition of what a correct &amp;quot;segmentation&amp;quot; is, namely that longer segments are desirable only when no compositional translation is possible.
    The algorithm is modified to include the following computations, and remains the same otherwise:
  
  
    In our experience, this method has proven extremely effective for avoiding missegmentation pitfalls, essentially erring only in pathological cases involving coordination constructions or lexicon coverage inadequacies.
    The method is also straightforward to employ in tandem with other application
