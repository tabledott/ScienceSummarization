m model and a letter trigram model.
    The latter is needed in order to be able to generate words that are not in the word unigram model.
    However, despite being trained on a long list of names, the letter trigram model occasionally produce unlikely candidates.
    Unlikely candidates can be eliminated by filtering out candidates with zero Web counts.
    The Web-based filtering is useful only for our spelling-based model since all candidates generated by the phonetic-based model are in the pronunciation dictionary and all have non-zero Web counts.
    A comparison of the transliteration accuracy with and without the Web-based filtering is shown in Table 4.
  
  
    In this section, we present a comparison of the accuracy of the phonetic-based model, the spelling-based model, and the linear combination in transliterating names from Arabic into English on the development and test sets.
    We also, present the transliteration accuracy of human translators on the same task.
