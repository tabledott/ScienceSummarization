t specify relationships between the members.
    (As mentioned above, the conceptual hierarchy is the best place for encoding known role-related expectations.)
    The use of clusters for sense discrimination is also comparable to approaches that favor senses linked by marked paths in a semantic network (Hirst 1987).
    In fact, clusters capture most of the useful associations found in scripts or semantic networks, but lack many of the disadvantages of using networks.
    For example, because clusters do not specify what the exact nature of any association is, learning new clusters from previously processed sentences would be fairly straightforward, in contrast to learning new fragments of network.
    Using clusters also avoids the major problem associated with marker-passing approaches, namely how to prevent the production of stupid paths (or remove them from consideration after they have been produced) (Charniak 1983).
    The relevant difference is that a cluster is cautious because it must explicitly sp
