tences were based on or inspired by centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995), which postulated strong links between the center of attention in comprehension of adjacent sentences and syntactic position and form of reference.
    In a detailed study of information ordering in three very different corpora, (Karamanis et al., to appear) assessed the performance of various formulations of centering.
    Their results were somewhat unexpected, showing that while centering transition preferences were useful, the most successful strategy for information ordering was based on avoiding rough shifts, that is, sequences of sentences that share no entities in common.
    This supports previous findings that such types of transitions are associated with poorly written text and can be used to improve the accuracy of automatic grading of essays based on various non-discourse features (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2000).
    In a more powerful generalization of centering, Barzilay and Lapata (2008) developed a novel approach which do
