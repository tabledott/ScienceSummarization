nd gradient vector for the normal-form model are as follows: where dj is the the gold standard derivation for sentence Sj and B(Sj) is the set of possible derivations for Sj.
    Note that the empirical expectation in (7) is simply a count of the number of times the feature appears in the gold-standard derivations.
  
  
    The packed charts perform a number of roles: they are a compact representation of a very large number of CCG derivations; they allow recovery of the highest scoring parse or dependency structure without enumerating all derivations; and they represent an instance of what Miyao and Tsujii (2002) call a feature forest, which is used to efficiently estimate a log-linear model.
    The idea behind a packed chart is simple: equivalent chart entries of the same type, in the same cell, are grouped together, and back pointers to the daughters indicate how an individual entry was created.
    Equivalent entries form the same structures in any subsequent parsing.
    Since the packed charts are used
