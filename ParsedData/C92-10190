	Word Identification For Mandarin Chinese Sentences
		Keh- J iann Chen Sh ing- l luan Liu Institute of lnfl~rmation Science Academia Sinica Chinese sentences are composed with string of characters without blanks to mark words.
		However the basic unit for sentence parsing and understanding is word.
		Therefore the first step of processing Chinese sentences i to identify the words.
		The difficulties of identifying words include (l) the identification of com- plex words, such as Determinative-Measure, redupli- cations, derived words etc., (2) the identification of proper names,(3) resolving the ambiguous segmenta- tions.
		In this paper, we propose the possible solutions for the above difficulties.
		We adopt a matching algo- rithm with 6 different heuristic rules to resolve the am- biguities and achieve an 99.77% of the success rate.
		The statistical data supports that the maximal match- ing algorithm is the most effective heuristics.
