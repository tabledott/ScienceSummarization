h improvement is due to these features better capturing the syntactic information that is relevant for the task of semantic labeling.
    Also, these features represent syntactic categories about which there is a broad consensus in the literature.
    Therefore, we believe that our results are portable to other frameworks and differently annotated corpora such as dependency corpora.
    We also show that predicting labels from a &#8220;lightweight&#8221; parser that generates deep syntactic features performs comparably to using a full parser that generates only surface syntactic features.
    Improvements along this line may be attained by use of a full TAG parser, such as Chiang (2000) for example.
