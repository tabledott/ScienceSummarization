    Buitelaar and Sacaleanu (2001) have previously explored ranking and selection of synsets in GermaNet for specific domains using the words in a given synset, and those related by hyponymy, and a term relevance measure taken from information retrieval.
    Buitelaar and Sacaleanu have evaluated their method on identifying domain specific concepts using human
