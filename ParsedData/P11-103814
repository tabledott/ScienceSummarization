candidates are then filtered for each token occurrence of a given OOV word, based on their local context fit with a language model.
    Revisiting our manual analysis from Section 3.2, most ill-formed tokens in Twitter are morphophonemically derived.
    First, inspired by Kaufmann and Kalita (2010), any repititions of more than 3 letters are reduced back to 3 letters (e.g. cooool is reduced to coool).
    Second, IV words within a threshold T, character edit distance of the given OOV word are calculated, as is widely used in spell checkers.
    Third, the double metaphone algorithm (Philips, 2000) is used to decode the pronunciation of all IV words, and IV words within a threshold Tp edit distance of the given OOV word under phonemic transcription, are included in the confusion set; this allows us to capture OOV words such as earthquick &#8220;earthquake&#8221;.
    In Table 2, we list the recall and average size of the confusion set generated by the final two strategies with different threshold settings, ba
