 to that entity the listener is most attending to.
    Pronouns can most easily specify the current DF, slightly less easily a member of the PFL, and with slightly more difficulty, a stacked focus.
    Specifying an entity pronominally can shift the listener's attention to it, thereby promoting it to be the next DF.
    Anything else specified in the clause ends up on the PFL, ordered by its original syntactic position.
    (Sidner introduced a separate &amp;quot;agent focus&amp;quot; to allow two entities to be specified pronominally in the same clause, but it was not a critical feature of her approach.)
    As for anaphoric definite NPs, they can specify anything previously introduced (whether on the PFL, a stacked focus, or anything else) or anything related in a mutually inferrable way with the current DF or a member of the PFL.
    In terms of the constraints I mentioned above, it is only those discourse entities that are either the DF or on the PFL that can serve as Ea for an anaphoric definite NP.9 In
