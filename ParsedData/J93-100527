rn for leaving some PPs unattached.
    For this purpose, a threshold could be used.
    Table 4 shows the combined precision and recall levels at various LA thresholds.
    It is clear that the LA score can be used effectively to trade off precision and recall, with a floor for the forced choice at about 80%.
    A comparison of Table 3 with Table 2 indicates, however, that the decline in recall is severe for V attachment.
    And in general, the performance of the LA procedure is worse on V attachment examples than on N attachments, according to both precision and recall criteria.
    The next section is concerned with a classification of the test examples, which gives insight into why performance on V attachments is worse.
    Our model takes frequency of co-occurrence as evidence of an underlying relationship but makes no attempt to determine what sort of relationship is involved.
    It is interesting to see what kinds of relationships are responsible for the associations the model is identifying.
