gulation is also regarded as a primary argument.
    For some event types, other arguments detailing of the events are also defined (Secondary Args. in Table 1).
    From a computational point of view, the event types represent different levels of complexity.
    When only primary arguments are considered, the first five event types require only unary arguments, and the task can be cast as relation extraction between a predicate (event trigger) and an argument (Protein).
    The Binding type is more complex in requiring the detection of an arbitrary number of arguments.
    Regulation events always take a Theme argument and, when expressed, also a Cause argument.
    Note that a Regulation event may take another event as its theme or cause, a unique feature of the BioNLP task compared to other event extraction tasks, e.g.
    ACE.
    In the BioNLP task, events are expressed using three different types of entities.
    Text-bound entities (tentities hereafter) are represented as text spans with associated cla
