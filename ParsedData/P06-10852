    Specifically, this paper demonstrates the importance of contextual dependencies for word segmentation by comparing two probabilistic models that differ only in that the first assumes that the probability of a word is independent of its local context, while the second incorporates bigram dependencies between adjacent words.
    The algorithms we use to search for likely segmentations do differ, but so long as the segmentations they produce are close to optimal we can be confident that any differences in the segmentations reflect differences in the probabilistic models, i.e., in the kinds of dependencies between words.
    We are not the first to propose explicit probabilistic models of word segmentation.
    Two successful word segmentation systems based on explicit probabilistic models are those of Brent (1999) and Venkataraman (2001).
    Brent&#8217;s ModelBased Dynamic Programming (MBDP) system assumes a unigram word distribution.
