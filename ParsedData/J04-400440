 compute priors on lexicalized nonterminals.
    These priors are used as a crude proxy for the outside probability of a chart item (see Baker [1979] and Lari and Young [1990] for full descriptions of the Inside&#8211;Outside algorithm).
    Previous work (Goodman 1997) has shown that the inside probability alone is an insufficient scoring metric when comparing chart items covering the same span during decoding and that some estimate of the outside probability of a chart item should be factored into the score.
    A prior on the root (lexicalized) nonterminal label of the derivation forest represented by a particular chart item is used for this purpose in Collins&#8217; parser.
    22 As described in Bikel (2002), our parsing engine allows easy experimentation with a wide variety of different generative models, including the ability to construct history contexts from arbitrary numbers of previously generated modifiers.
