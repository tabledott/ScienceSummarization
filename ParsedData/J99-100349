ed between aligned blocks.
    It is highly likely that at least some of these segments are mutual translations, despite SIMR's failure to find any points of correspondence between them.
    Therefore, GSA treats all sandwiched empty blocks as aligned blocks.
    If an empty block is not 1x1, GSA realigns it using Gale and Church's length-based algorithm, just as it would realign any other many-to-many aligned block.
    The most problematic cases involve an error of omission adjacent to an error of commission, as in blocks (0, (h)) and ((LK), (i)).
    If the point in cell (J,i) should really be in cell (J,h), then realignment inside the erroneous blocks would not solve the problem.
    A naive solution is to merge these blocks and then to realign them using a length-based method.
    Unfortunately, this kind of alignment pattern, i.e., Ox 1 followed by 2 x 1, is surprisingly often correct.
    Length-based methods assign low probabilities to such pattern sequences and usually get them wrong.
    Therefore,
