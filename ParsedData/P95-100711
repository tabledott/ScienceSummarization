lation shows that using their own preprocessing hueristics to guess a bracketing provides a higher accuracy on their test set than their statistical model does.
    This renders their experiment inconclusive.
  
  
    A test set of syntactically ambiguous noun compounds was extracted from our 8 million word Grolier's encyclopedia corpus in the following way.2 Because the corpus is not tagged or parsed, a somewhat conservative strategy of looking for unambiguous sequences of nouns was used.
    To distinguish nouns from other words, the University of Pennsylvania morphological analyser (described in Karp et al, 1992) was used to generate the set of words that can only be used as nouns (I shall henceforth call this set A).
    All consecutive sequences of these words were extracted, and the three word sequences used to form the test set.
    For reasons made clear below, only sequences consisting entirely of words from Roget's thesaurus were retained, giving a total of 308 test triples.3 These triples were man
