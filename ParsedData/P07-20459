uired have had to be duplicated.
    This has also hindered effective comparisons of the different elements of the systems.
    By providing a free and complete toolkit, we hope that this will stimulate the development of the field.
    For this system to be adopted by the community, it must demonstrate performance that is comparable to the best available systems.
    Moses has shown that it achieves results comparable to the most competitive and widely used statistical machine translation systems in translation quality and run-time (Shen et al. 2006).
    It features all the capabilities of the closed sourced Pharaoh decoder (Koehn 2004).
    Apart from providing an open-source toolkit for SMT, a further motivation for Moses is to extend phrase-based translation with factors and confusion network decoding.
    The current phrase-based approach to statistical machine translation is limited to the mapping of small text chunks without any explicit use of linguistic information, be it morphological, syntactic, o
