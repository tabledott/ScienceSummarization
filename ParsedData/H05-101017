 meaning no learning is needed yet ? we achieve an AER of 29.8, between the Dice with competitive linking result of 34.0 and Model 1 of 25.9 given in Och and Ney (2003).
			An example of the alignment at this stage is shown in Figure 1(a).
			Note that most errors lie off the diagonal, for example the often-correct to-a` match.
			IBM Model 2, as usually implemented, addsthe preference of alignments to lie near the di agonal.
			Model 2 is driven by the product of a word-to-word measure and a (usually) Gaussian distribution which penalizes distortion from thediagonal.
			We can capture the same effect using features which reference the relative posi tions j and k of a pair (e j , f k ).
			In addition to aModel 2-style quadratic feature referencing relative position, we threw in the following proximity features: absolute difference in relative posi tion abs(j/|e|?k/|f |), and the square and squareroot of this value.
			In addition, we used a con junction feature of the dice coefficient times the proximity.
