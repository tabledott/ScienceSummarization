of adjectives (a partition) according to the combined dissimilarity values computed in the previous stage.
    We want to find a partition which is optimal, in the sense that adjectives with high dissimilarity are placed in different groups.
    We use a non-hierarchical clustering algorithm, since such algorithms are in general stronger than hierarchical methods (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990).
    The number of clusters produced is an input parameter.
    The algorithm uses the exchange method (Spath, 1985) since the more commonly used Kmeans method (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990) is not applicable; the K-means method, like all centroid methods, requires the measure d between the clustered objects to be a distance; this means, among other conditions, that for any three objects x, y, and z the triangle inequality applies.
    However, this inequality does not necessarily hold for our dissimilarity measure.
    If the adjectives x and y were observed in the same minimal NP, their dissimilarity is quite large.
