 incorporated a label consistency constraint into probabilistic sequence model named entity recognition systems.
    Mikheev et al. (1999) and Finkel et al.
    (2004) incorporate label consistency information by using adhoc multi-stage labeling procedures that are effective but special-purpose.
    Malouf (2002) and Curran and Clark (2003) condition the label of a token at a particular position on the label of the most recent previous instance of that same token in a prior sentence of the same document.
    Note that this violates the Markov property, but is achieved by slightly relaxing the requirement of exact inference.
    Instead of finding the maximum likelihood sequence over the entire document, they classify one sentence at a time, allowing them to condition on the maximum likelihood sequence of previous sentences.
    This approach is quite effective for enforcing label consistency in many NLP tasks, however, it permits a forward flow of information only, which is not sufficient for all cases of int
