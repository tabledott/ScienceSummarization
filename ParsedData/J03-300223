erally lower quality.
    This suggests that high-quality parallel translations are present in this corpus and that poor-quality parallel translations are very poor (whether because of misalignment or simply because of poor translation quality at the document level) and might therefore be easily distinguishable from the better material.
    We plan to address this in future work.
    Qualitatively, the results are a source of optimism about parallel data from the Web.
    Looking monolingually, fluency of the English side is statistically comparable to that of English sentences from the FBIS parallel corpus (essentially at ceiling), and on average the Chinese Web data are judged somewhere between &#8220;fairly fluent&#8221; and &#8220;very fluent,&#8221; with the median at &#8220;very fluent&#8221; (only the second judge found the fluency of the Chinese Web sentences to be significantly worse than the human-generated Chinese sentences, Mann-Whitney test, p &lt; 0.02). several language pairs, it appears that S
