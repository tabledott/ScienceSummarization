returned this year.
    This year, most of these groups follow a phrasebased statistical approach to machine translation.
    However, several groups submitted results from systems that followed a hybrid approach.
    While building a machine translation system is a serious undertaking we hope to attract more newcomers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry as low as possible.
    The creation of parallel corpora such as the Europarl, the CzEng, and the News Commentary corpora should help in this direction by providing freely available language resources for building systems.

    For more on the participating systems, please refer to the respective system description in the proceedings of the workshop.
  
  
    We evaluated the shared task submissions using both manual evaluation and automatic metrics.
    While automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the day-to-day development of machine tra
