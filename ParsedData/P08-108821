rojected source feature we examined the closest projected target features.
    In table 5(a), we present some of the orthographic feature relationships learned by our system.
    Many of these relationships correspond to phonological and morphological regularities such as the English suffix ing mapping to the Spanish suffix gia.
    In table 5(b), we present context feature correspondences.
    Here, the broad trend is for words which are either translations or semantically related across languages to be close in canonical space.
  
  
    We have presented a generative model for bilingual lexicon induction based on probabilistic CCA.
    Our experiments show that high-precision translations can be mined without any access to parallel corpora.
    It remains to be seen how such lexicons can be best utilized, but they invite new approaches to the statistical translation of resource-poor languages.
