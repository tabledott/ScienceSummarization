red, independent, morphological and syntactic components of which scores are combined to cater for the joint inference task.
    Both (Tsarfaty, 2006; Cohen and Smith, 2007) have shown that a single integrated framework outperforms a completely streamlined implementation, yet neither has shown a single generative model which handles both tasks.
  
  
    A Hebrew surface token may have several readings, each of which corresponding to a sequence of segments and their corresponding PoS tags.
    We refer to different readings as different analyses whereby the segments are deterministic given the sequence of PoS tags.
    We refer to a segment and its assigned PoS tag as a lexeme, and so analyses are in fact sequences of lexemes.
    For brevity we omit the segments from the analysis, and so analysis of the form &#8220;fmnh&#8221; as f/REL mnh/VB is represented simply as REL VB.
    Such tag sequences are often treated as &#8220;complex tags&#8221; (e.g.
    REL+VB) (cf.
