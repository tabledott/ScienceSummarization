  Learning Synchronous Grammars for Semantic Parsing with Lambda Calculus
  
    This paper presents the first empirical results to our knowledge on learning synchronous grammars that generate logical forms.
    Using statistical machine translation techniques, a semantic parser based on a synchronous grammar augmented with operators is learned given a set of training sentences and their correct logical forms.
    The resulting parser is shown to be the bestperforming system so far in a database query domain.
  
  
    Originally developed as a theory of compiling programming languages (Aho and Ullman, 1972), synchronous grammars have seen a surge of interest recently in the statistical machine translation (SMT) community as a way of formalizing syntax-based translation models between natural languages (NL).
    In generating multiple parse trees in a single derivation, synchronous grammars are ideal for modeling syntax-based translation because they describe not only the hierarchical structures of a sentenc
