    In this section, we present experiments and results for two classification tasks: 1) Positive versus Negative and 2) Positive versus Negative versus Neutral.
    For each of the classification tasks we present three models, as well as results for two combinations of these models: For the unigram plus Senti-features model, we present feature analysis to gain insight about what kinds of features are adding most value to the model.
    We also present learning curves for each of the models and compare learning abilities of models when provided limited data.
    Experimental-Set-up: For all our experiments we use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and report averaged 5-fold cross-validation test results.
    We tune the C parameter for SVM using an embedded 5-fold cross-validation on the training data of each fold, i.e. for each fold, we first run 5-fold cross-validation only on the training data of that fold for different valu
