    The MBR scaling parameter (&#945; in Equation 3) is tuned on the dev2 development set.
    We next report translation results from lattice MBR decoding.
    All results will be presented on the NIST 2008 evaluation sets.
    We report results using the NIST implementation of the BLEU score which computes the brevity penalty using the shortest reference translation for each segment (NIST, 2002 2008).
    The BLEU scores are reported at the wordlevel for aren and zhen but at the character level for enzh.
    We measure statistical significance using 95% confidence intervals computed with paired bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004).
    In all tables, systems in a column show statistically significant differences unless marked with an asterisk.
    We first compare lattice MBR to N-best MBR decoding and MAP decoding (Table 2).
    In these experiments, we hold the likelihood scaling factor &#945; a constant; it is set to 0.2 for aren and enzh, and 0.1 for zhen.
    The translation lattices are pruned using Fo
