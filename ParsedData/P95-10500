  Identifying Word Translations In Non-Parallel Texts
  
    Common algorithms for sentence and word-alignment allow the automatic identification of word translations from parallel texts.
    This study suggests that the identification of word translations should also be possible with non-parallel and even unrelated texts.
    The method proposed is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between the patterns of word cooccurrences in texts of different languages.
  
  
    In a number of recent studies it has been shown that word translations can be automatically derived from the statistical distribution of words in bilingual parallel texts (e. g. Catizone, Russell &amp; Warwick, 1989; Brown et al., 1990; Dagan, Church &amp; Gale, 1993; Kay &amp; ROscheisen, 1993).
    Most of the proposed algorithms first conduct an alignment of sentences, i. e. those pairs of sentences are located that are translations of each other.
    In a second step a word alignment is performed by analyzing the correspond
