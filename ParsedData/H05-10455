			Sim ilarly, an IE system that extracts information about terrorism must distinguish between the person who is the perpetrator and the person who is the victim.We hypothesized that IE techniques would be well suited for source identification because an opinion statement can be viewed as a kind of speech event with the source as the agent.
			We investigate two very different learning-basedmethods from information extraction for the problem of opinion source identification: graphical mod els and extraction pattern learning.
			In particular, we consider Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al, 2001) and a variation of AutoSlog (Riloff, 1996a).CRFs have been used successfully for Named En tity recognition (e.g., McCallum and Li (2003),Sarawagi and Cohen (2004)), and AutoSlog has performed well on information extraction tasks in sev eral domains (Riloff, 1996a).
			While CRFs treatsource identification as a sequence tagging task, Au toSlog views the problem
