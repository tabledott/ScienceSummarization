ity as we employ richer extraction techniques.
    The relatively poor performance of Lex with LM in K-Best compared to the baseline shows that we are still making search errors during parsing despite tighter integration of the language model.
    We also ran an experiment with CMU&#8217;s phrasebased decoder (Vogel et al., 2003) using the length7 phrase table.
    While its development-set score was only 31.01, the decoder achieved 31.42 on the test set, placing it at the same level as our extendedcategory system for that phrase table.
  
  
    In this work we applied syntax based resources (the target language parser) to annotate and generalize phrase translation tables extracted via existing phrase extraction techniques.
    Our work reaffirms the feasibility of parsing approaches to machine translation in a large data setting, and illustrates the impact of adding syntactic categories to drive and constrain the structured search space.
    While no improvements were available at submission time, our subse
