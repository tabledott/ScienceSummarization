xample: 3We follow (Gaifman, 1965) throughout this paper by modeling a dependency grammar with a string-rewriting system.
    However, we will identify a derivation with its representation as a tree, and we will sometimes refer to symbols introduced in a rewrite step as &amp;quot;dependent nodes&amp;quot;.
    For a model of a DG based on tree-rewriting (in the spirit of Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi et al., 1975)), see (Nasr, 1995).
    We will call this system generative dependency grammar or GDG for short.
    Derivations in GDG are defined as follows.
    In a rewrite step, we choose a multiset of dependency rules (i.e., a set of instances of dependency rules) which contains exactly one srule and zero or more m-rules.
    The left-hand side nonterminal is the same as that we want to rewrite.
    Call this multiset the rewrite-multiset.
    In the rewriting operation, we introduce a multiset of new nonterminals and exactly one terminal symbol (the head).
    The rewriting operation then must meet the follo
