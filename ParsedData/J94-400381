ision algorithms were employed in different works.
    These include a Bayesian classifier (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1993) and a distance metric between vectors (Schiitze 1993), both inspired from methods in information retrieval; the use of the flip&#8212;flop algorithm for ordering possible informants about the preferred sense, trying to maximize the mutual information between the informant and the ambiguous word (Brown et al. 1991); and the use of confidence intervals to establish the degree of confidence in a certain preference, combined with a constraint propagation algorithm (the current paper).
    At the present stage of research on sense disambiguation, it is difficult to judge whether a certain decision algorithm is significantly superior to others.21 Yet, these decision models can be characterized by several criteria, which clarify the similarities and differences between them.
    As will be explained below, many of the differences are correlated with the different information sources employed b
