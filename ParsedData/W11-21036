struct these systems is not subject to the same constraints as the shared task participants.
    It is possible that part of the reference translations that were taken from online news sites could have been included in the online systems&#8217; models, for instance.
    We therefore categorize all commercial systems as unconstrained when evaluating the results.
    In total, we had 148 primary system entries (including the 46 entries crawled from online sources), and 60 contrastive entries.
    These were made available to distinct words (case-insensitive) is based on the provided tokenizer.
  
  
    participants in the system combination shared task.
    Continuing our practice from last year&#8217;s workshop, we separated the test set into a tuning set and a final held-out test set for system combinations.
    The tuning portion was distributed to system combination participants along with reference translations, to aid them set any system parameters.
    In the European language pairs, the tuning set cons
