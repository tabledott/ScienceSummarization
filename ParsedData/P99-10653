    As usual, with the development test set being available during the development phase, all final results has been obtained on the evaluation test set, which nobody could see beforehand.
  
  
    The parsing model builds on Model 1 of (Collins 97); this section briefly describes the model.
    The parser uses a lexicalized grammar &#8212; each nonterminal has an associated head-word and part-ofspeech (POS).
    We write non-terminals as X (x): X is the non-terminal label, and x is a (w, t) pair where w is the associated head-word, and t as the POS tag.
    See figure 1 for an example lexicalized tree, and a list of the lexicalized rules that it contains.
    Each rule has the fonnl : 'With the exception of the top rule in the tree, which has the form TOP H (h) .
    H is the head-child of the phrase, which inherits the head-word h from its parent P. L1...Ln and RI are left and right mod
