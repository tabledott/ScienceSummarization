column and the random variable is uniformly distributed: E &#8212; U[-0.001, 0.001].
    The first block is multiplied by the left child and the second by the right child:
  
  
    We evaluate the CVG in two ways: First, by a standard parsing evaluation on Penn Treebank WSJ and then by analyzing the model errors in detail.
    We used the first 20 files of WSJ section 22 to cross-validate several model and optimization choices.
    The base PCFG uses simplified categories of the Stanford PCFG Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003a).
    We decreased the state splitting of the PCFG grammar (which helps both by making it less sparse and by reducing the number of parameters in the SU-RNN) by adding the following options to training: &#8216;-noRightRec dominatesV 0 -baseNP 0&#8217;.
    This reduces the number of states from 15,276 to 12,061 states and 602 POS tags.
    These include split categories, such as parent annotation categories like VP&#710;S.
    Furthermore, we ignore all category splits for the SURNN weig
