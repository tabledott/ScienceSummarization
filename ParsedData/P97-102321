d to construct a series of data sets, or graphs, which represent different scenarios corresponding to a given combination of values of P and k. To do this, we construct a random graph by randomly assigning 50 nodes to the two possible orientations.
    Because we don't have frequency and morphology information on these abstract nodes, we cannot predict whether two nodes are of the same or different orientation.
    Rather, we randomly assign links between nodes so that, on average, each node participates in k links and 100 x P% of all links connect nodes of the same orientation.
    Then we consider these links as identified by the link prediction algorithm as connecting two nodes with the same orientation (so that 100 x P% of these predictions will be correct).
    This is equivalent to the baseline link classification method, and provides a lower bound on the performance of the algorithm actually used in our system (Section 5).
    Because of the lack of actual measurements such as frequency on these abstra
