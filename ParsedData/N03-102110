ry MTGs.
    It initializes its chart and fires Y inferences just like Parser R2A.
    It then composes pairs of items into larger items using inference rule A.0 (see below).
    Just like items in ordinary parsers, Parser A items need to know their positions in the input multitext, but not their internal structure.
    However, items with discontinuities need to remember all their boundaries, not just the outermost ones.
    Expanding on Johnson (1985), we define a discontinuous span (or dshort) as a of zero or more intervals = .
    ; where the left boundaries and the are right boundaries between word positions in a text, so /, for 1 &#8226; &lt; for 1 &lt; &lt; m which means that the intervals do not overlap. predefined equivalence classes for new nonterminals.
    &amp;quot;For correct binarization of productions with a distinguished heir, the decomposition must put the heir in the most deeply nested DLV.
    This requirement tends to increase the cardinality of L2MTGs, as shown in Table 1.
