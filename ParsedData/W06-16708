    Supersense tagging is inspired by similar considerations, but in a domain-independent setting; e.g., verb supersenses can label semantic interactions between nominal concepts.
    The following sentence (Example 1), extracted from the data &#8211; further described in Section 5.1 &#8211; shows the information captured by the supersense tagset: guestsn.person in the boxn.artifact, stood upv.motion and demandedv.communication watern.substance.
    As Example 1 shows there is more information that can be extracted from a sentence than just the names; e.g. the fact that &#8220;Clara Harris&#8221; and the following &#8220;guests&#8221; are both tagged as &#8220;person&#8221; might suggest some sort of co-referentiality, while the coordination of verbs of motion and communication, as in &#8220;stood up and demanded&#8221;, might be useful for language modeling purposes.
    In such a setting, structured learning methods, e.g., sequential, can help tagging by taking the sense
