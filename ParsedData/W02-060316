optimal solutions.
    Rejection criteria.
    (1) Rare morphs.
    Reject the segmentation of a word if the segmentation contains a morph that was used in only one word type in the previous iteration.
    This is motivated by the fact that extremely rare morphs are often incorrect.
    (2) Sequences of one-letter morphs.
    Reject the segmentation if it contains two or more one-letter morphs in a sequence.
    For instance, accept the segmentation halua + n (Engl.
    &#8217;I want&#8217;, i.e. present stem of the verb &#8217;to want&#8217; followed by the ending for the first person singular), but reject the segmentation halu + a + n (stem of the noun &#8217;desire&#8217; followed by a strange sequence of endings).
    Long sequences of one-letter morphs are usually a sign of a very bad local optimum that may even get worse in future iterations, in case too much probability mass is transferred onto these short morphs3.
    3Nevertheless, for Finnish there do exist some one-letter morphemes that can occur i
