ic features have been extensively used for tasks such as argument identification: dividing sentences into elementary discourse units among which discourse relations hold (Soricut and Marcu, 2003; Wellner and Pustejovsky, 2007; Fisher and Roark, 2007; Elwell and Baldridge, 2008).
    Syntax has not been used for discourse vs. non-discourse disambiguation, but it is clear from the examples above that discourse connectives appear in specific syntactic contexts.
    The syntactic features we used were extracted from the gold standard Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) parses of the PDTB articles: Self Category The highest node in the tree which dominates the words in the connective but nothing else.
    For single word connectives, this might correspond to the POS tag of the word, however for multi-word connectives it will not.
    For example, the cue phrase in addition is parsed as (PP (IN In) (NP (NN addition) )).
    While the POS tags of &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;addition&#8221; are preposition and noun,
