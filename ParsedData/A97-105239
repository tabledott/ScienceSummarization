classes.
    More generally, for the manually analysed verbs, almost 60% of the false negatives have only one or two exemplars each in the corpus citations.
    None of them are returned by the system because the binomial filter always rejects classes hypothesised on the basis of such little evidence.
    In Figure 4 we estimate the accuracy with which our system ranks true positive classes against the correct ranking for the seven verbs whose corpus input was manually analysed.
    We compute this measure by calculating the percentage of pairs of classes at positions (n, m) s.t. n &lt; m in the system ranking that are ordered the same in the correct ranking.
    This gives us an estimate of the accuracy of the relative frequencies of classes output by the system.
    For each of the seven verbs for which we undertook a corpus analysis, we calculate the token recall of our system as the percentage (over all exemplars) of true positives in the corpus.
    This gives us an estimate of the parsing performance th
