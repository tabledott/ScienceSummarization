of 1996 using two different planning operators.
    While the system we report on is fully implemented, our work is undergoing continuous development.
    Currently, the system includes eight different planning operators, a testbed of 200 input templates grouped into sets on the same event, and can produce fully lexicalized summaries for approximately half of the cases (the rest of the templates were either not complete or the information extracted in them was irrelevant to the task).
    We haven't performed an evaluation beyond the testbed.
    Our work provides a methodology for increasing the vocabulary size and the robustness of the system using a collected corpus, and moreover, it shows how summarization can be used to evaluate the message understanding systems, identifying future research directions that would not be pursued under the current MUC evaluation cycle.2 Due to inherent difficulties in the summarization task, our work is a substantial first step and provides the framework for a number of dif
