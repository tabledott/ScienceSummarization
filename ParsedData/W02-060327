 the percentage of unseen morph/morphemic label pairs is about the same for all three methods.
    This suggests that in a morphologically poor language such as English a restrictive segmentation method, such as Linguistica, can compensate for new word forms &#8211; that it does not recognize at all &#8211; with old, familiar words, that it &#8220;gets just right&#8221;.
    In contrast, the methods presented in this paper produce a morph lexicon that is smaller and able to generalize better to new word forms but has somewhat lower accuracy for already observed word forms.
    Visual inspection of a sample of words.
    In an attempt to analyze the segmentations more thoroughly, we randomly picked 1000 different words from the Finnish test set.
    The total number of occurrences of these words constitute about 2.5% of the whole set.
    We inspected the segmentation of each word visually and classified it into one of three categories: (1) correct and complete segmentation (i.e., all relevant morpheme boundar
