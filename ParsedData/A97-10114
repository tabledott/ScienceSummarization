    The syntactic tagset of the Constraint Grammar provides an underspecific dependency description.
    For example, labels for functional heads (such as CSUBJ, COBJ, CI-OBJ) mark the word which is a head of a noun phrase having that function in the clause, but the parent is not indicated.
    In addition, the representation is shallow, which means that, e.g., objects of infinitives and participles receive the same type of label as objects of finite verbs.
    On the other hand, the non-finite verb forms functioning as objects receive only verbal labels.
    When using the grammar formalism described above, a considerable amount of syntactic ambiguity can not be resolved reliably and is therefore left pending in the parse.
    As a consequence, the output is not optimal in many applications.
    For example, it is not possible to reliably pick head-modifier pairs from the parser output or collect arguments of verbs, which was one of the tasks we originally were interested in.
