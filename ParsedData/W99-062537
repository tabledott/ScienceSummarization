ion of feature values.
    The first is for text length (measured in words), where each feature value is normalized by the size of the textual units in the pair.
    Thus, for a pair of textual units A and B, the feature values are divided by: This operation removes potential bias in favor of longer text units.
    The second type of normalization we examined was based on the relative frequency of occurrence of each primitive.
    This is motivated by the fact that infrequently matching primitive elements are likely to have a higher impact on similarity than primitives which match more frequently.
    We perform this normalization in a manner similar to the IDF part of TF*IDF [Salton 1989].
    Every primitive element is associated with a value which is the number of textual units in which the primitive appeared in the corpus.
    For a primitive element which compares single words, this is the number of textual units which contain that word in the corpus; for a noun phrase, this is the number of textual unit
