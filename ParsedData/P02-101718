onstituent classes, using a slightly more complex generative model in which the bracketing generates a labeling which then generates the constituents and contexts.
    The set of labels for constituent spans and distituent spans are forced to be disjoint.
    Intuitively, it seems that more classes should help, by allowing the system to distinguish different types of constituents and constituent contexts.
    However, it seemed to slightly hurt parsing accuracy overall.
    Figure 8 compares the performance for 2 versus 12 classes; in both cases, only one of the classes was allocated for distituents.
    Overall F1 dropped very slightly with 12 classes, but the category recall numbers indicate that the errors shifted around substantially.
    PP accuracy is lower, which is not surprising considering that PPs tend to appear rather optionally and in contexts in which other, easier categories also frequently appear.
    On the other hand, embedded sentence recall is substantially higher, possibly because of more
