    In searching for the sentence S that maximizes Pr(S) Pr( TI S), we face the difficulty that there are simply too many sentences to try.
    Instead, we must carry out a suboptimal search.
    We do so using a variant of the stack search that has worked so well in speech recognition (Bahl et al. 1983).
    In a stack search, we maintain a list of partial alignment hypotheses.
    Initially, this list contains only one entry corresponding to the hypothesis that the target sentence arose in some way from a sequence of source words that we do not know.
    In the alignment notation introduced earlier, this entry might be (Jean aime MarieI*) where the asterisk is a place holder for an unknown sequence of source words.
    The search proceeds by iterations, each of which extends some of the most promising entries on the list.
    An entry is extended by adding one or more additional words to its hypothesis.
    For example, we might extend the initial entry above to one or more of
