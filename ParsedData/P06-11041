tions between pairs of entities in text.
    The research on relation extraction has been promoted by the Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) (MUC, 19871998) and Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) program (ACE, 2002-2005).
    According to the ACE Program, an entity is an object or set of objects in the world and a relation is an explicitly or implicitly stated relationship among entities.
    For example, the sentence &#8220;Bill Gates is chairman and chief software architect of Microsoft Corporation.&#8221; conveys the ACE-style relation &#8220;EMPLOYMENT.exec&#8221; between the entities &#8220;Bill Gates&#8221; (PERSON.Name) and &#8220;Microsoft Corporation&#8221; (ORGANIZATION.
    Commercial).
    In this paper, we address the problem of relation extraction using kernel methods (Sch&#246;lkopf and Smola, 2001).
    Many feature-based learning algorithms involve only the dot-product between feature vectors.
    Kernel methods can be regarded as a generalization of the feature-based methods by replaci
