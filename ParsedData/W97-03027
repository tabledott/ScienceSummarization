t from the chart, saving time later.
    There is a subtlety about what it means for a node Nxk to be more likely than some other node.
    Ac2, cording to folk wisdom, the best way to measure the likelihood of a node NiCk is to use the probability that the nonterminal X generates the span ti.-tk called the inside probability.
    Formally, we write this as P(X ti...tk), and denote it by (nk ).
    However, this does not give information about the probability of the node in the context of the full parse tree.
    For instance, two nodes, one an NP and the other a FRAU (fragment), may have equal inside probabilities, but since there are far more NPs than there are FRAU clauses, the NP node is more likely overall.
    Therefore, we must consider more information than just the inside probability.
    The outside probability of a node Nfk is the probability of that node given the surrounding terminals of the sentence, i.e.
    P(S _k+1.&#8226;&#8226;tn); which we denote by a(Nick).
    Ideally, we would multiply
