be selected compared to multiple tokens &#8220;&#12525;&#12510;&#12531; / &#12399;&#8221; or &#8220;&#12394; &#12356; / &#24515;&#8221;.
    Moreover, &#8220;&#12525;&#12510;&#12531;&#8221; and &#8220;&#12525;&#12510;&#12531;&#12399;&#8221; have exactly the same POS (Noun), and transition probabilities of these tokens become almost equal.
    Consequentially, there is no choice but to select a short path (single token) in order to maximize the whole sentence probability.
    Table 5 summarizes the number of errors in HMMs, CRFs and MEMMs, using the KC data set.
    Two types of errors, l-error and s-error, are given in this table. l-error (or s-error) means that a system incorrectly outputs a longer (or shorter) token than the correct token respectively.
    By length bias, long tokens are preferred to short tokens.
    Thus, larger number of l-errors implies that the result is highly influenced by the length bias.
    While the relative rates of l-error and s-error are almost the same in HMMs and CRFs, the n
