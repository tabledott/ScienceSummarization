 for relation extraction and our tree kernel takes a big stride towards the right direction.
			Finally, they also show that our composite kernel-based system outper forms other composite kernel-based systems.
	
	
			Structured parse tree information holds great potential for relation extraction.
			This paper proposes a contextsensitive convolution tree kernel to resolve two critical problems in previous tree kernels for relation ex traction by first automatically determining a dynamic context-sensitive tree span and then applying a con text-sensitive convolution tree kernel.
			Moreover, this paper evaluates the complementary nature between our tree kernel and a state-of-the-art linear kernel.
			Evaluation on the ACE RDC corpora shows that our dynamic context-sensitive tree span is much more suitable for relation extraction than the widely -used Shortest Path-enclosed Tree and our tree kernel outperforms the state-of-the-art Collins and Duffy?s con volution tree kernel.
			It also shows that feature-based
