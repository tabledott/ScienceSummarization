he parallel work by Char niak and Johnson (2005) in several ways, including oracle reranking and average number of found parses.
			Ratnaparkhi (1997) introduced the idea of oracle reranking: suppose there exists a perfect reranking scheme that magically picks the best parse that has the highest F-score among the top k parses for each sentence.
			Then the performance of this oracle reranking scheme is the upper bound of any actual reranking system like(Collins, 2000).As k increases, the F-score is nondecreas ing, and there is some k (which might be very large) at which the F-score converges.Ratnaparkhi reports experiments using oracle rerank ing with his statistical parser MXPARSE, which can compute its k-best parses (in his experiments, k = 20).
			Collins (2000), in his parse-reranking experiments, used his Model 2 parser (Collins, 2003) with a beam width of 10?3 together with a cell limit of 100 to obtain k-best lists; the average number of parses obtained per sentence was 29.2, the maximum, 101.7 Charnia
