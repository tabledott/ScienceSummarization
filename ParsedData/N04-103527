ource of information.
    They encode translation transformations that are both syntactically and lexically motivated (some of our rules are purely syntactic; others are lexically grounded).
    A simple sort on the counts of our rules makes explicit the transformations that occur most often.
    A comparison of the number of rules extracted from parallel corpora specific to multiple language pairs provide a quantitative estimator of the syntactic &#8220;closeness&#8221; between various language pairs.
    3.
    The theory we proposed in this paper is independent of the method that one uses to compute the wordlevel alignments in a parallel corpus.
    4.
    The theory and rule-extraction algorithm are also well-suited to deal with the errors introduced by the word-level alignment and parsing programs one uses.
    Our theory makes no a priori assumptions about the transformations that one is permitted to learn.
    If a parser, for example, makes a systematic error, we expect to learn a rule that can nevert
