hat it facilitates the design and implementation f the system, allows one to make an evaluation of the status of the system, and provides a basis for proving certain important properties about he system.
  Introduction There are many cases in which the natural translation of one language into another results in a very different form than that of the original.
  The existence of translation divergences (i.e., cross-linguistic distinctions) makes the straightforward transfer from source structures into target structures impractical.
  This paper demonstrates that a sys- tematic solution to the divergence problem can be derived from the formalization of two types of information: (1) the linguistically grounded classes upon which lexical- semantic divergences are based; and (2) the techniques by which lexical-semantic divergences are resolved.
  An important result of this formalization is the provision of a framework for proving that the lexical-semantic divergence classification proposed in the current approach
