ng an evaluation methodology that factors out inessential degrees of freedom; a proposal, building on this comparison, of a characteristic for classifying similarity functions; and the introduction of a new similarity metric incorporating this characteristic that is superior at evaluating potential proxy distributions.
  
  
    In this section, we describe the seven distributional similarity functions we initally evaluated.2 For concreteness, we choose N and V to be the set of nouns and the set of transitive verbs, respectively; a cooccurrence pair (n, v) results when n appears as the head noun of the direct object of v. We use P to denote probabilities assigned by a base language model (in our experiments, we simply used unsmoothed relative frequencies derived from training corpus counts).
    Let n and m be two nouns whose distributional similarity is to be determined; for notational simplicity, we write q(v) for P(v In) and r (v) for P(v1m), their respective conditional verb cooccurrence probabilities.
