  Learning Bilingual Lexicons from Monolingual Corpora
  
    We present a method for learning bilingual translation lexicons from monolingual corpora.
    Word types in each language are characterized by purely monolingual features, such as context counts and orthographic substrings.
    Translations are induced using a generative model based on canonical correlation analysis, which explains the monolingual lexicons in terms of latent matchings.
    We show that high-precision lexicons can be learned in a variety of language pairs and from a range of corpus types.
  
  
    Current statistical machine translation systems use parallel corpora to induce translation correspondences, whether those correspondences be at the level of phrases (Koehn, 2004), treelets (Galley et al., 2006), or simply single words (Brown et al., 1994).
    Although parallel text is plentiful for some language pairs such as English-Chinese or EnglishArabic, it is scarce or even non-existent for most others, such as English-Hindi or Fr
