rom the 10 000 highest ranked candidates.
    We have applied the statistical test described above to obtain confidence intervals for the true precision values of the bestperforming AM (frequency), given our 10% sample.
    The upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals are shown as thin lines.
    Even the highest precision estimates fall well below the 6.41% precision baseline of the PNV data with .
    Again, we conclude that the exclusion of low-frequency candidates was well justified.
  
  
    We have assessed the significance of differences between AMs using the well-known test as described in (Krenn, 2000).12 The thin lines in Figure 10 delimit 95% confidence intervals around the best-performing measure for the AdjN data with (log-likelihood).
    There is no significant difference between loglikelihood and t-test.
    And only for -best lists with , frequency performs marginally significantly worse than log-likelihood.
    For the PNV data (not shown), the t-test is significantly better t
