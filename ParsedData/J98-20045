e common in practice.
    We cannot calculate p(Nk I to,), since in order to do so, we would need to completely parse the sentence.
    In this paper, we examine the performance of several proposed figures of merit that approximate it in one way or another, using two different grammars.
    We identify a figure of merit that gives superior results on all of our performance measures and on both grammars.
    Section 2 of this paper describes the method we used to determine the effectiveness of figures of merit, that is, to compare how well they choose constituents to be moved from the agenda to the chart.
    Section 2.1 explains the experiment, Section 2.2 describes the measures we used to compare the performance of the figures of merit, and Section 2.3 describes a model we used to represent the performance of a traditional parser using a simple stack as an agenda.
    In Section 3, we describe and compare three simple and easily computable figures of merit based on inside probability.
