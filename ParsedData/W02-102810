r categories as well).
    To alleviate this problem, we modified the scoring function to compute the average logarithm of the number of category members extracted by each pattern.
    The logarithm reduces the influence of any single pattern.
    We will refer to this scoring metric as the AvgLog function, which is defined below.
    Since log2(1) = 0, we add one to each frequency count so that patterns which extract a single category member contribute a positive value.
    Using this scoring metric, all words in the candidate word pool are scored and the top five words are added to the semantic lexicon.
    The pattern pool and the candidate word pool are then emptied, and the bootstrapping process starts over again.
  
  
    Several weakly supervised learning algorithms have previously been developed to generate semantic lexicons from text corpora.
    Riloff and Shepherd (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) developed a bootstrapping algorithm that exploits lexical co-occurrence statistics, and Roark and Charniak
