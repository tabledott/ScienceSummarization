  Arabic Tokenization Part-Of-Speech Tagging And Morphological Disambiguation In One Fell Swoop
  
    We present an approach to using a morphological analyzer for tokenizing and morphologically tagging (including partof-speech tagging) Arabic words in one process.
    We learn classifiers for individual morphological features, as well as ways of using these classifiers to choose among entries from the output of the analyzer.
    We obtain accuracy rates on all tasks in the high nineties.
  
  
    Arabic is a morphologically complex language.1 The morphological analysis of a word consists of determining the values of a large number of (orthogonal) features, such as basic part-of-speech (i.e., noun, verb, and so on), voice, gender, number, information about the clitics, and so on.2 For Arabic, this gives us about 333,000 theoretically possible completely specified morphological analyses, i.e., morphological tags, of which about 2,200 are actually used in the first 280,000 words of the Penn Arabic Treebank (A
