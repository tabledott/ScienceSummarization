ent syntactic positions (such as subject or object), and to be introduced in a main clause.
    The linguistic realization of subsequent mentions&#8212;in particular, pronominalization&#8212;is so tightly linked to salience that in some theories (e.g., Givon 1987) it provides the sole basis for defining a salience hierarchy.
    The hypothesis is that the degree of underspecification in a referring expression indicates the topical status of its antecedent (e.g., pronouns refer to very salient entities, whereas full NPs refer to less salient ones).
    In Centering Theory, this phenomenon is captured in the Pronoun Rule, and Givon&#8217;s Scale of Topicality and Ariel&#8217;s Accessibility Marking Scale propose a graded hierarchy of underspecification that ranges from zero anaphora to full noun phrases, and includes stressed and unstressed pronouns, demonstratives with modifiers, and definite descriptions.
    Entity-based theories capture coherence by characterizing the distribution of entities across discour
