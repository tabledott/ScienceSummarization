ively appealing way of thinking about the representation of various kinds of knowledge.
    This fact has not gone unnoticed by a number of researchers working on lexical knowledge representation, e.g.
    de Smedt (1984), Flickinger et al. (1985), Calder &amp; te Linden (1987), Daelemans (1987a,1987b), Gazdar (1987) and Calder (1989).
    However, many such networks have been realized in the context of programming systems or programming languages that leave their precise meaning unclear.
    In the light of Braclunan (1985), Ether. ington (1988) and much other recent work, it ha become apparent that the formal properties oi notations intended to represent inheritance arc highly problematic.
    Although not discussec here, DATR has a formal semantics (Evans &amp; Gazdar 1989) for which some completeness anc soundness results have been derived.
    These results, and others (on complexity, for example; will be provided in a subsequent paper.
    There are several prototype computational implementa. tions of t
