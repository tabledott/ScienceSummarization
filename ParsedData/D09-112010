istically assign a set of compatible NER values (e.g. personal pronouns can only be a PERpositive and i-within-i constraint.
    The i-withini constraint disallows coreference between parent and child NPs unless the child is an appositive.
    Hashed numbers indicate ground truth but are not in the actual trees.
    SON, but its can be an ORGANIZATION or LOCATION).
    Since the NER tagger typically does not label non-proper NP heads, we have no NER compatibility information for nominals.
    We incorporate agreement constraints by filtering the set of possible antecedents to those which have compatible number and NER types with the target mention.
    This yields 53.4 pairwise F1, and reduces pronoun antecedent errors to 42.5% from 34.4%.
    An example of the type of error fixed by these agreement constraints is given by Figure 2.
    Our system has so far focused only on improving pronoun anaphora resolution.
    However, a plurality of the errors made by our system are amongst nonpronominal mentions.8 We
