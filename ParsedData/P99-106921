 Indeed, the number and choice of features strongly influences the performance of the model.
    The estimated models are able to identify the correct parse from the set of all possible parses approximately 50% of the time.
    We would have liked to introduce features corresponding to dependencies between lexical items.
    Log-linear models are well-suited for lexical dependencies, but because of the large number of such dependencies substantially larger corpora will probably be needed to estimate such mo dels .1 'Alternatively, it may be possible to use a simpler non-SUBG model of lexical dependencies estimated from a much larger corpus as the reference distribution with parses of the test corpus that were the correct parses, and &#8212; log PL(E5test) is the negative logarithm of the pseudo-likelihood of the test corpus.
    However, there may be applications which can benefit from a model that performs even at this level.
    For example, in a machine-assisted translation system a model like ours could b
