f both approaches.
    There have been other attempts in NLP to jointly model multiple levels of structure, with varying degrees of success.
    Most work on joint parsing and semantic role labeling (SRL) has been disappointing, despite obvious connections between the two tasks.
    Sutton and McCallum (2005) attempted to jointly model PCFG parsing and SRL for the CoNLL 2005 shared task, but were unable to improve performance on either task.
    The CoNLL 2008 shared task (Surdeanu et al., 2008) was joint dependency parsing and SRL, but the top performing systems decoupled the tasks, rather than building joint models.
    Zhang and Clark (2008) successfully built a joint model of Chinese word segmentation and parts of speech using a single perceptron.
    An alternative approach to joint modeling is to take a pipelined approach.
    Previous work on linguistic annotation pipelines (Finkel et al., 2006; Hollingshead and Roark, 2007) has enforced consistency from one stage to the next.
    However, these models
