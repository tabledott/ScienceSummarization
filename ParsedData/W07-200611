			mance by heavily exploiting the coarse nature of the sense inventory.
			In Table 5 we report the results for each of the five articles.
			The interesting aspect of the table is that documents from some domains seem to havepredominant senses different from those in Sem Cor.
			Specifically, the MFS baseline performs more poorly on documents d004 and d005, from the COMPUTER SCIENCE and BIOGRAPHY domains respectively.
			We believe this is due to the fact that these documents have specific predominant senses, which correspond less often to the most frequent sense in SemCor than for the other three documents.
			It is also interesting to observe that different systemsperform differently on the five documents (we high light in bold the best performing systems on each article).
			Finally, we calc
