is.
    Similar comparisons made between a large corpus of general text and a domain-specific text can be used to produce lists consisting only of words and bigrams characteristic of the domain-specific texts.
    This comparison was done by creating a contingency table that contained the following counts of each bigram that appeared in the text: where the A B represents the bigram in which the first word is not word A and the second is word B.
    If the words A and B occur independently, then we would expect p(AB) -= p(A)p(B) where p(AB) is the probability of A and B occurring in sequence, p(A) is the probability of A appearing in the first position, and p(B) is the probability of B appearing in the second position.
    We can cast this into the mold of our earlier binomial analysis by phrasing the null hypothesis that A and B are independent as p(A I B) = p(A H B) = p(A).
    This means that testing for the independence of A and B can be done by testing to see if the distribution of A given that B is prese
