    The number of sentences in this data set is nearly twice that of the English treebank, leading to a very large number of features &#8212; 13, 450, 672.
    But again, each instance uses just a handful of these features.
    For POS tags we used the automatically generated tags in the data set.
    Though we made no language specific model changes, we did need to make some data specific changes.
    In particular, we used the method of Collins et al. (1999) to simplify part-of-speech tags since the rich tags used by Czech would have led to a large but rarely seen set of POS features.
    The model based on MIRA also performs well on Czech, again slightly outperforming averaged perceptron.
    Unfortunately, we do not know of any other parsing systems tested on the same data set.
    The Czech parser of Collins et al. (1999) was run on a different data set and most other dependency parsers are evaluated using English.
    Learning a model from the Czech training data is somewhat p
