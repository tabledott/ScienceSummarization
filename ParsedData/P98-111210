ts - or synsets - are connected by different semantic relationships such as hypernymy (i.e. plunging is a way of descending), synonymy, antonymy, and others (see Fellbaum 1990).
    The determination of relatedness via taxonomic relations has a rich history (see Resnik 1993 for a review).
    The premise is that words with similar meanings will be located relatively close to each other in the hierarchy.

    The WN-Verber tool.
    We used the hypernym relationship in WordNet because of its high coverage.
    We counted the number of edges needed to find a common ancestor for a pair of verbs.
    Given the hierarchical structure of WordNet, the lower the edge count, in principle, the closer the verbs are semantically.
    Because WordNet common ancestor inform__ let know testify to, ... indicate, ... announce, ... &#9632; abduce, ..., cite attest, report post sound allows individual words (via synsets) t
