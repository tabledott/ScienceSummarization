ssibilities that we obtain by using the second interpretation.
    An important open problem of this approach is the handling of complex features in search.
    An interesting question is to come up with features that allow an efficient handling using conventional dynamic programming search algorithms.
    In addition, it might be promising to optimize the parameters directly with respect to the error rate of the MT system as is suggested in the field of pattern and speech recognition (Juang et al., 1995; Schl&#168;uter and Ney, 2001).
