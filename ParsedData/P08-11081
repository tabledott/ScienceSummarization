    One advantage of this representation is that it extends naturally to discontinuous constructions, which arise due to long distance dependencies or in languages where syntactic structure is encoded in morphology rather than in word order.
    This is undoubtedly one of the reasons for the emergence of dependency parsers for a wide range of languages.
    Many of these parsers are based on data-driven parsing models, which learn to produce dependency graphs for sentences solely from an annotated corpus and can be easily ported to any language or domain in which annotated resources exist.
    Practically all data-driven models that have been proposed for dependency parsing in recent years can be described as either graph-based or transitionbased (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).
    In graph-based parsing, we learn a model for scoring possible dependency graphs for a given sentence, typically by factoring the graphs into their component arcs, and perform parsing by searching for the highest-sc
