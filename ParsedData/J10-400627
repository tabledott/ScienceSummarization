    In DM, we formalize the weighted tuple structure as a labeled third-order tensor, from which semantic spaces are then derived through the operation of labeled matricization.
    Tensors are multi-way arrays, conventionally denoted by boldface Euler script letters: X (Turney 2007; Kolda and Bader 2009).
    The order (or n-way) of a tensor is the number of indices needed to identify its elements.
    Tensors are a generalization of vectors and matrices.
    The entries in a vector can be denoted by a single index.
    Vectors are thus first-order tensors, often indicated by a bold lowercase l
