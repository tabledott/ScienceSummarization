level if . ) was much lower and we find that at the same confidence level of 99%.
    However, due to the very large number of low-frequency candidates, there may be as many as 4200 collocations in the PNV data with , more than 4 times the number identified in our experiment.
    It is imaginable, then, that one of the AMs 11To be precise, the binomial distribution is itself an approximation of the exact hypergeometric probabilities (cf.
    Pedersen (1996)).
    This approximation is sufficiently accurate as long as the sample size is small compared to the size of the base set (i.e., the number of low-frequency candidates). might succeed in extracting a substantial number of collocations from the low-frequency PNV data.
    Figure 9 shows precision curves for the 10 000 highest ranked word combinations from each SL for PNV combinations with (the vertical lines correspond to -best lists for ).
    In order to reduce the amount of manual work, the precision values for each AM are based on a 10% random sample f
