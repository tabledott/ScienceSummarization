    Because the average narrative length is 100 prosodic phrases and boundaries are relatively infrequent (average boundary frequency=16%), percent agreement among 7 subjects (row one in Table 1) is largely determined by percent agreement on non-boundaries (row three).
    Thus, total percent agreement could be very high, even if subjects did not agree on any boundaries.
    However, our results show that percent agreement on boundaries is not only high (row two), but also statistically significant.
    We have shown that boundaries agreed on by at least 4 subjects are very unlikely to be the result of chance.
    Rather, they most likely reflect the validity of the notion of segment as defined here.
    In Figure 2, 6 of the 11 possible boundary sites were identified by at least 1 subject.
    Of these, only two were identified by a majority of subjects.
    If we take these two boundaries, appearing after prosodic phrases 3.3 and 8.4, to be statistically validated, we arrive at a linear version of the se
