loops.
    As an example, consider the following simple left-recursive SCFG. where q = 1 &#8212; p. Nonprobabilistically, the prediction loop at position 0 would stop after producing the states corresponding to just two out of an infinity of possible paths.
    The correct forward probabilities are obtained as a sum of infinitely many terms, accounting for all possible paths of length 1.
    In these sums each p corresponds to a choice of the first production, each q to a choice of the second production.
    If we didn't care about finite computation the resulting geometric series could be computed by letting the prediction loop (and hence the summation) continue indefinitely.
    Fortunately, all repeated prediction steps, including those due to left-recursion in the productions, can be collapsed into a single, modified prediction step, and the corresponding sums computed in closed form.
    For this purpose we need a probabilistic version of the well-known parsing concept of a left corner, which is also at
