    As has been noticed elsewhere (Bourigault, 1992; Justeson and Katz, 1993), most technical terms can be found by looking for multiword noun phrases that satisfy a rather restricted set of syntactic patterns.
    We follow Justeson and Katz (1993) who emphasize the importance of term frequency in selecting good candidate terms.
    An expert terminologist can then skim the list of candidates to weed out spurious candidates and cliches.
    Very simple procedures of this kind have been remarkably successful.
    They can save an enormous amount of time over the current practic
