ing training instances with target instances with predicted labels.
    We evaluated the proposed method with three adaptation problems in NLP, including POS tagging, NE type classification, and spam filtering.
    The results show that regular semi-supervised and supervised learning methods do not perform as well as our new method, which explicitly captures domain difference.
    Our results also show that incorporating and exploiting more information from the target domain is much more useful for improving performance than excluding misleading training examples from the source domain.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    In Section 2, we formally analyze the domain adaptation problem and distinguish two types of adaptation.
    In Section 3, we then propose a general instance weighting framework for domain adaptation.
    In Section 4, we present the experiment results.
    Finally, we compare our framework with related work in Section 5 before we conclude in Section 6.
