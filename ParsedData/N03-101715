211; say, by counting syntactic phrase pairs twice &#8211; or during translation &#8211; each time the decoder uses a syntactic phrase pair, it credits a bonus factor to the hypothesis score.
    We found that neither of these methods result in significant improvement of translation performance.
    Even penalizing the use of syntactic phrase pairs does not harm performance significantly.
    These results suggest that requiring phrases to be syntactically motivated does not lead to better phrase pairs, but only to fewer phrase pairs, with the loss of a good amount of valuable knowledge.
    One illustration for this is the common German &#8220;es gibt&#8221;, which literally translates as &#8220;it gives&#8221;, but really means &#8220;there is&#8221;.
    &#8220;Es gibt&#8221; and &#8220;there is&#8221; are not syntactic constituents.
    Note that also constructions such as &#8220;with regard to&#8221; and &#8220;note that&#8221; have fairly complex syntactic representations, but often simple one word tran
