			Table 2 shows their values.
			We can conclude from these numbers that the 3 sources provide a reasonable quality data.
			This means that combining them might bring some improvement to the polarity detection instead of, for instance, using one of them in isolation.
			An aspect that is overlooked by quality is the bias of the data.
			For instance, by examining the data from TwitterFeel,we found out that only 4 positive words (?awe some?,?rock?,?love?
			and ?beat?)
			cover 95% of their positive examples and only 6 negative words (?hate?,?suck?,?wtf?,?piss?,?stupid?
			and ?fail?)
			cover 96% of their negative set.
