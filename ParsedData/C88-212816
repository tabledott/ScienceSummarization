tachment [Fra~zier and Fodor, 1978].
  However, unlike the earlier characterization in terms of LlZ disambiguation, this mechanism can be used for arbitrary logic or unification-based gram- mars, not just context-free grammars.
  Furthermore, the architecture allows for fine tuning of the disambiguation strategy beyond that de- scribed in earlier work.
  Finally, the strategy is complete, allowing "backtracking" if earlier proof paths lead to a dead eudf 4.2 A Pars ing  Example As a demonstration f the architecture used as a parser, we consider the Earley and backtracking-LR instances in parsing the ambiguous sentence: Castillo said Sonny was shot yesterday.
  Since the operation of the architecture as a parser is quite similar to that of previous parsers for unification-based formalisms, we will only highlight a few crucial steps in the process.
  The Earley parser assigns higher priority to items ending earlier in the sentence.
  The highest-priority initialization items are added first, s [O,S-~ ,NP  VP,
