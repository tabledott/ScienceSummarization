 Next, a head word is assigned to each constituent.
    After this, grammatical functions are inferred, allowing a dependency tree to be created.
    To find head children (used in assign-heads), a system of rules is used or if h and d are inside a split word Set the function tag of d to L in T if h and d are part of a larger constituent procedure reattach-traces(T) for each empty category t in T set the function tag of s to OBJ set the function tag of S to OPRD else e &#8592; index of last child of N find head child H between 1 and e according to head rules (Table 3) N.head &#8592; H.head procedure is-coordinated(N) if N has the label UCP return True if N has a CC or CONJP child which is not leftmost return True if N has a , or : child c, and c is not leftmost or rightmost or crossed by an apposition link, return True else return False procedure create-dependency-tree(T) (Table 3).
