			We show that per formance can be compromised due to incomplete coverage (i.e., missing frame or predicate entries as well as annotated sentences) but also because of mismatching question-answer representations.
			The question and the answer may evoke different frames or the answer simply falls outside the scope of agiven frame (i.e., in a non predicate-argument structure).
			Our study shows that mismatches are rela tively frequent and motivates the use of semantically informed methods in conjunction with syntax-based methods.
			Important future directions lie in evaluating the contribution of alternative semantic role frameworks (e.g., PropBank) to the answer extraction task anddeveloping models that learn semantic roles di rectly from unannotated text without the support of FrameNet annotations (Grenager and Manning, 2006).
			Beyond question answering, we also plan to investigate the potential of our model for shallow semantic parsing since our experience so far has shown that it achieves go
