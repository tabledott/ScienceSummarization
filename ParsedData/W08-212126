e support chain took + dozens + of is represented as a sequence of dependencies: of depends on Mary, dozens depends on of and took depends on dozens.
    Each of these dependencies is labeled SU.
    The syntactic dependency types are divided into atomic types that consist of a single label, and nonatomic types consisting of more than one label.
    There are 38 atomic and 70 non-atomic labels in the corpus.
    There are three types of non-atomic labels: those consisting of a PRD or OPRD concatenated with an adverbial label such as LOC or TMP; gapping labels such as GAP-SBJ; and combined adverbial tags such as LOC-TMP.
    Table 4 shows statistics for the atomic syntactic dependencies: label type, the frequency of the label in the complete corpus, and a description of the label.
    Table 5 shows the corresponding statistics for non-atomic dependencies, excluding gapping dependencies.
    The non-atomic labels are rare, which made it difficult to learn these relations effectively.
