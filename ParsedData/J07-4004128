    The results for CCGbank were obtained using the oracle method described previously. aux 93.33 91.00 92.15 95.03 90.75 92.84 96.47 90.33 93.30 400 conj 72.39 72.27 72.33 79.02 75.97 77.46 83.07 80.27 81.65 595 ta 42.61 51.37 46.58 51.52 11.64 18.99 62.07 12.59 20.93 292 det 87.73 90.48 89.09 95.23 94.97 95.10 97.27 94.09 95.66 1,114 arg mod 79.18 75.47 77.28 81.46 81.76 81.61 86.75 84.19 85.45 8,295 mod 74.43 67.78 70.95 71.30 77.23 74.14 77.83 79.65 78.73 3,908 ncmod 75.72 69.94 72.72 73.36 78.96 76.05 78.88 80.64 79.75 3,550 xmod 53.21 46.63 49.70 42.67 53.93 47.
