 worse than our three baselines.
    By looking at the middle four columns, we can see that adding non-arc-factored features makes the models more accurate, for all languages.
    With the exception of Portuguese, the best results are achieved with the full set of features.
    We can also observe that, for some languages, the valency features do not seem to help.
    Merely modeling the number of dependents of a word may not be as valuable as knowing what kinds of dependents they are (for example, distinguishing among arguments and adjuncts).
    Comparing with the baselines, we observe that our full model outperforms that of McDonald and Pereira (2006), and is in line with the most accurate dependency parsers (Nivre and McDonald, 2008; Martins et al., 2008), obtained by combining transition-based and graph-based parsers.14 Notice that our model, compared with these hybrid parsers, has the advantage of not requiring an ensemble configuration (eliminating, for example, the need to tune two parsers).
