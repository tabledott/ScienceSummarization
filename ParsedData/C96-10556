uch predictable rela- tionships are not confined to an insignificant portion of the vocabulary, Levin surveys 4183 verbs, grouped into 191 semantic lasses in Part Two of her book.
  The syn- tactic behavior of these classes is illustrated with 1668 example sentences, an average of 8 sentences per (:lass.
  Given the scope of bevins work, it is not easy to verify the central thesis.
  lb this end, we created a database of Levins verb classes and example sentences from each class, and wrote a parser to extract, basic syn- tactic patterns from tire sentences.1 We then character- ized each semantic lass by a set of syntactic patterns, which we call a syntactic signature, and used the re- suiting database as the basis of two experiments, both designed to to discover whether the syntactic signatures tell us anything about the meaning of the verbs.
  2 [he first experiment, which we label Verb-Based, ignores word-sense distinctions by assigning one syntactic sig- nature to each verb, regardless of whether it occurre
