erminates.
    A similar queuing scheme, with the start index order reversed, can be used for the reverse completion step needed in the computation of outer probabilities (Section 5.2).
    B.3 Efficient Parsing with Large Sparse Grammars During work with a moderate-sized, application-specific natural language grammar taken from the BeRP speech system (Jurafsky, Wooters, Tajchman, Segal, Stolcke, Foster, and Morgan 1994) we had an opportunity to optimize our implementation of the algorithm.
    Below we relate some of the lessons learned in the process.
    B.3.1 Speeding up matrix inversions.
    Both prediction and completion steps make use of a matrix R defined as a geometric series derived from a matrix P. Both P and R are indexed by the nonterminals in the grammar.
    The matrix P is derived from the SCFG rules and probabilities (either the left-corner relation or the unit production relation).
    For an application using a fixed grammar the time taken by the precomputation of left-corner and unit prod
