ish string, which would require a more expensive summation over derivations.
    We now discuss the details of the decoder, focusing attention on efficiently calculating English language-model probabilities for possible translations, which is the primary technical challenge.
    In the following we present several parsers as deductive proof systems (Shieber, Schabes, and Pereira 1995; Goodman 1999).
    A parser in this notation defines a space of weighted items, in which some items are designated axioms and some items are designated goals (the items to be proven), and a set of inference rules of the form which means that if all the items Ii (called the antecedents) are provable, with weight wi, then I (called the consequent) is provable, with weight w, provided the side condition &#966; holds.
    The parsing process grows a set of provable items: It starts with the axioms, and proceeds by applying inference rules to prove more and more items until a goal is proven.
    For example, the well-known CKY algori
