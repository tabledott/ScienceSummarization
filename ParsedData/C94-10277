 network, the output unit with the higlu.st activation indicates, which tag shouhl be attached to the word that is cur- rently processed.
  The input of the network comprises all the informa- tion whicii the systeni ti;Ls about the parts of speech of the current word, the p precedhig words al,d the f fol- lowing words.
  More precisely, for each part-of-speech tag posj and each of the p-t- 1-kf words in the context, there is an input unit whose activation in U represents the probability that wordl h~Ls part of speech posj.
  For the word which is being tagged and the fol- lowing words, the lezical part-of-speech probability l(posj]wordi) is all we know about the part of speech ~, This probability does not take into account arty contextual influences.
  So, we get the following in- put representation for the currently tagged word and the following words: i , , , j  : v(vo.,v I,,,o,.d,), ir i &gt; o (s) 2 Lexical probabilities are estimated hy dividing, the number of times a word occurs with a giw:n tag by the
