 surface realization of the pairs.
    The collected paraphrases were sent as input to HIT-2 (Grammaticality).
    After this validation HIT, the number of acceptable paraphrases was reduced to 1,326 (with 88 discarded sentences, corresponding to 6.22% of the total).
    The retained paraphrases were paired with their corresponding original sentences, and sent to HIT-3 (Bidirectional Entailment) to be judged for semantic equivalence.
    The pairs marked as bidirectional entailments (1,205) were divided in three groups: 25% of the pairs (301) were directly stored in the final corpus, while the ENG1 paraphrases of the remaining 75% (904) were equally distributed to the next modification steps.
    In both HIT-4a (Add Information) and HIT-4b (Remove information) two new modified sentences were asked for each of the 452 paraphrases received as input.
    The sentences collected in these generation tasks were respectively 916 and 923.
    The new modified sentences were sent back to HIT-2 (Grammaticality) and HIT
