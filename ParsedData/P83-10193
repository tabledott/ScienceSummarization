imply as an instance of the general non-linguistic rule that multiple instances of the same thing count as a single instance.
    The category copying rules are generalizations of simple copying, applied to a knowledge of linguistic categories.
    Making the transition from surface copies to category copies is aided by the fact that there is considerable overlap in coverage, defining a path of expanding generalization.
    Thus at the earliest stages of learning, only the simplest, non-linguistic self-correction rules would come into play, and gradually the more syntactically integrated would be acquired.
    Contrast this self-correction system to an approach that handles non-fluencies by some general problem solving routines, for example Granger (1982), who proposes reasoning from what a speaker might be expected to say.
    Besides the obvious inefficiencies of general problem solving approaches, it is worth giving special emphasis to the problem with learnability.
    A general problem solving approach d
