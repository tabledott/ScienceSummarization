    These feature vectors are in fact the first order context vectors of the feature words (and not target word).
    The words that co&#8211;occur with the feature words form the dimensions of the feature space.
    Sch&#168;utze reduces the dimensionality of this feature space using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which is also employed by related techniques such as Latent Semantic Indexing (Deerwester et al., 1990) and Latent Semantic Analysis (Landauer et al., 1998).
    SVD has the effect of converting a word level feature space into a concept level semantic space that smoothes the fine distinctions between features that represent similar concepts.
    Pedersen and Bruce represent instances in a (dis)similarity space where each instance can be seen as a point and the distance between any two points is a function of their mutual (dis)similarities.
    The (dis)similarity matrix showing the pair-wise (dis)similarities among the instances is given as the input to the agglomerative clust
