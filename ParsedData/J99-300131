    We briefly list the major claims of our approach to centering.
    In the following sections, we elaborate on these claims, in particular the ranking of the forward-looking centers.
    In contrast to the BFP algorithm, the model of functional centering requires neither a backward-looking center, nor transitions, nor transition ranking criteria for anaphora resolution.
    For text interpretation, at least, functional centering also makes no commitments to further constraints and rules.
    In this section, we introduce the functional Cf ranking criteria.
    We first describe a basic version, which is valid for a wide range of text genres in which pronominal reference is the predominant text phenomenon.
    This is the type of discourse to which centering was mainly applied in previous approaches (see, for example,
