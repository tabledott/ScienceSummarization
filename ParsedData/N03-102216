if one of its parent clauses come from the Set of Support.
    The axioms that are placed in the SOS are the candidate answers, the question negated (to invoke the proof by contradiction), and axioms related to linking named entities to answer types.
    Axioms placed in the Usable list are: (1) Extended WordNet axioms, (2) NLP axioms, and (3) axioms based on outside world knowledge, such as people and organizations.
    The inference rule sets are based on hyperresolution and paramodulation.
    Hyperresolution is an inference rule that does multiple binary resolution steps in one, where binary resolution is an inference mechanism that looks for a positive literal in one clause and negative form of that same literal in another clause such that the two literals can be canceled, resulting in a newly inferred clause.
    Paramodulation introduces the notion of equality substitution so that axioms representing equality in the proof do not need to be explicitly included in the axiom lists.
