 and operator appearing in the logical forms constructed by the semantic rules.
    Sorts are located in a conceptual hierarchy and are implemented as Prolog terms such that more general sorts subsume more specific sorts (Mellish, 1988).
    This allows the subsumption checking and packing in the parser to share structure whenever possible.
    Semantic coverage with sortal constraints applied was 87.4% on the training set, and on the test set it was 83.7%.
    Gemini, syntactic and semantic processing is fully interleaved.
    Building an edge requires that syntactic constraints be applied, which results in a tree structure, to which semantic rules can be applied, which results in a logical form to which sortal contraints can be applied.
    Only if the syntactic edge leads to a well-sorted semantically-acceptable logical form fragment is it added to the chart.
    Interleaving the syntax and semantics in this way depends on a crucial property of the semantics: a semantic interpretation is available for each
