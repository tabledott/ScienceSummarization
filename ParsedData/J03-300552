r class-based smoothing).
    The smoothing method discussed above is simply one type of class-based smoothing.
    Other, more sophisticated class-based methods do away with the simplifying assumption that the argument co-occurring with a given predicate (adjective, noun, verb) is distributed evenly across its conceptual classes and attempt to find the right level of generalization in a concept hierarchy, by discounting, for example, the contribution of very general classes (Clark and Weir 2001; McCarthy 2000; Li and Abe 1998).
    Other smoothing approaches such as discounting (Katz 1987) and distance-weighted averaging (Grishman and Sterling 1994; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999) re-create counts of unseen word combinations by exploiting only corpus-internal evidence, without relying on taxonomic information.
    Our goal was to demonstrate that frequencies retrieved from the Web are a viable alternative to conventional smoothing methods when data are sparse; we do not claim that our Web-based method is neces
