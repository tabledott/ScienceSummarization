aps onto [kandao ... Bi&#8217;er] on the Chinese side.
    This target span is contiguous, because no word within this span is aligned to a source word outside of the source span.
    In this case we say feature c(st&#8722;1, st) =+, which encourages &#8220;reduce&#8221;.
    However, in Figure 3(b), the source span is still [saw .. Bill], but this time maps onto a much longer span on the Chinese side.
    This target span is discontiguous, since the Chinese words na and wangyuanjin are alinged to English &#8220;with&#8221; and &#8220;telescope&#8221;, both of which fall outside of the source span.
    In this case we say feature c(st&#8722;1, st) =&#8722;, which discourages &#8220;reduce&#8221; .
    Similarly, we can develop another feature cR(st, wi) for the shift action.
    In Figure 3(c), when considering shifting &#8220;with&#8221;, the source span becomes [Bill .. with] which maps to [na .. Bi&#8217;er] on the Chinese side.
    This target span looks like discontiguous in the above definition with wan
