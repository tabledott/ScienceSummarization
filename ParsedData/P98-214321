).
    For the training data from the genre of technical manuals, it was rule 5 (see Baldwin 1997) which was most frequently used (39% of the cases, 100% success), followed by rule 8 (33% of the cases, 33% success), rule 7 (11%, 100%), rule 1 (9%, 100%) and rule 3 (7.4%, 100%).
    It would be fair to say that even though the results show superiority of our approach on the training data used (the genre of technical manuals), they cannot be generalised automatically for other genres or unrestricted texts and for a more accurate picture, further extensive tests are necessary.
  
  
    An attractive feature of any NLP approach would be its language &amp;quot;universality&amp;quot;.
    While we acknowledge that most of the monolingual NLP approaches are not automatically transferable (with the same degree of efficiency) to other languages, it would be highly desirable if this could be done with minimal adaptation.
    We used the robust approach as a basis for developing a genre-specific reference resolution ap
