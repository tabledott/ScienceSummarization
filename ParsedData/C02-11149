 1 Let A be a set of nodes and let N(A), the neighbours of A, be the nodes which are linked to any a ? A.
			(So N(A) = ? a?AN(a).)
			The best new node is taken to be the node b ? N(A)\A with the highest proportion of links to N(A).
			More precisely, for each u ? N(A)\A, let the affinity between u and A be given by the ratio |N(u) ?N(A)| |N(u)| . The best new node b ? N(A) \ A is the node which maximises this affinity score.
			This algorithm has been built into an on-line demonstration where the user inputs a givenseed word and can then see the cluster of re lated words being gradually assembled.
			The algorithm is particularly effective atavoiding infections arising from spurious co occurrences and from ambiguity.
			Consider, forexample, the graph built around the word ap ple in Figure 6.
			Suppose that we start with the seed-list apple, orange, banana.
			However many times the string ?Apple and Novell?
			occurs in the corpus, the novell node will not be addedto this list because it doesn?t have a li
