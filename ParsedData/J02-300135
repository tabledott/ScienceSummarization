he path and gov features are compared in Section 4.3.
    The differences between the two are relatively small for the purpose of identifying semantic roles when frame element boundaries are known.
    The path feature will, however, be important in identifying which constituents are frame elements for a given target word, as it gives us a way of navigating through the parse tree to find the frame elements in the sentence.
    4.1.4 Position.
    To overcome errors due to incorrect parses, as well as to see how much can be done without parse trees, we introduced position as a feature.
    The position feature simply indicates whether the constituent to be labeled occurs before or after the predicate defining the semantic frame.
    We expected this feature to be highly correlated with grammatical function, since subjects will generally appear before a verb and objects after.
    Although we do not have hand-checked parses against which to measure the performance of the automatic parser on our corpus, the resu
