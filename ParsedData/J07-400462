bject of buy, and there is an object dependency on the second NP encoding the object of buy.
    Entries in the same equivalence class are identical for the purposes of creating new dependencies for the remainder of the parsing.
    It is possible to extend the locality of the features beyond single rule instantiations and local dependencies.
    For example, the definition of equivalence given earlier allows the incorporation of long-range dependencies as features.
    The equivalence test considers unfilled dependencies which are both local and long-range; thus any individual entries which have different long-range dependencies waiting to be filled will be in different equivalence classes.
    One of the advantages of log-linear models is that it is easy to include such features; Hockenmaier (2003b) describes the difficulties in including such features in a generative model.
    One of the early motivations of the Edinburgh CCG parsing project was to see if the long-range dependencies recovered by a CCG par
