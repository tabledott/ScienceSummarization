  A parse produced by the grammar is judged to be correct if it agrees with the Treebank parse structurally and the NT labels agree.
  The grammar has a significantly richer NT label set (more than 10000) than the Treebank but we have defined an equivalence mapping between the grammar NT labels and the Treebank NT labels.
  In this paper, we do not include the tags in the measure of a correct parse.
  We have used about 25,000 sentences to help the gram- marian develop the grammar with the goal that the cor- rect (as defined above) parse is among the proposed (by the grammar) parses for a sentence.
