[a reimbursement]ARG1 and the alternative realization (ii) [Shaw Publishing]ARG0 [offered]PRED [a reimbursement]ARG1 [to Mr. Smith]ARG2.
    When classifying the NP in object position, it is useful to know whether the following argument is a PP.
    If it is, the NP will more likely be an ARG1, and if not, it will more likely be an ARG2.
    A feature template that captures such information extracts, for each candidate argument node, its phrase type and label.
    For example, the instantiations of such templates in (ii), including only the predicate voice or also the predicate lemma, would be: [voice:active, NP-ARG0, PRED, NP-ARG1, PP-ARG2] [voice:active,lemma:offer, NP-ARG0, PRED, NP-ARG1, PP-ARG2] We experimented with extracting several kinds of features from each argument node and found that the phrase type and the head of a directly dominating PP&#8212;if one exists&#8212;were most helpful.
    Local models normally consider only features of the phrase being classified in addition to features of the pred
