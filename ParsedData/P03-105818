e listed in the column labeled M2 in Table 3.
    We observed that M2 is always lower in value compared to M1 for all difficult nouns.
    This suggests that the effect of training and test examples coming from the same document has inflated the accuracy figures of SENSEVAL-2 nouns.
    Next, we randomly selected 10 sets of training examples from the parallel corpora, such that the number of training examples in each sense followed the official training set of w. (When there were insufficient training examples for a sense, we just used as many as we could find from the parallel corpora.)
    In each trial, after training a WSD classifier on the selected parallel text examples, we tested the classifier on the same test set (from SENSEVAL-2 provided data) used in that trial that generated the M2 score.
    The accuracy figures thus obtained for all the difficult nouns are listed in the column labeled P2 in Table 3.
    Insufficient Sense Coverage We observed that there are situations when we have insufficient t
