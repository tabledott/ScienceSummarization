620/2 on average&#8212;to ensure it is not semantically redundant.
    (Additional comparisons are needed to reject parses other than the lucky 48,620.)
    Adding a parse can therefore take exponential time.
    Structure sharing does not appear to help: parses that are grouped in a parse forest have only their syntactic category in common, not their meaning.
    Karttunen's approach must tease such parses apart and compare their various meanings individually against each new candidate.
    By contrast, the method proposed below is purely syntactic&#8212;just like any &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot; parser&#8212;so it never needs to unpack a subforest, and can run in polynomial time. standard constituents are allowed when necessary: (8c) is in normal form (cf.
    (1)).
    It is not hard to see that (7a) eliminates all but right-branching parses of &amp;quot;forward chains&amp;quot; like A/B B/C C or A/B/C C/D D/E/F/G G/H, and that (7b) eliminates all but left-branching parses of &amp;quot;backward chains.&amp
