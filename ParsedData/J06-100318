eatured in the WordNet ontology (which include cause, pertinence, also see, etc.).
  Like other researchers, however, they had to resort to the noun subnetwork only.
  In what follows, therefore, we will use appropriately restricted versions of their notions.
  18 Budanitsky and Hirst Lexical Semantic Relatedness in the WordNet noun network as consisting of two directed edges representing inverse relations.
  Each relation r has a weight or a range [minr; maxr] of weights associated with it: for example, hypernymy, hyponymy, holonymy, and meronymy have weights between minr = 1 and maxr = 2.4 The weight of each edge of type r from some node c1 is reduced by a factor that depends on the number of edges, edgesr, of the same type leaving c1: wt(c1 ?r) = maxr ?
  minr edgesr(c1) (3) The distance between two adjacent nodes c1 and c2 is then the average of the weights on each direction of the edge, scaled by the depth of the nodes: distS(c1, c2) = wt(c1 ?r) + wt(c2 ?r? )
  max{depth(c1), depth(c2)} (4) where r is th
