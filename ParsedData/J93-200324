 the word in position i of the English string, then al = i, and if it is not connected to any English word, then a] = 0.
    Without loss of generality, we can write This is only one of many ways in which Pr(f, ale) can be written as the product of a series of conditional probabilities.
    It is important to realize that Equation (4) is not an approximation.
    Regardless of the form of Pr(f, ale), it can always be analyzed into a product of terms in this way.
    We are simply asserting in this equation that when we generate a French string together with an alignment from an English string, we can first choose the length of the French string given our knowledge of the English string.
    Then we can choose where to connect the first position in the French string given our knowledge of the English string and the length of the French string.
    Then we can choose the identity of the first word in the French string given our knowledge of the English string, the length of the French string, and the position i
