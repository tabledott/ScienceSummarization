ions are as follows: The resulting decision score corresponds to the contribution of expression (26).
    Any valid and complete sequence of decisions dI+1 1 uniquely corresponds to a certain translation eI1, a segmentation into K phrases, a phrase alignment &#960;K1 , and a sequence of alignment template instantiations zK1 .
    The sum of the decision scores is equal to the corresponding score described in expressions (24)&#8211;(26).
    A straightforward representation of all hypotheses would be the prefix tree of all possible sequences of decisions.
    Obviously, there would be a large redundancy in this search space representation, because there are many search nodes that are indistinguishable in the sense that the subtrees following these search nodes are identical.
    We can recombine these identical search nodes; that is, we have to maintain only the most probable hypothesis (Bellman 1957).
    In general, the criterion for recombining a set of nodes is that the hypotheses can be distinguished by n
