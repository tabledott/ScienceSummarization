was 11 minutes.
    Out of more than 2,400 sentences, only 26 were rejected by the parser (about 1.1%).
    For these sentences, partial analyses were created by combining the items in the stack in flat structures, and these were included in the evaluation.
    Predictably, the labeled constituent precision and recall obtained with automatically POS-tagged sentences were lower, at 86.01% and 86.15%.
    The part-of-speech tagger used in our experiments was SVMTool (Gim&#233;nez and M&#225;rquez, 2004), and its accuracy on the test set is 97%.
    The MBL-based parser (denoted by MBLpar) uses the IB1 algorithm, with five nearest neighbors, and the modified value difference metric (MVDM), following the work of Nivre and Scholz (2004) on MBL-based deterministic dependency parsing.
    MBLpar was trained with all training instances in under 15 minutes, but its accuracy on the test set was much lower than that of SVMpar, with constituent precision and recall of 80.0% and 80.2%, and dependency accuracy of 86.3% (24
