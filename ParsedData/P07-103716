 composition operators.
    The n-gram language model over supertags applies a kind of statistical &#8216;compositionality check&#8217; but due to smoothing effects this could mask crucial violations of the compositionality operators of the grammar formalism (CCG in this case).
    It is interesting to observe the effect of integrating into the language model a penalty imposed when formal compostion operators are violated.
    We combine the n-gram language model with a penalty factor that measures the number of encountered combinatory operator violations in a sequence of supertags (cf.
    Figure 2).
    For a supertag sequence of length (L) which has (V ) operator violations (as measured by the CCG system), the language model P will be adjusted as P* = P x (1 &#8722; &#65533;i ).
    This is of course no longer a simple smoothed maximum-likelihood estimate nor is it a true probability.
    Nevertheless, this mechanism provides a simple, efficient integration of a global compositionality (grammaticality) mea
