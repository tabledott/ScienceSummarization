t be examined to see whether it exhibits all the alternations of a class.
    This might be approximated by automatically extracting the syntactic frames in which the verb occurs in corpus data, rather than manual analysis of each verb, as was done in this study.
    We have also examined a mapping between the English verbs that we have discussed and their Portuguese translations, which have several of the same properties as the corresponding verbs in English.
    Most of these verbs take the same alternations as in English and, by virtue of these alternations, achieve the same regular sense extensions.
    There are still many questions that require further investigation.
    First, since our experiment was based on a translation from English to Portuguese, we can expect that other verbs in Portuguese would share the same alternations, so the classes in Portuguese should by no means be considered complete.
    We will be using resources such as dictionaries and on-line corpora to investigate potential additi
