 shown in the table.
    All the numbers are normalized so that the highest ranked sentence gets the score .
    It is obvious from the figures that threshold choice affects the LexPageRank rankings of some sentences.
    The graph-based centrality approach we have introduced has several advantages over Centroid.
    First of all, it accounts for information subsumption among sentences.
    If the information content of a sentence subsumes another sentence in a cluster, it is naturally preferred to include the one that contains more information in the summary.
    The degree of a node in the cosine similarity graph is an indication of how much common information the sentence has with other sentences.
    Sentence d4s1 in Figure 1 gets the highest score since it almost subsumes the information in the first two sentences of the cluster and has some common information with others.
    Another advantage is that it prevents unnaturally high IDF scores from boosting up the score of a sentence that is unrelated to t
