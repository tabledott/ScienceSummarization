ar morphology then it is handled by the rules expressing generalisations.
    Also, a side-effect of the fact that the generator is derived from the analyser is that the two modules have exactly the same coverage and are guaranteed to stay in step with each other.
    This is important in the context of an applied system.
    The accuracy of the generator is quite sufficient for this application; our experience is that typographical mistakes in the original newspaper text are much more common than errors in morphological processing.
    Some orthographic phenomena span more than one word.
    These cannot be dealt with in morphological generation since this works strictly a word at a time.
