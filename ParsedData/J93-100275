he definitions to remove punctuation, font control information, and so forth.'
    A lexicon was created for this corpus by extracting the appropriate lemmas and matching these against entries in the ANLT lexicon.
    The 10,600 resultant entries were loaded into the ANLT morphological system (Ritchie et al. 1987) and this sublexicon and the full ANLT grammar formed the starting point for the training process.
    A total of 246 definitions, selected without regard for their syntactic form, were parsed semi-automatically using the parser described in Section 5.
    During this process, further rules and lexical entries were created for some definitions that failed to parse.
    Of the total number, 150 were successfully parsed and 63 lexical entries and 14 rules were added.
    Some of the rules required reflected general inadequacies in the ANLT grammar; for example, we added rules to deal with new partitives and prepositional phrase and verb complementation.
    However, 7 of these rules cover relatively id
