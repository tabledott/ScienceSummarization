    Figure 2: Sample sentence and parse tree we have an input sentence (ABCDEhas a parse tree shown in Figure 2. a human reduces the sentence to which can be translated to a series of decisions made along edges in the sentence parse tree as shown in Figure 3.
    The symbol &amp;quot;y&amp;quot; along an edge means the node it points to will be kept, and &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; means the node will be removed.
    Suppose the program reduces sentence to can be translated similarly to the annotated tree shown in Figure 4.
    Figure 4: Reduced form by the program We can see that along five edges (they are D&#8212;)T, D&#8212;*G, B-4A, B&#8212;&gt;C), both the human and the program made decisions.
    Two out of the five decisions agree (they are D--&#247;B and D&#8212;&gt;E), so the rate is 2/5 (40%).
    The rate defined as: man and the program have made the same decision success rate = the total # of edges along which both the human and the progam have m
