d 55.99 and 55.96 respectively.
    Another 1.5 points separates them from the fourth best score of 54.53 (nugues).
    Thus the performance differences between the better-scoring systems were not large, with only about three points separating the top four systems.
    This becomes even clearer if we merge in the results of systems that participated only in the open track but that made relatively limited use of outside resources.21 Comparing that way, the cai system scores in the same ball park as the second rank systems (sapena and chang).
    The uryupina system similarly scores very close to nugues&#8217;s 54.53 Given that our choice of the official metric was somewhat arbitrary, if is also useful to look at the individual metrics, including the mention-based CEAFm and BLANC metrics that were not part of the official metric.
    The lee system which scored the best using the official metric does slightly worse than song on the MUC metric, and also does slightly worse than chang on the B-CUBED and BLANC met
