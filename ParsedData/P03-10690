  Probabilistic Text Structuring: Experiments With Sentence Ordering
  
    Ordering information is a critical task for natural language generation applications.
    In this paper we propose an approach to information ordering that is particularly suited for text-to-text generation.
    We describe a model that learns constraints on sentence order from a corpus of domainspecific texts and an algorithm that yields the most likely order among several alternatives.
    We evaluate the automatically generated orderings against authored texts from our corpus and against human subjects that are asked to mimic the model&#8217;s task.
    We also assess the appropriateness of such a model for multidocument summarization.
  
  
    Structuring a set of facts into a coherent text is a non-trivial task which has received much attention in the area of concept-to-text generation (see Reiter and Dale 2000 for an overview).
    The structured text is typically assumed to be a tree (i.e., to have a hierarchical structure) w
