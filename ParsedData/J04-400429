erated in two steps to allow for the parameters to be independently smoothed, which, in turn, is done to avoid sparse-data problems.
    These two steps estimate the joint event of all three components using the chain rule.
    In the A tree containing both punctuation and conjunction. first step, a partially lexicalized version of the nonterminal is generated, consisting of the unlexicalized label plus the part of speech of its headword.
    These partially lexicalized modifying nonterminals are generated conditioning on the parent label, the head label, the headword, the head tag, the current state of the dynamic subcat, and a distance metric.
    Symbolically, the parameter classes are where &#8710; denotes the distance metric.17 As discussed above, one of the two components of this distance metric is the vi predicate.
    The other is a predicate that simply reports whether the current modifier is the first modifier being generated, that is, whether i = 1.
    The second step is to generate the headword i
