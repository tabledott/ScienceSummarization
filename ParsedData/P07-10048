can be very expensive if L is very large (as on the Chinese&#8211;English data set).
    This additional phrase table is small and specific to the development or test set it is trained on.
    It overlaps with the original phrase tables, but also contains many new phrase pairs (Ueffing, 2006).
    Mixture Model: Another alternative for Estimate is to create a mixture model of the phrase table probabilities with new phrase table probabilities where Lp and Tp are phrase table probabilities estimated on L and T, respectively.
    In cases where new phrase pairs are learned from T, they get added into the merged phrase table.
    In Algorithm 1, the Score function assigns a score to each translation hypothesis t. We used the following scoring functions in our experiments: which we implemented follows the approaches suggested in (Blatz et al., 2003; Ueffing and Ney, 2007): The confidence score of a target sentence t is calculated as a log-linear combination of phrase posterior probabilities, Levenshtein-based word
