the former is much more likely to be the head (and so is a verb vs. a preposition or an adverb).
    Shift-reduce resolution, however, is more non-local, and often involves a triple, for example, (saw, Bill, with) for a typical PP-attachment.
    On the other hand, if we indeed make a wrong decision, a reduce-reduce mistake just flips the head and the modifier, and often has a more local effect on the shape of the tree, whereas a shift-reduce mistake always leads stack; wi and wi+1 denote the current and next words on the queue.
    T(&#183;) denotes the POS tag of a given word, and lc(&#183;) and rc(&#183;) represent the leftmost and rightmost child.
    Symbol o denotes feature conjunction.
    Each of these templates is further conjoined with the 3 actions shift, reduceL, and reduceR. to vastly incompatible tree shapes with crossing brackets (for example, [saw Bill] vs. [Bill with a telescope]).
    We will see in Section 5.3 that this is indeed the case in practice, thus suggesting us to focus on shift-re
