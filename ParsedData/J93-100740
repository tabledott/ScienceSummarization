 occupying the position with a probability greater than a given threshold T.12 If part of speech information is available, the same analysis is also performed with parts of speech instead of actual words.
    In short, a word w or a part of speech pos is kept in the final n-gram at position i if and only if it satisfies the following inequation: p(e) denotes the probability of event e. Consider the examples given in Figures 6 and 7 that show the concordances (output of step 2.1) for the input pairs: &amp;quot;averageindustrial&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;index-composite.&amp;quot; In Figure 6, the same words are always used from position &#8212;4 to position 0.
    However, at position +1, the words used are always different.
    &amp;quot;Dow&amp;quot; is used at position &#8212;3 in more than 90% of the cases.
    It is thus part of the produced rigid noun phrases.
    But &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; is only used a couple of times (out of several hundred) at position +1, 11 The distance is actually optional and ca
