rally rec ognized.As Table 1 makes clear, the EM estimator pro duces models that are extremely competitive in many-to-1 accuracy and Variation of Information, but are significantly worse in 1-to-1 accuracy.
			Wecan understand these results by comparing the dis tribution of words to hidden states to the distribution of words to POS tags in the gold-standard evaluation corpus.
			As Figure 3 shows, the distribution of words to POS tags is highly skewed, with just 6 POS tags, NN, IN, NNP, DT, JJ and NNS, accounting for over 55% of the tokens in the corpus.
			By contrast, the EM distribution is much flatter.
			This also explains why the many-to-1 accuracy is so much better than the one-to-one accuracy; presumably several hidden 299 Estimator 1-to-1 Many-to-1 VI H(T |Y ) H(Y |T ) EM (50) 0.40 (0.02) 0.62 (0.01) 4.46 (0.08) 1.75 (0.04) 2.71 (0.06) VB(0.1, 0.1) (50) 0.47 (0.02) 0.50 (0.02) 4.28 (0.09) 2.39 (0.07) 1.89 (0.06) VB(0.1, 10?4) (50) 0.46 (0.03) 0.50 (0.02) 4.28 (0.11) 2.39 (0.08) 1.90 (0.07) VB(10?4, 0
