 the sparseness of data, by reducing the effects of phenomena which mask redundancy.

    Each name is replaced with its category label, a single token.
    The name classifier also factors out other out-ofvocabulary (OOV) classes of items: dates, times, numeric and monetary expressions.

    Parsing: After name classification, we apply a general English parser, from Conexor Oy, (Tapanainen and J&#168;arvinen, 1997).
    The parser recognizes the name tags generated in the preceding step, and treats them as atomic.
    The parser&#8217;s output is a set
