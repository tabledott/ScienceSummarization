re&#8221;, which may turn a negative statement into a positive one.4 A second type of annotation that can be added to syntactic categories is the so-called parent annotation (Johnson, 1998), which was effectively used in syntactic parsing to break unreasonable context-free assumptions.
    For instance, a PP with a VP parent is marked as PP&#710;VP.
    It is reasonable to assume that, e.g., that constituents deep inside a PP have more chances to be removed than otherwise expected, and one may seek to increase the amount of vertical context that is available for conditioning each constituent deletion.
    To achieve the above desiderata for better SCFG probability estimates&#8212;i.e., reduce the amount of sister annotation within each SCFG production, by conditioning deletions on a context smaller than an entire right-hand side, and at the same time increase the amount of ancestor and descendent annotation through parent (or ancestor) annotation and lexicalization&#8212;we follow the approach of (Collins, 19
