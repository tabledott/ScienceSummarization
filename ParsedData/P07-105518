ard bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm.
    Details are omitted Three baseline systems were created, for space reasons.
    Other models are possible where dependencies occur across non-neighbouring levels, e.g., by inserting edges between the sentence level nodes and the document level node.
    In the general case, inference is exponential in the size of each clique.
    Both the models in Figure 1 and Figure 4 have maximum clique sizes of three.
  
  
    To test the model we compiled a corpus of 600 online product reviews from three domains: car seats for children, fitness equipment, and Mp3 players.
    Of the original 600 reviews that were gathered, we discarded duplicate reviews, reviews with insufficient text, and spam.
    All reviews were labeled by online customers as having a positive or negative polarity on the document level, i.e., Y(d) _ {pos, neg}.
    Each review was then split into sentences and every sentence annotated by a single annotator as either being positive, negative or neutral
