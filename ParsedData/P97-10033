 LH Si RHS, 1 i n, The re-write rules are either internal to the tree, where LHS is a non-terminal and RHS is a string of one or more non-terminals; or lexical, where LHS is a part of speech tag and RHS is a word.
    A PCFG can be lexicalised2 by associating a word w and a part-of-speech (POS) tag t with each nonterminal X in the tree.
    Thus we write a nonterminal as X(x), where x = (w,t), and X is a constituent label.
    Each rule now has the form3: H is the head-child of the phrase, which inherits the head-word h from its parent P. L1...L7, and are left and right modifiers of H. Either n or m may be zero, and n = m = 0 for unary rules.
    Figure 1 shows a tree which will be used as an example throughout this paper.
    The addition of lexical heads leads to an enormous number of potential rules, making direct estimation of P(RHS I LHS) infeasible because of sparse data problems.
    We decompose the generation of the RHS of a rule such as (3), given the LHS, into three steps &#8212; first generating t
