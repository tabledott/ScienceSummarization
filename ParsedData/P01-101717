head&#8221; for the distribution p(h I t,l, m, u, i, j).
    Thus we adopted the following revised definition of head for constituents of base noun-phrases: For a pre-terminal (e.g., noun) constituent c of a base noun-phrase in which it is not the standard head (h) and which has as its right-sister another preterminal constituent d which is not itself h, the head of c is the head of d. The sole exceptions to this rule are phraseinitial determiners and numbers which retain h as their heads.
    In effect this definition assumes that the substructure of all base noun-phrases is left branching, as in Figure 2.
    This is not true, but Lauer [11] shows that about two-thirds of all branching in base-noun-phrases is leftward.
    We believe we would get even better results if the parser could determine the true branching structure.
    We then adopt the following definition of a grandparent-head feature j.
    1. if c is a noun phrase under a prepositional phrase, or is a pre-terminal which takes a revised head as
