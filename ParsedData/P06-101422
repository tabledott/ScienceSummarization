t of these methods do not evaluate the clustering produced with respect to a gold-standard clustering.
    Indeed, such an evaluation would be difficult and timeconsuming without a coarse sense inventory like that of ODE.
    A limited assessment of coarse WSD is performed by Fellbaum et al. (2001), who obtain a large improvement in the accuracy of a maximum-entropy system on clustered verbs.
  
  
    Dolan (1994) describes a method for clustering word senses with the use of information provided in the electronic version of LDOCE (textual definitions, semantic relations, domain labels, etc.).
    Unfortunately, the approach is not described in detail and no evaluation is provided.
    Most of the approaches in the literature make use of the WordNet structure to cluster its senses.
    Peters et al. (1998) exploit specific patterns in the WordNet hierarchy (e.g. sisters, autohyponymy, twins, etc.) to group word senses.
    They study semantic regularities or generalizations obtained and analyze the effect of
