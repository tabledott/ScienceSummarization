cribed in Church and Hindle (1990), Church and Hanks (1990), and Hindle and Rooth (1991), Figure 4 shows some examples of the most frequent V-0 pairs from the AP corpus.
    Corpus studies confirm similar results for &amp;quot;weakly intensional contexts&amp;quot; such as the complement of coercive verbs such as veto.
    These are interesting because regardless of the noun type appearing as complement, it is embedded within a semantic interpretation of &amp;quot;the proposal to,&amp;quot; thereby clothing the complement within an intensional context.
    The examples in Figure 5 with the verb veto indicate two things: first, that such coercions are regular and pervasive in corpora; second, that almost anything can be vetoed, but that the most frequently occurring objects are closest to the type selected by the verb.
    What these data show is that the highest count complement types match the type required by the verb; namely, that one vetoes a bill or proposal to do something, not the thing itself.
