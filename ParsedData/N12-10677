t path and let p be the number of matched edits.
    Assume that there exists another edit sequence e0 with higher total edge weights but p0 &gt; p matching edits.
    Then we have where q and q0 denote the combined cost of all nonmatching edits in the two paths, respectively.
    Because p0 &#8722; p &#8805; 1, the right hand side is at most &#8722;(u + 1)|E|.
    Because q and q0 are positive and bounded by (u + 1)|E|, the left hand side cannot be smaller than or equal to &#8722;(u + 1)|E|.
    This is a contradiction.
    Therefore there cannot exist such an edit sequence e0, and e is the sequence with the maximum overlap with the gold-standard annotation.
    What is left to do is to evaluate the set of edits with respect to the gold standard.
    This is done by computing precision, recall, and F1 measure (van Rijsbergen, 1979) between the set of system edits {e1, ... , en} and the set of gold edits {g1, ... , gn} for all sentences where we define the intersection between ei and gi as ei &#8745; gi = {e
