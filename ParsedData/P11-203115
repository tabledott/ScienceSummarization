ions are performed, as ought to be reasonable in a research setting.
    In this simulation, we randomly selected n optimizer outputs from our large pool and ran the AR test to determine the significance; we repeated this procedure 250 times.
    The p-values reported are the pvalues at the edges of the 95% confidence interval (CI) according to AR seen in the 250 simulated comparison scenarios.
    These indicate that we are very likely to observe a significant difference for BTEC at n = 5, and a very significant difference by n = 50 (Table 2).
    Similarly, we see this trend in the WMT system: more replications leads to more significant results, which will be easier to reproduce.
    Based on the average performance of the systems reported in Table 1, we expect significance over a large enough number of independent trials.
  
  
    No experiment can completely control for all possible confounding variables.
    Nor are metric scores (even if they are statistically reliable) a substitute for thorough human
