V), we will now split up the candidate sets into high-frequency and low-frequency occurrences.
    This procedure allows us to assess the performance of AMs within different frequency strata.
    For instance, there is a widely held belief that and are inferior to other measures because they overestimate the collocativity of low-frequency candidates (cf. the remarks on the measure in (Dunning, 1993)).
    One might thus expect and to yield much better results for higher frequencies.
    We have divided the AdjN data into two samples with (high frequencies) and (low frequencies), because the number of data in the base sample is quite small.
    As there are enough PNV data, we used a higher threshold and selected samples with (high frequencies) and (low frequencies).
    Considering our high-frequency AdjN data (Figure 5), we find that all precision curves decline as more of the data in the SLs is examined.
    Especially for , this is markedly different from the results obtained before.
    As the full curves
