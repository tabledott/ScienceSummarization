    To assess similarity between vectors we utilized standard cosine similarity (cos(a, b) = a&#183;b ||a||&#215;||b||).
    We experimentally determined that the use of proper nouns alone led to more pure clustering.
    As a result, for the remainder of the experiments, we used only proper nouns in the vectors, except for those common words introduced by the various feature sets.
    Selective term weighting has been shown to be highly effective for information retrieval.
    For this study, we investigated both the use of standard TFIDF weighting and weighting based on the mutual information, where gi
