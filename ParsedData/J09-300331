l or polar in context.
    The second step, Polarity Classification, takes all instances that step one classified as polar, and tries to disambiguate their contextual polarity.
    This two-step approach is illustrated in Figure 1.
  
  
    The features used in our experiments were motivated both by the literature and by exploration of the contextual-polarity annotations in our development data.
    A number Two-step approach to recognizing contextual polarity. of features were inspired by the paper on contextual-polarity influencers by Polanyi and Zaenan (2004).
    Other features are those that have been found useful in the past for recognizing subjective sentences (Wiebe, Bruce, and O&#8217;Hara 1999; Wiebe and Riloff 2005).
    For distinguishing between neutral and polar instances, we use the features listed in Table 7.
    For ease of description, we group the features into six sets: word features, general modification features, polarity modification features, structure features, sentence features, and
