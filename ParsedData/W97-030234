    The grammar rules, and their associated probabilities, were determined by reading them off of the training section of the treebank, in a manner very similar to that used by Charniak (1996).
    The main grammar we chose was essentially of the following form: That is, our grammar was binary branching except that we also allowed unary branching productions.
    There were never more than five subscripted symbols for any nonterminal, although there could be fewer than five if there were fewer than five symbols remaining on the right hand side.
    Thus, our grammar was a kind of 6-gram model on symbols in the grammar.4 Figure 8 shows an example of how we converted trees to binary branching with our grammar.
    We refer to this grammar as the 6-gram grammar.
    The terminals of the grammar were the part-of-speech symbols in the treebank.
    Any experiments that don't mention which grammar we used were run with the 6-gram grammar.
    For a simple grammar, we wanted something that would be very fast.
