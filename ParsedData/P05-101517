timization function (Section 3.3) to But before proceeding, we note that it is possible that similarity information might yield no extra benefit at all.
    For instance, we don&#8217;t need it if we can reliably identify each class just from some set of distinguishing terms.
    If we define such terms as frequent ones ( ) that appear in a single class 50% or more of the time, then we do find many instances; some examples for one author are: &#8220;meaningless&#8221;, &#8220;disgusting&#8221; (class 0); &#8220;pleasant&#8221;, &#8220;uneven&#8221; (class 1); and &#8220;oscar&#8221;, &#8220;gem&#8221; (class 2) for the three-class case, and, in the four-class case, &#8220;flat&#8221;, &#8220;tedious&#8221; (class 1) versus &#8220;straightforward&#8221;, &#8220;likeable&#8221; (class 2).
    Some unexpected distinguishing terms for this author are &#8220;lion&#8221; for class 2 (threeclass case), and for class 2 in the four-class case, &#8220;jennifer&#8221;, for a wide variety of Jennifers.
