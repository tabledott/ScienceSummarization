    Thus we automatically find (a) the question type from the taxonomy of questions built into the system, (b) the expected answer type from the semantic analysis of the question, and most importantly, (c) the question focus defined as the main information required by that question.
    Furthermore, the Question Processing module also identifies the keywords from the question, which are passed to the Paragraph Indexing module, as illustrated by Figure 1. what questions, as what is ambiguous and it says nothing about the information asked by the question.
