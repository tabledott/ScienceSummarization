cores ob- tained in prior MUCs.
  The highest performance overall was 47% recall and 70% precision.
  One can observe an increasing convergence of methods tbr information extraction.
  Most of the systems participating in MUC-6 employed a cascade of finite-state pattern recognizers, with the earlier pattern sets recognizing entities, and the later sets recognizing scenario-specific pat- terns.
  This convergence may be one reason for tile bunching of scores for this task -- most sys- tems fell in a rather narrow range in both recall and precision.
  The results of this MUC provide valuable pos- itive testimony on behalf of information extra(&gt; tion, but further improvement in both portability and performance is needed tbr many applications.
  With respect o port~bility, custoiners would like to have systems which can be ported in a tew hours, or at most a few days, by someone with less expertise than a system developer.
  How this might be tested in the context of a MUC is not en- tirely clear.
