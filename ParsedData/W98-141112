trees (including the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; relation at each point) and focussing the subtree swapping on subtrees that contributed to bad scores, but the above algorithm was the one that seemed most successful.
    Figure 2 shows an example text generated by subtree swapping.
    Note that we have taken liberties in editing by hand the surface text (for instance, by introducing better referring expressions and aggregation).
    For clarity, coreference has been indicated by subscripts.
    The ordering of the material and the use of rhetorical relations 'are the only things which are determined by the algorithm.
    Results for subtree swapping are shown together with later results in Figure 5 (the example text shown for subtree swapping is for the item named j-342540).
    The most obvious feature of these results is the huge variability of the results, which suggests that there are many local maxima in the search space.
    Looking at the texts produced, we can see a number of problems.
    If there is o
