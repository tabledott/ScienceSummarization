just TIMEX with MUC-7 (MUC-7 1998) results on similar news stories, where the best performance was .99 Precision and .88 Recall.
    (The MUC task required recognizing a wider variety of TIMEXs, including event-dependent ones.
    However, at least 30% of the dates and times in the MUC test were fixed-format ones occurring in document headers, trailers, and copyright notices. )
    Finally, there is a large body of work, e.g., (Moens and Steedman 1988), (Passoneau 1988), (Webber 1988), (Hwang 1992), (Song and Cohen 1991), that has focused on a computational analysis of tense and aspect.
    While the work on event chronologies is based on some of the notions developed in that body of work, we hope to further exploit insights from previous work.
  
  
    We have developed a temporal annotation specification, and an algorithm for resolving a class of time expressions found in news.
    The algorithm, which is relatively knowledge-poor, uses a mix of hand-crafted and machine-learnt rules and obtains reasonable
