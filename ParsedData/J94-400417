e-like representation shown in Figure 5, in which (1) X is the syntactic head (of category V, N, A, P, I, or C); (2) W-MAX is the external argument; (3) Z-MAX1, ... ,  Z-MAXn are the internal arguments; and (4) Q-MAX1 .
  Q-MAXm are the syntactic adjuncts.
  Example  4 The syntactic phrase corresponding to John went happily to school is [C-MAX [I-MAX [N-MAX John] [V-MAX [v went] [ADV happily] [P-MAX to [N-MAX school]]]]] This corresponds to the tree-like representation shown in Figure 6, in which (1) the syntactic head is [v went]; (2) the external argument is [N-MAX John]; (3) the internal argument is [P-MAX a ...]; and (4) the syntactic adjunct is [ADV happily].
  Note that the internal argument constituent is itself a syntactic phrase that contains an internal argument, [N-MAX school], i.e., syntactic phrases are recursively defined.
  In addition to the representations involved in the translation mapping,  it is also possible to formalize the mapping itself.
  The current approach is to map between 6 Thes
