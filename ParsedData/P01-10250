  Methods For The Qualitative Evaluation Of Lexical Association Measures
  
    This paper presents methods for a qualitative, unbiased comparison of lexical association measures and the results we have obtained for adjective-noun pairs and preposition-noun-verb triples extracted from German corpora.
    In our approach, we compare the entire list of candidates, sorted according to the particular measures, to a reference set of manually identified &#8220;true positives&#8221;.
    We also show how estimates for the very large number of hapaxlegomena and double occurrences can be inferred from random samples.
  
  
    In computational linguistics, a variety of (statistical) measures have been proposed for identifying lexical associations between words in lexical tuples extracted from text corpora.
    Methods used range from pure frequency counts to information theoretic measures and statistical significance tests.
    While the mathematical properties of those measures have been extensively discussed,' the
