l syntactic evidence disagrees with evidence based on local linear context, the two models compete with one another, despite the fact that the PCFG takes also local context into account.
    In addition, as the CRF and PCFG look at similar sorts of information from within two inherently different models, they are far from independent and optimizing their product is meaningless.
    Cohen and Smith approach this by introducing the &#945; hyperparameter, which performs best when optimized independently for each sentence (cf.
    Oracle results).
    In contrast, our morphological probabilities are based on a unigram, lexeme-based model, and all other (local and non-local) contextual considerations are delegated to the PCFG.
    This fully generative model caters for real interaction between the syntactic and morphological levels as a part of a single coherent process.
  
  
    Employing a PCFG-based generative framework to make both syntactic and morphological disambiguation decisions is not only theoretically
