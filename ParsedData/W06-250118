words, while 1,806 are verbs and 768 are adjectives.
    We use the noun data to compare all six of the measures, since four of the measures are limited to nouns as input.
    The accuracy of disambiguation when performed using each of the measures for nouns is shown in Table 2.
  
  
    As discussed in earlier sections, the Gloss Vector measure builds a word space consisting of first order context vectors corresponding to every word in a corpus.
    Gloss vectors are the resultant of a number of first order context vectors.
    All of these vectors encode semantic information about the concepts or the glosses that the vectors represent.
    We note that the quality of the words used as the dimensions of these vectors plays a pivotal role in getting accurate relatedness scores.
    We find that words corresponding to very specific concepts and are highly indicative of a few topics, make good dimensions.
    Words that are very general in nature and that appear all over the place add noise to the vectors.
