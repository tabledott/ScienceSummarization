mediate children.
    The collected ETs are put into square boxes and the partitioning operations taken are marked with dotted arrows.
    Similar to (Ding and Palmer, 2004a), we also use a heuristic function in Step 1(a) of the algorithm to rank all the word pairs for the tentative tree partitioning operation.
    The heuristic function is based on a set of heuristics, most of which are similar to those in (Ding and Palmer, 2004a).
    For a word pair (ei, fj)for the tentative partitioning operation, we briefly describe the heuristics: the foreign words in the current tree.
    The above heuristics are a set of real valued numbers.
    We use a Maximum Entropy model to interpolate the heuristics in a log-linear fashion, which is different from the error minimization training in (Ding and Palmer, 2004a). where y = (0,1) as labeled in the training data whether the two words are mapped with each other.
    The MaxEnt model is trained using the same word level aligned parallel corpus as the one in Section 3.1.
