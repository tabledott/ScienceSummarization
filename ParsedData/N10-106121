trongly biased the type fertility parameters to generate empty NAM-HEAD lists.
    Because only certain semantic types were annotated under the arbitrary ACE guidelines, there are many mentions which do not fall into those limited categories.
    We therefore prototype (refinements of) the ACE types and then add an equal number of unconstrained &#8220;other&#8221; types which are automatically induced.
    A nice consequence of this approach is that we can simply run our model on all mentions, discarding at evaluation time any which are of nonprototyped types.
    We evaluated on multiple coreference resolution metrics, as no single one is clearly superior, partic8Meaning those headwords were assigned to the target type for more than 75% of their usages.
    NAM NOM PRO ularly in dealing with the system mention setting.
    We utilized MUC (Vilain et al., 1995), B3All (Stoyanov et al., 2009), B3None (Stoyanov et al., 2009), and Pairwise F1.
    The B3All and B3None are B3 variants (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) th
