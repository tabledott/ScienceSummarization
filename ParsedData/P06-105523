ols for several tags are shown in Table 1, along with their most frequent members.
    In most cases, the categories are recognizable as either classic subcategories or an interpretable division of some other kind.
    Nominal categories are the most heavily split (see Table 2), and have the splits which are most semantic in nature (though not without syntactic correlations).
    For example, plural common nouns (NNS) divide into the maximum number of categories (16).
    One category consists primarily of dates, whose typical parent is an NP subsymbol whose typical parent is a root S, essentially modeling the temporal noun annotation discussed in Klein and Manning (2003).
    Another category specializes in capitalized words, preferring as a parent an NP with an S parent (i.e. subject position).
    A third category specializes in monetary units, and so on.
    These kinds of syntactico-semantic categories are typical, and, given distributional clustering results like those of Schuetze (1998), unsurprising.
