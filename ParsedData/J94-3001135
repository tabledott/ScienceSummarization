ransitions, labels, and label pairs&#8212;the building blocks of finite automata and transducers.
    But many of our initial mistakes and failures arose from attempting also to think in terms of these objects.
    The automata required to implement even the simplest examples are large and involve considerable subtlety for their construction.
    To view them from the perspective of states and transitions is much like predicting weather patterns by studying the movements of atoms and molecules or inverting a matrix with a Turing machine.
    The only hope of success in this domain lies in developing an appropriate set of high-level algebraic operators for reasoning about languages and relations and for justifying a corresponding set of operators and automata for computation.
    From a practical point of view, the result of the work reported here has been a set of powerful and sometimes quite complex tools for compiling phonological grammars in a variety of formalisms into a single representation, namely a fi
