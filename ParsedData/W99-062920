of subjects, subjects in embedded clauses, or subjects and objects related to the verb only through a trace, which makes their task easier.
    For a detailed comparison of the two methods on the same task see (Daelemans et al., 1999a).
    That paper also shows that the chunking method proposed here performs about as well as other methods, and that the influence of tagging errors on (NP) chunking is less than 1%.
    To study the effect of the errors in the lower modules other than the tagger, we used &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; test data in a last experiment, i.e. data annotated with partial information taken directly from the treebank.
    The results are shown in Table 5.
    We see that later modules suffer from errors of earlier modules (as could be expected): Fp_1 of PP chunking is 92% but could have previous modules in the cascade) vs. on &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; input (enriched with partial treebank annotation).
    For PPs, this means perfect POS tags and chunk labels/boundaries, for ADVFUNC addi
