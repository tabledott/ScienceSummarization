    Table 7 indicates that the 38,090 alignments in the range from &#8220;1-90000&#8221; are sufficiently reliable.
    Tables 6 and 7 show that we can extract valid alignments by sorting alignments according to SntScore and by selecting only higher ranked sentence alignments.
    Overall, evaluations between the first and second check were consistent.
    10The notion of &#8220;appropriate (correct) sentence alignment&#8221; depends on applications.
    Machine translation, for example, may require more precise (literal) alignment.
    To get literal alignments beyond a sharing of a common event, we will select a set of alignments from the top of the sorted alignments that satisfies the required literalness.
    This is because, in general, higher ranked alignments are more literal translations, because those alignments tend to have many one-to-one corresponding words and to be contained in highly similar article alignments.
  
  
    We compared SntScore with SIM and found that SntScore is more reliable th
