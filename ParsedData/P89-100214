nontermination, unless syntactic factors eliminate the recursion, as they would in the rule above regardless of which element is chosen as semantic head.
    In a rule for relative clause introduction such as the following (in highly abbreviated form) we can (and must) choose the nominal as semantic head to effect termination.
    However, there are other problematic cases, such as verb-movement analyses of verb-second languages, whose detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this paper. is chosen, each of its children must be generated recursively.
    The bottom-up steps to connect the pivot to the root of the analysis tree can be restricted to chain rules only, as the pivot (along with all intermediate nodes) has the same semantics as the root and must therefore be the semantic head.
    Again, after a chain rule is chosen to move up one node in the tree being constructed, the remaining (nonsemantic-head) children must be generated recursively.
    The top-down base case occurs when the nonchain rule has
