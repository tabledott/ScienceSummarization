			Such llde encapsu- lates S modifiers (e.g. s~tential adverbs as in "apparently John left"), VP modifiers (e.g. verb phr~e adverbs as in "John left abruptly}", NP modifiers (e.g. relative clauses as in "The man who left was happy"), N modifiers (e.g. adtieetive~ asin "prelty woman"), or even sententiM complements (e.g. John think8 that Harry is sick).
