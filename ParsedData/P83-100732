s the president's key aan in negotiations vith Congress. in which 'he' may be interpreted as either value-free (IT) or value-loaded (VL), may be followed by either of the following two sentences: (Sc) As ambassador to China, he handled zany tricky negotiations.
    (VL) (Sc') He is required to be at least 36 years old.
    (VF) However, if we change (5b) to force the value-loaded interpretation, as in (5b&amp;quot;), then only (5c) is possible.
    (Sb') Right now he is the president's key man in negotiations with Congress.
    Similarly, if (5b) is changed to force the value-free interpretation, as in (4b), then only (5c') is possible.
    If an intermediate sentence allows both interpretations but prefers one in a given context, then either is possible in the third sentence.
    A use with preference for a valueloaded interpretation followed by a use indicating the value-free interpretation is illustrated in the sequence: John thinks that the telephone is a toy.
    He plays with it every day.
