 all previously given performance values) the function-tagger's performance on the correctlylabelled constituents output by our parser.
    For comparison, we also give its performance when run directly on the original treebank parse; since the parser's accuracy is about 89%, working directly with the treebank means our statistics are over roughly 12% more constituents.
    This second version does slightly better.
    The main reason that tagging does worse on the parsed version is that although the constituent itself may be correctly bracketed and labelled, its exterior conditioning information can still be incorrect.
    An example of this that actually occurred in the development corpus (section 24 of the treebank) is the 'that' clause in the phrase 'can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six-figure salaries', correctly diagrammed in figure 5.
    The function tagger gave this SBAR an ADV tag, indicating an unspecified adverbial function.
    This seems extremely odd, given that
