M Algorithm.
			Experimental results show that it outperforms the baseline methods based on existing techniques, mainly due to the employment of EM.
			Experimental results also show that the use of web data is more effective than non-use of it.
			Future work includes further applying the proposed method to the translation of other types of Base NPs and between other language pairs.
