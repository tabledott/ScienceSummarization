amp;quot; in the template, or there is a &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; on the template which does not trigger gemination.
    A &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; can fail to trigger gemination only when the root contains enough consonants to fill all the requirements that the template makes for them.
    One quadriliteral case remains to be accounted for, namely the following: ktaabab dharjaj According to the strategy just elaborated, we should have expected the quadriliteral form to been &amp;quot;dhaaraj&amp;quot;.
    But, this form contains a slot that is used for vowel lengthening with triliteral roots, and as consonantal position for quadriliterals.
    We must therefore presumably take it that the prosodic template for this form is something like &amp;quot;CCVXCVC&amp;quot; where &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; is a segment, but not specified as either vocalic or consonantal.
    This much is in line with the proposal that McCarthy himself makes The question is, when should be filled by a vowel, and when by a consonant?
