makes it possible for our approach to deal with texts of different domains and unexpected topics.
    Sparck Jones (1999) argues that it is crucial for a summarization strategy to relate the large-scale document structure of texts to readers&#8217; tasks in the real world (i.e., to the proposed use of the summaries).
    We feel that incorporating a robust analysis of discourse structure into a document summarizer is one step along this way.
    Our practical contributions are twofold.
    First, we present a scheme for the annotation of sentences with rhetorical status, and we have shown that the annotation is stable (K = .82, .81, .76) and reproducible (K = .71).
    Since these results indicate that the annotation is reliable, we use it as our gold standard for evaluation and training.
    Second, we present a machine learning system for the classification of sentences by relevance and by rhetorical status.
    The contribution here is not the statistical classifier, which is well-known and has been used i
