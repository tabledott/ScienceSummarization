ty 'glutathione' is included in two other entities: 'glutathione S' and 'glutathione S - transferase'.
    In order to instantiate potentials over variable number of label nodes, we introduce a logical OR clique template that matches a variable number of entities.
    When this template matches a subset of entities el, e2, ... , en, it will create an auxiliary OR entity e,, with a single feature e&#8222; .1 abel .
    The potential function is set so that it assigns a non-zero potential only when e, .1 abel = el .1 abel V e2.1abel V ...V en .1 abel .
    The cliques are only created as needed, e.g. when the auxiliary OR variable is required by repeat and acronym clique templates.
    Figure 3 shows the factor graph for a samverges, it gives a good approximation to the correct marginals.
    The algorithm works by altering the belief at each label node by repeatedly passing messages between the node and all potential nodes connected to it (Kschischang et al., 2001).
    As many of the label nodes are indirectl
