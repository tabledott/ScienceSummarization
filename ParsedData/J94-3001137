e relation for a complete grammar, we come naturally to a consideration of how that relation should comport with the other parts of a larger language-processing system.
    We can show, for example, that the result of combining together a list of items that have exceptional phonological behavior with a grammar-derived relation for general patterns is still a regular relation with an associated transducer.
    If E is a relation for a finite list of exceptional input-output pairs and P is the general phonological relation, then the combination is given by E u [Id(Dom(E)) p] This relation is regular because E is regular (as is any finite list of pairs); it suppresses the general mapping provided by P for the exceptional items, allowing outputs for them to come from E only.
    As another example, the finite list of formatives in a lexicon L can be combined with a regular phonology (perhaps with exceptions already folded in) by means of the composition Id(L) o P. This relation enshrines not only the phonological
