 largely dependent on semantic indications unavailable to the transformational learner.
  
  
    We are planning to explore several different paths that might increase the system's power to distinguish the linguistic contexts in which particular changes would be useful.
    One such direction is to expand the template set by adding templates that are sensitive to the chunk structure.
    For example, instead of referring to the word two to the left, a rule pattern could refer to the first word in the current chunk, or the last word of the previous chunk.
    Another direction would be to enrich the vocabulary of chunk tags, so that they could be used during the learning process to encode contextual features for use by later rules in the sequence.
    We would also like to explore applying these same kinds of techniques to building larger scale structures, in which larger units are assembled or predicate/argument structures derived by combining chunks.
    One interesting direction here would be to explore th
