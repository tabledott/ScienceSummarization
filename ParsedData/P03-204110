st be connected and acyclic, and there must be exactly one node r E V (the root) that has no incoming edges.
    The function ` : (V i U E) &#8594; L labels each internal node or edge; q E Q is the root state, and s : V f &#8594; Q assigns a frontier state to each frontier node (perhaps including r).
    4The joint probability model can be formulated, if desired, as a language model times a channel model.
    A TSG is a set of elementary trees.
    The generation process builds up a derived tree T that has the same form as an elementary tree, and for which V f = 0.
    Initially, T is chosen to be any elementary tree whose root state T.q = Start.
    As long as T has any frontier nodes, T.V f, the process expands each frontier node d E T.V f by substituting at d an elementary tree t whose root state, t.q, equals d&#8217;s frontier state, T.s(d).
    This operation replaces T with (T.V U t.V &#8722; {d}, T.V i U t.V i, T.E' U t.E, T. B U t.&#65533;, T.q, T.s U t.s &#8722; {d, t.q}).
    Note that a function is
