 as reported in Tillmann (2001).
    The WER and mWER on the TEST-331 test set increase significantly, if no distortion probability is used, for the case &#945;D = 0.0.
    The benefit of a distortion probability scaling factor of &#945;D = 0.4 comes from the fact that otherwise, a low distortion probability might suppress long-distant word reordering that is important for German-to-English verb group reordering.
    The setting &#945;LM = 0.8 and &#945;D = 0.4 is used for all subsequent translation results (including the translation direction English to German). mWER, and SSER on the TEST-147 test set as a function of three reordering constraints: MON, GE, and S3 (as discussed in the Appendix).
    The computing time is given in terms of central processing unit (CPU) time per sentence (on a 450 MHz Pentium III personal computer).
    For the SSER, it turns out that restricting the word reordering such that it may not cross punctuation marks improves translation performance significantly.
    The average leng
