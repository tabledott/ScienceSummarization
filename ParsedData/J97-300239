ich contains approximately 6,500 English words and 5,500 Chinese words with about 86% translation accuracy (Wu and Xia 1994), so a better lexicon should yield substantial performance improvement.
    Moreover, if the resources for a good monolingual part-of-speech or grammar-based bracketer such as that of Magerman and Marcus (1990) are available, its output can readily be incorporated in complementary fashion as discussed in Section 9.

    Phrasal translation examples at the subsentential level are an essential resource for many MT and MAT architectures.
    This requirement is becoming increasingly direct for the example-based machine translation paradigm (Nagao 1984), whose translation flexibility is strongly restricted if the examples are only at the sentential level.
    It can now be assumed that a parallel bilingual corpus may be aligned to the sentence level with reasonable accuracy (Kay and Rocheisen 1988; Catizone, Russ
