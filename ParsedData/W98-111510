 as a 'new' single non-terminal in the left-factored grammar (the quote marks indicate that this subsequence is to be considered a single symbol).
    For example, the production VP -4 V NP NP PP :0.7 left-factors to the following productions: VP --4 NP NP' PP :0.7 NP NP' NP' PP : 1.0 NP' -4 V NP :1.0 It is not difficult to show that the left-factored grammar defines the same probability distribution over strings as the original grammar, and to devise a tree transformation that maps each parse tree of the original grammar into a unique parse tree of the left-factored grammar of the same probability.
    In fact, the assumption that all productions are at most binary is not extraordinary, since tabular parsers that construct complete parse forests in worst-case 0(n3) time explicitly or implicitly convert their grammars into binary branching form (Lang, 1974; Lang, 1991).
    Sikkel and Nijholt (1997) describe in detail the close relationship between the CKY algorithm, the Earley algorithm and a bottom-up varia
