000 sentence pairs to 320,000 sentence pairs.
    All systems improve with more data.
    Table 1 lists the number of distinct phrase translation pairs learned by each method and each corpus.
    The number grows almost linearly with the training corpus size, due to the large number of singletons.
    The syntactic restriction eliminates over 80% of all phrase pairs.
    Note that the millions of phrase pairs learned fit easily into the working memory of modern computers.
    Even the largest models take up only a few hundred megabyte of RAM.
    The restriction on syntactic phrases is harmful, because too many phrases are eliminated.
    But still, we might suspect, that these lead to more reliable phrase pairs. pairs consistent with a word alignment (AP), phrase pairs from the joint model (Joint), IBM Model 4 (M4), and only syntactic phrases (Syn) One way to check this is to use all phrase pairs and give more weight to syntactic phrase translations.
