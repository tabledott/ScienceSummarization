agraphs.
    We argue that a paragraph can address multiple topics and is motivated by content, writing style and presentation.
    Thus, a topic segment is a collection of sentences.
    This view is supported by previous work in text segmentation (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Choi, 2000a).
    A similarity metric estimates the likelihood of two segments describing the same topic.
    Existing methods fall into one of two categories.
    Lexical cohesion methods stem from the work of Halliday and Hasan (1976), in which a coherent topic segment is believed to contain parts with similar vocabulary.
    Implementations of this use word stem repetition (Youmans, 1991; Reynar, 1994; Ponte and Croft, 1997), context vectors (Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Kaufmann, 1999; Eichmann et al., 1999; Choi, 2000a), entity repetition (Kan et al., 1998), thesaurus relations (Morris and Hirst, 1991), spreading activation over dictionary (Kozima, 1993), a word distance model (Beeferman et al., 1997) or a word frequency model (Reynar, 19
