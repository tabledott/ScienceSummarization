 will give the maximum increase in likelihood, or leaving it in its original cluster if no improvement can be found.
    There are a number of different ways in which the initial clustering can be chosen; it has been found, and our own experiments have tended to confirm this, that the initialisation method has little effect on the final quality of the clusters but can have a marked effect on the speed of convergence of the algorithm.
    A more important variation for our purposes is how the rare words are treated.
    (Martin et al., 1998) leave all words with a frequency of less than 5 in a particular class, from which they may not be moved.
  
  
    The second sort of information is information about the sequence of letters or phones that form each word.
    To take a trivial example, if we encounter an unknown word, say &#163;212,000 then merely looking at the sequence of characters that compose it is enough to enable us to make a good guess as to its part of speech.
    Less trivially, if a word in Engl
