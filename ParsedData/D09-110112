ing (ILP), where a discourse-new classifier and a coreference classifier are trained independently of each other, and then ILP is applied as a post-processing step to jointly infer discourse-new and coreference decisions so that they are consistent with each other (e.g., Denis and Baldridge (2007)).
    Joint inference is different from our jointlearning approach, which allows the two tasks to be learned jointly and not independently.
  
  
    In this section, we describe three coreference models that will serve as our baselines: the mentionpair model, the entity-mention model, and the mention-ranking model.
    For illustrative purposes, we will use the text segment shown in Figure 1.
    Each mention m in the segment is annotated as [m]cidmid, where mid is the mention id and cid is the id of the cluster to which m belongs.
    As we can see, the mentions are partitioned into four sets, with Barack Obama, his, and he in one cluster, and each of the remaining mentions in its own cluster.
    As noted before,
