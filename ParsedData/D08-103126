d mentions to their counterparts in the annotated data.
    We resolve coreference on unannotated text as follows: First we detect mention heads following a state of the art chunking approach (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001) using standard features.
    This results in a 90% F1 head detector.
    Next, we detect the extent boundaries for each head using a learned classifier.
    This is followed by determining whether a mention is a proper name, common noun phrase, prenominal modifier, or pronoun using a learned mention type classifier that.
    Finally, we apply our coreference algorithm described above.
    To evaluate, we align the heads of the detected mentions to the gold standard heads greedily based on number of overlapping words.
    We choose not to impute errors to the coreference system for mentions that were not detected or for spuriously detected mentions (following Ji et al. (2005) and others).
    Although this evaluation is lenient, given that the mention detection component performs at over 90% F1
