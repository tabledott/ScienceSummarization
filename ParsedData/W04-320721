f five-fold cross-validation with the mean and standard deviation (in parentheses).
    Since it is unlexicalized, the PCFG parses sequences of tags as output by the morphological analysis model.
    By contrast, we can build translation tables for the SITG directly from surface words&#8212;and thus not use any labeled training data at all&#8212;or from the sequence of head morphemes.
    Experiments showed, however, that the SITG using words consistently outperformed the SITG using morphemes.
    We also implemented Wu&#8217;s treetransformation algorithm to turn full binary-branching SITG output into flatter trees.
    Finally, we can provide extra information to the SITG by giving it a set of English bracketings that it must respect when constructing the joint tree.
    To get an upper bound on performance, we used the true parses from the English side of the KTB.
    Only the PCFG, of course, can be evaluated on labeled bracketing (Table 6).
    Although labeled precision and recall on test data generally
