 ties in the domain at any given point in time: the constituency of this set changes as a recipe pro- ceeds, since entities may be created or destroyed.
  4 Suppose, for example, we  determine that we must identify a given object as being a set of olives which have been pitted (in a context, for example, where there are also olives which have not been pitted}; the corresponding deep semantic struc- ture is then as in figure 3.
  Note that this deep semantic structure can be realized in at least two ways: as either the olives which have been pitted or the pitted olives.
  4A slightly more sophisticated approach would be to restrict U to exclude those entities which are, in G rosz and Sidners (1986) terms, only present in closed focus spaces.
  However, the benefit gained from doing this (if indeed it is a valid thing to do) is minimal in the current context because of the small number of entities we are dealing with.
