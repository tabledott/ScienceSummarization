st instance that was classified with a grammatical relation, we check whether the same verb-focuspair appears with the same relation in the GR list extracted directly from the treebank.
    This gives us the precision of the classifier.
    Checking the treebank list versus the classified list yields We have already seen from the example that the level of structure in the input text can influence the composition of the instances.
    We are interested in the effects of different sorts of partial structure in the input data on the classification performance of the final classifier.
    Therefore, we ran a series of experiments.
    The classification task was always that of finding grammatical relations to verbs and performance was always measured by precision and recall on those relations (the test set contained 45825 relations).
    The amount of structure in the input data varied.
    Table 4 shows the results of the experiments.
    In the first experiment, only POS tagged input is used.
    Then, NP chunk
