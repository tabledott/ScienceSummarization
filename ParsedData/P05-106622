pression of the differences between the baseline and reordered system.
    Our (no doubt subjective) impression is that the cases in figure 3 are more clear cut instances of translation improvements, but we leave the reader to make his/her own judgement on this point.
    We now describe statistical significance tests for our results.
    We believe that applying significance tests to Bleu scores is a subtle issue, for this reason we go into some detail in this section.
    We used the sign test (e.g., see page 166 of (Lehmann, 1986)) to test the statistical significance of our results.
    For a source sentence , the sign test requires a function that is defined as follows: If reordered system produces a better translation for than the baseline If baseline produces a better translation for than the reordered system.
    If the two systems produce equal quality translations on We assume that sentences are drawn from some underlying distribution , and that the test set consists of independently, identically di
