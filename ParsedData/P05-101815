and Lee, 2004; Karamanis et al., 2004) are commonly evaluated by their performance at information-ordering.
    The task concerns determining a sequence in which to present a pre-selected set of information-bearing items; this is an essential step in concept-to-text generation, multi-document summarization, and other text-synthesis problems.
    Since local coherence is a key property of any well-formed text, our model can be used to rank alternative sentence orderings.
    We do not assume that local coherence is sufficient to uniquely determine the best ordering &#8212; other constraints clearly play a role here.
    However, we expect that the accuracy of a coherence model is reflected in its performance in the ordering task.
    Data To acquire a large collection for training and testing, we create synthetic data, wherein the candidate set consists of a source document and permutations of its sentences.
    This framework for data acquisition is widely used in evaluation of ordering algorithms as it enabl
