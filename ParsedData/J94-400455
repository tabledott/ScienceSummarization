ly, it also cannot be the case that a logical argument maps to a syntactic adjunct position (case 1.2).
  A logical argument is a necessary participant of a particular action, and as such, it must be "governed" by the lexical item that selects it.
  By contrast, adjunct positions are reserved for optional modifying participants that do not need to be governed by the lexical item that they are modifying; thus, logical arguments must necessarily be mapped into internal argument positions.
  618 Bonnie J. Dorr Machine Translation Divergences Another case that is eliminated is the renaming of a logical head as a syntactic adjunct whose head corresponds to a logical modifier (case 2.3).
  The idea is simply that modification is a one-way relation.
  If a logical head has a modifier, the head cannot become an adjunct of that modifier because the modifying relation would be reversed (i.e., the logical head would modify the syntactic head rather than the other way around).
  In contrast, a logical head of a CLCS can
