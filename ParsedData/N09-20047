ns are not only at the single-word level, but are in general at the phrasal level.
    The second pass takes the output of the first pass, and re-orders constituent phrases corresponding to semantic predicates and arguments, seeking to maximize the cross-lingual match of the semantic parse of the re-ordered translation to that of the original input sentence.
    The second pass algorithm performs the error correction shown in Figure 1.
    The design decision to allow the first pass to fix all lexical choices follows an insight inspired by an empirical observation from our error analyses: the lexical choice decisions being made by today&#8217;s SMT models have attained fairly reasonable levels, and are not where the major problems of adequacy lie.
    Rather, the ordering of arguments in relation to their predicates is often where the main failures of adequacy occur.
    By avoiding lexical choice variations while considering re-ordering hypotheses, a significantly larger amount of re-ordering can be done wit
