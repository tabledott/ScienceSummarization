 should be modified to be the nonterminal immediately to the left of the CC (see Figure 6).
    An important detail is that such &#8220;head movement&#8221; does not occur inside base NPs.
    That is, a phrase headed by NPB may indeed look as though it constitutes a coordinated phrase&#8212;it has a CC that is noninitial but to the left of the currently chosen head&#8212;but the currently chosen head should remain chosen.11 As we shall see, there is exceptional behavior for base NPs in almost every part of the Collins parser.
    10 In our first attempt at replicating Collins&#8217; results, we simply employed the same head-finding rule for NX nodes as for NP nodes.
    This choice yields different&#8212;but not necessarily inferior&#8212;results.
    11 In Section 4.1, we defined coordinated phrases in terms of heads, but here we are discussing how the head-finder itself needs to determine whether a phrase is coordinated.
    It does this by considering the potential new choice of head: If the head-finding
