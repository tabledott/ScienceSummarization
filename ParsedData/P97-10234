 with *fair and brutal and *corrupt and legitimate (or the other cross-products of the above conjunctions) which are semantically anomalous.
    The situation is reversed for but, which usually connects two adjectives of different orientations.
    The system identifies and uses this indirect information in the following stages: In the following sections, we first present the set of adjectives used for training and evaluation.
    We next validate our hypothesis that conjunctions constrain the orientation of conjoined adjectives and then describe the remaining three steps of the algorithm.
    After presenting our results and evaluation, we discuss simulation experiments that show how our method performs under different conditions of sparseness of data.
  
  
    For our experiments, we use the 21 million word 1987 Wall Street Journal corpus', automatically annotated with part-of-speech tags using the PARTS tagger (Church, 1988).
    In order to verify our hypothesis about the orientations of conjoined adject
