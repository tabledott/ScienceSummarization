le T we will produce all possible translations.'
    Assumption 3, which may be viewed as a soundness assumption, does not always hold, since a target language word may be the translation of several source language words.
    Consider, for example, the Hebrew tuple T = (verb&#8212;obj: hehziq lul).
    Lul is ambiguous, meaning either a playpen or a chicken pen.
    Accordingly, T can be translated to either T1 = (verb&#8212;obj: hold playpen) or T2 = (verb&#8212;obj: hold pen).
    In the context of 'hold' the first translation is more likely, and we can therefore expect our model to prefer T1.
    However, this might not be the case because Assumption 3 is contradicted.
    'Pen' can also be the translation of the Hebrew word 'et (the writing instrument), and thus T2 can be the translation of another Hebrew tuple, = (verb&#8212;obj: hehziq 'et).
    This means that when translating T we are counting occurrences of T2 that correspond to both T and T', &amp;quot;misleading&amp;quot; the selection criterion.
