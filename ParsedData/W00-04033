    A key feature of MEAD is its use of cluster centroids, which consist of words which are central not only to one article in a cluster, but to all the articles.
    MEAD is significantly different from previous work on multi-document summarization [Radev &amp; McKeown, 1998; Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Mani and Bloedorn, 1999; McKeown et al., 1999], which use techniques such as graph matching, maximal marginal relevance, or language generation.
    Finally, evaluation of multi-document summaries is a difficult problem.
    There is not yet a widely accepted evaluation scheme.
    We propose a utility-based evaluation scheme, which can be used to evaluate both single-document and multi-document summaries.
  
  
    Cluster-based sentence utility (CBSU, or utility) refers to the degree of relevance (from 0 to 10) of a ' particular sentence to the general topic of the entire cluster (for a dis cussion of what is a topic, see [Allan et al. 1998]).
    A utility of 0 means that the sentence is not relevant
