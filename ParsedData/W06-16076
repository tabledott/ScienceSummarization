ts, in order to compensate for data sparsity.
    In the spirit of ((Hastie et al., 2001), figure 2.11, pg.
    38) smoothing can be seen as a way of combining the relativefrequency estimate, which is a model with high complexity, high variance, and low bias, with another model with lower complexity, lower variance, and high bias, in the hope of obtaining better performance on new data.
    There are two main ingredients in all such recipes: some probability distribution that is smoother than relative frequencies (ie, that has fewer parameters and is thus less complex) and some technique for combining that distribution with relative frequency estimates.
    We will now discuss both these choices: the distribution for carrying out smoothing and the combination technique.
    In this discussion, we use &#732;p() to denote relative frequency distributions.
    One can distinguish between two approaches to smoothing phrase tables.
    Black-box techniques do not look inside phrases but instead treat them as atomi
