 on the tuning set, and used the averaged feature weights from all iterations of all learners to decode the test set.
    The results (Table 1) show significant improvements in both systems (p &lt; 0.01) over already very strong MERT baselines.
    Adding the source-side and discount features to Hiero yields a +1.5 BLEU improvement, and adding the target-side syntax and discount features to the syntax-based system yields a +1.1 BLEU improvement.
    The results also show that for Hiero, the various classes of features contributed roughly equally; for the syntax-based system, we see that two of the feature classes make small contributions but time constraints unfortunately did not permit isolated testing of all feature classes.
  
  
    How did the various new features improve the translation quality of our two systems?
    We begin by examining the discount features.
    For these features, we used slightly different schemes for the two systems, shown in Table 2 with their learned feature weights.
    We see
