    Usually, in computational linguistic literature, a named entity represents an instance of a name, either a location, a person, an organization, and the NER task consists of identifying each individual occurrence of such an entity.
    We will instead adopt the nomenclature of the Automatic Content Extraction program' (NIST, 2003a): we will call the instances of textual references to objects or abstractions mentions, which can be either named (e.g.
    John Mayor), nominal (e.g. the president) or pronominal (e.g. she, it).
    An entity consists of all the mentions (of any level) which refer to one conceptual entity.
