ehensible discourse, if they take advantage of this interplay between segmentation and linguistic devices.
    In Section 2, we give a brief overview of related work.
    In Section 3, we present our analysis of segmentation data collected from a population of naive subjects.
    Our results demonstrate an extremely significant pattern of agreement on segment boundaries.
    In Section 4, we use boundaries abstracted from the data produced by our subjects to quantitatively evaluate algorithms for segmenting discourse.
    In Section 4.1, we discuss the coding and evaluation methods.
    In Section 4,2, we test an initial set of algorithms for computing segment boundaries from a particular type of linguistic feature, either referential noun phrases, cue phrases, or pauses.
    In Section 4.3.1, we analyze the errors of our initial algorithms in order to identify a set of enriched input features, and to determine how to combine information from the three linguistic knowledge sources.
    In Section 4.3.2, we us
