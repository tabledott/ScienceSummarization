easures.
    Details on this have been described in (Leusch et al., 2005).
    Table 3 presents the correlation of BLEU, WER, and CDER with human assessment.
    It can be seen that CDER shows better correlation than BLEU and WER on both corpora.
    On the Chinese&#8211;English task, the smoothed BLEU score has a higher sentence-level correlation than WER.
    However, this is not the case for the Arabic&#8211; English task.
    So none of these two measures is superior to the other one, but they are both outperformed by CDER.
    If the direction of CDER is reversed (i.e, the CD constraints are required for the candidate instead of the reference, such that the measure has precision instead of recall characteristics), the correlation with human evaluation is much lower.
    Additionally we studied the use of the maximum of the distances in both directions.
    This has a lower correlation than taking the original CDER, as Table 3 shows.
    Nevertheless, the maximum still performs slightly better than BLEU a
