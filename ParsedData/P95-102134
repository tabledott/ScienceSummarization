Furthermore, a finite verb may optionally also project to S' (as in the d-tree shown for claims), indicating that a whmoved or topicalized element is required.
    The finite verb seems also projects to S, even though it does not itself provide a functional subject.
    In the case of the to adore tree, the situation is the inverse: the functional subject requires a finite verb to agree with, which is signaled by the fact that its component's root and frontier nodes are labelled S and VP, respectively, but the verb itself is not finite and therefore only projects to VP[-fin].
    Therefore, the subject will have to raise out of its clause for agreement and case assignment.
    The direct object of to adore has wh-moved out of the projection of the verb (we include a trace for the sake of clarity).
    We add SICs to ensure that the projections are respected by components of other d-trees that may be inserted during a derivation.
    A SIC is associated with the d-edge between VP and S node in the seems d-tree
