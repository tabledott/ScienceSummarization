			We define Question Classification(QC) here to be the task that, given a question, maps it to one of k classes, which provide a semantic constraint on the sought-after answer1.
			The intension is that this 1We do not address questions like ?Do you have a light??, which calls for an action, but rather only factual Wh-questions.
