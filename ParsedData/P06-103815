    In order to cover as many words as possible, we use the smallest clique, a single symmetric arc.
    This creates redundant categories.
    We enhance the quality of the categories by merging them and by windowing on the corpus.
    We use two simple merge heuristics.
    First, if two categories are identical we treat them as one.
    Second, given two categories Q, R, we merge them iff there&#8217;s more than a 50% overlap between them: (|Q n R |&gt; |Q|/2) n (|Q n R |&gt; |R|/2).
    = This could be added to the clique-set stage, but the phrasing above is simpler to explain and implement.
    In order to increase category quality and remove categories that are too context-specific, we use a simple corpus windowing technique.
    Instead of running the algorithm of this section on the whole corpus, we divide the corpus into windows of equal size (see Section 5 for size determination) and perform the category discovery algorithm of this section on each window independently.
    Merging is also performed
