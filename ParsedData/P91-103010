    To evaluate the performance of this procedure, first the two authors graded a set of verb-nounpreposition triples as follows.
    From the AP new stories, we randomly selected 1000 test sentences in which the parser identified an ambiguous verbnoun-preposition triple.
    (These sentences were selected from stories included in the 13 million word sample, but the particular sentences were excluded from the calculation of lexical associations.)
    For every such triple , each author made a judgement of the correct attachment on the basis of the three words alone (forced choice - preposition attaches to noun or verb).
    This task is in essence the one that we will give the computer &#8212; i.e., to judge the attachment without any more information than the preposition and the head of the two possible attachment sites, the noun and the verb.
    This gave us two sets of judgements to compare the algorithm's performance to.
    We also wanted a standard of correctness for these test sentence
