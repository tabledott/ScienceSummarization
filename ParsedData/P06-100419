    We intentionally did not provide the subjects with the target number of boundaries, since we wanted to see if the annotators would converge on a common segmentation granularity.
    Table 2 presents the annotator segmentation statistics.
    We see two classes of segmentation granularities.
    The original reference (O) and annotator A segmented at a coarse level with an average of 6.6 and 8.9 segments per lecture, respectively.
    Annotators B and C operated at much finer levels of discrimination with 18.4 and 13.8 segments per lecture on average.
    We conclude that multiple levels of granularity are acceptable in spoken lecture segmentation.
    This is expected given the length of the lectures and varying human judgments in selecting relevant topical content.
    Following previous studies, we quantify the level of annotator agreement with the Pk measure (Gruenstein et al., 2005).3 Table 3 shows the annotator agreement scores between different pairs of annotators.
    Pk measures ranged from 0.24
