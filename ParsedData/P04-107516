epresentativeness and diversity criteria at the same time.
    This strategy is shown in Figure 3.
    One limitation of this strategy is that clustering result may not reflect the distribution of whole sample space since we only cluster on INTERSet for efficiency.
    The other is that since the representativeness of an example is only evaluated on a cluster.
    If the cluster size is too small, the most representative example in this cluster may not be representative in the whole sample space.
    Given: NESet = {NE1, .
    .., NEN} BatchSet with the maximal size K. INTERSet with the maximal size M Steps: which the Info and Density value of NEi are normalized first.
    The individual importance of each criterion in this function is adjusted by the tradeoff parameter l ( 0 &#8804; l &#8804;1 ) (set to 0.6 in our experiment).
    First, we select a candidate example NEi with the maximum value of this function from NESet.
    Second, we consider diversity criterion using the local method in Section 3.3.2.
