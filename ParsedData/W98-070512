stinguish them.
    Other problems of WordNet for text retrieval include too much finegrained sense-distinctions and lack of domain information; see (Gonzalo et al., In press) for a more detailed discussion on the adequacy of WordNet structure for text retrieval.
    Figure 2 shows the sensitivity of the synset indexing system to degradation of disambiguation accuracy (corresponding to the experiments 4 and 5 described above).
    From the plot, it can be seen that: differs from (Sanderson, 1994) result (namely, that it is better not to disambiguate below a 90% accuracy).
    The main difference is that we are using concepts rather than word senses.
    But, in addition, it must be noted that Sanderson's setup used artificially created ambiguous pseudo words (such as 'bank/spring) which are not guaranteed to behave as real ambiguous words.
    Moreover, what he understands as disambiguating is selecting -in the example- bank or spring which remain to be ambiguous words themselves.
    It is too soon to say if
