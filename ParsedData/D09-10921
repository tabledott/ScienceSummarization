s in email (McCallum et al., 2005), and expanding queries with topically related words in information retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006).
    Much of this work, however, has occurred in monolingual contexts.
    In an increasingly connected world, the ability to access documents in many languages has become both a strategic asset and a personally enriching experience.
    In this paper, we present the polylingual topic model (PLTM).
    We demonstrate its utility and explore its characteristics using two polylingual corpora: proceedings of the European parliament (in eleven languages) and a collection of Wikipedia articles (in twelve languages).
    There are many potential applications for polylingual topic models.
    Although research literature is typically written in English, bibliographic databases often contain substantial quantities of work in other languages.
    To perform topic-based bibliometric analysis on these collections, it is necessary to have topic models that are aligned across languages.
