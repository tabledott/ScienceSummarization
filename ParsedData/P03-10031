 reasoning (Moldovan et al, 2002).
    They access external resources such as the WordNet (Hovy et al., 2001, Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001, Prager et al., 2001), the web (Brill et al., 2001), structured, and semistructured databases (Katz et al., 2001; Lin, 2002; Clarke, 2001).
    They contain feedback loops, ranking, and re-ranking modules.
    Given their complexity, it is often difficult (and sometimes impossible) to understand what contributes to the performance of a system and what doesn&#8217;t.
    In this paper, we propose a new approach to QA in which the contribution of various resources and components can be easily assessed.
    The fundamental insight of our approach, which departs significantly from the current architectures, is that, at its core, a QA system is a pipeline of only two modules: a question Q and a sentence S (from the set of sentences retrieved by the IR engine) identifies a sub-string SA of S that is likely to be an answer to Q and assigns a score to it.
    Once one has these two m
