e correct choice for some NE words (e.g. for queen in Queen Victoria), and transliterations for others (e.g.
    Bush in Steven Bush).
    We expect temporal sequence alignment to resolve many of such ambiguities.
    It is used to select the best translation/transliteration candidate from each word&#8217;s candidate set, which are then merged into a possible NE in the other language.
    Finally, we verify that the NE is actually contained in the target corpus.
    A major challenge inherent in discovering transliterated NEs is the fact that a single entity may be represented by multiple transliteration strings.
    One reason is language morphology.
    For example, in Russian, depending on a case being used, the same noun may appear with various endings.
    Another reason is the lack of transliteration standards.
    Again, in Russian, several possible transliterations of an English entity may be acceptable, as long as they are phonetically similar to the source.
    Thus, in order to rely on the time seq
