so on.
    The hierarchy of equivalence classes F0, ... ,Fn is as follows: where n is the maximum number of morpho-syntactic tags.
    The mapping from the full lemma-tag representation back to inflected word forms is generally unambiguous; thus Fn contains only one element, namely, ankomme.
    Fn&#8722;1 contains the forms ankomme, ankommst, and ankommt; in Fn&#8722;2 the number (singular or plural) is ignored, and so on.
    The largest equivalence class contains all inflected forms of the base form ankommen.1 Section 4.2 introduces the concept of combining information at different levels of abstraction.
    In modeling for statistical machine translation, a hidden variable aJ1, denoting the hidden alignment between the words in the source and target languages, is usually introduced into the string translation probability: In the following, Tj = &#65533;tn &#65533; j denotes the lemma-tag representation of the jth word in 0 the input sentence.
    The sequence TJ1 stands for the sequence of readings for th
