he example sentences are The correct classifications of tuples 1 and 2 are N and V, respectively.
    (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) describes a partially supervised approach in which the FIDDITCH partial parser was used to extract (v, n, p) tuples from raw text, where p is a preposition whose attachment is ambiguous between the head verb v and the head noun n. The extracted tuples are then used to construct a classifier, which resolves unseen ambiguities at around 80% accuracy.
    Later work, such as (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Collins and Brooks, 1995; Merlo et al., 1997; Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997; Franz, 1997), trains and tests on quintuples of the form (v, n,p, n2, a) extracted from the Penn treebank(Marcus et al., 1994), and has gradually improved on this accuracy with other kinds of statistical learning methods, yielding up to 84.5% accuracy(Collins and Brooks, 1995).
    Recently, (Stetina and Naga,o, 1997) have reported 88% accuracy by using a corpus-based model in conjunction with
