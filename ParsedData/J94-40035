n hoze means both 'contract' and 'treaty,' where the difference is mainly in usage rather than in the meaning (in Hebrew the word hoze is used for both sub-senses).
    One possible solution is to consult a Hebrew corpus tagged with word senses, from which we would probably learn that the sense 'sign' of lahtom appears more frequently with hoze as its object than all the other senses.
    Thus we should prefer that sense.
    However, the size of corpora required to identify lexical relations in a broad domain is very large, and therefore it is usually not feasible to have such corpora manually tagged with word senses!
    The problem of choosing between 'treaty' and 'contract' cannot be solved using only information on Hebrew, because Hebrew does not distinguish between them.
    The solution suggested in this paper is to identify the lexical relations in corpora of the target language, instead of the source language.
    We consider word combinations and count how often they appear in the same syntactic rel
