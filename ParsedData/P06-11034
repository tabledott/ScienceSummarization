 side of the bilingual corpus to their counterparts on the other.
    We use a Discrete Fourier Transform (Arfken, 1985) based metric for computing similarity of time distributions, and show that it has significant advantages over other metrics traditionally used.
    We score NEs similarity with a linear transliteration model.
    We first train a transliteration model on singleword NEs.
    During training, for a given NE in one language, the current model chooses a list of top ranked transliteration candidates in another language.
    Time sequence scoring is then used to rerank the list and choose the candidate best temporally aligned with the NE.
    Pairs of NEs and the best candidates are then used to iteratively train the Once the model is trained, NE discovery proceeds as follows.
    For a given NE, transliteration model selects a candidate list for each constituent word.
    If a dictionary is available, each candidate list is augmented with translations (if they exist).
    Translations will be th
