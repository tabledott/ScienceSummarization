orithm is a bilingual corpus with high-precision word alignments.
    We obtain the word alignments using the way of Koehn et al. (2005).
    After running GIZA++ (Och and Ney, rows from the corners are their links.
    Corner c1 is shared by block b1 and b2, which in turn are linked by the STRAIGHT links, bottomleft and topright of c1.
    Similarly, block b3 and b4 are linked by the INVERTED links, topleft and bottomright of c2.
    2000) in both directions, we apply the &#8220;growdiag-final&#8221; refinement rule on the intersection alignments for each sentence pair.
    Before we introduce this algorithm, we introduce some formal definitions.
    The first one is block which is a pair of source and target contiguous sequences of words This definition is similar to that of bilingual phrase except that there is no length limitation over block.
    A reordering example is a triple of (o, b1, b2) where b1 and b2 are two neighbor blocks and o is the order between them.
    We define each vertex of block as co
