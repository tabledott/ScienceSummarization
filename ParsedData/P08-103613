erall sentiment.
    The MAS model is presented in Figure 3b.
    Note that for simplicity we decided to omit in the figure the components of the MG-LDA model other than variables r, z and w, though they are present in the statistical model.
    MAS also allows for extra unassociated local topics in order to capture aspects not explicitly rated by the user.
    As in MG-LDA, MAS has global topics which are expected to capture topics corresponding to particular types of items, such London hotels or seaside resorts for the hotel domain.
    In figure 3b we shaded the aspect ratings ya, assuming that every aspect rating is present in the data (though in practice they might be available only for some reviews).
    In this model the distribution of the overall sentiment rating yo&#8222; is based on all the n-gram features of a review text.
    Then the distribution of ya, for every rated aspect a, can be computed from the distribution of yo&#8222; and from any n-gram feature where at least one word in the n-gram i
