 problems.
    It is also clear that some of the distinctions being made by the tags are more important than others for parsing.
    We therefore explored different ways of extracting smaller but still maximally informative POS tagsets.
    The POS tags in the Czech PDT corpus (Haji 6 and Hladka, 1997) are encoded in 13-character strings.
    Table 1 shows the role of each character.
    For example, the tag NNMP1 A would be used for a word that had &amp;quot;noun&amp;quot; as both its main and detailed part of speech, that was masculine, plural, nominative (case 1), and whose negativeness value was &amp;quot;affirmative&amp;quot;.
    Within the corpus, each word was annotated with all of the POS tags that would be possible given its spelling, using the output of a morphological analysis program, and also with the single one of those tags that a statistical POS tagging program had predicted to be the correct tag (Hake and Hladka, 1998).
    Table 2 shows a phrase from the corpus, with the alternative possibl
