ee of partial character matching by step 3, as for the latter example.
    Our method detects the scope of a CS by finding the two series of bunsetsus from before and after the KB that have the greatest similarity.
    To measure the similarity score between two series of bunsetsus, we have developed a method using a triangular matrix, A, as shown in Figure 2 (Figure 7 and Figure 8 are concrete examples): A = (a(i, j)) (0 5_ i &lt; 1; i &lt; j &lt; I), where 1 is the number of bunsetsus in a sentence.
    Here, each diagonal element a(i, i) is the ith bunsetsu in a sentence (hereafter denoted 13,) and every other element a(i,j) (i &lt;j) is the similarity value between bunsetsu Bi and bunsetsu Bj calculated by the process just described.
    In detecting a CS whose KB is the nth bunsetsu (B&#8222;), we consider only a partial matrix (denoted An) that is the upper right part of B, (Figure 2): For specifying candidate pre- and post-conjuncts and measuring their similarity, we define a path in A, (Figure 2): pat
