ach containing approximately 160,000 words.
    This is an &#8220;annotation lite&#8221; task: With no training, the annotators achieved kappa values of 0.94 and 0.95, and each spent an average of three hours per Wall Street Journal file.
  
  
    The goal in this section is to learn lexical subjectivity clues of various types, single words as well as collocations.
    Some require no training data, some are learned using the expression-level subjective-element annotations as training data, and some are learned using the document-level opinion piece annotations as training data (i.e., opinion piece versus nonopinion piece).
    All of the clues are evaluated with respect to the document-level opinion piece annotations.
    While these evaluations are our focus, because many more opinion piece than subjective-element data exist, we do evaluate the clues learned from the opinion piece data on the subjective-element data as well.
    Thus, we cross-validate the results both ways between the two types of annotat
