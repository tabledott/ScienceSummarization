re the characteristics of (er,,,, el, C,).
    In this paper, we investigate combinations of the atomic features listed in Table 1.
    The following combinations are used for representing the characteristics of the binary/unary schema applications.
    In addition, the following is for expressing the condition of the root node of the parse tree.
    Figure 4 shows examples: (root is for the root node, in which the phrase symbol is S and the surface form, part-of-speech, and lexical entry of the lexical head are &#8220;saw&#8221;, VBD, and a transitive verb, respectively. fbinary is for the binary rule application to &#8220;saw a girl&#8221; and &#8220;with a telescope&#8221;, in which the applied schema is the Head-Modifier Schema, the left daughter is VP headed by &#8220;saw&#8221;, and the right daughter is PP headed by &#8220;with&#8221;, whose part-of-speech is IN and the lexical entry is a VP-modifying preposition.
    In an actual implementation, some of the atomic features are abstracted (i.e., ignore
