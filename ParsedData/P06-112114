own traversal.To assign complement spans, we assign the com plement span of any node n to each of its children, and for each of them, add the span of the child to the complement span of all other children.
			In another traversal of G, we determine the minimal rule extractible from each node in F . We explore all tree fragments rooted at n by maintaining an open and a closed queue of rules extracted from n (qo and qc).
			At each step, we pick the smallest rule in qo, and for each of itsvariable nodes, try to discover new rules (?succes sor rules?)
			by means of composition with minimalrules, until a given threshold on rule size or maxi mum number of rules in qc is reached.
			There may be more that one successor per rule, since we must account for all possible spans than can be assigned to non-lexical leaves of a rule.
			Once a threshold is reached, or if the open queue is empty, we connecta new OR-node to all rules that have just been ex tracted from n, and add it to or-dforest.
			Finally, we proceed rec
