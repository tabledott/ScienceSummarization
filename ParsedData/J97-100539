served number of agreements is halfway between chance and perfect agreement.
    Negative values indicate the degree to which observed disagreements differ from chance.
    In principle, a is computed from the same type of matrix shown in Table 1, Krippendorff's a comparing boundaries derived from two sets of 4 subjects on 4 narratives.

    Here we summarize computation of a simplified formula for a used for comparing two data sets with a single, dichotomous variable.
    To exemplify the computation, we use the first two rows of Table 1, giving a matrix of size i = 2 x j = 11.
    The value of Do (proportion of observed disagreements) is then simply -All, where M is the total number of mismatches (j being the potential number of matches).
    In our example, Do has a value of 121 (.18).
    Where n1 is the total number of l's and no is the total numbe
