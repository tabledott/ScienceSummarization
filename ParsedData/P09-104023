icant with respect to all other systems except MSTMalt for Slovene, all except MSTMalt and Spp for Czech, and with respect to MSTMalt for Turkish.
    For Arabic and Danish, there are no significant differences in the exact match scores.
    We conclude that Su may increase the probability of finding a completely correct analysis, which is sometimes reflected also in the overall attachment score, and we conjecture that the strength of the positive effect is dependent on the frequency of non-projective arcs in the language.
  
  
    Processing non-projective trees by swapping the order of words has recently been proposed by both Nivre (2008b) and Titov et al. (2009), but these systems cannot handle unrestricted non-projective trees.
    It is worth pointing out that, although the system described in Nivre (2008b) uses four transitions bearing the same names as the transitions of Su, the two systems are not equivalent.
    In particular, the system of Nivre (2008b) is sound but not complete for the class of al
