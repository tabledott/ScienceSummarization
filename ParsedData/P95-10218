  Thus, they fail to address the first prowe discussed (in Section 1.3 The DTG Approach Vijay-Shanker (1992) points out that use of adjunction for clausal complementation in TAG corresponds, at the level of dependency structure, to substitution at the foot node' of the adjoined tree.
    However, adjunction (rather than substitution) is used since, in general, the structure that is substituted may only form part of the clausal complement: the remaining substructure of the clausal complement appears above the root of the adjoined tree.
    Unfortunately, as seen in the examples given in Section 1.2, there are cases where satisfactory analyses cannot be obtained with adjunction.
    In particular, using adjunction in this way cannot handle cases in which parts of the clausal complement are required to be placed within the structure of the adjoined tree. of subsertion is designed to overcome this limitation.
    Subsertion can be viewed as a generalization of adjunction in which components of the clausal complem
