irst decoding method achieves equally good performance as full bidirectional inference.
			Table 2 also shows that the easiest-last strategy, where weselect and tag the most difficult word at each itera tion, is clearly a bad strategy.An example of easiest-first decoding is given be low: 1For dependency network and full bidirectional decoding, we conducted pruning because the computational cost was too large to perform exhaustive search.
			We pruned a tag candidate if the zero-th order probability of the candidate P (ti|o) was lower than one hundredth of the zero-th order probability of the most likely tag at the token.
