ted that the performance of the state-of-the-art keyword extraction is much lower than for many other NLP-tasks, such as tagging and parsing, and there is plenty of room for improvements.
    To give an idea of this, the results obtained by the genetic algorithm trained by Turney (2000), and the naive Bayes approach by Frank et al. (1999) are presented.
    The number of terms assigned must be explicitly limited by the user for these algorithms.
    Turney and Frank et al. report the precision for five and fifteen keywords per document.
    Recall is not reported in their studies.
    In Table 1 their results when training and testing on journal articles are shown, and the highest values for the two algorithms are presented.
    There are two drawbacks in common with the approaches proposed by Turney (2000) and Frank et al. (1999).
    First, the number of tokens in a keyword is limited to three.
    In the data used to train the classifiers evaluated in this paper, 9.1% of the manually assigned keywords cons
