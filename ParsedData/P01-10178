conditioned on one lexical item (either i or h).
    Thus only p(h j t,l, m, u, i), the distribution for the head of c, looks at two lexical items (i and h itself), and none of the distributions look at three lexical items as do the trigram distribution of Equation 4 and the previously discussed parsing language models [4, 15].
    Next we describe how we assign a probability to the expansion e of a constituent.
    We break up a traditional probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) rule into a left-hand side with a label l(c) drawn from the non-terminal symbols of our grammar, and a right-hand side that is a sequence 1We simplify slightly in this section.
    See [3] for all the details on the equations as well as the smoothing used. of one or more such symbols.
    For each expansion we distinguish one of the right-hand side labels as the &#8220;middle&#8221; or &#8220;head&#8221; symbol M(c).
    M(c) is the constituent from which the head lexical item h is obtained according to deterministic rules that pi
