sonably well to unseen test data from other sources.
    First, smoothing across classes greatly reduces the training data required for individual grade models.
    By &#8216;borrowing&#8217; word frequency data from nearby grades, the effective number of types for each grade model is multiplied by a factor of five or more.
    This helps explain the type coverage of about 90% on our test data.
    Second, because we are interested in the relative likelihoods of grade levels, accurate relative type probabilities are more important than absolute probabilities.
    Indeed, trying to learn absolute type probabilities would be undesirable since it would fit the model too closely to whatever specific topics were in the training set.
    The important functions of relative likelihood appear to be general indicators such as the grade when a word is first introduced into usage, whether it generally increases or decreases with grade level, and whether it is most frequent in a particular grade range.
