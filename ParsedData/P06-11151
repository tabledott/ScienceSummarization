 have considered the important task of doing deep semantic parsing to map sentences into their computer-executable meaning representations.
			Previous work on learning semantic parsers either employ rule-based algorithms (Tang andMooney, 2001; Kate et al, 2005), or use sta tistical feature-based methods (Ge and Mooney, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2006).
			In this paper, we present anovel kernel-based statistical method for learn ing semantic parsers.
			Kernel methods (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) are particularly suitable for semantic parsing because it involves mappingphrases of natural language (NL) sentences to semantic concepts in a meaning representation lan guage (MRL).
			Given that natural languages are so flexible, there are various ways in which one can express the same semantic concept.
			It is difficultfor rule-based methods or even statistical featurebased methods to capture the full range of NL con texts which map to a semantic concept because they tend to en
