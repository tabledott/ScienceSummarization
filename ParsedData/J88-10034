  It then handles various special cases, such as words with initial &amp;quot;$&amp;quot;, contractions, special symbols, and capitalized words.
    The word's ending is then checked against a suffix list of about 450 strings.
    The lists were derived from lexicostatistics of the Brown Corpus.
    If TAGGIT has not assigned some tag(s) after these several steps, &amp;quot;the word is tagged NN, VB, or JJ [that is, as being three-ways ambiguous], in order that the disambiguation routine may have something to work with&amp;quot; (Greene and Rubin (1971), p. 25).
    After tagging, TAGGIT applies a set of 3300 context frame rules.
    Each rule, when its context is satisfied, has the effect of deleting one or more candidates from the list of possible tags for one word.
    If the number of candidates is reduced to one, disambiguation is considered successful subject to human post-editing.
    Each rule can include a scope of up to two unambiguous words on each side of the ambiguous word to which the rule is be
