   Assumption 1 may not be completely safe even with this restriction, due to the imprecise nature of translation model construction algorithms.
  
  
    The mutual exclusion condition implies that multiple tests must be performed to find the majority of NCCs in a given text.
    Furthermore, Equation 4 allows testing of only two-word NCCs.
    Certainly, longer NCCs exist.
    Given parallel texts E and F, the following algorithm runs multiple NCC tests and allows for recognition of progressively longer NCCs: Fortunately, the objective function in Equations 1 3.
    Induce a base translation model between E is already a summation over source words.
    So, its and F. The algorithm can also be run in &amp;quot;two-sided&amp;quot; mode, so that it looks for NCCs in E and in F on alternate iterations.
    This mode enables the translation model to link NCCs in one language to NCCs in the other.
    In its simplest form, the algorithm only considers adjacent words as candidate NCCs.
    However, function words
