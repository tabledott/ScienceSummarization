t for a noun phrase goal, again through the nonterminal argument identifications included in the chained_ nodes table.
    The rules outlined here are less efficient than they might be because during the distribution of store elements among the subject and complements of a verb no check is performed as to whether the variable bound by a store element actually appears in the semantics of the phrase to which it is being assigned, leading to many dead ends in the generation process.
    Also, the rules are sound for generation but not for analysis, because they do not enforce the constraint that every occurrence of a variable in logical form be outscoped by the variable's binder.
    Adding appropriate side conditions to the rules, following the constraints discussed by Hobbs and Shieber (1987) would not be difficult.
  
  
    The basic semantic-head-driven generation algorithm can be augmented in various ways so as to encompass some important analyses and constraints.
    In particular, we discuss the incorpor
