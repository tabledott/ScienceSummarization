 language.
  It is thus a strictly context-feusitive language.
  Example 2.3 thus illustrates part (e) of Theorem 2.2.
  TAGs have more power than CFGs.
  However, the extra power is quite limited.
  The language L t bag equal number of as, bs a~d cs; however, the ss and bs are mixed in a certain way.
  The Itmguage I~ is similar to Lt, except that as come before all bs.
  TAGs as defined so far are not powerful enough to generate Lt.
  This can be seen as follows.
  Clearly, for any TAG for I.~, each initial tree must contain equal number of as, bs and cs (including sero), sod each auxiliary tree must also contain equal number of as, bs and cs.
  Further in each cue  the as must precede the bs.
  Then it i~ easy to see from the grammar of Example 2.3, that it will not be po~ible to avoid getting the as and bs mixed.
  However, L t can be generated by a TAG with local constraints (see Section 2.1} The so- called copy language.
  -  {wewlw,{~b}"  } also cannot be generated by s TAG, however, again, with local
