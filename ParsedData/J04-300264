ve part-of-speech features, two lexical features, and a paragraph feature were used.
    These results suggested to us that there are clues to subjectivity that might be learned automatically from text and motivated the work reported in the current article.
    The system was tested in 10-fold cross validation experiments using corpus WSJ-SE, a small corpus of only 1,001 sentences.
    As discussed in Section 1, a main goal of our current work is to exploit existing document-level annotations, because they enable us to use much larger data sets, they were created outside our research group, and they allow us to assess consistency of performance by cross-validating between our manual annotations and the existing document-level annotations.
    Because the document-level data are not annotated at the sentence level, sentence-level classification is not highlighted in this article.
    The new sentence annotation study to evaluate sentences with high-density features (Section 4.5) uses different data from WSJ-SE
