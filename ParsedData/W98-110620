s was AutoSlog (Riloff, 1993; Riloff, 1996a), which generates extraction patterns from annotated text.
    The patterns produced by AutoSlog achieved 98% of the performance of hand-crafted extraction patterns, but AutoSlog requires a training corpus that is manually tagged with domain-specific annotations.
    Another early system, PALKA (Kim and Moldovan, 1993), requires domain-specific frames with keyword lists, CRYSTAL (Soderland et al., 1995) requires an annotated training corpus, RAPIER (Calif and Mooney, 1997) requires filled templates, and LIEP (Huffman, 1996) requires keywords and annotated training examples.
    PALKA and CRYSTAL also require semantic lexicons, while LIEP uses domain-specific concept recognizers.
    AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1996b) is a derivative of AutoSlog that was designed to obviate the need for special training data.
    AutoSlog-TS generates extraction patterns using only a &amp;quot;preclassified&amp;quot; training corpus: one set of texts that are relevant to the domain, and one
