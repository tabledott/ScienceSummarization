an action or state to its participants (i.e., who did what to whom).
    In facing the task of automatic acquisition of knowledge about verbs, two basic questions must be addressed: In answering these questions, some approaches to lexical acquisition have focused on learning syntactic information about verbs, by automatically extracting subcategorization frames from a corpus or machine-readable dictionary (Brent 1993; Briscoe and Carroll 1997; Dorr 1997; Lapata 1999; Manning 1993; McCarthy and Korhonen 1998).
    Examples of verbs from the three optionally intransitive classes.
    Unergative The horse raced past the barn.
    The jockey raced the horse past the barn.
    Unaccusative The butter melted in the pan.
    The cook melted the butter in the pan.
    Object-Drop The boy played.
    The boy played soccer.
    Other work has attempted to learn deeper semantic properties such as selectional restrictions (Resnik 1996; Riloff and Schmelzenbach 1998), verbal aspect (Klavans and Chodorow 1992; Siegel 1999)
