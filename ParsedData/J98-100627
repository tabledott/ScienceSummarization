t perfect results on homonyms (95-99%), 72% accuracy for four senses of interest, and 77% on three senses of cone.
    The training was collected in the following manner.
    Take a Roget's category&#8212;his examples were TOOL and ANIMAL&#8212;and collect sentences from a corpus (in this case, Grolier's Encyclopedia) using the words in each category.
    Consider the noun crane, which appears in both the Roget's categories TOOL and ANIMAL.
    To represent the TOOL category, Yarowsky extracted contexts from Gro/ier's Encyclopedia.
    For example, contexts with the words adz, shovel, crane, sickle, and so on.
    Similarly he collected sentences with names of animals from the ANIMAL category.
    In these samples, crane and drill appeared under both categories.
    Yarowsky points out that the resulting noise will be a problem only when one of the spurious senses is salient, dominating the training set, and he uses frequency-based weights to minimize these effects.
    We propose to minimize spurious trainin
