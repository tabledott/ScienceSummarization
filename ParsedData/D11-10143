ed sentiment data and does not require any language-specific sentiment lexica, Sorry, Hugs You Rock Teehee I Understand Wow, Just Wow i walked into a parked car parsers, etc.
    (iii) Rather than limiting sentiment to a positive/negative scale, we predict a multidimensional distribution over several complex, interconnected sentiments.
    We introduce an approach based on semisupervised, recursive autoencoders (RAE) which use as input continuous word vectors.
    Fig.
    1 shows an illustration of the model which learns vector representations of phrases and full sentences as well as their hierarchical structure from unsupervised text.
    We extend our model to also learn a distribution over sentiment labels at each node of the hierarchy.
    We evaluate our approach on several standard datasets where we achieve state-of-the art performance.
    Furthermore, we show results on the recently introduced experience project (EP) dataset (Potts, 2010) that captures a broader spectrum of human sentiments and emoti
