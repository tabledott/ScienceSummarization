  The first study of this system, from the point of view of its formal properties and linguistic applicability, was carried out by Joshi in [Joshi 1985].
  TAGs have been used in providing linguistic analyses; a detailed study of the linguistic relevance was done by Kroch and Joshi in [Kroch et al.
  In this paper, we show lmw TAGs can be embedded in a feature struc- ture based framework.
  Feature structure based Tree Adjoining Grammars (FTAG) are introduced in Section 2, and is f611owed by a comparsion of the descriptive capacity of FTAG and TAG.
  A restricted version of FTAG is proposed and some possible linguistic stipulations are considered.
  In Section 3, we introduce a calculus, which is an extension of the logical calculus of Rounds and Kasper [Rounds et al.
