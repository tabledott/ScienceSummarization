ent disagree with each other makes it difficult for third parties to know what actually happened.)
    However, it is important to keep in mind that achieving good agreement cannot ensure validity: Two observers of the same event may well share the same prejudice while still being objectively wrong.
    It is useful to think of a reliability study as involving a set of items (markables), a set of categories, and a set of coders (annotators) who assign to each item a unique category label.
    The discussions of reliability in the literature often use different notations to express these concepts.
    We introduce a uniform notation, which we hope will make the relations between the different coefficients of agreement clearer.
    Confusion also arises from the use of the letter P, which is used in the literature with at least three distinct interpretations, namely &#8220;proportion,&#8221; &#8220;percent,&#8221; and &#8220;probability.&#8221; We will use the following notation uniformly throughout the article
