    We applied CBC to the TREC-9 and TREC-2002 (Aquaint) newswire collections consisting of over 600 million words.
    CBC generated 1628 noun concepts and these were used as our semantic classes for SPs.
    Secondly, we extracted semantic classes from WordNet 2.1 (Fellbaum 1998).
    In the absence of any externally motivated distinguishing features (for example, the Basic Level categories from Prototype Theory, developed by Eleanor Rosch (1978)), we used the simple but effective method of manually truncating the noun synset hierarchy5 and considering all synsets below each cut point as part of the semantic class at that node.
    To select the cut points, we inspected several different hierarchy levels and found the synsets at a depth of 4 5 Only nouns are considered since DIRT semantic relations connect only nouns. to form the most natural semantic classes.
    Since the noun hierarchy in WordNet has an average depth of 12, our truncation created a set of concepts considerably coarser-grained than Word
