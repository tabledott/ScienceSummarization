			(this will be true if, for example, there is sufficient data that the posterior distribution has a peaked mode): P(x,y, ?, ?) ?
			Q(y, ?, ?) = Q1(y)Q2(?, ?) The calculus of variations is used to minimize theKL divergence between the desired posterior distri bution and the factorized approximation.
			It turnsout that if the likelihood and conjugate prior be long to exponential families then the optimalQ1 andQ2 do too, and there is an EM-like iterative pro cedure that finds locally-optimal model parameters (Bishop, 2006).
			This procedure is especially attrac
