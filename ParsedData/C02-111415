thesaurus generated using Latent Se mantic Indexing (Manning and Schu?tze, 1999, Ch 15), a ?bag-of-words?
			approach, on the samecorpus.
			The same number of nouns was re trieved for each class using the graph model and LSI.
			The LSI similarity thesaurus obtained an accuracy of 31%, much less than the graph model?s 82%.
			This is because LSI retrieves words which are related by context but are not in the same class: for example, the neighbours of piano found using LSI cosine-similarity on the BNC corpus include words such as composer,music, Bach, concerto and dance, which are re lated but certainly not in the same semantic class.The incremental clustering algorithm of Def inition (1) works well at preventing ?infections?
