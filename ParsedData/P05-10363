|s) is the channel model: the probability the long sentence is the expanded version of the short.
    This framework independently models the grammaticality of s (with P(s)) and whether s is a good compression of l (P(l  |s)).
    The K&amp;M model uses parse trees for the sentences.
    These allow it to better determine the probability of the short sentence and to obtain alignments from the training data.
    In the K&amp;M model, the sentence probability is determined by combining a probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) with a word-bigram score.
    The joint rules used to create the compressions are generated by aligning the nodes of the short and long trees in the training data to determine expansion probabilities (P(l  |s)).
    Recall that the channel model tries to find the probability of the long string with respect to the short string.
    It obtains these probabilities by aligning nodes in the parsed parallel training corpus, and counting the nodes that align as &#8220;joint events.&#8221; For
