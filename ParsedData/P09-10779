identifying contrast relations.
    Indeed, word pairs form the basic feature of most previous work on classifying implicit relations (Marcu and Echihabi, 2001; BlairGoldensohn et al., 2007; Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) or the simpler task of predicting which connective should be used to express a relation (Lapata and Lascarides, 2004).
    Semantic relations vs. function word pairs If the hypothesis for word pair triggers of discourse relations were true, the analysis of unambiguous relations can be used to discover pairs of words with causal or contrastive relations holding between them.
    Yet, feature analysis has not been performed in prior studies to establish or refute this possibility.
    At the same time, feature selection is always necessary for word pairs, which are numerous and lead to data sparsity problems.
    Here, we present a meta analysis of the feature selection work in three prior studies.
    One approach for reducing the number of features follows the hypothesis of semantic relatio
