ed model has a two-layer architecture, with a characterbased perceptron as the core combined with other real-valued features such as language models.
    We will describe it in detail in Section 4.
    In this architecture, knowledge sources that are intractable to incorporate into the perceptron, can be easily incorporated into the outside linear model.
    In addition, as these knowledge sources are regarded as separate features, we can train their corresponding models independently with each other.
    This is an interesting approach when the training corpus is large as it reduces the time and space consumption.
    Experiments show that our cascaded model can utilize different knowledge sources effectively and obtain accuracy improvements on both segmentation and Joint S&amp;T.
    2 Segmentation and POS Tagging Given a Chinese character sequence: while the segmentation and POS tagging result can be depicted as: Here, Ci (i = L.n) denotes Chinese character, ti (i = L.m) denotes POS tag, and Cl:r (l &lt; r
