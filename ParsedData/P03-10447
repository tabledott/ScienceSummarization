while achieving maximal recall.
    We briefly mention some of the unsupervised methods for acquiring knowledge for NL understanding, in particular in the context of IE.
    A typical architecture for an IE system includes knowledge bases (KBs), which must be customized when the system is ported to new domains.
    The KBs cover different levels, viz. a lexicon, a semantic conceptual hierarchy, a set of patterns, a set of inference rules, a set of logical representations for objects in the domain.
    Each KB can be expected to be domain-specific, to a greater or lesser degree.
    Among the research that deals with automatic acquisition of knowledge from text, the following are particularly relevant to us.
    (Strzalkowski and Wang, 1996) proposed a method for learning concepts belonging to a given semantic class.
    (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Riloff, 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000) present different combinations of learners of patterns and concept classes specifically for IE.
    In (Riloff, 1996) the system
