    We evaluate this parser on a diverse set of 13 languages using data provided by the CoNLL-X shared-task organizers (Buchholz et al., 2006; Haji&#711;c et al., 2004; Simov et al., 2005; Simov and Osenova, 2003; Chen et al., 2003; B&#168;ohmov&#180;a et al., 2003; Kromann, 2003; van der Beek et al., 2002; Brants et al., 2002; Kawata and Bartels, 2000; Afonso et al., 2002; D&#711;zeroski et al., 2006; Civit Torruella and MartiAntonin, 2002; Nilsson et al., 2005; Oflazer et al., 2003; Atalay et al., 2003).
    The results are promising and show the language independence of our system under the assumption of a labeled dependency corpus in the target language.
    For the remainder of this paper, we denote by x = x1,... xn a sentence with n words and by y a corresponding dependency graph.
    A dependency graph is represented by a set of ordered pairs (i, j) E y in which xj is a dependent and xi is the corresponding head.
    Each edge can be assigned a label l(ij) from a finite set L of pred
