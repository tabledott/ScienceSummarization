r RMSE was used for prediction (scoring) and ranking.
    The contribution of new features was tested by adding them to the baseline features using 5-fold cross-validation.
    Most features did not result in any improvement over the baseline.
    The final submission was a combination of all feature sets that showed improvement.
    SJTU (R, S): The task is treated as a regression problem using the epsilon-SVM method.
    All features are extracted from the official data, involving no external NLP tools/resources.
    Most of them come from the phrase table, decoding data and SMT training data.
    The focus is on special word relations and special phrase patterns, thus several feature templates on this topic are extracted.
    Since the training data is not large enough to assign weights to all features, methods for estimating common strings or sequences of words are used.
    The training data is divided in 3/4 for training and 1/4 for development to filter ineffective features.
    Besides the baseline fe
