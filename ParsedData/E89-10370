  Translation By Structural Correspondences
  
    We sketch and illustrate an approach to machine translation that exploits the potential of simultaneous correspondences between separate levels of linguistic representation, as in the of codescriptions.
    The approach is illustrated with examples from English, German and French where the source and the target language sentence show noteworthy differences in linguistic analysis.
  
  
    In this paper we sketch an approach to machine translation that offers several advantages compared to many of the other strategies currently being pursued.
    We define the relationship between the linguistic structures of the source and target languages in terms of a set of correspondence functions instead of providing derivational or procedural techniques for converting source into target.
    This approach permits the mapping between source and target to depend on information from various levels of linguistic abstraction while still preserving the modularity of linguis
