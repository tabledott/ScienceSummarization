n, in which only the current input source text is considered.
    Adaptation relies on mixture models estimated on the training data through some unsupervised clustering method.
    Given available adaptation data, mixture weights are re-estimated ad-hoc.
    A variation of this approach was also recently proposed in (Finch and Sumita, 2008).
    In (Civera and Juan, 2007) mixture models are instead employed to adapt a word alignment model to in-domain parallel data.
    In (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007) cross-domain adaptation techniques were applied on a phrasebased SMT trained on the Europarl task, in order to translate news commentaries, from French to English.
    In particular, a small portion of indomain bilingual data was exploited to adapt the Europarl language model and translation models by means of linear interpolation techniques.
    Ueffing et al. (2007) proposed several elaborate adaptation methods relying on additional bilingual data synthesized from the development or test set.
