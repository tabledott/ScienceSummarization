r function.
    The mapping is formally defined as follows.
    The above method allows for the tractable estimation of log-linear models on exponentially-many HPSG parse trees.
    However, despite the development of methods to improve HPSG parsing efficiency (Oepen et al., 2002a), the exhaustive parsing of all sentences in a treebank is still expensive.
    Our idea is that we can omit the computation of parse trees with low probabilities in the estimation stage because T(s) can be approximated with parse trees with high probabilities.
    To achieve this, we first prepared a preliminary probabilistic model whose estimation did not require the parsing of a treebank.
    The preliminary model was used to reduce the search space for parsing a training treebank.
    The preliminary model in this study is a unigram model, p(tIs) = FJwEs p(1I w), where w E s is a word in the sentence s, and 1 is a lexical entry assigned to w. This model can be estimated without parsing a treebank.
    Given this model, we restri
