ble output, but often suffer in quality due to an incoherent taxonomy, inability to map arguments to a class (poor lexical coverage), and word sense ambiguity.
    Because of these limitations researchers have investigated non-class based approaches, which attempt to directly classify a given noun-phrase as plausible/implausible for a relation.
    Of these, the similarity based approaches make use of a distributional similarity measure between arguments and evaluate a heuristic scoring function: Erk (2007) showed the advantages of this approach over Resnik&#8217;s information-theoretic classbased method on a pseudo-disambiguation evaluation.
    These methods obtain better lexical coverage, but are unable to obtain any abstract representation of selectional preferences.
    Our solution fits into the general category of generative probabilistic models, which model each relation/argument combination as being generated by a latent class variable.
    These classes are automatically learned from the data.
