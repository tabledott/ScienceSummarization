    The primary distinction is the use of latent semantic analysis (LSA) in formulating the similarity matrix.
    We discovered that (1) LSA is a more accurate measure of similarity than the cosine metric, (2) stemming does not always improve segmentation accuracy and (3) ranking is crucial to cosine but not LSA.
  
  
    A text segmentation algorithm has three main parts.
    First, the input text is divided into elementary blocks.
    Second, a similarity metric identifies blocks that are about the same topic.
    Finally, topic boundaries are discovered by a clustering algorithm.
    An elementary block is the smallest text segment that can describe an entire topic, e.g. sentences (Ponte and Croft, 1997), paragraphs (Yaari, 1997) and arbitrary-sized segments (Hearst, 1994).
    Linguistic theories (Chafe, 1979; Longacre, 1979; Kieras, 1982) and work in information retrieval (Salton et al., 1993; Kaszkiel and Zobel, 1997) suggest a coherent text segment is represented by par
