t of both the main verb and the reduced relative structures being simultaneously available up until the final verb, 5Whether the quantitative values of the predicted reading times can be mapped onto a particular experiment involves taking some position on the oft-observed (Gibson and Sch&#168;utze, 1999) imperfect relationship between corpus frequency and psychological norms. then the effect should disappear when words intervene that cancel the reduced relative interpretation early on.
    To examine this possibility, consider now a different example sentence, this time from the language of grammar (2).
    The probabilities in grammar (2) are estimated from the same sample as before.
    It generates a sentence composed of words actually found in the sample, &#8220;the banker told about the buy-back resigned.&#8221; This sentence exhibits the same reduced relative clause structure as does &#8220;the horse raced past the barn fell.&#8221; Grammar (2) also generates6 the subject relative &#8220;the banker who
