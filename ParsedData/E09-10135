    We discuss our results in Section 6, and conclude in Section 7.
  
  
    Sense induction is typically treated as a clustering problem, where instances of a target word are partitioned into classes by considering their co-occurring contexts.
    Considerable latitude is allowed in selecting and representing the cooccurring contexts.
    Previous methods have used first or second order co-occurrences (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004; Sch&#168;utze, 1998), parts of speech (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), and grammatical relations (Pantel and Lin, 2002; Dorow and Widdows, 2003).
    The size of the context window also varies, it can be a relatively small, such as two words before and after the target word (Gauch and Futrelle, 1993), the sentence within which the target is found (Bordag, 2006), or even larger, such as the 20 surrounding words on either side of the target (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004).
    In essence, each instance of a target word is represented as a feature vector which subsequently serves
