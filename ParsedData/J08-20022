    We also present results on the CoNLL 2005 shared task data set.
    Additionally, we explore considering multiple syntactic analyses to cope with parser noise and uncertainty.
  
  
    Since the release of the FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998) and Propbank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) corpora, there has been a large amount of work on statistical models for semantic role labeling.
    Most of this work relies heavily on local classifiers: ones that decide the semantic role of each phrase independently of the roles of other phrases.
