ntext words that have a large mutual information value with at least one of w1 and w2.
    The mutual information value with the other word may then be large, providing a strong &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot; for similarity, or may be small, providing a strong &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot; against similarity.
    The weight for a specific right context similarity value is defined equivalently.
    Using these weights, we get the weighted average in Figure 2 as the general definition of 41n the case of cooccurrence pairs, a word may be involved in two types of relations, being the left or right argument of the pair.
    The definitions can be easily adopted to cases in which there are more types of relations, such as provided by syntactic parsing.
