Cases D, H, A relation between two conjunctive structures.
    M, and N illustrate this relation.
    Cases A, B, C, and G fall into this category when a pre-conjunct of a posterior CS (Y) is extended to the left to include a prior CS (X), because X is considered to be a modifier in Y's pre-conjunct.2 Case E also falls into the parent&#8212;child category by extending X's post-conjunct to the right to include Y.
    This is because the EB of the extended X (that is, Y's EB) can correspond to X's KB through the EB of the original X (that is, Y's KB).
    Apart from case E, a post-conjunct is not extended to the right.
    Therefore, cases I and J do not come into this relation.
    Incorrect relation (cases I, J, K, L, 0, and P in Figure 9): These relations do not exist in actual sentences and are caused only by incorrect detection of CSs.
    Therefore, a retrial of detecting their scopes is done in the way described in the following section.
