r 1986), Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) relations (Mann and Thompson 1988) or other semantic relations (Polanyi 1988; Hobbs 1979).
    The linguistic structure of Grosz and Sidner's (1986) discourse model consists of multiutterance segments and structural relations among them, yielding a discourse tree structure.
    The hierarchical relations of their linguistic structure are isomorphic with the two other levels of their model, intentional structure and attentional state.
    Rhetorical relations do not play a role in their model.
    In Hobbs (1979) and Polanyi (1988), segmental structure is an artifact of coherence relations among utterances, such as elaboration, evaluation, cause, and so on.
    Their coherence relations are similar to those posited in RST (Mann and Thompson 1988), which informs much work in generation.
    Polanyi (1988) distinguishes among four types of Discourse Constituent Units (DCUs) based on different types of structural relations (e.g., sequence).
    As in Grosz and Sidner's (
