 to t, which will be a passive edge with label X if cri is the last symbol in the right-hand side of the dotted rule; otherwise it will be an active edge with the dot advanced over cri.
    Second, the parsing strategy must place into the chart, at appropriate points, new empty active edges that will be used to combine existing passive edges.
    The exact method used determines whether the parsing method is seen as top-down, bottom-up, or a combination of the two, The Earley parsing algorithm can be seen as a special case of chart parsing in which new empty active edges are introduced top-down and, for all k, the edge combinations involving only the first k nodes are done before any combinations that involve later nodes.
    This particular strategy allows certain simplifications to be made in the general algorithm.
  
  
    We would like to make a few informal observations at this point to clarify the relationship between DCGs and other unification grammar formalisms &#8212; LFG in particular.
