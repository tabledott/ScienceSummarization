 occurrences of swallow and 1 occurrence of crow, and 0 occurrence of all other words, also as part of 100 data for the subject slot of fly.
    In this case, our method would select the model that stops generalizing at bird, swallow, eagle, etc., because the description length for the same subtree now is 86.22 + 3.32 = 89.54 if generalized, and 55.04 + 33.22 = 88.26 if not generalized.
    These examples seem to indicate that our MDL-based method would choose to generalize, even when there are relatively large differences in frequencies of words within a class, but knows enough to stop generalizing when the discrepancy in frequencies is especially noticeable (relative to the given sample size).
  
  
    We applied our generalization method to large corpora and inspected the obtained tree cut models to see if they agreed with human intuition.
    In our experiments, we extracted verbs and their case frame slots (verb, slot _name , slot _value triples) from the tagged texts of the Wall Street Journal corpus (
