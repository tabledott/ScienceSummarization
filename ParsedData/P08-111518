6 evaluation sets (MT05, MT06).
    Experimental results: Word-lattices improve translation quality.
    We used both a phrase-based translation model, decoded using our modified version of Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), and a hierarchical phrase-based translation model, using our modified version of Hiero (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).
    These two translation model types illustrate the applicability of the theoretical contributions presented in Section 2 and Section 3.
    We observed that the coverage of named entities (NEs) in our baseline systems was rather poor.
    Since names in Chinese can be composed of relatively long strings of characters that cannot be translated individually, when generating the segmentation lattices that included cs arcs, we avoided segmenting NEs of type PERSON, as identified using a Chinese NE tagger (Florian et al., 2004).
    The results are summarized in Table 4.
    We see that using word lattices improves BLEU scores both in the phrase-based model and hierarchical model as
