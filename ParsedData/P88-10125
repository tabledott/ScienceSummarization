 interpretation.
    Deciding whether &amp;quot;after lube-oil alarm&amp;quot; modifies the compressor or the disengaging is a problem in syntactic ambiguity resolution.
    The preposition &amp;quot;after&amp;quot; requires an event or condition as its object and this forces us to coerce &amp;quot;lube-oil alarm&amp;quot; into &amp;quot;the sounding of the lube-oil alarm&amp;quot;; this is an example of metonymy resolution.
    We wish to show that solving the first three of these problems amounts to deriving the logical form of the sentence.
    Solving the fourth amounts to deriving the constraints predicates impose on their arguments, allowing for coercions.
    For each of these problems, our approach is to frame a logical expression whose derivation, or proof, constitutes an interpretation.
    Reference: To resolve the reference of &amp;quot;compressor&amp;quot; in sentence (1), we need to prove (constructively) the following logical expression: If, for example, we prove this expression by using axioms
