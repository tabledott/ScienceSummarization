  This is called careful mode, e.g.
  : classical repertoire of heads and modifiers.
  CG syn- tax maps morphological categories and word order information onto syntactic labels.
  The designated syntactic subsets of verb chain elements, head labels, and modifier labels should be established.
  For English, these include e.g.
  : (@w =0 VFIN (-1C TO)) For many constraints it is necessary to require that they do not apply over clause boundaries.
  This clause boundary mode is effected by appending either of the atoms **CLB (ordinary mode) or**CLB- C (careful mode) after the last context condition.
  Clause boundary mode is typically used in conjunc- tion with unbounded contexts.
  A template mechanism is available for expressing partial generalizations.
  E.g., a template "&amp;NP" could be declared to contain the alternatives ((N)), ((A) (N)) ((DET) .
  (N)) ((DET) (A) (N)), etc.
  Then the template &amp;NP could be used in the context parl of any con- straint.
  At run-time all alternative realizations of &
