ions, such as information extraction, can benefit from subjec- tivity analysis by filtering out opinionated sentences (Riloff et al., 2005).
  2 OpinionFinder OpinionFinder runs in two modes, batch and inter- active.
  Document processing is largely the same for both modes.
  In batch mode, OpinionFinder takes a list of documents to process.
  Interactive mode pro- vides a front-end that allows a user to query on-line news sources for documents to process.
  2.1 System Architecture Overview OpinionFinder operates as one large pipeline.

  The second part performs the sub- jectivity analysis.
