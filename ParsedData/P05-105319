 effective on the ACE RDC task.
    Finally, Table 6 shows the distributions of errors.
    It shows that 73% (627/864) of errors results from relation detection and 27% (237/864) of errors results from relation characterization, among which 17.8% (154/864) of errors are from misclassification across relation types and 9.6% (83/864) of errors are from misclassification of relation subtypes inside the same relation types.
    This suggests that relation detection is critical for relation extraction.
  
  
    In this paper, we have presented a feature-based approach for relation extraction where diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge are employed.
    Instead of exploring the full parse tree information directly as previous related work, we incorporate the base phrase chunking information first.
    Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that base phrase chunking contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while further incorporation of the parse tree and dependence tree inf
