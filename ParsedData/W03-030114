el texts are employed.
    Ranked results for all systems are plotted in Figures 2 and 3.
    In the graphs, systems are ordered based on their AER scores.
    System names are preceded by a marker to indicate the system type: L stands for Limited Resources, and U stands for Unlimited Resources.
  
  
    A shared task on word alignment was organized as part of the HLT/NAACL 2003 Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts.
    In this paper, we presented the task definition, and resources involved, and shortly described the participating systems.
    The shared task included Romanian-English and English-French sub-tasks, and drew the participation of seven teams from around the world.
    Comparative evaluations of results led to interesting insights regarding the impact on performance of (1) various alignment algorithms, (2) large or small amounts of training data, and (3) type of resources available.
    Data and evaluation software used in this exercise are available online at http://www.cs.unt.edu/&#73
