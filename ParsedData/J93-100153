might lend some support for the quantity position for Murray's example of imaginable.
    Note that there is plenty of evidence in the larger corpora, but not in the smaller ones.
    Thus, it would appear that &amp;quot;more data are better data,&amp;quot; at least for the purpose of finding exemplars of words like imaginable.
    Similar comments hold for collocation studies, as illustrated in Table 8, which shows mutual information values (Fano 1961; p. 28) for several collocations in a number of different corpora.
    Mutual information compares the probability of observing word x and word y together (the joint probability) to the probability of observing x and y independently (chance).
    Most of the mutual information values in Table 8 are much larger than zero, indicating, as we would hope, that the collocations appear much more often in these corpora than one would expect by chance.
    The probabilities, Pr(x) and Pr(y), are estimated by counting the number of observations of x and y in a corpus, f
