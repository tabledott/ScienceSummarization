  Its basic data structures are typed feature structures.
  The type system encourages an object- oriented approach to linguistic description by providing a multiple inheritance mecha- nism and an inference mechanism which al- lows the specitication of relations between levels o[ linguistic description defined as classes of objects.
  We illustrate this alc- proach starting from a very simple DCG, and show how to make use of the typing sys- tem to enforce general constraints and mod- ularize linguistic descriptions, and how fur- ther abstraction leads to a tlPSG-Iike gram- mar.
