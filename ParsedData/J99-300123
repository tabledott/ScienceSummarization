   The algorithm (which we will refer to as the basic algorithm; Table 3) consists of two steps, which are triggered independently.
    We may illustrate this algorithm by referring to the text fragment in example (2):6 a.
    The sentry was not dead.
    Table 4 gives the centering analysis for this text fragment using the algorithm from Table 3.7 Since (2a) is the first sentence in this fragment, it has no Cb.
    In (2b) and in (2c) the discourse entity SENTRY is referred to by the personal pronoun he.
    Since we assume a Cf ranking by grammatical roles in this example, SENTRY is ranked highest in these sentences (the pronoun always appears in subject position).
    In (2d), the discourse entity MIKE is introduced by a proper name in subject position.
    The pronoun him is resolved to the most highly ranked element of Cf(2c), namely SENTRY.
    Since Mike occupies the subject position, it is ranked higher in the Cf(2d) than SENTRY.
    Therefore the pronoun he in (2e) can be resolved correctly to MIKE.
