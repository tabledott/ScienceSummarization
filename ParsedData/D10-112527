 and non-projective parsing using the dual decomposition approach.
    For Czech data, where nonprojective structures are common, non-projective decoding has clear benefits.
    In contrast, there is little difference in accuracy between projective and nonprojective decoding on English.
  
  
    We have described dual decomposition algorithms for non-projective parsing, which leverage existing dynamic programming and MST algorithms.
    There are a number of possible areas for future work.
    As described in section 7.7, the algorithms can be easily modified to consider projective structures by replacing Y with the set of projective trees, and then using first-order dependency parsing algorithms in place of MST decoding.
    This method could be used to derive parsing algorithms that include higher-order features, as an alternative to specialized dynamic programming algorithms.
    Eisner (2000) describes extensions of head automata to include word senses; we have not discussed this issue in the current pap
