gments and attempt to focus on variety and on minimizing the human annotation cost.
    The corpus contains 2,031 sentence pairs each with a human judgment indicating whether the paraphrase is correct or not.
    To build the corpus, they first stipulate a typology of paraphrastic phenomena (rewriting light-verb constructions, for example) and then manually create a set of morpho-syntactic paraphrasing rules and patterns describing each type of paraphrasing phenomenon.
    A paraphrase generation system using these rules (Fujita et al. 2004) is then applied to a corpus containing Japanese news articles, and example paraphrases are generated for the sentences in the corpus.
    These paraphrase pairs are then handed to two human annotators who create binary judgments for each pair indicating whether or not the paraphrase is correct.
    Using a class-oriented approach is claimed to have a two-fold advantage: The biggest disadvantage of this approach is that only two types of paraphrastic phenomena are used: li
