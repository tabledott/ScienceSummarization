ces predictions that are relatively close to each other, regardless of the independent words that were used to calculate the compositional vectors.
    This has the consequence that the nearest neighbour lists for each model&#8217;s predictions are, by and large, populated by items generated in the same model, as shown in Table 4.
    Neighbours of predictions from the multiplicative model are all multiplicative.
    The additive model has the most varied set of neighbours, but the majority of them are additive-neighbours.
    PLSR shows a mixed behaviour.
    However, PLSR produced neighbours that find their way into the neighbour sets of both the additive model and the observations.
    These remarks point in the same direction: every model is a simplified and specialised version of the original space, somewhat more orderly than the observed data, and may give different results depending on the task at stake.
    PLSR (and to a lesser extent also the multiplicative model) is particularly efficient as genera
