For example, given the NUMBER AGREEMENT feature, which determines whether two NPs agree in number, we can apply the ALL predicate to create a cluster-level feature, which has the value YES if NPk agrees in number with all of the NPs in Cj and NO otherwise.
    Other commonly-used logical predicates for creating cluster-level features include relaxed versions of the ALL predicate, such as MOST, which is true if NPk agrees in number with more than half of the NPs in Cj, and ANY, which is true as long as NPk agrees in number with just one of the NPs in Cj.
    The ability of the entity-mention model to employ cluster-level features makes it more expressive than its mention-pair counterpart.
    Despite its improved expressiveness, the entitymention model has not yielded particularly encouraging results.
    For example, Luo et al. (2004) apply the ANY predicate to generate cluster-level features for their entity-mention model, which does not perform as well as the mention-pair model.
