strict it to English in order to perform evaluations against the human-labeled CELEX database (Baayen, et al., 1993).
  
  
    Existing induction algorithms all focus on identifying prefixes, suffixes, and word stems in inflectional languages (avoiding infixes and other language types like concatenative or agglutinative languages (Sproat, 1992)).
    They also observe high frequency occurrences of some word endings or beginnings, perform statistics thereon, and propose that some of these appendages are valid morphemes.
    However, these algorithms differ in specifics.
    DeJean (1998) uses an approach derived from Harris (1951) where word-splitting occurs if the number of distinct letters that follows a given sequence of characters surpasses a threshold.
    He uses these hypothesized affixes to resegment words and thereby identify additional affixes that were initially overlooked.
    His overall goal is different from ours: he primarily seeks an affix inventory.
