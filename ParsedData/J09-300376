fluencers, including negators and intensifiers, are included.12 Koppel and Schler (2006) demonstrate the importance of neutral examples for document-level classification.
    In this work, we show that being able to correctly identify neutral instances is also very important for phraselevel sentiment analysis.
  
  
    Being able to determine automatically the contextual polarity of words and phrases is an important problem in sentiment analysis.
    In the research presented in this article, we tackle this problem and show that it is much more complex than simply determining whether a word or phrase is positive or negative.
    In our analysis of a corpus with annotations of subjective expressions and their contextual polarity, we find that positive and negative words from a lexicon are used in neutral contexts much more often than they are used in expressions of the opposite polarity.
    The importance of identifying when contextual polarity is neutral is further revealed in our classification experiments
