 targeted the clus- tering of all mentions of an entity across a given document collection rather than the mapping of these mentions to a given reference list of entities.
  A body of work that did employ reference entity lists targeted the resolution of geographic names in 708 text.
  Woodruff and Plaunt (1994) used a list of 80k geographic entities and achieved a disambiguation precision of 75%.
  Kanada (1999) employed a list of 96k entities and reported 96% precision for geo- graphic name disambiguation in Japanese text.
  Smith and Crane (2002) used the Cruchley?s and the Getty thesauri, in conjunction with heuristics inspired from the Nominator work, and obtained between 74% and 93% precision at recall levels of 89-99% on five different history text corpora.
  Overell and R?ger (2006) also employed the Getty thesaurus as reference and used Wikipedia to develop a co-occurrence model and to test their system.
  In many respects, the problem of resolving am- biguous surface forms based on a reference list
