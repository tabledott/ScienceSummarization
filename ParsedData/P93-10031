    A word sequence in Ei is defined here as the correspondence of another sequence in Fi if the words of one sequence are considered to represent the words in the other.
    Single word correspondences have been investigated [Gale and Church, 1991a] using a statistic operating on contingency tables.
    An algorithm for producing collocational correspondences has also been described [Smadja, 1992].
    The algorithm involves several steps.
    English collocations are first extracted from the English side of the corpus.
    Instances of the English collocation are found and the mutual information is calculated betwee
