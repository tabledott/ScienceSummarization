			With only minimal rules, Chinese VSO is wrongly preferred.
			extracted the most probable one (Viterbi) for each sentence pair (based on an automatic alignment produced by GIZA).
			We noticed in general thatViterbi derivations according to C4 make exten sive usage of composed rules, as it is the case inthe example in Figure 4.
			It shows the best deriva tion according to Cm and C4 on the unseen (pi,f,a)triple displayed on the right.
			The second deriva tion (log p = ?11.6) is much more probable than the minimal one (log p = ?17.7
