ing and task structure are necessary for understanding and producing task-oriented dialogue.
    One of the main generalizations of previous work will be to show that discourses are generally in some sense &amp;quot;task-oriented,&amp;quot; but the kinds of &amp;quot;tasks&amp;quot; that can be engaged in are quite varied &#8212; some are physical, some mental, others linguistic.
    Consequently, the term &amp;quot;task&amp;quot; is misleading; we therefore will use the more general terminology of intentions (e.g., when speaking of discourse purposes) for most of what we say.
    Our main thesis is that the structure of any discourse is a composite of three distinct but interacting components: The distinction among these components is essential to an explanation of interruptions (see Section 5), as well as to explanations of the use of certain types of referring expressions (see Section 4.2) and various other expressions that affect discourse segmentation and structure (see Section 6).
