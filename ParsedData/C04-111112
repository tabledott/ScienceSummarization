senta tions for the string b(1, m).
			The algorithm consists of two parts: calculation of the minimal edit dis tance and retrieval of an optimal pattern.
			The minimal edit distance algorithm calculates the number of edit operations (insertions, deletions and replacements) required to change one string to another string.
			The optimal pattern is retrieved by {Phil Donahue,Pat Sajak,Arsenio Hall} N:gen:N talk show 93 11.77 television show 24 11.30 TV show 25 10.45 show 255 9.98 audience 23 7.80 joke 5 7.37 V:subj:N joke 39 7.11 tape 10 7.09 poke 15 6.87 host 40 6.47 co-host 4 6.14 banter 3 6.00 interview 20 5.89 N:appo:N host 127 12.46 comedian 12 11.02 King 13 9.49 star 6 7.47 Figure 1.
