ome of the benefits of full parsing without imposing the strict connectedness requirements that it demands.
    We employ the aforementioned supertaggers to enrich the English side of the parallel training corpus with a single supertag sequence per sentence.
    Then we extract phrase-pairs together with the cooccuring English supertag sequence from this corpus via the same phrase extraction method used in the baseline model.
    This way we directly extend the baseline model described in section 3 with supertags both in the phrase translation table and in the language model.
    Next we define the probabilistic model that accompanies this syntactic enrichment of the baseline model.
    Let 5T represent a supertag sequence of the same length as a target sentence t. Equation (2) changes as follows: The approximations made in this formula are of two kinds: the standard split into components and the search for the most likely joint probability of a target hypothesis and a supertag sequence cooccuring with the so
