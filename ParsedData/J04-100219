 to B in Y is computed as the degree to which the predicates &#945; select for the nodes B in Y, or selection strength(Y, &#945;, B).
    Structure flow in the opposite direction is selection strength(X, &#946;,A).
    The definition of selection strength(Domain, case slots, node cluster) is the average of the selectionalpreference strengths of the predicates in case slots for the nodes in node cluster in Domain.
    The polarity for &#945; and &#946; is the difference in the two quantities.
    If the polarity is near zero, there is not much structure flow and no evidence for a metaphoric mapping.
    In some cases a difference in selectional preferences between domains does not indicate the presence of a metaphor.
    To take a fictitious but illustrative example, say Asymmetric structure transfer between LAB and FINANCE.
    Predicates from LAB that select for liquids are transferred to FINANCE and select for money.
    On the other hand, predicates from FINANCE that select for money are transferred to LAB
