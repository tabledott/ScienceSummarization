  As for pseudo-likelihood: So that maximizing pseudo-likelihood (at large samples) amounts to minimizing the average (over yields) divergence between the true and estimated conditional distributions of analyses given yields.
    Maximum likelihood estimation is consistent: under broad conditions the sequence of distributions Po , associated with the maximum likelihood estimator for 00 given the samples con, converges to Poo.
    Pseudo-likelihood is also consistent, but in the present implementation it is consistent for the conditional distributions Poo (wly(w)) and not necessarily for the full distribution Poo (see Chi (1998)).
    It is not hard to see that pseudo-likelihood will not always correctly estimate Poo.
    Suppose there is a feature L which depends only on yields: f2(w) = fz(y(w)).
    (Later we will refer to such features as pseudo-constant.)
    In this case, the derivative of PLo (1.0 with respect to 0i is zero; PL0(65) contains no information about 0.
    In fact, in this case any value of
