projective, we still see an absolute improve ment of up to 1.1% in overall accuracy over the projective model.
			Furthermore, when we focus on the subset of data that only contains sentences with at least one non-projective dependency, the effect is amplified.
			Another major improvement here isthat the Chu-Liu-Edmonds non-projective MST al gorithm has a parsing complexity of O(n2), versusthe O(n3) complexity of the projective Eisner algo rithm, which in practice leads to improvements in parsing time.
			The results also show that in terms of Accuracy, factored MIRA performs better than single-best MIRA.
			However, for the factored model,we do have O(n2) margin constraints, which re sults in a significant increase in training time over single-best MIRA.
			Furthermore, we can also see that the MST parsers perform favorably compared to the more powerful lexicalized phrase-structure parsers, such as those presented by Collins et al (1999) andZeman (2004) that use expensive O(n5) parsing al gorithms.
