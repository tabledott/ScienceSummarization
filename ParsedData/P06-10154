te instance quality, it remains vulnerable to data sparseness and has the limitation of considering only one-word terms.
    Improving upon (Berland and Charniak 1999), Girju et al. (2006) employ machine learning algorithms and WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) to disambiguate part-of generic patterns like &#8220;X&#8217;s Y&#8221; and &#8220;X of Y&#8221;.
    This study is the first extensive attempt to make use of generic patterns.
    In order to discard incorrect instances, they learn WordNetbased selectional restrictions, like &#8220;X(scene#4)&#8217;s Y(movie#1)&#8221;.
    While making huge grounds on improving precision/recall, heavy supervision is required through manual semantic annotations.
    Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) focus on scaling relation extraction to the Web.
    A simple and effective algorithm is proposed to infer surface patterns from a small set of instance seeds by extracting substrings relating seeds in corpus sentences.
    The approach gives good results on specific relations such as bir
