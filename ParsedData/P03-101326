d if split PPs are used for testing.
    This finding goes some way towards explaining why the parsing performance reported for the Penn Treebank is substantially higher than the results for Negra: the Penn Treebank contains split PPs, which means that there are lot of brackets that are easy to get right.
    The resulting performance figures are not directly comparable to figures obtained on Negra, or other corpora with flat PPs.2 We also obtained a positive result: we demonstrated that a sister-head model outperforms the unlexicalized baseline model (unlike the C&amp;R model and the Collins model in Experiment 1).
    LR was about 1% higher and LP about 4% higher than the baseline if lexical sister-head dependencies are used for all categories.
    This holds both for TnT tags and for perfect tags (compare Tables 2 and 5).
    We also found that using lexical sister-head dependencies for all categories leads to a larger improvement than using them only for NPs or PPs (see Table 5).
    This result was confi
