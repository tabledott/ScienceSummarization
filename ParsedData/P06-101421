dNet senses, based on the Minimum Description Length, is described by Tomuro (2001).
    The clustering is evaluated against WordNet cousins and used for the study of inter-annotator disagreement.
    Another approach exploits the (dis)agreements of human annotators to derive coarse-grained sense clusters (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2003), where sense similarity is computed from confusion matrices.
    Agirre and Lopez (2003) analyze a set of methods to cluster WordNet senses based on the use of confusion matrices from the results of WSD systems, translation equivalences, and topic signatures (word co-occurrences extracted from the web).
    They assess the acquired clusterings against 20 words from the Senseval-2 sense groupings.
    Finally, McCarthy (2006) proposes the use of ranked lists, based on distributionally nearest neighbours, to relate word senses.
    This softer notion of sense relatedness allows to adopt the most appropriate granularity for a specific application.
