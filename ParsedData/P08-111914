    Incorporating a noun phrase chunker would eliminate some of these cases, but far from all of them.
    We concluded that even such a restrictive pattern is not sufficient for semantic class learning on its own.
    In the next section, we present a new approach that creates a Hyponym Pattern Linkage Graph to steer bootstrapping and improve accuracy.
    Intuitively, we expect true class members to occur frequently in pattern contexts with other class members.
    To operationalize this intuition, we create a hyponym pattern linkage graph, which represents the frequencies with which candidate instances generate each other in the pattern contexts.
    We define a hyponym pattern linkage graph (HPLG) as a G = (V, E), where each vertex v &#8712; V is a candidate instance and each edge (u, v) &#8712; E means that instance v was generated by instance u.
    The weight w of an edge is the frequency with which u generated v. For example, consider the following sentence, where the pattern is italicized
