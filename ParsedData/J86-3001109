    That this is so can be seen clearly by considering situations in which the OCP already believes p and is known by the ICP to do so, but does not have a good reason for believing p. This last property of the belief case is not shared by the action case.
    There is an important relationship between the supports relation and the dominance relation that can hold between DP/DSPs; it is captured in the following rule (using the same notation as above): The implication in the forward direction states that if a conversational participant (CPi) believes that the proposition p is supported by the proposition qi, and he intends another participant (CP2) to adopt these beliefs, then his intention that CP2 believe p dominates his intention that CP2 believe qi.
    Viewed intuitively, CPI's belief that q; provides support for p, underlies his intention to get CP2 to believe p by getting him to believe qi.
    The satisfaction of CP, 's intention that CP2 should believe q; will help satisfy CPI's intention that CP2 b
