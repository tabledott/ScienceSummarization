nt fills the role of protagonist.
    Chain learning and clustering is based only on the frequency with which two verbs share arguments, ignoring any features of the arguments themselves.
    Take this example of an actual chain from an article in our training data.
    Given this chain of five events, we want to choose other events most likely to occur in this scenario.
    One of the top scoring event slots is (fly X).
    Narrative chains incorrectly favor (fly X) because it is observed during training with all five event slots, although not frequently with any one of them.
    An event slot like (charge X) is much more plausible, but is unfortunately scored lower by the model.
    Representing the types of the arguments can help solve this problem.
    Few types of arguments are shared between the chain and (fly X).
    However, (charge X) shares many arguments with (accuse X), (search X) and (suspect X) (e.g., criminal and suspect).
    Even more telling is that these arguments are jointly shared (the sa
