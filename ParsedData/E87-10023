some way.
    The pairs that the system as a whole accepts are those are those that are rejected by none of the component transducers, modulo certain assumptions about way in they interact, whose details need not concern us.
    Once again, there is a formal procedure that can be used to combine set transducers that make up such a system 2 into a single automaton with the same overall so that the final result indistinguishable form that obtained from a set of ordered rules.
    However it is an advantage of parallel machines that they can be used with very little loss of efficiency without combining them in this way.
    While it is not the purpose of this paper to explore the formal properties of finite-state transducers, a brief excursion may be in order at this point to forestall a possible objection to the claim that a parallel configuration of transducers can be combined into a single one.
    On the face of it, this cannot generally be so because there is generally no finite-state transducer that will a
