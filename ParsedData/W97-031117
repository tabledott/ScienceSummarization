    I applied the mutual information objective function and its associated predictive value function to a data set consisting of spellings and pronunciations of 17381 English words.
    Table 1 shows the NCCs of English spelling that the algorithm discovered on the first 10 iterations.
    The table reveals some interesting behavior of the algorithm.
    The NCCs &amp;quot;er,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ng&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ow&amp;quot; were validated because this data set represents the sounds usually produced by these letter combinations with one phoneme.
    The NCC &amp;quot;es&amp;quot; most often appears in word-final position, where the &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; is silent.
    However, when &amp;quot;es&amp;quot; is not word-final, the &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; is usually not silent, and the most frequent following letter is &amp;quot;s
