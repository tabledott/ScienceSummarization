    In this section we discuss the tests we ran to arrive at a final configuration of the system.
    The performance of the heuristics discussed in Section 4 was evaluated by comparing the results of the system with the human annotation of the corpus produced during the experiments discussed in Poesio and Vieira (1998).
    Several variants of our heuristics were tried using Corpus 1 as training data; after deciding upon an optimal version, our algorithms were evaluated using Corpus 2 as test data.
    Because our proposals concerning bridging descriptions are much less developed than those concerning anaphoric descriptions and discourse-new descriptions, we ran separate evaluations of two versions of the system: Version 1, which does not attempt to resolve bridging descriptions, and Version 2, which does; we will point out below which version of the system is considered in each evaluation.
    The fact that the annotators working on our corpus did not al
