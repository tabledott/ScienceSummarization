    The algorithms in this paper can be adapted for any synchronous grammar formalism.
    The vehicle for the present guided tour shall be multitext grammar (MTG), which is a generalization of context-free grammar to the synchronous case (Melamed, 2003).
    We shall limit our attention to MTGs in Generalized Chomsky Normal Form (GCNF) (Melamed et al., 2004).
    This normal form allows simpler algorithm descriptions than the normal forms used by Wu (1997) and Melamed (2003).
    In GCNF, every production is either a terminal production or a nonterminal production.
    A nonterminal production might look like this: There are nonterminals on the left-hand side (LHS) and in parentheses on the right-hand side (RHS).
    Each row of the production describes rewriting in a different component text of a multitext.
    In each row, a role template describes the relative order and contiguity of the RHS nonterminals.
    E.g., in the top row, [1,2] indicates that the first nonterminal (A) p
