nal method of evaluating semantic distance between two meanings based merely on the length of the path between the nodes representing them, does not work well in WordNet, because the distance also depends on the depth at which the concepts appear in the hierarchy.
    For example, the root entity is directly followed by the concept of life...farm, while a sedan, a type of a car, is in terms of path more distant from the concept of express_train, although they are both vehicles and therefore closer concepts.
    In the case of verbs, the situation is even more complex, because many verbs do not share the same hierarchy, and therefore there is no direct path between the concepts they represent.
    There have been numerous attempts to defme a measure for semantic distance of WordNet contained concepts [RE95],[K&amp;E96], [SU95], [SU96], etc.
    For our purposes, we have based the semantic distance calculation on a combination of the path distance between two nodes and their depth.
