s stacks and lists.
    We use the notation &#946;c and Ac to refer to the value of &#946; and A, respectively, in a configuration c; we also use |&#946; |to refer to the length of &#946; (i.e., the number of nodes in the buffer) and we use [ ] to denote an empty buffer.
    Let S = (C, T, cs, Ct) be a transition system.
    A transition sequence for a sentence x = (w0, w1, ... , wn) in S is a sequence C0,m = (c0, c1, ... , cm) of configurations, such that The parse assigned to x by C0,m is the dependency graph Gcm = (10,1, ... , n}, Acm ), where Acm is the set of dependency arcs in cm.
    Starting from the initial configuration for the sentence to be parsed, transitions will manipulate &#946; and A (and other available data structures) until a terminal configuration is reached.
    Because the node set V is given by the input sentence itself, the set Acm of dependency arcs in the terminal configuration will determine the output dependency graph Gcm = (V, Acm ).
    The first two conditions state that the bu
