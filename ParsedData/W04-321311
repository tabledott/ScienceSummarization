riate slot class.
    In , the slot component is dropped, and the noun is generalized to the appropriate noun class.
    Although it may seem counterintuitive to drop the slot, this helps us capture generalizations over &#8220;alternations,&#8221; in which the same semantic argument may appear in different syntactic slots (as in The ice melted and The sun melted the ice).
    In , again the noun component is dropped, but in this case the verb is generalized to the appropriate verb class.
    Each type of class is described in the following subsection.
    The last backoff level simply uses the probability of the role given the slot class, .
    The backoff model is summarized in Figure 1.
    We use maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for each of the probability formulas.
    For slots, true generalization to a class only occurs for the prepositional slots, all of which are mapped to a single PP slot class.
    All other slots&#8212; subject, object, and indirect object&#8212;each form their own singleton slot
