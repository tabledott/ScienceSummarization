ily incorporated via the minimum-cut formalism but are not natural inputs for standard Naive Bayes and SVMs.
    Figure 5 shows the effect of adding in proximity information.
    ExtractNB+Prox and ExtractSVM+Prox are the graph-based subjectivity detectors using Naive Bayes and SVMs, respectively, for the individual scores; we depict the best performance achieved by a single setting of the three proximity-related edge-weight parameters over all ten data folds13 (parameter selection was not a focus of the current work).
    The two comparisons we are most interested in are ExtractNB+Prox versus ExtractNB and ExtractSVM+Prox versus ExtractSVM.
    We see that the context-aware graph-based subjectivity detectors tend to create extracts that are more informative (statistically significant so (paired t-test) for SVM subjectivity detectors only), although these extracts are longer than their contextblind counterparts.
    We note that the performance 13Parameters are chosen from T E {1, 2, 3}, f(d) E {1, e1&#8722;d
