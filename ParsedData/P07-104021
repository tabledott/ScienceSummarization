ores on the metric used in tuning are the best on that metric.
    Also, the combination results are better than any single system on all metrics in the case of TER and BLEU tuning.
    However, the METEOR tuning yields extremely high TER and low BLEU scores.
    This must be due to the higher weight on the recall compared to precision in the harmonic mean used to compute the METEOR score.
    Even though METEOR has been shown to be a good metric on a given MT output, tuning to optimize METEOR results in a high insertion rate and low precision.
    The Arabic test set results are shown in Table 2.
    The TER and BLEU optimized combination results beat all single system scores on all metrics.
    The best results on a given metric are again obtained by the combination optimized for the corresponding metric.
    It should be noted that the TER optimized combination has significantly higher BLEU score than the TER optimized baseline.
    Compared to the baseline system which is also optimized for TER, the BLEU
