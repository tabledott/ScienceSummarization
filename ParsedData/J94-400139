s of supplementing the CSs with omitted predicates.
    The conditions for incomplete conjunctive structures are the following (Figure 16c): The key point is that it is important for successful analysis of CSs containing predicate ellipses to detect the correct scope of the incomplete conjunctive structures.
    In most cases their scopes can be detected correctly from a significant similarity between the A predicate ellipsis. pre- and post-conjuncts that contain the case components of the same predicate.
    That is, the detection of a CS based on the similarity measure smoothly leads to the omitted predicate being recovered.
    A method that merely searches for the EB as the most similar bunsetsu for the KB might detect an incorrect scope, and in this case the predicate ellipsis cannot be detected, as shown in Figure 16d.
    When a CS is regarded as an incomplete conjunctive structure, each series of bunsetsus to the left of an FB is analyzed into a dependency tree, and its root node (FB) is connected to
