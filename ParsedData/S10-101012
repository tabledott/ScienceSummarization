val-2 the systems would score better on task C since we added the restriction that the event and time expression had to be syntactically adjacent.
    It is not clear why the results on task C have not improved.
  
  
    In this paper, we described the TempEval-2 task within the SemEval 2010 competition.
    This task involves identifying the temporal relations between events and temporal expressions in text.
    Using a subset of TimeML temporal relations, we show how temporal relations and anchorings can be annotated and identified in six different languages.
    The markup language adopted presents a descriptive framework with which to examine the temporal aspects of natural language information, demonstrating in particular, how tense and temporal information is encoded in specific sentences, and how temporal relations are encoded between events and temporal expressions.
    This work paves the way towards establishing a broad and open standard metadata markup language for natural language texts, examinin
