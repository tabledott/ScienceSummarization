t methods are conceivable, including a more or less sophisticated use of machine learning.
    In the present study, we limit ourselves to an algorithmic approach, using a deterministic breadthfirst search.
    The details of the transformation procedure are slightly different depending on the encoding schemes: d&#8593;h let the linear head be the syntactic head). target arc must have the form wl &#8722;&#8594; wm; if no target arc is found, Head is used as backoff. must have the form wl &#8722;&#8594; wm and no outgoing arcs of the form wm p'&#8595; &#8722;&#8594; wo; no backoff.
    In section 4 we evaluate these transformations with respect to projectivized dependency treebanks, and in section 5 they are applied to parser output.
    Before we turn to the evaluation, however, we need to introduce the data-driven dependency parser used in the latter experiments.
  
  
    In the experiments below, we employ a data-driven deterministic dependency parser producing labeled projective dependency graphs,3 previo
