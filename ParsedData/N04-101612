an be viewed as generation task, as it consists of choosing between alternative surface realizations of a word.
    This choice is typically modeled by confusion sets such as {principal, principle} or {then, than} under the assumption that each word in the set could be mistakenly typed when another word in the set was intended.
    The task is to infer which word in a confusion set is the correct one in a given context.
    This choice can be either syntactic (as for {then, than}) or semantic (as for {principal, principle}).
    A number of machine learning methods have been proposed for context-sensitive spelling correction.
    These include a variety of Bayesian classifiers (Golding, 1995; Golding and Schabes, 1996), decision lists (Golding, 1995) transformation-based learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Jones and Martin, 1997), multiplicative weight update algorithms (Golding and Roth, 1999), and augmented mixture models (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2002).
