le cue phrases spoken by a single speaker, have both practical and theoretical import.
    From a practical point of view, the construction of both text-based and prosodic models permit improvement in the generation of synthetic speech from unrestricted text.
    From our text based model, we know when to convey a discourse or a sentential use of a given cue phrase.
    From our prosodic model, we know how to convey such a distinction.
    These distinctions have in fact been implemented in a new version of the Bell Labs Text-to-Speech System (Sproat, Hirschberg, and Yarowsky 1992).
    From a theoretical point of view, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of cue phrase disambiguation in both text and speech and provide a model for how that disambiguation might be accomplished.
    These results strengthen the claim that the discourse structures crucial to computational models of interaction, in this case, certain lexical indicators of discourse structure, can indeed be identified.
