    In fact, we believe that most of the annotator disagreements were, like this example, between closely related WordNet senses with only subtle (and often inexplicit) distinctions and that more coarse-grained sense distinctions are needed (Palmer et al., 2004).
  
  
    26 systems were submitted by a total of 16 teams.
    The system names, along with email contacts are listed in table 3.
    Two sets of scores were computed for each system.
    For the first set of scores (&amp;quot;With U&amp;quot;), we assumed an answer of U (untaggable) whenever the system failed to provide a sense.
    Thus the instance would be scored as correct if the answer key also marked it as U, and incorrect otherwi
