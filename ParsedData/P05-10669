ish, where reordering rules are acquired automatically.
    The reordering rules in their approach operate at the level of context-free rules in the parse tree.
    Our method differs from that of (Xia and McCord, 2004) in a couple of important respects.
    First, we are considering German, which arguably has more challenging word order phenonema than French.
    German has relatively free word order, in contrast to both English and French: for example, there is considerable flexibility in terms of which phrases can appear in the first position in a clause.
    Second, Xia et. al&#8217;s (2004) use of reordering rules stated at the context-free level differs from ours.
    As one example, in our approach we use a single transformation that moves an infinitival verb to the first position in a verb phrase.
    Xia et. al&#8217;s approach would require learning of a different rule transformation for every production of the form VP =&gt; ....
    In practice the German parser that we are using creates relatively
