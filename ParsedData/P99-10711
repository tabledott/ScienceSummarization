ifferent descriptions of the same event.
    Hundreds of news stories on the same event are produced daily by news agencies.
    Repeated information about the event is a good indicator of its importancy to the event, and can be used for summary generation.
    Most research on single document summarization, particularly for domain independent tasks, uses sentence extraction to produce a summary (Lin and Hovy, 1997; Marcu, 1997; Salton et al., 1991).
    In the case of multidocument summarization of articles about the same event, the original articles can include both similar and contradictory information.
    Extracting all similar sentences would produce a verbose and repetitive summary, while extracting some similar sentences could produce a summary biased towards some sources.
    Instead, we move beyond sentence extraction, using a comparison of extracted similar sentences to select the phrases that should be included in the summary and sentence generation to reformulate them as new text.
