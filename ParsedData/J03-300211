 and for each English URL, applying all possible rules to generate URLs that might appear on the list of pages for the other language.
    If such a URL is found, the pair with similar URLs is added to the list of candidate document pairs.
    For example, suppose an English-Chinese site contains a page with URL (http://mysite.com/english/home en.html), on which one combination of substitutions might produce the URL (http://mysite.com/big5/home ch.html).
    The original page and the produced URL are probably worth considering as a likely candidate pair.
    Owing to the combinatorics (an exponential number of possible substitutions), only a fixed number of substitution combinations can be tried per English URL; however, in Section 4.3 we describe a more scalable URL-matching algorithm.
    Another possible criterion for matching is the use of document lengths.
    Texts that are translations of one another tend to be similar in length, and it is reasonable to assume that for text E in language 1 and text F i
