    Thus, the data for each predicate are statistically representative of the corpus, as are the frequencies of the predicates themselves.
    Annotation takes place with reference to the Penn Treebank trees not only are annotators shown the trees when analyzing a sentence, they are constrained to assign the semantic labels to portions of the sentence corresponding to nodes in the tree.
    Propbank annotators tag all examples of a given verb, regardless of word sense.
    The tagging guidelines for a verb may contain many &amp;quot;rolesets&amp;quot;, corresponding to word sense at a relatively coarsegrained level.
