ive (0%), adjective phrase (1%).
    From the 30.01% lexicalized noun compounds , 18% were proper names.
    This simple analysis leads to the important conclusion that the NP constructions must be treated separately as their semantic content is different.
    This observation is also partially consistent with other recent work in linguistics and computational linguistics on the grammatical variation of the English genitives, noun compounds, and adjective phrases.
    We can draw from here the following conclusions: Given each NP syntactic construction considered, the goal is to develop a procedure for the automatic labeling of the semantic relations they encode.
    The semantic relation derives from the lexical, syntactic, semantic and contextual features of each NP construction.
    Semantic classification of syntactic patterns in general can be formulated as a learning problem, and thus benefit from the theoretical foundation and experience gained with various learning paradigms.
