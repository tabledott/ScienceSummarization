    We have three basic types of auxiliaries.
    The first type is aspect auxiliaries.
    These are treated as raising verbs, and include such elements as iru (roughly, progressive) and aru (roughly, perfective), as can be seen in example 2.
    The other two classes of auxiliaries provide information about perspective or the point of view from which a situation is being described.
    Both classes of auxiliaries add a ni (dative) marked argument to the argument structure of the whole predicate.
    The classes differ in how they relate their arguments to the arguments of the verb.
    One class (including kureru 'give'; see example 3) are treated as subject control verbs.
    The other class (including morau 'receive', see example 4) establishes a control relation between the nimarked argument and the embedded subject.
