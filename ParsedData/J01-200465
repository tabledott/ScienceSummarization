 we varied the base beam factor in trials on the Chelba and Jelinek corpora, keeping the level of conditioning information constant, and Table 6 shows the results across a variety of factors.
    The parser error, parser coverage, and the uninterpolated model perplexity (A = 1) all suffered substantially from a narrower search, but the interpolated perplexity remained quite good even at the extremes.
    Figure 8 plots the percentage increase in parser error, model perplexity, interpolated perplexity, and efficiency (i.e., decrease in rule expansions per word) as the base beam factor decreased.
    Note that the model perplexity and parser accuracy are quite similarly affected, but that the interpolated perplexity remained far below the trigram baseline, even with extremely narrow beams.
  
  
    The empirical results presented above are quite encouraging, and the potential of this kind of approach both for parsing and language modeling seems very promising.
