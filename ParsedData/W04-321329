propriate roles.
  
  
    Using an unsupervised algorithm for semantic role labelling, we have achieved 90% correct on identified arguments, well over an informed baseline of 77%, and have achieved 87% correct on all slots (64% baseline).
    On PP objects, our conservative role assignment shows promise at leaving adjuncts unlabelled.
    However, PP objects also have the lowest performance (of 78% correct on identified arguments, compared to 93% for subjects or objects).
    More work is required on our frame matching approach to determine appropriate roles for PP objects given the specification in the lexicon, which (in the case of VerbNet) often over-constrains the allowable prepositions for a slot.
    Although these results are promising, they are only a first step in demonstrating the potential of the approach.
    We need to test more verbs, from a wider variety of verb classes (or even a different kind of predicate classification, such as FrameNet), to determine the generalizability of our findings.
