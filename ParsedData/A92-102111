   An explicit rule was written to pretag as old as with the proper tags.
    According to the tagging scheme of the Brown Corpus, the first as should be tagged as a qualifier, and the second as a subordinating conjunction.
    In the rule-based tagger, the most common tag for as is subordinating conjunction.
    So initially, the second as is tagged correctly and the first as is tagged incorrectly.
    To remedy this, the system acquires the patch: if the current word is tagged as a subordinating conjunction, and so is the word two positions ahead, then change the tag of the current word to gualifier.6 The rule-based tagger has automatically learned how to properly tag this &amp;quot;idiom.&amp;quot; Regardless of the precise rankings of the various taggers, we have demonstrated that a simple rule-based tagger with very few rules performs on par with stochastic taggers.
    6This was one of the 71 patches acquired by the rule-based tagger.
  
  
    We have presented a simple part of speech tagger which perf
