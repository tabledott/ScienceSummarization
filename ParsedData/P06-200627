mostly double counting a corresponding xcomp relation.
    On the other hand, our ta relation syntactically underspecifies many DepBank adjunct relations.
    Nevertheless, it is possible to see, for instance, that while both parsers perform badly on second objects ours is worse, presumably because of lack of lexical subcategorization information.
  
  
    We have demonstrated that an unlexicalized parser with minimal manual modification for WSJ text &#8211; but no tuning of performance to optimize on this dataset alone, and no use of PTB &#8211; can achieve accuracy competitive with parsers employing lexicalized statistical models trained on PTB.
    We speculate that we achieve these results because our system is engineered to make minimal use of lexical information both in the grammar and in parse ranking, because the grammar has been developed to constrain ambiguity despite this lack of lexical information, and because we can compute the full packed parse forest for all the test sentences efficiently (wi
