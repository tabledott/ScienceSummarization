from English to the Slavic languages.
    However, note that using English alone without a bridge language when translating to the Romance languages still achieves reasonable performance, due to the substantial French and Latinate presence in English vocabulary.
  
  
    Probabilistic string edit distance learning techniques have been studied by Ristad and Yianilos (1998) for use in pronunciation modeling for speech recognition.
    Satta and Henderson (1997) propose a transformation learning method for generic string transduction.
    Brill and Moore (2000) propose an alternative string distance metric and learning algorithm.
    While early statistical machine translation models, such as Brown et al. (1993), did not use any cognate based information to seed their wordto-word translation probabilities, subsequent models (Chen, 1993 and Simard et al., 1992) incorporated some simple deterministic heuristics to increase the translation model probabilities for cognates.
    Other methods have been demonstrated
