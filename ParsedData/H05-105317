			For ex ample, sense 11 of return (a tennis stroke) was notthe first sense in SPORTS, however it did have a rel ative frequency of 19% in that corpus and was absent from BNC and FINANCE.
	
	
			We have run the predominant sense finding algo rithm on the raw text of each of the three corporain turn (the first step being to compute a distribu tional similarity thesaurus for each, as outlined in section 2).
			We evaluate the accuracy of performingWSD purely with the predominant sense heuristic us ing all 9 combinations of training and test corpora.
			The results are presented in Table 2.
