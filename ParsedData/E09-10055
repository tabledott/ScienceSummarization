s on the rank of node i: the more important node i is, the more strength its votes will have.
    Alternatively, PageRank can also be viewed as the result of a random walk process, where the final rank of node i represents the probability of a random walk over the graph ending on node i, at a sufficiently large time.
    Let G be a graph with N vertices vi, ... , vN and di be the outdegree of node i; let M be a In the equation, v is a N &#215; 1 vector whose elements are 1N and c is the so called damping factor, a scalar value between 0 and 1.
    The first term of the sum on the equation models the voting scheme described in the beginning of the section.
    The second term represents, loosely speaking, the probability of a surfer randomly jumping to any node, e.g. without following any paths on the graph.
    The damping factor, usually set in the [0.85..0.95] range, models the way in which these two terms are combined at each step.
    The second term on Eq.
    (1) can also be seen as a smoothing factor t
