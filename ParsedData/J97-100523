in previous work, is a preliminary evaluation of the reliability of our method where we give a conservative lower bound suggesting that the method is reliable.
    The claim has been made that different people (investigators or subjects) are likely to assign similar segment boundaries or segment relations to a discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985; Mann and Thompson 1988), but it has also been observed that discourse structure can be ambiguous (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1987).
    Studies asking subjects to assign topical units to sample discourses have shown that the resulting segments vary widely in both size and location (Rotondo 1984).
    Yet until recently, there has been little attempt to quantify the degree of variability among subjects in performing such a task.
    Here we present the results of our study of naive subjects performing a relatively unstructured segmentation task on a corpus of similar discourses.
    Full details are presented in Passonneau and Litman (1996).
