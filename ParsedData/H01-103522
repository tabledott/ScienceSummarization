rage by type and 99.8% coverage by token.
  A backoff model based on Levenshtein-distance and distributional context similarity handles the relatively small percentage of cases where MProj and MTrie together are not sufficiently confident, bringing the system cov- erage to 100% coverage with a small drop in precision to 97.9% (by type) and 99.8% (by token) on the unrestricted space of in- flected verbs observed in the full French Hansards.
  As shown in Section 7.3, performance is strongly correlated with size of the ini- tial aligned bilingual corpus, with a larger Hansard subset of 12M words yielding 99.4% precision (by type) and 99.9% precision (by token).
  Performance on Czech is discussed in Section 7.3.
