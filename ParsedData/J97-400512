e following stochastic context-free grammar for illustrative purposes.
    Let us call the underlying grammar G1 and the grammar equipped with weights as shown, Mi.
    : The probability of a given tree is computed as the product of probabilities of rules used in it.
    For example: Let x be the tree in Figure 2 and let qi be the probability distribution over trees defined by model M1.
    Then: In parsing, we use the probability distribution qi (x) defined by model M1 to disambiguate: the grammar assigns some set of trees {xi, , x,,} to a sentence a, and we choose that tree xi that has greatest probability qi (x,).
    The issue of efficiently computing the most-probable parse for a given sentence has been thoroughly addressed in the literature.
    The standard parsing techniques can be readily adapted to the random-field models to be discussed below, so I simply refer the reader to the literature.
    Instead, I concentrate on parameter estimation, which, for attribute-value grammars, cannot be accomplish
