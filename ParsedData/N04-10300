	Shallow Semantic Parsing Using Support Vector Machines
		In this paper, we propose a machine learning algorithm for shallow semantic parsing, extend ing the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002),Surdeanu et al (2003) and others.
		Our al gorithm is based on Support Vector Machineswhich we show give an improvement in performance over earlier classifiers.
		We show perfor mance improvements through a number of newfeatures and measure their ability to general ize to a new test set drawn from the AQUAINT corpus.
	
	
			Automatic, accurate and wide-coverage techniques thatcan annotate naturally occurring text with semantic argu ment structure can play a key role in NLP applications such as Information Extraction, Question Answering and Summarization.
			Shallow semantic parsing ? the process of assigning a simple WHO did WHAT to WHOM, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, HOW, etc. structure to sentences in text,is the process of producing such a markup.
			When pre sented with a sentence, a parser should, for each predicatein the sen
