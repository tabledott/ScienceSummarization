ic, we use cosine.
    A cluster may be represented by a cosine similarity matrix where each entry in the matrix is the similarity between the corresponding sentence pair.
    Figure 1 shows a subset of a cluster used in DUC 2004, and the corresponding cosine similarity matrix.
    Sentence ID d s indicates the th sentence in the th document.
    In the following sections, we discuss two methods to compute sentence prestige using this matrix.
    In a cluster of related documents, many of the sentences are expected to be somewhat similar to each other since they are all about the same topic.
    This can be seen in Figure 1 where the majority of the values in the similarity matrix are nonzero.
    Since we are interested in significant similarities, we can eliminate some low values in this matrix by defining a threshold so that the cluster can be viewed as an (undirected) graph, where each sentence of the cluster is a node, and significantly similar sentences are connected to each other.
    Figure 2 shows th
