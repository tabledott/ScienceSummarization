but humans have little trouble even with novel lexical items, and generally speak of &amp;quot;context&amp;quot; when asked to describe how they figure out such words.
    As Ryder and Walker (1982) note, the use of structural analysis based on contextual clues allows speakers to compute syntactic structures even for a text such as Jabberwocky, where lexical information is clearly insufficient.
    The immediate syntactic context severely restricts the likely choices for the grammatical category of each neologism.
    VOLSUNGA can perform much the same task via a minor modification, even if a suffix analysis fails.
    The most obvious solution is simply to assign all tags to the unknown word and find the optimal path through the containing span as usual.
    Since the algorithm is fast, this is not prohibitive.
    Better, one can assign only those tags with a non-minimal probability of being adjacent to the possible tags of neighboring words.
    Precisely calculating the mean number of tags remaining under
