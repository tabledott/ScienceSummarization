rarchical clustering, but we adopt complete linkage because it is conservative in making clusters.
    The distance between clusters is taken to be the distance of the furthest nodes between clusters in complete linkage.
    If most of the NE pairs in the same cluster had words in common, the common words would represent the characterization of the cluster.
    In other words, we can regard the common words as the characterization of a particular relation.
    We simply count the frequency of the common words in all combinations of the NE pairs in the same cluster.
    The frequencies are normalized by the number of combinations.
    The frequent common words in a cluster would become the label of the cluster, i.e. they would become the label of the relation, if the cluster would consist of the NE pairs in the same relation.
  
  
    We experimented with one year of The New York Times (1995) as our corpus to verify our proposed method.
    We determined three parameters for thresholds and identified the patt
