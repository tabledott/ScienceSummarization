    A set of definite clauses forms a program.
    A program defines the relations denoted by the predicates appearing on the head of clauses.
    When using a definite clause interpreter, such as PROLOG [9], a goal statement ?- P. specifies that the relation instances that match P are required.

    A context-free rule like determiner --&gt; [the].
    (where the square brackets mark a terminal) can be translated into determiner(SO,S) connects(SO,the,S). which may be read as &amp;quot;there is a determiner between points SO and S in a string if SO is joined to
