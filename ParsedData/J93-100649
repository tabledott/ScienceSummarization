ively.
    Entries in the array indicate that the sentences are considered to correspond.
    The numbers show how often a particular association is supported, which is essentially equivalent to how many word pairs in the WAT support such an association.
    If there are no such numbers, then no associations have been found for it at this stage.
    For example, the association of English sentence 148 with German sentence 170 is supported by three different word pairs.
    It is already very striking how strongly occupied entries in this table constrain the possible entries in the unoccupied slots.
    Figure 3 shows part of the AST before pass 2.
    This is derived directly from the material illustrated in Figure 2.
    The abscissa gives the English sentence number and in direction of the ordinate the associated German sentences are shown (bullet).
    Those sentence pairs in Figure 2 supported by at least three word pairs, namely those shown on lines 148, 192, 194, and 196, are assumed to be reliable, and
