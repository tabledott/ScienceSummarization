t, we use the neighbours lists and WordNet similarity measures to impose a prevalence ranking on the WordNet senses.
    We believe automatic ranking techniques such as ours will be useful for systems that rely on WordNet, for example those that use it for lexical acquisition or WSD.
    It would be useful however to combine our method of finding predominant senses with one which can automatically find new senses within text and relate these to WordNet synsets, as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) do with unknown nouns.
    We have restricted ourselves to nouns in this work, since this PoS is perhaps most affected by domain.
    We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic, and this method, for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data (McCarthy et al., 2004), although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora.
    The lesk measure can be used when ranking adjectives, and adverbs as well as nouns and verbs (which can also be ranked using jcn).
    Another major advantage that lesk has is
