    The action-effect rule applied to the starting formula yields one of the form BsWA(BsWA(P)), i.e.
    S believes that A wants S to recognize A's intention that P. The inferencing process searches for plausible formulas of the form BsWA(IA(A)) where IA is an illocutionary level act.
    Example 1 shows a direct request to pass the salt, where the surface request maps directly into the intended request interpretation.6 The actions relevant to the examples given here are: Let us also assume that S presently has the salt, i.e.
    HAVE(S,SALT) is true, and mutually believed by S and A.
    The rating heuristics for the complex rules EI.1 to EI.3 are the same as for the PI rules but each heuristic may be applicable several times at different levels.
    For example, consider the frequently recurring inference chain: It shows the line of inference from the point where S recognizes that A requested S to do ACT (at step (2)) to the point where the effects of the requested action are inferred as par
