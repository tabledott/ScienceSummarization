    We used the bracketed corpus of the Penn Treebank (Wall Street Journal corpus) (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) as our data.
    First we randomly selected one of the 26 directories of the WSJ files as the test data and what remains as the training data.

    We used these 10 data sets to conduct cross-validation as described below.
    From the test data in each data set, we extracted (verb, nouni, prep, noun2) quadruples using the extraction tool provided by the Penn Treebank called &amp;quot;tgrep.&amp;quot; At the same time, we obtained the answer for the PP-attachment site for each quadruple.
    We did not double-check if the answers provided in the Penn Treebank were actually correct or not.
    Then from the training data of e
