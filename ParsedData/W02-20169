ope with this problem, Kudo and Matsumoto (2000) introduced a new type of features called dynamic features, which are created dynamically during the parsing process.
    For example, if some relation is determined, this modification relation may have some influence on other dependency relation.
    Therefore, once a segment has been determined to modify another segment, such information is kept in both of the segments and is added to them as a new feature.
    Specifically, we take the following three types of dynamic features in our experiments.
    He her warm heart be moved A.
    The segments which modify the current candidate modifiee.
    (boxes marked with A in Figure 2) B.
    The segments which modify the current candidate modifier.
    (boxes marked with B in Figure 2) C. The segment which is modified by the current candidate modifiee.

    Although any kind of machine learning algorithm can be applied to the cascaded chunking model, we use Support Vector M
