lying appropriate priori &amp;quot;hints.&amp;quot; It should be possible to give different hints for different corpora. effort required to retarget a tagger to new corpora, new tagsets, and new languages should be minimal.
    2 Methodology 2.1 Background Several different approaches have been used for building text taggers.
    Greene and Rubin used a rule-based approach in the TAGGIT program [Greene and Rubin, 1971], which was an aid in tagging the Brown corpus [Francis and KuEera, 1982].
    TAGGIT disambiguated 77% of the corpus; the rest was done manually over a period of several years.
    More recently, Koskenniemi also used a rule-based approach implemented with finite-state machines [Koskenniemi, 1990].
    Statistical methods have also been used (e.g., [DeRose, [Garside al., These provide the capability of resolving ambiguity on the basis of most likely interpretation.
    A form of Markov model has been widely used that assumes that a word depends probabilistically on just its part-of-speech categ
