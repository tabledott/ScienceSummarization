t published results (93.1P/93.5R) by approximately 3%.
    This straightforward comparison, however, is not entirely appropriate.
    Ramshaw &amp; Marcus allow their learning algorithm to access word-level information in addition to part-of-speech tags.
    The treebank approach, on the other hand, makes use only of part-ofspeech tags.
    Table 2 compares Ramshaw &amp; Marcus' (In press) results with and without lexical knowledge.
    The first column reports their performance when using lexical templates; the second when lexical templates are not used; the third again shows the treebank approach using incremental pruning.
    The treebank approach and the R&amp;M approach without lecial templates are shown to perform comparably (-1.1P/+0.2R).
    Lexicalization of our base NP finder will be addressed in Section 4.1.
    Finally, note the relatively small difference between the threshold and incremental pruning methods in Table 1.
    For some applications, this minor drop in performance may be worth the de
