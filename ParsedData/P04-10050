  A TAG-Based Noisy-Channel Model Of Speech Repairs
  
    This paper describes a noisy channel model of speech repairs, which can identify and correct repairs in speech transcripts.
    A syntactic parser is used as the source model, and a novel type of TAG-based transducer is the channel model.
    The use of TAG is motivated by the intuition that the reparandum is a &#8220;rough copy&#8221; of the repair.
    The model is trained and tested on the Switchboard disfluency-annotated corpus.
  
  
    Most spontaneous speech contains disfluencies such as partial words, filled pauses (e.g., &#8220;uh&#8221;, &#8220;um&#8221;, &#8220;huh&#8221;), explicit editing terms (e.g., &#8220;I mean&#8221;), parenthetical asides and repairs.
    Of these repairs pose particularly difficult problems for parsing and related NLP tasks.
    This paper presents an explicit generative model of speech repairs and shows how it can eliminate this kind of disfluency.
    While speech repairs have been studied by psycholinguists fo
