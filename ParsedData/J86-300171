 all the focused elements the backward-looking center is the one that is central in that utterance (i.e., the uttering of the particular sequence of words at that point in the discourse).
    A combination of syntactic, semantic, and discourse information is used to identify the backward-looking center.
    The fact that some entity is the backward-looking center is used to constrain the search for the referent of a pronoun in a subsequent utterance.
    Note that unlike the DSP, which is constant for a segment, the backward-looking center may shift: different entities may become more salient at different points in the segment.
    The presence of both centers and DSPs in this theory leads us to an intriguing conjecture: that &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; is a concept that is used ambiguously for both the DSP of a segment and the center.
    In the literature the concept of &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; has appeared in many guises.
    In syntactic form it is used to describe the preposing of syntactic constituents i
