other, against the alternative hypothesis that the rank of a variable is correlated with the rank of another variable.
    The value of the statistic ranges from &#8212;1, indicating that high ranks of one variable occur with low ranks of the other variable, through 0, indicating no correlation between the variables, to +1, indicating that high ranks of one variable occur with high ranks of the other variable. system, discourse markers are considered unambiguous with respect to the relations that they signal.
    In contrast, our system uses a mathematical model in which this ambiguity is acknowledged and appropriately treated.
    Also, the discourse trees that we build are very constrained structures (see section 2): as a consequence, we do not overgenerate invalid trees as Sumita et al. do.
    Furthermore, we use only surface-based methods for determining the markers and textual units and use clauses as the minimal units of the discourse trees.
    In contrast, Sumita et al. use deep syntactic and semanti
