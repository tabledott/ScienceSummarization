odes connected together by the difference-list threading technique used for standard DCG compilation.
    At that point, terminal strings can be introduced into the string threading and need never be considered further.
    For instance, the previous rule becomes node(sbar/S, IthatIPOI-P) ---&gt; node(s/S, PO-P).
    Throughout, we will alternate between the two encodings, using the standard one for readability and the node encoding as the actual data for grammar interpretation.
    As the latter, more cumbersome, representation is algorithmically generable from the former, no loss of generality ensues from using both.
  
  
    Existing generation algorithms have efficiency or termination problems with respect to certain classes of grammars.
    We review the problems of both top-down and bottom-up regimes in this section.
    Consider a naive top-down generation mechanism that takes as input the semantics to generate from and a corresponding syntactic category and builds a complete tree, top-down, left-to-r
