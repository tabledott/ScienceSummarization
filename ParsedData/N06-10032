tical machine translation made considerable advances in translation quality with the introduction of phrase-based translation (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004).
    By grams, and 4-grams from the Europarl Spanish test sentences for which translations were learned in increasingly large training corpora increasing the size of the basic unit of translation, phrase-based machine translation does away with many of the problems associated with the original word-based formulation of statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993).
    For instance, with multiword units less re-ordering needs to occur since local dependencies are frequently captured.
    For example, common adjective-noun alternations are memorized.
    However, since this linguistic information is not explicitly and generatively encoded in the model, unseen adjective noun pairs may still be handled incorrectly.
    Thus, having observed phrases in the past dramatically increases the chances that they will be translat
