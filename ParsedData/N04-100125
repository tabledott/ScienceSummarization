 mention detection task, we will also present results by using the more established F-measure, computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall &#8211; this measure gives equal importance to all entities, regardless of their type, level or genericity.
    As described in Section 2.6, the mention detection systems make use of a large set of features.
    To better assert the contribution of the different types of features to the final performance, we have grouped them into 4 categories: Table 3 presents the mention detection comparative results, F-measure and ACE value, on Arabic and Chinese data.
    The Arabic and Chinese models were built using the RRM model.
    There are some interesting observations: first, the F-measure performance does not correlate well with an improvement in ACE value &#8211; small improvements in F-measure sometimes are paired with large relative improvements in ACE value, fact due to the different weighting of entity types.
    Second, the largest single improvement in ACE val
