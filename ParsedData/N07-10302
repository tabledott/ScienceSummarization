ng, given that the tasks are codependent.
    The second problem is that most coreference systems make each decision independently of previous ones in a greedy fashion (McCallum and Wellner, 2004).
    Clearly, the determination of membership of a particular mention into a partition should be conditioned on how well it matches the entity as a whole.
    Since independence between decisions is an unwarranted assumption for the task, models that consider a more global context are likely to be more appropriate.
    Recent work has examined such models; Luo et al. (2004) using Bell trees, and McCallum and Wellner (2004) using conditional random fields, and Ng (2005) using rerankers.
    In this paper, we propose to recast the task of coreference resolution as an optimization problem, namely an integer linear programming (ILP) problem.
    This framework has several properties that make it highly suitable for addressing the two aforementioned problems.
    The first is that it can utilize existing classifiers; ILP
