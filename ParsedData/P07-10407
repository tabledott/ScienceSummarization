f unigram matches, is the hypothesis length, is the reference length and is the minimum number of -gram matches that covers the alignment.
    The second term is a fragmentation penalty which penalizes the harmonic mean by a factor of up to when ; i.e., there are no matching -grams higher than .
    By default, METEOR script counts the words that match exactly, and words that match after a simple Porter stemmer.
    Additional matching modules including WordNet stemming and synonymy may also be used.
    When multiple references are provided, the lowest score is reported.
    Full test set scores are obtained by accumulating statistics over all test sentences.
    The METEOR scores are also between and , higher being better.
    The scores in the results section are reported as percentages.
    Translation edit rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) has been proposed as more intuitive evaluation metric since it is based on the rate of edits required to transform the hypothesis into the reference.
    The TER score
