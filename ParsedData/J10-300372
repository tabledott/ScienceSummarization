e with the noisy alignment process.
    Before we continue, we believe it would be useful to draw a connection between Bannard and Callison-Burch&#8217;s (2005) work and that of Wu and Zhou (2003) as discussed in Section 3.2.
    Note that both of these techniques rely on a secondary language to provide the cues for generating paraphrases in the primary language.
    However, Wu and Zhou rely on a pre-compiled bilingual dictionary to discover these cues whereas Bannard and Callison-Burch have an entirely datadriven discovery process.
    In an attempt to address some of the noisy alignment issues, Callison-Burch (2008) recently proposed an improvement that places an additional syntactic constraint on the phrasal paraphrases extracted via the pivot-based method from bilingual corpora and showed that using such a constraint leads to a significant improvement in the quality of the extracted paraphrases.12 The syntactic constraint requires that the extracted paraphrase be of the same syntactic type as the origina
