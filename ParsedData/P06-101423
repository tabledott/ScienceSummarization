clustering on the compatibility of language-specific wordnets.
    Mihalcea and Moldovan (2001) study the structure of In this paper, we presented a study on the construction of a coarse sense inventory for the WordNet lexicon and its effects on unrestricted WSD.
    A key feature in our approach is the use of a well-established dictionary encoding sense hierarchies.
    As remarked in Section 2.2, the method can employ any dictionary with a sufficiently structured inventory of senses, and can thus be applied to reduce the granularity of, e.g., wordnets of other languages.
    One could argue that the adoption of the ODE as a sense inventory for WSD would be a better solution.
    While we are not against this possibility, there are problems that cannot be solved at present: the ODE does not encode semantic relations and is not freely available.
    Also, most of the present research and standard data sets focus on WordNet.
    The fine granularity of the WordNet sense inventory is unsuitable for most applica
