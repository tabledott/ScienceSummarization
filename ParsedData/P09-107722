e first words of Arg1 and Arg2, and the pair of the last words.
    We also add two additional features which indicate the first three words of each argument.
    Modality: Modal words, such as &#8220;can&#8221;, &#8220;should&#8221;, and &#8220;may&#8221;, are often used to express conditional statements (i.e.
    &#8220;If I were a wealthy man, I wouldn&#8217;t have to work hard.&#8221;) thus signaling a Contingency relation.
    We include a feature for the presence or absence of modals in Arg1 and Arg2, features for specific modal words, and their cross-products.
    Context: Some implicit relations appear immediately before or immediately after certain explicit relations far more often than one would expect due to chance (Pitler et al., 2008).
    We define a feature indicating if the immediately preceding (or following) relation was an explicit.
    If it was, we include the connective trigger of the relation and its sense as features.
    We use oracle annotations of the connective sense, however, most
