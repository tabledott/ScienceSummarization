e, the cardinality of the union over the sets of all cost-minimizing paths for all -y c R is then upper-bounded by |1E |1: Proof: The proposition holds for the empty graph as well as for the case that V = Is, tu} with all arcs e c E joining the source and sink node.
    Let G therefore be a larger graph.
    Then we perform an s-t cut and split G into two subgraphs G1 (left subgraph) and G2 (right subgraph).
    Arcs spanning the section boundary are duplicated (with the costs of the copied arcs in G2 being set to zero) and connected with a newly added head or tail node: The zero-cost arcs in G2 that emerged from the duplication process are contracted, which can be done without loss of generality because zero-cost arcs do not affect the total costs of paths in the lattice.
    The contraction essentially amounts to a removal of arcs and is required in order to ensure that the sum of edges in both subgraphs does not exceed the number of edges in G. All nodes in G1 with out-degree zero are then combined into a
