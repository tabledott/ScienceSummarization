tentially suboptimal design decisions.'
    For instance, if we 'We still need to determine the coreference systems to be employed in our framework, however.
    Fortunately, the choice of is flexible, and can be as large as we want subject to the cannot decide whether learner is better to use than learner in a coreference system, we can simply create two copies of the system with one employing and the other , and then add both into our preselected set of coreference systems.
    Generation of multiple candidate partitions.
    Although an exhaustive search for the best partition is not computationally feasible even for a document with a moderate number of NPs, our approach explores a larger portion of the search space than the standard approach via generating multiple hypotheses, making it possible to find a potentially better partition of the NPs under consideration.
    Optimization for clustering-level accuracy via ranking.
    As mentioned above, the standard approach trains and optimizes a coreference c
