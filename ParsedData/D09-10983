does not scale well to web-size term-context matrices.
    Other currently unscalable smoothing techniques include Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (Hofmann 1999), Iterative Scaling (Ando 2000), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al. 2003).
    Randomized Algorithms: Randomized techniques for approximating various similarity measures have been successfully applied to term similarity (Ravichandran et al. 2005; Gorman and Curran 2006).
    Common techniques include Random Indexing based on Sparse Distributed Memory (Kanerva 1993) and Locality Sensitive Hashing (Broder 1997).
    Bayardo et al. (2007) present a sparse matrix optimization strategy capable of efficiently computing the similarity between terms which&#8217;s similarity exceeds a given threshold.
    Rychl&#253; and Kilgarriff (2007), Elsayed et al. (2008) and Agirre et al.
    (2009) use reverse indexing and the MapReduce framework to distribute the similarity computations across several machines.
    Our proposed approach combines these
