   Recall was computed as the number of correct answers divided by the number of frame elements in the test set.
    Overlap was the average overlap of all correct answers.
    The percent Attempted was the number of frame elements generated divided by the number of frame elements in the test set, multiplied by 100.
    If a system returned frame elements not identified in the test set, its precision would be lower.
  
  
    Eight teams submitted 20 runs.
    Three teams submitted runs only for the restricted case (no prior knowledge about frame boundaries).
    The other five 4Hence the problem with an element having (0,0) as the start and end positions. teams submitted at least two runs, with one team submitting 8 runs and another submitting 4 runs.
    Four of these five teams submitted a restricted run and an unrestricted run (frame boundaries were identified, i.e., the task was a classification task of identifying the applicable frame element).
    The results for the classification task are shown in Ta
