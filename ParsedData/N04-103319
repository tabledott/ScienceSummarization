language model, the phrase translation model and the word-based lexicon model.
    The latter two feature functions are used for both directions: p(f|e) and p(e|f).
    Additionally, we use the word and phrase penalty feature functions.
    The model scaling factors are optimized on the development corpus with respect to mWER similar to (Och, 2003).
    We use the Downhill Simplex algorithm from (Press et al., 2002).
    We do not perform the optimization on N-best lists but we retranslate the whole development corpus for each iteration of the optimization algorithm.
    This is feasible because this system is extremely fast.
    It takes only a few seconds to translate the whole development corpus for the Verbmobil task and the Xerox task; for details see Section 8.
    In the experiments, the Downhill Simplex algorithm converged after about 200 iterations.
    This method has the advantage that it is not limited to the model scaling factors as the method described in (Och, 2003).
    It is also possible to
