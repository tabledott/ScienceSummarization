cling) errors per thousand words.
    Not surprisingly, performance deteriorates significantly when the PH model is used to segment the Rocling test files or vice versa.
    Several differences between the corpora influence performance.
    Many English words are included in Rocling, whereas in PH only a few letters are used to repof Wtiti- in the PH corpus.
    Quotation marks also differ: L 1 in Rocling but &amp;quot; &amp;quot; in PH.
    In addition, as is only to be expected in any large collection of natural language, typographical errors occur in both corpora.
    The overall result indicates that our algorithm is robust.
    It performs well so long as the training and testing data come from the same source.
    5.6 Effect of the Amount of Training Data For the Rocling corpus, we experimented with different amounts of training data.
    Four models were trained with successively larger amounts of data, 0.5M, 1M, 1.5M, and 2M words, each training file being an extension of the text in the preceding tra
