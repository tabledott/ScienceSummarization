for computing ambiguity, but inappropriate for constructing trees.
    For example, we observed that prepositional phrases and conjunction are both &amp;quot;every way ambiguous&amp;quot; grammars because their ambiguity coefficients are Catalan numbers.
    However, it is not the case that they generate exactly the same parse trees.
    Nevertheless we present the table lookup pseudoparser here because it seems to be a speculative new approach with considerable promise.
    It is often more efficient than a real parser, and the trees that it finds may be just as useful as the correct one for many practical purposes.
    For example, many speech recognition projects employ a parser to filter out syntactically inappropriate hypotheses.
    However, a full parser is not really necessary for this task; a recognizer such as this table lookup pseudo-parser may be perfectly adequate for this task.
    Furthermore, it is often possible to recover the correct trees from the output of the pseudo-parser.
