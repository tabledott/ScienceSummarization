but we make occasional reference to Model 3, as well.
  
  
    There are three primary motivations for this work.
    First, Collins&#8217; parsing model represents a widely used and cited parsing model.
    As such, if it is not desirable to use it as a black box (it has only recently been made publicly available), then it should be possible to replicate the model in full, providing a necessary consistency among research efforts employing it.
    Careful examination of its intricacies will also allow researchers to deviate from the original model when they think it is warranted and accurately document those deviations, as well as understand the implications of doing so.
    The second motivation is related to the first: science dictates that experiments be replicable, for this is the way we may test and validate them.
    The work described here comes in the wake of several previous efforts to replicate this particular model, but this is the first such effort to provide a faithful and equally well-performin
