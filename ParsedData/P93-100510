uestion? etc.) can be incorporated into the language model.
    The history-based grammar model defines context of a parse tree in terms of the leftmost derivation of the tree.
    Following (5), we show in Figure 1 a contextfree grammar (CFG) for ab n and the parse tree for the sentence aabb.
    The leftmost derivation of the tree T in Figure 1 is: where the rule used to expand the i-th node of the tree is denoted by 7%.
    Note that we have indexed the non-terminal (NT) nodes of the tree with this leftmost order.
    We denote by 2 the sentential form obtained just before we expand node i.
    Hence, t.; corresponds to the sentential form aSB or equivalently to the string 7.17.2.
    In a leftmost derivation we produce the words in left-toright order.
    Using the one-to-one correspondence between leftmost derivations and parse trees, we can rewrite the joint probability in (1) as: p(T, w7) = 11p(ri In a probabilistic context-free grammar (P-CFG), the probability of an expansion at node i depends only on
