 Semantic roles could also act as an important intermediate representation in statistical machine translation or automatic text summarization and in the emerging field of text data mining (TDM) (Hearst 1999).
    Finally, incorporating semantic roles into probabilistic models of language may eventually yield more accurate parsers and better language models for speech recognition.
    This article describes an algorithm for identifying the semantic roles filled by constituents in a sentence.
    We apply statistical techniques that have been successful for the related problems of syntactic parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and word sense disambiguation, including probabilistic parsing and statistical classification.
    Our statistical algorithms are trained on a hand-labeled data set: the FrameNet database (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998; Johnson et al. 2001).
    The FrameNet database defines a tag set of semantic roles called frame elements and included, at the time of our experiments, roughly 50,000 sentenc
