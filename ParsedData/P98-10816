les are applied in sequence to new text.
    Of all the four systems, this one has access to the most information: contextual information (the words and tags in a window spanning three positions before and after the focus word) as well as lexical information (the existence of words formed by suffix/prefix addition/deletion).
    However, the actual use of this information is severely limited in that the individual information items can only be combined according to the patterns laid down in the rule templates.
    The third system uses Memory-Based Learning as described by Daelemans et al. (1996; henceforth tagger M, for Memory).
    During the training phase, cases containing information about the word, the context and the correct tag are stored in memory.
    During tagging, the case most similar to that of the focus word is retrieved from the memory, which is indexed on the basis of the Information Gain of each feature, and the accompanying tag is selected.
    The system used here has access to informatio
