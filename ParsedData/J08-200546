  0.63 an argument; the other classifier is to predict the end (E) of an argument.
  If the product of probabilities of a pair of S and E predictions is larger than a predefined threshold, then this pair is considered as an argument candidate.
  The threshold used here was obtained by using the validation set.
  Both classifiers use very similar features to those used by the argument identifier as explained in Section 3.2, treating the target word as a constituent.
  Particularly, the features are predicate, POS tag of the predicate, voice, context words, POS tags of the context words, chunk pattern, clause relative position, and shallow-path.
  The headword and its POS tag are replaced by the target word and its POS tag.
  The comparison of using the classifiers and the heuristics is shown in Table 7.
  Even without the knowledge of the constituent boundaries, t
