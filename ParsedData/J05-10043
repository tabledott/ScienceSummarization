oles, roles cannot be deterministically added to the treebank by an automatic conversion process with 100% accuracy.
  Our semantic-role annotation process begins with a rule-based automatic tagger, the output of which is then hand- corrected (see section 4 for details).
  The Proposition Bank aims to provide a broad-coverage hand-annotated corpus of such phenomena, enabling the development of better domain-independent language understanding systems and the quantitative study of how and why these syntactic alternations take place.
  We define a set of underlying semantic roles for each verb and annotate each occurrence in the text of the original Penn Treebank.
  Each verb?s roles are numbered, as in the following occurrences of the verb offer from our data: (8) .
