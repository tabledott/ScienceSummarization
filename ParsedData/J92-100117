that the lexicon does not distinguish; cf.
    Janssen [1990].)
    At this time, the lexicon contains about 13,000 senses and 10,000 explicit derivations.
    Each lexical entry provides information about the morphological preferences, sense preferences, and syntactic cues associated with a root, its senses, and their possible derivations.
    An entry also links words to the conceptual hierarchy by naming the conceptual parent of each sense.
    If necessary, an entry can also specify the composition of common phrases, such as collocations, that have the root as their head.
    TRUMP's lexicon combines a core lexicon with dynamic lexicons linked to specialized conceptual domains, collocations, and concretions.
    The core lexicon contains the generic, or context-independent, senses of each word.
    The system considers these senses whenever a word appears in the input.
    The dynamic lexicons contain word senses that normally appear only within a particular context; these senses are considered only when
