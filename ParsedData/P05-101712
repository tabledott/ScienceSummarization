#65533; 0).
    At a low temperature, most of the spins have the same direction (ferromagnetic phase, m =&#65533; 0).
    It is known that at some intermediate temperature, ferromagnetic phase suddenly changes to paramagnetic phase.
    This phenomenon is called phase transition.
    Slightly before the phase transition, spins are locally polarized; strongly connected spins have the same polarity, but not in a global way.
    Intuitively, the state of the lexical network is locally polarized.
    Therefore, we calculate values of m with several different values of Q and select the value just before the phase transition.
    In our model, the semantic orientations of words are determined according to the averages values of the spins.
    Despite the heuristic flavor of this decision rule, it has a theoretical background related to maximizer of posterior marginal (MPM) estimation, or &#8216;finite-temperature decoding&#8217; (Iba, 1999; Marroquin, 1985).
    In MPM, the average is the marginal distribution over
