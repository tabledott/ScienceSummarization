er than all the other corpora; omitting S02, which only ran on CTBo,c the scores for the other systems were uniformly higher on other corpora than they were on CTB, the single exception being S11 which did better on CTBo than on HKo.
    The baseline for CTB is also much lower than the baseline for other corpora, so one might be inclined to ascribe the generally lower performance to the smaller training data for this corpus.
    Also, the OOV rate for this corpus is much higher than all of the other corpora, and since error rates are generally higher on OOV, this is surely a contributing factor.
    However, this would only explain why CTB showed lower performance on the closed test; on the open test, one might expect the size of the training data to matter less, but there were still large differences between several systems&#8217; performance on CTB and their performance on other corpora.
    Note also that the topline for CTB is also lower than for the other corpora.
    What all of this suggests is that th
