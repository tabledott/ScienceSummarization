ave one feature tracking the number of times the lexical entry flights := N : ?x.flights(x) is used in a parse, and similar features for all other members of ?.
			Finally, we introduce new features which directly consider the semantics of a parse.
			For each predicate f seen in training data, we introduce a feature that counts the number of times f is conjoined with itself at some level in the logical form.
			For example, the expression ?x.flight(x) ? from(x, new york) ? from(x, boston) would trigger the new feature for 8In general, applications of the crossed composition rules can be lexically governed, as described in work on Multi-ModalCCG (Baldridge, 2002).
			In the future we would like to incorpo rate more fine-grained lexical distinctions of this type.

			We introduce similar features which track disjunction as opposed to conjunction.
