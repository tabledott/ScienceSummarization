tically significant with p &lt; 0.01 for all languages (paired t-test).
    Row 5 shows the scores with a beam of 80 and the additional graph features.
    Here the LAS scores for Chinese, Czech and German are higher than the best results on the CoNLL 2009 data sets, and the score for English is highly competitive.
    For Chinese, we achieve 78.51 LAS, which is 1.5 percentage points higher than the reference score, while the POS score is 0.54 higher than our baseline.
    For Czech, we get 83.73 LAS, which is by far the highest score reported for this data set, together with state-of-the-art POS accuracy.
    For German, we obtain 89.05 LAS and 97.78 POS, which in both cases is substantially better than in the CoNLL shared task.
    We believe it is also the highest POS accuracy ever reported for a tagger/parser trained only on the Tiger Treebank.
    Row 6, finally, presents results with added cluster features for English and German, which results in additional improvements in all metrics.
