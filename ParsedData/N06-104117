 instance, both JJs and NNs tend to occur after determiners and before nouns.
    The CD and DT confusion is a result of our prototype list not containing a contains-digit prototype for CD, so the predicate fails to be linked to CDs.
    Of course in a realistic, iterative design setting, we could have altered the prototype list to include a contains-digit prototype for CD and corrected this confusion.
    Figure 6 shows the marginal posterior distribution over label pairs (roughly, the bigram transition matrix) according to the treebank labels and the PROTO+SIM model run over the training set (using a collapsed tag set for space).
    Note that the broad structure is recovered to a reasonable degree.
    It is difficult to compare our results to other systems which utilize a full or partial tagging dictionary, since the amount of provided knowledge is substantially different.
    The best comparison is to Smith and Eisner (2005) who use a partial tagging dictionary.
    In order to compare with their results
