he algorithm described in this paper.
    The latter is given the expected number of topic segments for fair comparison with R98.
    Both algorithms used a 11 x 11 ranking mask.
    The first experiment focuses on the impact of our automatic termination strategy on C99(b) (table 6).
    C99(b) is marginally more accurate than C99.
    This indicates our automatic termination strategy is effective but not optimal.
    The minor reduction in speed performance is acceptable.
    The second experiment investigates the effect of different ranking mask size on the performance of C99 (table 7).
    Execution time increases with mask size.
    A 1 x 1 ranking mask reduces all the elements in the rank matrix to zero.
    Interestingly, the increase in ranking mask size beyond 3 x 3 has insignificant effect on segmentation accuracy.
    This suggests the use of extrema for clustering has a greater impact on accuracy than linearising the similarity scores (figure 4).
    Experimental result (table 8) shows our algorith
