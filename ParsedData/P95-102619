    The words used in this evaluation were randomly selected from those previously studied in the literature.

    Columns 6-8 illustrate differences in seed training options.
    Using only two words as seeds does surprisingly well (90.6 %).
    This approach is least successful for senses with a complex concept space, which cannot be adequately represented by single words.
