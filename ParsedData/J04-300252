ore weight it is given.
    The hypothesis behind this treatment is that additional matches represent additional evidence that a PSE instance is subjective.
    This hypothesis is realized as follows: Each match of each member of each type of PSE is considered to be a PSE instance.
    Thus, among them, there are 11 members in PSEinsts for the five phrases sunny, radiant, exhilarating, and splendidly, and is it that, one for each of the matches mentioned above.
    The process in Figure 4 was conducted with the 45 parameter pair values (T and W) chosen from the subjective-element data as described in Section 4.3.
    Table 11 shows results for a subset of the 45 parameters, namely, the most frequent parameter pair chosen from the top three precision intervals for each training set.
    The bottom of the table gives a baseline frequency and a baseline precision in OP1, defined as |PSEinsts| and prec(PSEinsts), respectively, in line 7 of Figure 4.
    The density features result in substantial increases in prec
