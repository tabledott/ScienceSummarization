 be expected from the difference in time complexity.
    But we also see that the projective list-based algorithm, despite having the same worst-case complexity as the non-projective algorithm, in practice behaves like the linear-time algorithms and is in fact slightly faster on average than the arc-eager stack-based algorithm, which in turn outperforms the arc-standard stack-based algorithm.
    This is consistent with the results from oracle parsing reported in Nivre (2006a), which show that, with the constraint of projectivity, the relation between sentence length and number of transitions for the list-based parser can be regarded as linear in practice.
    Comparing the arc-eager and the arc-standard variants of the stack-based algorithm, we find the same kind of pattern as for learning time in that the arc-eager parser is faster for all except a small set of languages: Chinese, Japanese, Slovene, and Turkish.
    Only two of these, Japanese and Slovene, are languages for which learning is also faster wit
