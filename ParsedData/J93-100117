utputs is known, the Markov model is said to be hidden.
    In practice, the Forward&#8212;Backward algorithm is often used to estimate the values of the transition and emission parameters on the basis of corpus evidence.
    See Furui (1989; Appendix D.3, pp.
    343-347) for a brief description of the Forward&#8212;Backward algorithm, and (Rabiner 1989) for a longer tutorial on HMMs.
    The general procedure, of which the Forward&#8212;Backward algorithm is a special case, was first published and shown to converge by Baum (1972).
    The first level of the Raleigh system converted spelling to phonemic base forms, rather like a dictionary; the second level dealt with the problems of allophonic variation mentioned above; the third level modeled the front end.
    At first, the values of the parameters in these HMMs were carefully constructed by hand, but eventually they would all be replaced with estimates obtained by training on real data using statistical estimation procedures such as the Forward&#8212;Bac
