ist, but only one is correct.
    The baseline for this task, choosing words at random, results on average in only 1 correct mapping in the entire lexicon.
    A perfect lexicon, of course, contains 1000 correct entries.
    The starting point for the corpus score is the 15.8% that are already achieved with the seed lexicon from Section 2.1.
    In an experiment where we identified the best lexical entries using a very large parallel corpus, we could achieve 89% accuracy on this test corpus. many correct lexicon entries where added (Entries), and how well the resulting translation lexicon performs compared to the actual wordlevel translations in a parallel corpus (Corpus).
    For all experiments the starting point was the seed lexicon of 1339 identical spelled words described in Section 2.1. which achieve 15.8% Corpus score.
    Taken alone, both the context and spelling clues learn over a hundred lexicon entries correctly.
    The similarity and frequency clues, however, seem to be too imprecise to pinpoint
