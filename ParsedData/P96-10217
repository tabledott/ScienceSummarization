sentence to map to any position i of a length-V English sentence.
    So VT alignments are possible, yielding an exponential space with correspondingly slow search times.
    Note there are no explicit linguistic grammars in the IBM channel model.
    Useful methods do exist for incorporating constraints fed in from other preprocessing modules, and some of these modules do employ linguistic grammars.
    For instance, we previously reported a method for improving search times in channel translation models that exploits bracketing information (Wu and Ng, 1995).
    If any brackets for the Chinese sentence can be supplied as additional input information, produced for example by a preprocessing stage, a modified version of the A*based algorithm can follow the brackets to guide the search heuristically.
    This strategy appears to produces moderate improvements in search speed and slightly better translations.
    Such linguistic-preprocessing techniques could 'Various models have been constructed by the IBM tea
