est results on the LLL challenge were obtained by the group from the University of Edinburgh (Reidel and Klein, 2005), which used Markov Logic, a framework that combines loglinear models and First Order Logic, to create a set of weighted clauses which can classify pairs of gene named entities as genic interactions.
    These clauses are based on chains of syntactic and semantic relations in the parse or Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) of a sentence, respectively.
    Other relevant approaches include those that adopt kernel methods to perform relation extraction.
    Zelenko et al. (2003) describe a relation extraction algorithm that uses a tree kernel defined over a shallow parse tree representation of sentences.
    The approach is vulnerable to unrecoverable parsing errors.
    Culotta and Sorensen (2004) describe a slightly generalized version of this kernel based on dependency trees, in which a bag-ofwords kernel is used to compensate for errors in syntactic analysis.
    A further extension is
