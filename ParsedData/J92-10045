e, and pruning away hypotheses that cannot be completed in any way.
    The natural language component should be able to offer significant additional constraint to the recognizer, beyond what would be available from a local word-pair or bigram4 language model, because it is able to make use of long-distance constraints in requiring well-formed whole sentences.
    This paper describes a natural language system, TINA, which attempts to address some of these issues.
    The mechanisms were designed to support a graceful, seamless interface between syntax and semantics, leading to an efficient mechanism for constraining semantics.
    Grammar rules are written such that they describe syntactic structures at the high levels of a parse tree and semantic structures at the low levels.
    All of the meaning-carrying content of the sentence is completely encoded in the names of the categories of the parse tree, thus obviating the need for separate semantic rules.
    By encoding meaning in the structural entities of
