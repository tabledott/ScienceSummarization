    Note that the substitution process must &#8220;standardize apart&#8221; or renumber indices appropriately in order to avoid accidentally labelling empty nodes inserted by two independent patterns with the same index.
    Pattern matching and substitution can be defined more rigorously using tree automata (G&#180;ecseg and Steinby, 1984), but for reasons of space these definitions are not given here.
    In fact, the actual implementation of pattern matching and substitution used here is considerably more complex than just described.
    It goes to some lengths to handle complex cases such as adjunction and where two or more empty nodes&#8217; paths cross (in these cases the pattern extracted consists of the union of the local trees that constitute the patterns for each of the empty nodes).
    However, given the low frequency of these constructions, there is probably only one case where this extra complexity is justified: viz., the empty compound SBAR subtree shown in Figure 3.
