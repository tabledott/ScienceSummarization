  Noun Classification From Predicate-Argument Structures
  
    A method of determining the similarity of nouns on the basis of a metric derived from the distribution of subject, verb and object in a large text corpus is described.
    The resulting quasi-semantic classification of nouns demonstrates the plausibility of the distributional hypothesis, and has potential application to a variety of tasks, including automatic indexing, resolving nominal compounds, and determining the scope of modification.
  
  
    A variety of linguistic relations apply to sets of semantically similar words.
    For example, modifiers select semantically similar nouns, selectional restrictions are expressed in terms of the semantic class of objects, and semantic type restricts the possibilities for noun compounding.
    Therefore, it is useful to have a classification of words into semantically similar sets.
    Standard approaches to classifying nouns, in terms of an &amp;quot;is-a&amp;quot; hierarchy, have proven hard to app
