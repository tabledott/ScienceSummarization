acy (90.5%) is substantially equal to the SVM performance (88%) obtained in (Hacioglu et al., 2003) with degree 2 and (c) the accuracy on FrameNet (85.2%) is higher than the best result obtained in literature, i.e.
    82.0% in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002).
    This different outcome is due to a different task (we classify different roles) and a different classification algorithm.
    Moreover, we did not use the Frame information which is very important8.
    It is worth noting that the difference between linear and polynomial kernel is about 3-4 percent points for both PropBank and FrameNet.
    This remarkable difference can be easily explained by considering the meaning of standard features.
    For example, let us restrict the classification function CArg0 to the two features Voice and Position.
    Without loss of generality we can assume: (a) Voice=1 if active and 0 if passive, and (b) Position=1 when the argument is after the predicate and 0 otherwise.
    To simplify the example, we also assume that if
