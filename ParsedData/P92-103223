ask is too hard (as Jorgensen's classification task may be), then there will be almost no room between the limits of the measurement and the baseline.
    In other words, there won't be enough dynamic range to measure differences between better systems and worse systems.
    In contrast, if we focus on easier tasks, then we might have enough dynamic range to show some interesting differences.
    Therefore, unlike Jorgensen who was interested in highlighting differences among judgments, we are much more interested in highlighting agreements.
    Fortunately, we have found in (Gale et al., 1992) that the agreement rate can be very high (96.8%), which is well above the baseline, under very different experimental conditions.
    Of course, it is a fairly major step to redefine the problem from a classification task to a discrimination one, as we are proposing.
    One might have preferred not to do so, but we simply don't know how one could establish enough dynamic range in that case to show any interesting diff
