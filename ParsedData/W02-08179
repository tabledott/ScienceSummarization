 be tagged are selected as those instances where there is a disagreement between the labels assigned by two different classifiers.
    The two classifiers are trained on a relatively small corpus of tagged data, which is formed either with (1) Senseval training examples, in the case of Senseval words, or (2) examples obtained with the Open Mind Word Expert system itself, when no other training data is available.
    The first classifier is a Semantic Tagger with Active Feature Selection (STAFS).
    This system (previously known as SMUls) is one of the top ranked systems in the English lexical sample task at SENSEVAL-2.
    The system consists of an instance based learning algorithm improved with a scheme for automatic feature selection.
    It relies on the fact that different sets of features have different effects depending on the ambiguous word considered.
    Rather than creating a general learning model for all polysemous words, STAFS builds a separate feature space for each individual word.
