discourse contexts, a single speaker may make a number of comments regarding a topic.
    It is reasonable to expect that in many settings, the participants in a discussion may be convinced to change their opinions midway through a debate.
    Hence, in the general case we wish to be able to express &#8220;soft&#8221; preferences for all of an author&#8217;s statements to receive the same label, where the strengths of such constraints could, for instance, vary according to the time elapsed between the statements.
    Weighted links are an appropriate means to express such variation.

    This assumption holds by fiat for the ground-truth labels in our dataset because these labels were derived from the single vote cast by the speaker on the bill being discussed.6 We can implement this assumption via links whose weights a
