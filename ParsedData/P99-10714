divided into a training portion and a testing portion.
    We used the training data for identification of paraphrasing rules on which our comparison algorithm is built.
    The system we describe has been fully implemented and tested on a variety of input articles; there are, of course, many open research issues that we are continuing to explore.
    In the following sections, we provide an overview of existing multi-document summarization systems, then we will detail our sentence comparison technique, and describe the sentence generation component.
    We provide examples of generated summaries and conclude with a discussion of evaluation.
  
  
    Automatic summarizers typically identify and extract the most important sentences from an input article.
    A variety of approaches exist for determining the salient sentences in the text: statistical techniques based on word distribution (Salton et a., 1991), symbolic techniques based on discourse structure (Marcu, 1997), and semantic relations between words (
