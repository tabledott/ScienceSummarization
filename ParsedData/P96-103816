, are presented in Table 3.
    Once again, averaged scores of .7 or better for text-and-speech labelings, for both speaking styles, indicate markedly higher inter-labeler reliability than do scores for text-alone labelings, which averaged .51 and .53.
    For purposes of intonational analysis, we take advantage of the high degree of agreement among our discourse labelers and include in each segment boundary class (SBEG, SF, and SCONT) only the phrases whose classification all subjects agreed upon.
    We term these the CONSENSUS-LABELED PHRASES, and compare their features to those of all phrases not in the relevant class (i.e., non-consensuslabeled phrases and consensus-labeled phrases of the other types).
    Note that there were one-third fewer consensus-labeled phrases for text-alone labelings than for text-and-speech (see Table 1).
    We examined the following acoustic and prosodic features of SBEG, SCONT, and SF consensus-labeled phrases: f0 maximum and f0 average;6 rms (energy) maximum and rms average
