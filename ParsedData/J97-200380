-25 illustrate the minimization of string-to-weight transducers using the determinization algorithm.
    The transducer 02 of Figure 23 is obtained from that of Figure 15, IA, by reversing it.
    The application of determinization to 02 results in 03 (Figure 24).
    Notice that since 01 is subsequential, according to the theorem the transducer 03 is minimal too.
    03 is then reversed and determinized (Figure 25).
    The resulting transducer 04 is minimal and equivalent to 01.
    Comparing the transducer 04 to the transducer of Figure 17, Si, we note that both are minimal and realize the same function.
    Si provides output weights as soon as possible; it can be obtained from 04 by pushing.
