  Ac~s DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOOT 1992 Stage 1 consists of two parallel two- level rule systems arranged in a cascade, as illustrated in Section 4.
  In Stage 2, the rules on each level have been intersected to a single transducer.
  Stage 3 shows the composition of the two-level rule systems to a single transducer and Stage 4 repre- sents the final result: a transducer that maps sequences of canonical dictionary forms and morphological categories to the corresponding surface forms, and
