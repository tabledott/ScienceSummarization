 of many supervised NLP tasks (Koo et al., 2008; Turian et al., 2010; T&#228;ckstr&#246;m et al., 2012, inter alia).
    We use a similar approach here to improve tagging performance for online conversational text.
    We also make our induced clusters publicly available in the hope that they will be useful for other NLP tasks in this genre.
    We obtained hierarchical word clusters via Brown clustering (Brown et al., 1992) on a large set of unlabeled tweets.4 The algorithm partitions words into a base set of 1,000 clusters, and induces a hierarchy among those 1,000 clusters with a series of greedy agglomerative merges that heuristically optimize the likelihood of a hidden Markov model with a one-class-per-lexical-type constraint.
    Not only does Brown clustering produce effective features for discriminative models, but its variants are better unsupervised POS taggers than some models developed nearly 20 years later; see comparisons in Blunsom and Cohn (2011).
    The algorithm is attractive for our purpos
