    We analyse the performance of the algorithms on three types of data.
    Two of the samples are those that Hobbs used when developing his algorithm.
    One is an excerpt from a novel and the other a sample of journalistic writing.
    The remaining sample is a set of 5 human-human, keyboard-mediated, task-oriented dialogue
