    Document polarity classification poses a significant challenge to data-driven methods, resisting traditional text-categorization techniques (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002).
    Previous approaches focused on selecting indicative lexical features (e.g., the word &#8220;good&#8221;), classifying a document according to the number of such features that occur anywhere within it.
    In contrast, we propose the following process: (1) label the sentences in the document as either subjective or objective, discarding the latter; and then (2) apply a standard machine-learning classifier to the resulting extract.
    This can prevent the polarity classifier from considering irrelevant or even potentially misl
