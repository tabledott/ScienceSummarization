 links between the words in WordNet to find similarwords, we can identify the paths connecting mem bers of a given semantic category in the dictionary.
			With multiple bootstrapping runs on different seed 4It is consistent with the observation by Kim and Hovy (2004) who noticed that, when positives and neutrals were collapsed into the same category opposed to negatives, the agreement between human annotators rose by 12%.
			5The operationalizations of centrality derived from thenumber of connections between elements can be found in so cial network theory (Burt, 1980) 212lists, we can then produce a measure of the density of such ties.
			The ambiguity measure de rived from inter-annotator disagreement can then be used to validate the results obtained from the density-based method of determining centrality.
			In order to produce a centrality measure, we conducted multiple runs with non-intersecting seed lists drawn from HM.
			The lists of wordsfetched by STEP on different runs partially over lapped, suggest
