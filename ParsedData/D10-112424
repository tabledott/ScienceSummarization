es of K. Of course it is always possible to optimize classification accuracy directly, but such an approach would be incapable of predicting the exact geographical location, which is the focus of our evaluation (given that the desired geographical partition is unknown).
    Note that the geographic topic model is also not trained to optimize classification accuracy.
  
  
    Our model permits analysis of geographical variation in the context of topics that help to clarify the significance of geographically-salient terms.
    Table 2 shows a subset of the results of one randomlyinitialized run, including five hand-chosen topics (of 50 total) and five regions (of 13, as chosen automatically during initialization).
    Terms were selected by log-odds comparison.
    For the base topics we show the ten strongest terms in each topic as compared to the background word distribution.
    For the regional variants, we show terms that are strong both regionally and topically: specifically, we select terms that are in
