 the hierarchy of grammatical roles can serve as an antecedent of a pronoun in Lin, provided that no higher ranked NP in U&#8222;_1 is taken as the antecedent of some other pronoun or definite NP in Un.
    24 An example will serve to illustrate the problem with this approach.
    The display shows you the status of all the printers.
    It also provides options that control printers.
    The (ranked) forward center list for the first sentence is as follows: ( [DISPLAY] [STATUS] [YOU] [PRINTERS] ) .
    Applying the filters and ranking mechanism of Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) yields two possible anchors.25 Each anchor determines a choice of Cb(LI) and the antecedent of it.
    One anchor identifies both with display, whereas the second takes both to be status.
    The hierarchy of grammatical roles is not used to select display over status.
    Nothing in the algorithm rules out the choice of status as the backward center for the second sentence and as the antecedent of it.
    If this selection is
