oring function prefers the (adjective,noun) attachment over the (prep,noun) attachment.
    Moreover, the attachment (jumped,with), while correct, receives a negative score for the bare preposition &#8220;with&#8221; (Fig.
    (1.1) - (1.4) ), and a high score once the verb has its subject and the PP &#8220;with joy&#8221; is built (Fig.
    (1.5) ).
    Ideally, we would like to score easy and reliable attachments higher than harder less likely attachments, thus performing attachments in order of confidence.
    This strategy allows us both to limit the extent of error propagation, and to make use of richer contextual information in the later, harder attachments.
    Unfortunately, this kind of ordering information is not directly encoded in the data.
    We must, therefore, learn how to order the decisions.
    We first describe the learning algorithm (Section 4) and a feature representation (Section 5) which enables us to learn an effective scoring function.
  
  
    We use a linear model score(x) = w&#65
