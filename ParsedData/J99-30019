e general methodological claim for which we have gathered some preliminary, though still not conclusive evidence.
    Based on a reevaluation of centering analyses of some challenging language data that can be found in the literature on centering, we will argue that exchanging grammatical for functional criteria might also be a reasonable strategy for fixed-word-order languages.
    What makes this proposal so attractive is the obvious gain in the generality of the model&#8212;given a functional framework, fixed- and free-word-order languages might be accounted for by the same ordering principles.
    The second major contribution of this paper is related to the unified treatment of different text coherence phenomena.
    It consists of an equally balanced treatment of intersentential (pro)nominal anaphora and inferables (also called functional, bridging, or partial anaphora).
    The latter phenomenon (cf. the examples in the next section and the in-depth treatment in Hahn, Markert, and Strube [1996]) is usu
