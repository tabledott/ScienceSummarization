ribed the anaphoric coreference information and other layers of annotation in the Mention pairs with less than threshold (5) number of different attribute values are considered (22% out of 99% original are discarded) All mention pairs and longer of nested mentions with common head kept OntoNotes corpus, and presented the results from an evaluation on learning such unrestricted entities and events in text.
    The following represent our conclusions on reviewing the results: &#8226; Perhaps the most surprising finding was that the best-performing system (lee) was completely rule-based, rather than trained.
    This suggests that their rule-based approach was able to do a more effective job of combining the multiple sources of evidence than the trained systems.
    The features for coreference prediction are certainly more complex than for many other language processing tasks, which makes it more challenging to generate effective feature combinations.
