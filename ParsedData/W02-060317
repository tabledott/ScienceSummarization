n a sequence.
    However, these morphemes can be thought of as a group that belongs together: e.g.,
  
  
    We wish to evaluate the method quantitatively from the following perspectives: (1) correspondence with linguistic morphemes, (2) efficiency of compression of the data, and (3) computational efficiency.
    The efficiency of compression can be evaluated as the total description length of the corpus and the codebook (the MDL cost function).
    The computational efficiency of the algorithm can be estimated from the running time and memory consumption of the program.
    However, the linguistic evaluation is in general not so straightforward.
    If a corpus with marked morpheme boundaries is available, the linguistic evaluation can be computed as the precision and recall of the segmentation.
    Unfortunately, we did not have such data sets at our disposal, and for Finnish such do not even exist.
    In addition, it is not always clear exactly where the morpheme boundary should be placed.
