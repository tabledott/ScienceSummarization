tion of meaning (the linear map f obtained from the grammatical reduction of the sentence) to be determined by the matrices of the relational words.
    For instance the meaning of the transitive sentence &#8216;sub verb obj&#8217; is: eeeeeeeet &#65533; (et sub verb obj = sub  |te v i)(et w j  |etobj) citjetst itj We take V := W := N and S = N &#174; N, then Eitj citjets t is determined by the matrix of the verb, i.e. substitute it by Eij cij(etn i &#174; ten j)4.
    Hence eeeeeeeet sub verb obj becomes: This can be decomposed to point-wise multiplication of two vectors as follows: 4Note that by doing so we are also reducing the verb space from N &#174; (N &#174; N) &#174; N to N &#174; N, since for our construction we only need tuples of the form _it i &#174; &#65533;&#65533;n i &#174; _nj &#174; _it j which are isomorphic to pairs (&#65533;&#65533;n i &#174; _# j).
    The left argument is the Kronecker product of subject and object vectors and the right argument is the vector of the verb, so we obtain Si
