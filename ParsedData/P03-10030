  A Noisy-Channel Approach To Question Answering
  
    We introduce a probabilistic noisychannel model for question answering and we show how it can be exploited in the context of an end-to-end QA system.
    Our noisy-channel system outperforms a stateof-the-art rule-based QA system that uses similar resources.
    We also show that the model we propose is flexible enough to accommodate within one mathematical framework many QA-specific resources and techniques, which range from the exploitation of WordNet, structured, and semi-structured databases to reasoning, and paraphrasing.
  
  
    Current state-of-the-art Question Answering (QA) systems are extremely complex.
    They contain tens of modules that do everything from information retrieval, sentence parsing (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2002; Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al, 2002), question-type pinpointing (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2002; Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al, 2002), semantic analysis (Xu et al., Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al, 2002), and
