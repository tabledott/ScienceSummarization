e employ features based on automaticallylearned extraction patterns and perform feature in duction on the CRF model.
			We evaluate our hybrid approach using the NRRC corpus (Wiebe et al, 2005), which is manually annotated with direct and indirect opinion source information.
			Experimental results show that theCRF model performs well, and that both the extraction patterns and feature induction produce perfor mance gains.
			The resulting system identifies opinionsources with 79.3% precision and 59.5% recall using a head noun matching measure, and 81.2% pre cision and 60.6% recall using an overlap measure.
	
	
			The goal of information extraction (IE) systems is to extract information about events, including the participants of the events.
			This task goes beyond Named Entity recognition (e.g., Bikel et al (1997))because it requires the recognition of role relationships.
			For example, an IE system that extracts information about corporate acquisitions must distinguish between the company that is doing the
