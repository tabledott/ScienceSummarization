ome of the sentences in the test corpus could not be automatically aligned because our aligner discards sentence pairs that are longer than a pre-defined limit.
    For these sentences, therefore, no attempt could be made at disambiguation.
    Future experiments will attempt to increase the acceptable sentence length, as limited by real memory, and to break longer sentence pairs into logical sub-parts for alignment.
    A second issue that affects recall is the lack of variability in pseudo-translations.
    Of the English nouns that are aligned with sourcelanguage words, approximately 35% are always aligned with the same word, rendering them untaggable using an approach based ort semantic similarity within target sets.
    Some cases may reflect preserved ambiguity in the language pair e.g.
    French interet and English interest are ambiguous in similar ways and others may simply reflect the fact that commercial MT systems are just not very creative or context sensitive in their lexical choices.
