   Hence the sum over the constrained incomplete paths is the sought-after sum over all complete derivations generating the prefix.
    Since string and prefix probabilities are the result of summing derivation probabilities, the goal is to compute these sums efficiently by taking advantage of the Earley control structure.
    This can be accomplished by attaching two probabilistic quantities to each Earley state, as follows.
    The terminology is derived from analogous or similar quantities commonly used in the literature on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Rabiner and Juang 1986) and in Baker (1979).
    The following definitions are relative to an implied input string x. a) The forward probability a, (kX --&gt; A.A) is the sum of the probabilities of all constrained paths of length i that end in state kX b) The inner probability 7,(kX ).p) is the sum of the probabilities of all paths of length i - k that start in state k: kX .Au and end in kX A.p, and generate the input symbols xk &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; x1-1
