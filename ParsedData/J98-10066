amples).
    On the sixsense task, the classifiers averaged 74% correct answers.
    Leacock, Towel!, and Voorhees (1993) found that the response patterns of the three classifiers converged, suggesting that each of the classifiers was extracting as much data as is available in purely topical approaches that look only at word counts from training examples.
    If this is the case, any technique that uses only topical information will not be significantly more accurate than the three classifiers tested.
    Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1996) showed that performance of the content vector topical classifier could be improved with the addition of local templates&#8212; specific word patterns that were recognized as being indicative of a particular sense&#8212; in an extension of an idea initially suggested by Weiss (1973).
    Although the templates proved to be highly reliable when they occurred, all too often, none were found.
    Yarowsky (1993) also found that template-like structures are very powerful indic
