50 (15) labelsfor hashtags (smileys) we have performed a bi nary classification when providing as training/testsets only positive examples of the specific senti ment label together with non-sentiment examples.
			Table 3 shows averaged results for this case and specific results for selected tags.
			We can see thatour framework successfully identifies diverse sentiment types.
			Obviously the results are much bet ter than those of multi-class classification, and the observed &gt; 0.8 precision confirms the usefulnessof the proposed framework for sentiment classifi cation of a variety of different sentiment types.
			We can see that even for binary classification settings, classification of smiley-labeled sentencesis a substantially easier task compared to classifi cation of hashtag-labeled tweets.
			Comparing the contributed performance of different feature typeswe can see that punctuation, word and pattern features, each provide a substantial boost for classi fication quality while we observe only a margina
