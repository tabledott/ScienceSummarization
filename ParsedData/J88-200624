ting of a preparatory phase (prep), a culmination (cul), and a consequent phase (conseq)&#8212;as in Figure 2.
    This tripartite structure permits a uniform account to be given of aspectual types in English and of how the interpretation of temporal adverbials interacts with the interpretation of tense and aspect.
    For example, the coercion of clauses from one interpretation to another is defined in terms of which parts of a nucleus they select and how those parts are described.I2 The ET/RT/ST configuration is significant in that, like Steedman 1982, Dowty 1986, Hinrichs 1986, and Partee 1984, I take RT as the basis for anaphora.
    To indicate this, I single it out as an independent argument to anaphoric functions, here labelled 0.
    In particular, the following schema holds of a clause Cb linked anaphorically to an event Ea through its RT: The relationship between Eb and Ea then falls out as a consequence of 1. the particular ET/RT/ST configuration of Cb; and 2. the particular function 0 involved.
