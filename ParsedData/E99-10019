    (Palmer and Day, 1997) evaluated the performance of such a minimal NE recognition system equipped with name lists derived from muc-6 training texts.
    The system was tested on newswire texts for six languages.
    It achieved a recall rate of about 70% for Chinese, Japanese and Portuguese and about 40% for English and French.
    The precision of the system was not calculated but can be assumed to be quite high because it would only be affected by cases where a capitalized word occurs in more than one list (e.g.
    &amp;quot;Columbia&amp;quot; could occur in the list of organisations as well as locations) or where a capitalised word occurs in a list but could also be something completely different (e.g.
    &amp;quot;Columbia&amp;quot; occurs in the list of locations but could also be the name of a space shuttle).
    We trained a similar minimal system using the muc- 7 training data (200 articles) and ran it on the test data set (100 articles).
