ed reference translations in the target language in order to tune their parameters relative to a translation quality metric.
    However, given the time and cost implications of such a process, most such data sets usually have only a single reference translation.
    Madnani et al. (2007, 2008b) generate sentential paraphrases and use them to expand the available reference translations for such sets so that the machine translation system can learn a better set of system parameters.
  
  
    A problem closely related to, and as important as, generating paraphrases is that of assigning a quantitative measurement to the semantic similarity of two phrases (Fujita and Sato 2008a) or even two given pieces of text (Corley and Mihalcea 2005; Uzuner and Katz 2005).
    A more complex formulation of the task would be to detect or recognize which sentences in the two texts are paraphrases of each other (Brockett and Dolan 2005; Marsi and Krahmer 2005a; Wu 2005; Jo`ao, Das, and Pavel 2007a, 2007b; Das and Smith 2009; Ma
