    As well as the usual NER categories, &#8220;person&#8221;, &#8220;group&#8221;, &#8220;location&#8221;, and &#8220;time&#8221;2, supersenses include categories such as artifacts, which can be fairly frequent, but usually neglected.
    To a greater extent than in standard NER, research in Bio-NER has focused on the adoption of richer ontologies for information extraction.
    Genia (Ohta et al., 2002), for example, is an ontology of 46 classes &#8211; with annotated 2The supersense category &#8220;group&#8221; is rather a superordinate of &#8220;organization&#8221; and has wider scope. corpus &#8211; designed for supporting information extraction in the molecular biology domain.
    In addition, there is growing interest for extracting relations between entities, as a more useful type of IE (
