on of word_align was performed on noisy technical documents, of the type typically available for AT&amp;T Language Line Services.
    We used the English and French versions of a manual of monitoring equipment (about 65,000 words), both scanned by an OCR device.
    We sampled the English vocabulary with frequency between three and 450 occurrences, the same vocabulary that was used for alignment.
    We sampled 100 types from the top fifth by frequency of the vocabulary (quintile), 80 types from the second quintile, 60 from the third, 40 from the fourth, and 20 from the bottom quintile.
    We used this stratified sampling because we wanted to make more accurate statements about our error rate by tokens than we would have obtained from random sampling, or even from equal weighting of the quintiles.
    After choosing the 300 types from the vocabulary list, one token for each type was chosen at random from the corpus.
    By hand, the best corresponding position in the French version was chosen, to be compared
