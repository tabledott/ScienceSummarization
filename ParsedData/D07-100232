 as declarative sentences).
			And secondly, it tends to favor precision over recall, thus re ducing the number of questions for which answers can be found.
			A similar finding is reported in Sun et al.
			(2005) for a PropBank trained parser.
	
	
			In this paper we assess the contribution of semanticrole labeling to open-domain factoid question answering.
			We present a graph-based answer extrac tion model which effectively incorporates FrameNet style role semantic information and show that it achieves promising results.
			Our experiments show that the proposed model can be effectively combined with a syntax-based system to obtain performancesuperior to the latter when used on its own.
			Fur thermore, we demonstrate performance gains over ashallow semantic parser trained on the FrameNet an notated corpus.
			We argue that performance gains are due to the adopted graph-theoretic framework which is robust to coverage and recall problems.We also provide a detailed analysis of the appropriateness of FrameNe
