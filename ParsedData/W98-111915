to anaphora resolution.
    We hoped that the knowledge about the governing constituent would, like gender and animaticity, make a large contribution.
    To our surprise, the improvement is only about 2.2%.
    This is partly because selection restrictions are not clearcut in many cases.
    Also, some head verbs are too general to restrict the selection of any NP.
    Examples are &amp;quot;is&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;has&amp;quot;, which appear frequently in Wall Street Journal: these verbs are not &amp;quot;selective&amp;quot; enough and the a.ssociated probability is not strong enough to rule out erroneous candidates.

    Consequently, we observe a relatively small enhancement to the system.
    The mention information gives the system some idea of the story's focus.
    The more frequently an entity is repeated, the more likely it is to be the topic of the story and thus to be a candidate for pronominalization.
    Our results show that this is ind
