on techniques that are only indirectly measuring what we try to optimize here.
    Unfortunately, (Freitag 2004) does not provide a total PP score for his 200 tags.
    He experiments with an handtagged, clean English corpus we did not have access to (the Penn Treebank).
    Freitag reports a PP for known words of 1.57 for the top 5,000 words (91% corpus coverage, baseline 1 at 23.6), a PP for unknown words without morphological extension of 4.8.
    Using morphological features the unknown PP score is lowered to 4.0.
    When augmenting the lexicon with low frequency words via their distributional characteristics, a PP as low as 2.9 is obtained for the remaining 9% of tokens.
    His methodology, however, does not allow for class ambiguity in the lexicon, the low number of OOV words is handled by a Hidden Markov Model.
  
  
    We presented a graph-based approach to unsupervised POS tagging.
    To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to leave the decision on tag granularity to the tagger.
    We suppor
