  Joint Determination of Anaphoricity and Coreference Resolution using Integer Programming
  
    Standard pairwise coreference resolution systems are subject to errors resulting from their performing anaphora identification as an implicit part of coreference resolution.
    In this paper, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for coreference resolution which models anaphoricity and coreference as a joint task, such that each local model informs the other for the final assignments. joint ILP formulation provides score improvements of 3.7-5.3% over a base coreference classifier on the ACE datasets.
  
  
    The task of coreference resolution involves imposing a partition on a set of entity mentions in a document, where each partition corresponds to some entity in an underlying discourse model.
    Most work treats coreference resolution as a binary classification task in which each decision is made in a pairwise fashion, independently of the others (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Soon et al
