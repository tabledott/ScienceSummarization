  An overview of some of the types of features chosen by the shared task participants, can be found in Table 3.
    All participants used lexical features (words) except for Whitelaw and Patrick (2003) who implemented a character-based method.
    Most of the systems employed part-of-speech tags and two of them have recomputed the English tags with better taggers (Hendrickx and Van den Bosch, 2003; Wu et al., 2003).
    Othographic information, affixes, gazetteers and chunk information were also incorporated in most systems although one group reports that the available chunking information did not help (Wu et al., 2003) Other features were used less frequently.
    Table 3 does not reveal a single feature that would be ideal for named entity recognition.
    Eleven of the sixteen participating teams have attempted to use information other than the training data that was supplied for this shared task.
    All included gazetteers in their systems.
    Four groups examined the usability of unannotated data, eith
