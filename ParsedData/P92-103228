d-senses automatically.
    Consequently, it ought to be possible to use this constraint in our next word-sense tagging algorithm to produce even better performance.
  
  
    We began this discussion with a review of our recent work on word-sense disambiguation, which extends the approach of using massive lexicographic resources (e.g., parallel corpora, dictionaries, thesauruses and encyclopedia) in order to attack the knowledgeacquisition bottleneck that Bar-Hillel identified over thirty years ago.
    After using both the monolingual and bilingual classifiers for a few months, we have convinced ourselves that the performance is remarkably good.
    Nevertheless, we would really like to be able to make a stronger statement, and therefore, we decided to try to develop some more objective evaluation measures.
    A survey of the literature on evaluation failed to identify an attractive role model.
    In addition, we found it particularly difficult to obtain a clear estimate of the state-of-the-art.
