g to find the most likely derivation that includes this prefix.
    With this most likely derivation, we could begin interpretation of a sentence even before the sentence was finished being spoken to a speech recognition system.
    We could even use the Viterbi-n-best semiring to find the n most likely derivations that include this prefix, if we wanted to take into account ambiguities present in parses of the prefix.
    There has been quite a bit of previous work on the intersection of formal language theory and algebra, as described by Kuich (1997), among others.
    This previous work has made heavy use of the fact that there is a strong correspondence between algebraic equations in certain noncommutative semirings, and CFGs.
    This correspondence has made it possible to manipulate algebraic systems, rather than grammar systems, simplifying many operations.
    On the other hand, there is an inherent limit to such an approach, namely a limit to context-free systems.
    It is then perhaps slightly surpr
