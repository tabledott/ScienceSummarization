ed with agreement on polysemy&#8212;that is, the extent to which coders agreed that a word was polysemous in a given context.
    Six naive coders were asked to make this judgment about 600 French words (200 nouns, 200 verbs, 200 adjectives) using the repertoire of senses in the Petit Larousse.
    On this task, a (pairwise) percentage agreement of 0.68 for nouns, 0.74 for verbs, and 0.78 for adjectives was observed, corresponding to K values of 0.36, 0.37, and 0.67, respectively.
    The 20 words from each category perceived by the coders in this first experiment to be most polysemous were then used in a second study, of intercoder agreement on the sense tagging task, which involved six different naive coders.
    Interestingly, the coders in this second experiment were allowed to assign multiple tags to words, although they did not make much use of this possibility; so &#954;w was used to measure agreement.
    In this experiment, V&#180;eronis observed (weighted) pairwise agreement of 0.63 for verbs, 0.71
