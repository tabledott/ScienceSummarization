  referential types, then the total number of inequalities needed is ?M.
  Constraint 7: C-arg arguments.
  This constraint is similar to the reference argument con- straints.
  The difference is that the continued argument arg has to occur before C-arg.
  269 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 Assume that the argument pair is A0 and C-A0, and arguments are sorted by their beginning positions, i.e., if i &lt; k, the position of the beginning of Sjk is not before that of the beginning of Sji .
  The linear inequalities that represent this constraint are: ?m ?
  ujmC-A0 Constraint 8: Illegal argument types.
  Given a specific verb, some argument types should never occur.
  For example, most verbs do not have arguments A5.
  This constraint is represented by summing all the corresponding indicator variables to be 0.
  i=1 uiA5 = 0 Using ILP to solve this inference problem enjoys several advantages.
  Linear con- straints are very general, and are able to represent any Boolean constraint (Gue?ret, Pr
