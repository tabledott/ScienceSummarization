sed on the approach to classification problems described in Freund and Schapire (1999).
    Figure 1 shows the algorithm.
    Note that the most complex step of the method is finding zi = arg maxz&#8712;GEN(x;) 4)(xi, z)&#183; &#945;&#175; &#8211; and this is precisely the decoding problem.
    Thus the training algorithm is in principle a simple part of the parser: any system will need a decoding method, and once the decoding algorithm is implemented the training algorithm is relatively straightforward.
    We will now give a first theorem regarding the convergence of this algorithm.
    First, we need the following definition: Definition 1 Let GEN(xi) = GEN(xi) &#8722; {yi}.
    In other words GEN(xi) is the set of incorrect candidates for an example xi.
    We will say that a training sequence (xi, yi) for i = 1... n is separable with margin S &gt; 0 if there exists some vector U with ||U ||= 1 such that Next, define Ne to be the number of times an error is made by the algorithm in figure 1 &#8211; that is
