63).
    Overviews of NLP research on this theme are (Wilks and Fass 1992), which includes the influential theory of Preference Semantics by Wilks, and more recently (Light and Greiff 2002).
    Rather than venture into learning inferential SPs, much previous work has focused on learning SPs for simpler structures.
    Resnik (1996), the seminal paper on this topic, introduced a statistical model for learning SPs for predicates using an unsupervised method.
    Learning SPs often relies on an underlying set of semantic classes, as in both Resnik&#8217;s and our approach.
    Semantic classes can be specified manually or derived automatically.
    Manual collections of semantic classes include the hierarchies of WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), Levin verb classes (Levin 1993), and FrameNet (Baker et al. 1998).
    Automatic derivation of semantic classes can take a variety of approaches, but often uses corpus methods and the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris 1964) to automatically cluster similar entities into classes
