    Out of the 269 ambiguous Hebrew words, for 96 the bound B. did not pass the threshold, achieving an applicability of 64.3%.
    The remaining 173 examples were distributed according to Table 4.
    For the words that are covered by the TWS' method, the Word Frequencies method has a precision of 71.1% (123/173), whereas the TWS' method has a precision of 85.5%(148/173).
    As can be seen in the table, the TWS' method is correct in almost all the cases it disagrees with the Word Frequencies method (28 out of 31).
    The applicability and precision figures in this experiment are somewhat lower than those achieved for the Hebrew set in our original evaluation of the TWS method (Table 2).
    We attribute this to the fact that the original results were achieved using a parsed corpus, which was about 2.5 times larger and of much higher quality than the one used in the second experiment.
    Yet, the new results give additional support for the usefulness of the TWS method, even for noisy data provided b
