our approach, the disambiguation decision for each (v, n, v') triple was made according to the following procedure: if max psc(c I v, obj) &gt; max psc(c I v', obj) If n has more than one sense, the sense is chosen that maximizes the relevant probability estimate; this explains the maximization over cn(n).
    The probability estimates were obtained using our class-based method, and the G2 statistic was used for the chi-square test.
    This procedure was also used for the MDL alternative, but using the MDL method to estimate the probabilities.
    Using the association score for each test triple, the decision was made according to the following procedure: then choose (v', n) else choose at random We use h(c) to denote the set consisting of the hypernyms of c. The inner maximization is over h(c), assuming c is the chosen sense of n, which corresponds to Resnik&#8217;s method of choosing a set to represent c. The outer maximization is over the senses of n, cn(n), which determines the sense of n by choosing the
