ecords the lexical score of the token-sequence gap 1 to the left of i until the score for 1 &#8212; 1 is smaller than the score for 1 (meaning the top of the peak was found at 1).
    Similarly, for token sequences to the right of i, the program monitors the score of token-sequence r until the score for r + 1 is less than that of r. Finally, score(r) &#8212; score(i) is added to score(1) &#8212; score(i), and the result is the depth score at i.
    A potential problem with this scoring method is illustrated in Figure 4(b).
    Here we see a small valley at gap b4 that can be said to &amp;quot;interrupt&amp;quot; the score for b2.
    As one safeguard, the algorithm uses smoothing (described below) to help eliminate small perturbations of the kind seen at 174.
    Additionally, because the distance between Yb3 and yb4 is small in these kinds of cases, this gap is less likely to be marked as a boundary than gaps like b2, which have large peak distances both to the left and the right.
    This example illustrate
