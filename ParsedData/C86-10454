tegories are functions from one (derived or basic) category to another.
			A derived category that encodes a function from category A to category B might be written B/A if the functor combines with an argument to its right or B~, if it expects the argument to its left.
			Thus, if we assume just two basic categories, N and S, then N/S, S/N, N\S, S\N, (S\N)/N, (N/S\(S\(N/N)), etc. are also categories.
			Not all of these categories will ever occur in the derivation of sentences.
			The set of actually occurring categories depends on the lexical categories of the language.
			Assume the following simple sample grammar: (2) Basic categories: N, S lexical categories: N (Paul, Peter) (S\N)fN (likes) The grammar is used for the sample derivation in (3): (3) Peter likes Paul N (S\N)fin N SkN S It should be clear from my brief description that the defining characteristics of unification grammar have nothing to do with the ones of categorial grammar.
			We will see that the properties of both grammar types actually co
