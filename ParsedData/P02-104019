consecutive systems and the 95% confidence interval about the mean.
    We see that S2 is quite a bit better than S1 (by a mean opinion score difference of 0.326 on the 5-point scale), while S3 is judged a little better (by 0.114).
    Both differences are significant at the 95% level.7 The human H1 is much better than the best system, though a bit worse than human H2.
    This is not surprising given that H1 is not a native speaker of either Chinese or English, whereas H2 is a native English speaker.
    Again, the difference between the human translators is significant beyond the 95% level.
    5 BLEU vs The Human Evaluation Figure 5 shows a linear regression of the monolingual group scores as a function of the BLEU score over two reference translations for the 5 systems.
    The high correlation coefficient of 0.99 indicates that BLEU tracks human judgment well.
    Particularly interesting is how well BLEU distinguishes between S2 and S3 which are quite close.
