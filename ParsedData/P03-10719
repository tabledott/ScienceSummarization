ed in the text, t1 ... t,,, the corresponding terms, L1 ... L,,, their respective lengths,4 and L the length of the text, the adapted metric is expressed as follows, combining frequency (freq(ti)) of a term ti and the compactness of its underlying chain: 3The latter parameter might seem controversial at first, and one might assume that longer chains should receive a higher score.
    However we point out that in a linear model of discourse, chains that almost span the entire text are barely indicative of any structure (assuming boundaries are only hypothesized where chains start and end).
    4All lengths are expressed in number of sentences.
    In the second part of the algorithm, we combine information from all term repetitions to compute a lexical cohesion score at each sentence break (or, in the case of spoken conversations, speaker turn break).
    This step of our algorithm is very similar in spirit to TextTiling (Hearst, 1994).
    The idea is to work with two adjacent analysis windows, each of fixed
