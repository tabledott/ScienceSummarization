regardless of the different classes are semantically related.
  A syntactic signature for a verb, by definition, is the union of the frames extracted from every example sentence for each verb.
  The outline of the verb-based experiment is as follows: 1.
  Automatically extract syntactic information from the example sentences.
  Group the verbs according to their syntactic signature.
  Determine where the two ways of grouping verbs over- lap: (a) the semantic lassification given by Levin.
  (1)) the syntactic classification based on the derived syntactic signatures.
  To return to the Change of State verbs, we now con- sider the syntactic signature of the verb break, rather than the signature of the semantic lass as a unit.
  The verb break belongs not only to the Change of State class, but also four other classes: 10.6 Cheat, 23.2 Split, 40.8.3 Hurl, and 48.1.1 Appear.
  Each of these classes is characterized syntactically with a set of sentences.
  The union of the syntactic patterns corresponding to these s
