e previous copy.
    We say that a word token is in a rough copy iff it appears in either the source or the free final.4 (2) is an example of a rough copy. ish the work Table 1 lists the conditioning variables used in our classifier.
    In that table, subscript integers refer to the relative position of word tokens relative to the current word; e.g.
    T1 is the POS tag of the following word.
    The subscript f refers to the tag of the first word of the free final match.
    If a variable is not defined for a particular word it is given the special value &#8216;NULL&#8217;; e.g., if a word is not in a rough copy then variables such as Nm, Nu, Ni, Nl, Nr and Tf all take the value NULL.
    Flags are booleanvalued variables, while numeric-valued variables are bounded to a value between 0 and 4 (as well as NULL, if appropriate).
    The three variables Ct, Cw and Ti are intended to help the classifier capture very short restarts or repairs that may not involve a rough copy.
    The flags Ct and Ci indicate wh
