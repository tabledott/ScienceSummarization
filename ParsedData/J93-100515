r nouns or verbs, for instance, reflecting a default preference with of for noun attachment.
    We can estimate these probabilities from the table of co-occurrence counts as:4 The LA score has several useful properties.
    The sign indicates which possibility, verb attachment or noun attachment, is more likely; an LA score of zero means they are equally likely.
    The magnitude of the score indicates how much more probable one outcome is than the other.
    For example, if the LA score is 2.0, then the probability of verb attachment is four times greater than noun attachment.
    Depending on the task, we can require a certain threshold of LA score magnitude before making a decision.'
    As usual, in dealing with counts from corpora we must confront the problem of how to estimate probabilities when counts are small.
    The maximum likelihood estimate described above is not very good when frequencies are small, and when frequencies are zero, the formula will not work at all.
    We use a crude adjustment
