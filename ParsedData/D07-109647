07).
			Only if a sentence was judged similar to target domain sentences was it included in the training set.Bick (2007) used a hybrid approach, where a data driven parser trained on the labeled training data was given access to the output of a Constraint Grammar parser for English run on the same data.
			Finally,Schneider et al (2007) learnt collocations and rela tional nouns from the unlabeled target data and used these in their parsing algorithm.
	
	
			Having discussed the major approaches taken in the two tracks of the shared task, we will now return tothe test results.
			For the multilingual track, we com pare results across data sets and across systems, and report results from a parser combination experiment involving all the participating systems (section 6.1).
			For the domain adaptation track, we sum up the most important findings from the test results (section 6.2).
			6.1 Multilingual Track.
			6.1.1 Across Data Sets The average LAS over all systems varies from 68.07 for Basque to 80.95 for Eng
