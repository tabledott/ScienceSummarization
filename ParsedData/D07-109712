 were obtained by not splittingthe training data into smaller sets; for the remain ing languages, accuracy was improved by using the CPOSTAG of Next as the defining feature for the split (instead of POSTAG).
			With respect to the SVMparameters (?, r, C, and ?), Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Greek and Hungarian retain the baseline settings, while the other languages have slightly dif ferent values for some parameters.
			The cumulative improvement after optimization of feature model and learning algorithm parameters was 1.71 percentage points on average over all ten languages, with a minimum of 0.69 (Turkish) and a maximum of 3.25 (Chinese) (cf.
			table 1).
			3 The Blended Parser.
			The Blended parser is an ensemble system based on the methodology proposed by Sagae and Lavie (2006).
			Given the output dependency graphs Gi(1 ? i ? m) of m different parsers for an input sen tence x, we construct a new graph containing all the labeled dependency arcs proposed by some parser and weight each arc a by a score s(a) r
