or, equivalently, that minimizes the number of bits required to represent the text according to that model.
    The following Viterbi-style algorithm can be used to solve this problem.
    Beginning at the initial state, the procedure traces through the model, recording at each state the highest probability of reaching that state from the beginning.
    Thus the two descendants of the start node, nodes to and t., are assigned the probability of o and conditioned in each case on t being the prior character, respectively.
    As more arcs are traversed, the associated probabilities are multiplied: thus the node .0 receives the product of the probability of &#8226; conditioned on t and of o conditioned on When the node ob is reached, it is assigned the greater of the probabilities associated with the two incoming transitions, and so on throughout the model.
    This is the standard dynamic programming technique of storing with each state the result of the best way of reaching that state, and using this result to
