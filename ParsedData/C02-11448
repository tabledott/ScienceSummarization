			CBC consists of three phases.
			In Phase I, we compute each element?s top-k similar elements.
			In our experiments, we used k = 20.
			In Phase II, we construct a collection of tight clusters, where the elements of each cluster form a committee.
			The algorithm tries to form as many committees as possible on the condition that each newly formed committee is not very similar to any existing committee.
			If the condition is violated, the committee is simply discarded.
			In the final phase of the algorithm, each element is assigned to its most similar cluster.

			Computing the complete similarity matrix between pairs of elements is obviously quadrati
