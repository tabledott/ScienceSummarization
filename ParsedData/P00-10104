expressions like generics, e.g., &#8220;April&#8221; in &#8220;April is usually wet&#8221;, or &#8220;today&#8221; in &#8220;today&#8217;s youth&#8221;, and indefinites, e.g., &#8220;a Tuesday&#8221;, are tagged without a value.
    Finally, expressions which are ambiguous without a strongly preferred reading are left without a value.
    This representation treats points as primitive (as do (Bennett and Partee 1972), (Dowty 1979), among others); other representations treat intervals as primitive, e.g., (Allen 1983).
    Arguments can be made for either position, as long as both intervals and points are accommodated.
    The annotation scheme does not force committing to end-points of intervals, and is compatible with current temporal ontologies such as (KSL-Time 1999); this may help eventually support advanced inferential capabilities based on temporal information extraction.
  
  
    The system architecture of the temporal tagger is shown in Figure 1.
    The tagging program takes in a document which has b
