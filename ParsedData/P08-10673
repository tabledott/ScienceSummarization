nk, where only at the root exact N/A we achieved an F-score of 91.7, which is a 19% error reduction from the 1-best baseline, and outperforms both 50-best and 100-best reranking.
    This result is also better than any previously reported systems trained on the Treebank.
  
  
    Informally, a packed parse forest, or forest in short, is a compact representation of all the derivations (i.e., parse trees) for a given sentence under a context-free grammar (Billot and Lang, 1989).
    For example, consider the following sentence 0 I 1 saw 2 him 3 with 4 a 5 mirror 6 where the numbers between words denote string positions.
    Shown in Figure 1, this sentence has (at least) two derivations depending on the attachment of the prep. phrase PP3,6 &#8220;with a mirror&#8221;: it can either be attached to the verb &#8220;saw&#8221;, or be attached to &#8220;him&#8221;, which will be further combined with the verb to form the same VP as above.
    These two derivations can be represented as a single forest by sharing co
