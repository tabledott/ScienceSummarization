    Researchers have explored the use of this kind of document segmentation to improve automated summarization (Salton et al. 1994; Barzilay and Elhadad 1997; Kan, Klavans, and McKeown 1998; Mittal et al.
    1999; Boguraev and Neff 2000) and automated genre detection (Karlgren 1996).
    Text segmentation issues are also important for passage retrieval, a subproblem of information retrieval (Hearst and Plaunt 1993; Salton, Allan, and Buckley 1993; Callan 1994; Kaszkiel and Zobel 1997).
    More recently, a great deal of interest has arisen in using automatic segmentation for the detection of topic and story boundaries in news feeds (Mani et al. 1997; Merlino, Morey, and Maybury 1997; Ponte and Croft 1997; Hauptmann and Witbrock 1998; Allan et al.
    1998; Beeferman, Berger, and Lafferty 1997, 1999).
    Sometimes segmentation is done at the clause level, for the purposes of detecting nuances of dialogue structure or for more sophisticated discourse-processing purposes (Morris and Hir
