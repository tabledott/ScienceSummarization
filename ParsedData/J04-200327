ot; aligned at least once to e. The new lexicon model p&#923;(f, tn0|e) can now replace the usual lexicon model p(f |e), over which it has the following main advantages: f (that is, for tn0 E&#65533; T (f)) amounts to making context information from the complete sentence f1J locally available: The sentence context was taken into account by the morpho-syntactic analyzer, which chose the valid readings T (f).
    4.2.1 Definition of Feature Functions.
    There are numerous possibilities for defining feature functions.
    We do not need to require that they all have the same parametric form or that the components be disjoint and statistically independent.
    Still, it is necessary to restrict the number of parameters so that optimizing them is practical.
    We used the following types of feature functions, which have been defined on the basis of the lemma-tag representation (see Section 2.3): First level: m = IL,&#732;e}, where L is the base form: Second level: m = IT, L,&#732;e}, with subsets T of cardinali
