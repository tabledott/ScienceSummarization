ellknown directed graph problems, which in turn are solvable by efficient algorithms.
    Unfortunately this approach does not work for grammars that are not LR(k) for any k (DeRemer and Pennello 1982:633), for example, ambiguous grammars.
    We therefore broadly follow the alternative approach of Aho, Sethi, and Ullman (1986), but with a number of optimizations: pairs), and 670,000 reduce actions (terminal&#8212;rule-number pairs); however, of the goto entries only 2,600 are distinct and of the shift actions only 1,100 are distinct; most states contain just reduce or just shift actions, and in any one state very few different rules are involved in reduce actions.'
    The majority of states contain just reduce or just shift actions, and in any one state very few different rules are involved in reduce actions.
    Taking advantage of the characteristics of this distribution, in each state we represent (in Common Lisp) For the grammars we have investigated, this representation achieves a similar order of spac
