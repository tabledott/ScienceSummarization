 a context, what type of general knowledge or how deep an inference has to be applied for a successful disambiguation.
    If we limit the context around the prepositional phrase to include only the verb, its object and the PP itself, the human performance on PP attachment is approximately 88.2% accurate decisions [RRR94].
    Because people are capable of utilising their world knowledge, the remaining inaccuracy must be attributed to the lack of a wider context2.
    Statistically, each preposition has a certain percentage of occurrences for each attachment, relying on which would provide us with approximately 72.7% of correct attachments [C&amp;B95].
    If we manage to partially substitute the world knowledge, the resulting accuracy would lie in the range between 72.7 and 88.2%.
    These are the boundaries we expect an automatic system to score within.
    Altman and Steedman [A&amp;S88] have shown that in many cases PP can be attached correctly only if the context of the current discourse is used.
