ure 1 shows a model that has long been used in automatic speech recognition (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983) and has recently been proposed for machine translation (Brown et al. 1990) and for automatic spelling correction (Mays, Demerau, and Mercer 1990).
    In automatic speech recognition, y is an acoustic signal; in machine translation, y is a sequence of words in another language; and in spelling correction, y is a sequence of characters produced by a possibly imperfect typist.
    In all three applications, given a signal y, we seek to determine the string of English words, w, which gave rise to it.
    In general, many different word strings can give rise to the same signal and so we cannot hope to recover w successfully in all cases.
    We can, however, minimize our probability of error by choosing as our estimate of w that string W for which the a posteriori probability of W given y is greatest.
    For a fixed choice of y, this probability is proportional to the joint probability of * and y which, a
