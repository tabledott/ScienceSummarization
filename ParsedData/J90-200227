 trigram model that we are preparing, the perplexity of the source text is about 9.
    In addition to showing the strength of a trigram model relative to a bigrant model, this also indicates that the 1,000-word task is very simple.
    We treat words as unanalyzed wholes, recognizing no connection, for example, between va, vais, and vont, or between tall, taller, and tallest.
    As a result, we cannot improve our statistical characterization of va, say, by observation of sentences involving vont.
    We are working on morphologies for French and English so that we can profit from statistical regularities that our current word-based approach must overlook.
    Finally, we treat the sentence as a structureless sequence of words.
    Sharman et al. discuss a method for deriving a probabilistic phrase structure grammar automatically from a sample of parsed sentences (1988).
    We hope to apply their method to construct grammars for both French and English and to base future translation models on the grammatica
