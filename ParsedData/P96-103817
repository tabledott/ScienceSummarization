; speaking rate (measured in syllables per second); and duration of preceding and subsequent silent pauses.
    As for the segmentation analyses, we compared intonational correlates of segment boundary types not only for group S versus group T, but also for spontaneous versus read speech.
    While correlates have been identified in read speech, they have been observed in spontaneous speech only rarely and descriptively.
    'We calculated 10 maximum in two ways: as simple f0 peak within the intermediate phrase and also as f0 maximum measured at the rms maximum of the sonorant portion of the nuclear-accented syllable in the intermediate phrase (HIGH FO in the ToBI framework (Pitre Beckman, and Hirschberg, 1994)).
    The latter measure proved more robust, so we report results based on this metric.
    The same applies to measurement of rms maximum.
    Average f0 and rms were calculated over the entire intermediate phrase.
    We found strong correlations for consensus SBEG, SCONT, and SF phrases for all cond
