&#8221; the Viterbi decision process to independent maximization of assignment over short chunks, where the greedy policy performs well.
    On the other hand, dependencies between isolated named entity chunks have longer-range dependencies and are not captured by second-order transition features, therefore requiring separate mechanisms, which we discuss in Section 5.
    Another important question that has been studied extensively in the context of shallow parsing and was somewhat overlooked in the NER literature is the representation of text segments (Veenstra, 1999).
    Related works include voting between several representation schemes (Shen and Sarkar, 2005), lexicalizing the schemes (Molina and Pla, 2002) and automatically searching for best encoding (Edward, 2007).
    However, we are not aware of similar work in the NER settings.
    Due to space limitations, we do not discuss all the representation schemes and combining predictions by voting.
    We focus instead on two most popular schemes&#8211; B
