 the ILP problem is NP-hard but it is very fast in practice (Punyakanok et al. 2004).
    The authors report substantial gains in performance due to these global consistency constraints.
    This method was applied to improve the performance both of a system based on labeling syntactic chunks and one based on labeling parse tree nodes.
    Our work differs from that work in that our constraints are not categorical (either satisfied or not), but are rather statistical preferences, and that they are learned automatically based on features specified by the knowledge engineer.
    On the other hand, we solve the search/estimation problem through re-ranking and n-best search only approximately, not exactly.
    So far we have mainly discussed systems which label nodes in a parse tree.
    Many systems that only use shallow syntactic information have also been presented (Hacioglu 2004; Punyakanok et al. 2004); using full syntactic parse information was not allowed in the CoNLL 2004 shared task on Semantic Role Labe
