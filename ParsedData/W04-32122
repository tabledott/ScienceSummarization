s organized as follows.
    In the next section, we briefly describe the annotation of the Proposition Bank, the data for our automatic semantic role labeling experiments.
    Section 3 describes the architecture of our system.
    We take a critical look at the previously used features against each subtask and propose a new set of features in Section 4.
    Section 5 presents experimental results that show the effectiveness of these new features and a comparison with previous results.
    We conclude in Section 6.
    2 The PropBank and Semantic Role Labeling The PropBank adds a layer of semantic annotation to the Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994) to capture generalizations that are not adequately represented in the treebank parse trees.
    For example, in both John broke the window into a million pieces yesterday and The window broke into a million pieces yesterday, the window plays the same role with regard to the verb break in both sentences even though they occur in different syntac
