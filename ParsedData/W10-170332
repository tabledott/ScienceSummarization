at the agreement rates are markedly lower than their expert counterparts.
    Another indication of the presence of bad workers is a low reference preference rate (RPR), which we define as the proportion of time a reference translation wins (or ties in) a comparison when it appears in one.
    Intuitively, the RPR should be quite high, since it is quite rare that an MT output ought to be judged better than the reference.
    This rate is 96.5% over the expert data, but only 83.7% over the MTurk data.
    Compare this to a randomly-clicking RPR of 66.67% (because the two acceptable answers are that the reference is either better than a system&#8217;s output or tied with it).
    Also telling would be the rate at which MTurk workers agree with experts.
    To ensure that we obtain enough overlapping data to calculate such a rate, we purposely select one-sixth14 of our ranking sets so that the five-system group is exactly one that has been judged by an expert.
    This way, at least one-sixth of the comparisons
