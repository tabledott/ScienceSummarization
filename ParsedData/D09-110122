ng it with each of its preceding clusters.
    The test instances are then presented to the ranker, and mk is linked to the cluster that is assigned the highest value by the ranker.
    Note that these partial clusters preceding mk are formed incrementally based on the predictions of the ranker for the first k&#8722;1 mentions; no gold-standard coreference information is used in their formation.
    The cluster ranker described above can be used to determine which preceding cluster a discourseold mention should be linked to, but it cannot be used to determine whether a mention is discoursenew or not.
    The reason is simple: all the training instances are generated from discourse-old mentions.
    Hence, to jointly learn discourse-new detection and coreference resolution, we must train the ranker using instances generated from both discourse-old and discourse-new mentions.
    Specifically, when training the ranker, we provide each active mention with the option to start a new cluster by creating an addition
