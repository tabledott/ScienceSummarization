    Reporting undirected numbers has two advantages: first, it facilitates comparison with earlier work, and, more importantly, it allows one to partially obscure the effects of alternate analyses, such as the systematic choice between a modal and a main verb for the head of a sentence (in either case, the two verbs would be linked, but the direction would vary).
    The dependency induction task has received relatively little attention; the best known work is Carroll and Charniak (1992), Yuret (1998), and Paskin (2002).
    All systems that we are aware of operate under the assumption that the probability of a dependency structure is the product of the scores of the dependencies (attachments) in that structure.
    Dependencies are seen as ordered (head, dependent) pairs of words, but the score of a dependency can optionally condition on other characteristics of the structure, most often the direction of the dependency (whether the arrow points left or right).
