other hand, we have two phrase-based systems, namely the alignment templates and the one described in this work.
    Single-Word Based Systems (SWB).
    First, there is a monotone search variant (Mon) that translates each word of the source sentence from left to right.
    The second variant allows reordering according to the so-called IBM constraints (Berger et al., 1996).
    Thus up to three words may be skipped and translated later.
    This system will be denoted by IBM.
    The third variant implements special German-English reordering constraints.
    These constraints are represented by a finite state automaton and optimized to handle the reorderings of the German verb group.
    The abbreviation for this variant is GE.
    It is only used for the German-English Verbmobil task.
    This is just an extremely brief description of these systems.
    For details, see (Tillmann and Ney, 2003).
    Phrase-Based System (PB).
    For the phrase-based system, we use the following feature functions: a trigram
