			A pro- nounced example is given in Figure 2.
			'She prob- lem of the absolute position alignment can he demonstrated at the positions (a) and (c): both Schneebretlgefahr und Schneeverfrachtungen have a high probability on neige.
			The IBM2 models chooses the position near the diagonal, as this is the one with the higher probability.
			Again, Schneebrettgefahr generates de which explains the wrong alignment near the diagonal in (c).
			However, this strength of the HMM model can also be a weakness as in the case of est developpe ist ... entstanden (see (b) in Figure 2.
			The required two large jumps are correctly found by the mixture model, but not by the HMM mod- el.
			These cases suggest an extention to the HMM model.
			In general, there are only a small number of big jumps in the position alignments in a given sentence pair.
