 that there are enough distinctive changes in word usage patterns between grade levels to give accurate predictions with simple language models, even when the subject domain of the documents is unrestricted.
  
  
    There is a significant body of work on readability that spans the last 70 years.
    A comprehensive summary of early readability work may be found in Chall (1958) and Klare (1963).
    In 1985 a study by Mitchell (1985) reviewed 97 different reading comprehension tests, although few of these have gained wide use.
    &#8216;Traditional&#8217; readability measures are those that rely on two main factors: the familiarity of semantic units (words or phrases) and the complexity of syntax.
    Measures that estimate semantic difficulty using a word list (as opposed to, say, number of syllables in a word) are termed &#8216;vocabulary-based measures&#8217;.
    Most similar to our work are the vocabulary-based measures, such as the Lexile measure (Stenner et al., 1988), the Revised Dale-Chall formula
