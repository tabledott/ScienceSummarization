raining sentences redefines the positive and negative evidence.
    Rather than moving probability mass only to full analyses of the training example xi, we also allow probability mass to go to partial analyses of xi.
    By injecting a bias (S 7&#65533; 0 or Q &gt; &#8722;oc) among tree hypotheses, however, we have gone beyond the CE framework.
    We have added features to the tree model (dependency length-sum, number of breaks), whose weights we extrinsically manipulate over time to impose locality bias CN and improve search on CN.
    Another idea, not explored here, is to change the contents of the neighborhood N over time.
    Experiment: Locality Bias within CE.
    We combined CE with a fixed-S locality bias for neighborhoods that were successful in the earlier CE experiment, namely DELETEORTRANSPOSE1 for German, English, Turkish, and Portuguese.
    Our results, shown in the seventh column of Table 3, show that, in all cases except Turkish, the combination improves over either technique on its own.
