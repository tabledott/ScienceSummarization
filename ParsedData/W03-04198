2003; Whitelaw and Patrick, 2003).
    However, they were always used in combination with other learning techniques.
    Klein et al. (2003) also applied the related Conditional Markov Models for combining classifiers.
    Learning methods that were based on connectionist approaches were applied by four systems.
    Zhang and Johnson (2003) used robust risk minimization, which is a Winnow technique.
    Florian et al. (2003) employed the same technique in a combination of learners.
    Voted perceptrons were applied to the shared task data by Carreras et al. (2003a) and Hammerton used a recurrent neural network (Long Short-Term Memory) for finding named entities.
    Other learning approaches were employed less frequently.
    Two teams used AdaBoost.MH (Carreras et al., 2003b; Wu et al., 2003) and two other groups employed memory-based learning (De Meulder and Daelemans, 2003; Hendrickx and Van den Bosch, 2003).
    Transformation-based learning (Florian et al., 2003), Support Vector Machines (Mayfield et al
