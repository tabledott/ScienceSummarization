ng similar words of w, and the similarity value with w is then computed only for these words.
    We thus get an approximation for the set of words that are most similar to w. For the example given in Table 3, the exhaustive method required 17 minutes of CPU time on a Sun 4 workstation, while the approximation required only 7 seconds.
    This was done using a data base of 1,377,653 cooccurrence pairs that were extracted from the corpus, along with their counts.
  
  
    The purpose of the first evaluation was to test whether the similarity based estimation method can enhance the performance of a disambiguation technique.
    Typically in a disambiguation task, different cooccurrences correspond to alternative interpretations of the ambiguous construct.
    It is therefore necessary that the probability estimates for the alternative cooccurrences will reflect the relative order between their true probabilities.
    However, a consistent bias in the estimate is usually not harmful, as it still preserves the c
