in test corpus # of correct tokens P recision = .
    # of tokens in system output In the evaluations of F-scores, three criteria of correctness are used: seg: (only the word segmentation is evaluated), top: (word segmentation and the top level of POS are evaluated), and all: (all information is used for evaluation).
    The hyperparameters C for L1-CRFs and L2CRFs are selected by cross-validation.
    Experiments are implemented in C++ and executed on Linux with XEON 2.8 GHz dual processors and 4.0 Gbyte of main memory.
    Tables 3 and 4 show experimental results using KC and RWCP respectively.
    The three F-scores (seg/top/all) for our CRFs and a baseline bi-gram HMMs are listed.
    In Table 3 (KC data set), the results of a variant of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) (Uchimoto et al., 2001) and a rule-based analyzer (JUMAN7) are also shown.
    To make a fare comparison, we use exactly the same data as (Uchimoto et al., 2001).
    In Table 4 (RWCP data set), the result of an extended Hidden Markov
