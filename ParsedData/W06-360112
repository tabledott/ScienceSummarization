 = r(d1, ... , dm) is also a derivation, where &#163;(d) = [xi H &#163;(di)]t and C(d) = [xi H C(di)]s. Note that we use a short-hand notation [xi H yi]t to denote the result of substituting each xi with yi in t, where xi ranges over all variables in t. For example, Figure 4 shows two derivations for the sentence pair in Example (1).
    In both cases, the source projection is the English tree in Figure 3 (b), and the target projection is the Chinese translation.
    Galley et al. (2004) presents a linear-time algorithm for automatic extraction of these xRs rules from a parallel corpora with word-alignment and parse-trees on the source-side, which will be used in our experiments in Section 6.
    Departing from the conventional noisy-channel approach of Brown et al. (1993), our basic model is a direct one: where e is the English input string and c* is the best Chinese translation according to the translation model Pr(c  |e).
    We now marginalize over all English parse trees T (e) that yield the sentence e:
