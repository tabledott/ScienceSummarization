re general than the rule itself, it permits no constituents that violate the constraints of the rule; therefore, it preserves correctness.
    Finally, because restriction has a finite range, the prediction step can only occur a finite number of times before building an edge identical to one already built; therefore, it preserves termination.
  
  
    The algorithm just. described has been implemented and incorporated into the PATR-II Experimental System at.
    SRI International. a grammar development and testing environment for PAT grammars written in Zetalisp for the Symbolics 3Witi.
    The following table gives some data suggestive of the of- fect of the restrictor on parsing efficiency.
    It shows the total number of active and passive edges added to the chart for five sentences of up to eleven words using four different restrictors.
    The first allowed only category information to be useI in prediction, thus generating the same behavior as the unextended Earley's algorithm.
    The second added su
