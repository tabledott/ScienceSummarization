ish than overall, while Riedel et al. (2006) are five ranks lower.
    Canisius et al. (2006) are six and Schiehlen and Spranger (2006) even eight ranks higher for Dutch than overall, while Riedel et al.
    (2006) are six ranks lower for Czech and Johansson and Nugues (2006) also six for Chinese.
    Some of the higher rankings could be related to native speaker competence and resulting better parameter tuning but other outliers remain a mystery.
    Even though McDonald et al. (2006) and Nivre et al.
    (2006) obtained very similar overall scores, a more detailed look at their performance shows clear differences.
    Taken over all 12 obligatory languages, both obtain a recall of more than 89% on root tokens (i.e. those with HEAD=0) but Nivre&#8217;s precision on them is much lower than McDonald&#8217;s (80.91 versus 91.07).
    This is likely to be an effect of the different parsing approaches.
    When breaking down by part-of-speech the results of all participants on all data sets, one can observe some
