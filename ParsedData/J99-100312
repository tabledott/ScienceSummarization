punctuation is missing due to OCR errors.
    More importantly, bitexts often contain lists, tables, titles, footnotes, citations and/or markup codes that foil sentence alignment methods.
    Church's solution was to map bitext correspondence at the level of the smallest text units&#8212;characters.
    Characters match across languages to the extent that they participate in orthographic cognates&#8212;words with similar meanings and spellings in different languages.
    Since there are far more characters than sentences in any bitext, the quadratic computational complexity of this approach presented an efficiency problem.
    Church showed how to use a high-band filter to find a rough bitext map quickly.
    Church's rough bitext maps were intended for input into Dagan, Church, and Gale's (1993) slower algorithm for refinement.
    Dagan, Church, and Gale used the rough bitext map to define a distance-based model of co-occurrence.
    Then they adapted Brown et al. 's (1993) statistical translation Model 2 t
