 a semantics for the numbers and the procedures that operate on them.
    In the course of this work, we may modify the procedures to an extent, but we expect to retain their essential properties.
  
  
    We now argue for the last half of the characterization (1) of interpretation.
    Abduction is the process by which, from (lx)p(s) D q(r) and q(A), one concludes p(A).
    One can think of q(A) as the observable evidence, of ( z)p(s) D q(x) as a general principle that could explain q(A)'s occurrence, and of p(A) as the inferred, underlying cause of q(A).
    Of course, this mode of inference is not valid; there may be many possible such p(A)'s.
    Therefore, other criteria are needed to choose among the possibilities.
    One obvious criterion is consistency of p(A) with the rest of what one knows.
    Two other criteria are what Thagard (1978) has called consilience and simplicity.
    Roughly, simplicity is that p(A) should be as small as possible, and consilience is that q(A) should be as big as possib
