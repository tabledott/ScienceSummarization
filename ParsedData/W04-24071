arsing process is to constructa dependency graph, of the kind depicted in Figure 1.
			De terministic parsing means that we always derive a singleanalysis for each input string.
			Moreover, this single anal ysis is derived in a monotonic fashion with no redundancy or backtracking, which makes it possible to parse natural language sentences in linear time (Nivre, 2003).In this paper, we report experiments using memorybased learning (Daelemans, 1999) to guide the parser described in Nivre (2003), using data from a small treebank of Swedish (Einarsson, 1976).
			Unlike most pre vious work on data-driven dependency parsing (Eisner, 1996; Collins et al, 1999; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003;Nivre, 2003), we assume that dependency graphs are la beled with dependency types, although the evaluationwill give results for both labeled and unlabeled represen tations.
			The paper is structured as follows.
			Section 2 gives the necessary background definitions and introduces the idea of guided parsing as well as memory-based
