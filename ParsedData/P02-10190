  Pronunciation Modeling For Improved Spelling Correction
  
    This paper presents a method for incorporating word pronunciation information in a noisy channel model for spelling correction.
    The proposed method builds an explicit error model for word pronunciations.
    By modeling pronunciation similarities between words we achieve a substantial performance improvement over the previous best performing models for spelling correction.
  
  
    Spelling errors are generally grouped into two classes (Kuckich, 1992) &#8212; typographic and cognitive.
    Cognitive errors occur when the writer does not know how to spell a word.
    In these cases the misspelling often has the same pronunciation as the correct word ( for example writing latex as latecks).
    Typographic errors are mostly errors related to the keyboard; e.g., substitution or transposition of two letters because their keys are close on the keyboard.
    Damerau (1964) found that 80% of misspelled words that are non-word errors are the resul
