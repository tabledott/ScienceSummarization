on that it has erred, but rather what can be done to remedy the situation.
    (Actually how the parser must resolve &#8226;!.:... lirst problem is a complex and interesting story in and of itself, with the punchline being that exactly one (but only one) of (2) and (4) I drove my aunt from Peoria's suburbs home. must cause a garden path.
    The details of this await further research on the control of D-theory parsing.)
    The description (3) is easy fixed, given that &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; is read &amp;quot;dominates&amp;quot;, and not &amp;quot;directly dominates&amp;quot;.
    Several further predications can merely be added to (3), namely those of (5), which state that npl is dominated by a determiner node named det 1, which itself is dominated by a new np node; np2, and that np2 is dominated by vpl. transitive.
    Given the predications in (5), (3.1) is redundant, but it is not false.
    The general point is this: D-theory allows nodes to be attached initially by a parser to some point which will turn
