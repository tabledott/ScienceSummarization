f the letter-to-phone model is significantly higher than its 1-best accuracy.
    Table 3 shows the spelling correction accuracy when using the model LTR, PH, or both in combination.
    The table shows N-best accuracy results.
    The N-best accuracy figures represent the percent test cases for which the correct word was in the top N words proposed by the model.
    We chose the context size of 3 for the LTR model as this context size maximized test set accuracy.
    Larger context sizes neither helped nor hurt accuracy.
    As we can see from the table, the phone-based model alone produces respectable accuracy results considering that it is only dealing with word pronunciations.
    The error reduction of the combined model compared to the letters-only model is substantial: for 1-Best, the error reduction is over 23%; for 2Best, 3-Best, and 4-Best it is even higher, reaching over 46% for 4-Best.
    As an example of the influence of pronunciation modeling, in Table 4 we list some misspellingcorrect word pai
