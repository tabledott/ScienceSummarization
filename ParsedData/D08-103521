    For clarity, our exposition will focus on the single-document case. bution does not affect the underlying probabilistic model &#8211; Metropolis-Hastings will converge to the same underlying distribution for any non-degenerate proposal.
    However, a well-chosen proposal distribution can substantially speed convergence.
    Our basic proposal distribution selects an existing segmentation point with uniform probability, and considers a set of local moves.
    The proposal is constructed so that no probability mass is allocated to moves that change the order of segment boundaries, or merge two segments; one consequence of this restriction is that moves cannot add or remove segments.5 We set the proposal distribution to decrease exponentially with the move distance, thus favoring incremental transformat
