limits, unlike previous approaches which were only applied to small data sets with short sentences.
    This paper is structured as follows: In Section 3 we argue for the use of efficient sampling techniques over SCFGs as an effective solution to the modelling and scaling problems of previous approaches.
    We describe our Bayesian SCFG model in Section 4 and a Gibbs sampler to explore its posterior.
    We apply this sampler to build phrase-based and hierarchical translation models and evaluate their performance on small and large corpora.
  
  
    A synchronous context free grammar (SCFG, (Lewis II and Stearns, 1968)) generalizes contextfree grammars to generate strings concurrently in two (or more) languages.
    A string pair is generated by applying a series of paired rewrite rules of the form, X &#8594; he, f, ai, where X is a nonterminal, e and f are strings of terminals and nonterminals and a specifies a one-to-one alignment between non-terminals in e and f. In the context of SMT, by assigning the s
