  Conceptual Density will yield the highest density for lhe subhierarchy containing more senses of lhose, rehttive to the total amount of senses in the subhierarchy.
  Tim sense o1 W contained in the subhierarchy with highest Conceptual l)ensity will be chosen as the sense disambiguating W in the given context.

  Figure 1: senses of a word in WordNet Given a concept c, at the top of a sulfifierarchy, and given nhyp (mean number of hyponyms per node), the Conceptual Density for c when its subhierarchy contains a number m (nmrks) of senses of the words to disambiguate is given by the [ormula below: m- I Z .0 20 nh37~ CI)(c, m)- ,::0 descendants,, (1) l;ornlula I shows a lmralneter that was COlnputed experimentally.
  The 0.20 tries to smooth the exponential i, as m ranges between I and tim total number of senses in WordNet.
