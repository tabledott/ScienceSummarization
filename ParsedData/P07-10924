cribed in detail in Section 3.
    We also demonstrate that triangulation can be used on its own, that is without a source-target distribution, and still yield acceptable translation output.
    This is particularly heartening, as it provides a means of translating between the many &#8220;low density&#8221; language pairs for which we don&#8217;t yet have a source-target bitext.
    This allows SMT to be applied to a much larger set of language pairs than was previously possible.
    In the following section we provide an overview of related work.
    Section 3 introduces a generative formulation of triangulation.
    We present our evaluation framework in Section 4 and results in Section 5.
  
  
    The idea of using multiple source languages for improving the translation quality of the target language dates back at least to Kay (1997), who observed that ambiguities in translating from one language onto another may be resolved if a translation into some third language is available.
