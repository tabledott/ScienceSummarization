    Ties are broken by direct comparison.
    We show the best individual systems alongside the system combinations, since the goal of combination is to produce better quality translation than the component systems.
    ? indicates an individual system that none of the system combinations beat by a statistically significant margin at plevel&#8804;0.1.
    Note: ONLINEA and ONLINEB were not included among the systems being combined in the system combination shared tasks, except in the Czech-English and English-Czech conditions, where ONLINEB was included.

    Note that the reference translation was edited alongside the system outputs.
    Error bars show one positive and one negative standard deviation for the syst
