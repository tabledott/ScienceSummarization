ts will be used for evaluating the methods throughout the paper.
    Each line of the table gives the results for one confusion set: the words in the confusion set; the number of instances of any word in the confusion set in the training corpus and in the test corpus; the word in the confusion set that occurred most often in the training corpus; and the prediction accuracy of the baseline method for the test corpus.
    Prediction accuracy is the number of times the correct word was predicted, divided by the total number of test cases.
    For example, the members of the confusion set {I, me} occurred 840 times in the test corpus, the breakdown being 744 / and 96 me.
    The baseline method predicted / every time, and thus was right 744 times, for a score of 744/840 = 0.886.
    Essentially the baseline method measures how accurately one can predict words using just their prior probabilities.
    This provides a lower bound on the performance we would expect from the other methods, which use more than just th
