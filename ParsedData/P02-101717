an true confusion, and the Penn treebank is a sometimes arbitrary or even inconsistent gold standard.
    To give a better sense of the kinds of errors the system is or is not making, we can look at which sequences are most often over-proposed, or most often under-proposed, compared to the treebank parses. forms MD VB verb groups systematically, and it attaches the possessive particle to the right, like a determiner, rather than to the left.8 It provides binarybranching analyses within NPs, normally resulting in correct extra N constituents, like JJ NN, which are not bracketed in the treebank.
    More seriously, it tends to attach post-verbal prepositions to the verb and gets confused by long sequences of nouns.
    A significant improvement over earlier systems is the absence of subject-verb groups, which disappeared when we switched to Psplit(B) for initial completions; the more balanced subject-verb analysis had a substantial combinatorial advantage with Pbin(B).
    We also ran the system with multiple c
