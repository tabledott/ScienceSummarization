me parsers, such as CKY parsers, all of these algorithms (except for the outside parser) strongly resemble each other.
    For other parsers, such as Earley parsers, the algorithms for computing each value are somewhat different, and a fair amount of work can be required to construct each one.
    We present a formalism for describing parsers such that a single simple description can be used to generate parsers that compute all of these quantities and others.
    This will be especially useful for finding parsers for outside values, and for parsers that can handle general grammars, like Earley-style parsers.
    Although our description format is not limited to context-free grammars (CFGs), we will begin by considering parsers for this common formalism.
    The input string will be denoted w1 w2.. wn.
    We will refer to the complete string as the sentence.
    A CFG G is a 4-tuple (N, E, R, S) where N is the set of nonterminals including the start symbol S. E is the set of terminal symbols, and R is the set
