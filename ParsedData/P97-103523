mean performance of B is .44, suggesting that Agent B may perform better than Agent A overall.
    The evaluator must then however test these performance differences for statistical significance.
    In this case, a t test shows that differences are only significant at the p &lt;.07 level, indicating a trend only.
    In this case, an evaluation over a larger subset of the user population would probably show significant differences.
    Since both tc and ci can be calculated over subdialogues, performance can also be calculated at the subdialogue level by using the values for a and wi as solved for above.
    This assumes that the factors that are predictive of global performance, based on US, generalize as predictors of local performance, i.e. within subdialogues defined by subtasks, as defined by the attribute tagging.I2 Consider calculating the performance of the dialogue strategies used by train timetable Agents A and B, over the subdialogues that repair the value of depart-city.
