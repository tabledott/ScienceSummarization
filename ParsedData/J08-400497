    Intuitively, we would want to consider this a case of perfect agreement, but this is not what the method proposed by Melamed and Resnik yields.
    The annotators&#8217; marks are distributed over the two sub-tags, each with probability 0.5, and then the agreement is computed by summing the joint probabilities over the two subtags (Equation (4) of Melamed and Resnik 2000), with the result that the agreement over the item turns out to be 0.52 + 0.52 = 0.5 instead of 1.
    To correct this, Dan Melamed (personal communication) suggested replacing the product in Equation (4) with a minimum operator.
    However, the calculation of expected agreement (Equation (5) of Melamed and Resnik 2000) still gives the amount of agreement which is expected if coders are forced to choose among leaf nodes, which makes this method inappropriate for coding schemes that do not force coders to do this.
    One way to use Melamed and Resnik&#8217;s proposal while avoiding the discrepancy between observed and expected agreemen
