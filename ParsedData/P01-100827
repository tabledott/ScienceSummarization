onym tree, 11(10%) are unrelated, and the remaining 5% are covered by other relations.
    These figures quantitatively validate our intuition that synonymy is not the only source of paraphrasing.
    One of the practical implications is that using synonymy relations exclusively to recognize paraphrasing limits system performance.
  
  
    In this paper, we presented a method for corpusbased identification of paraphrases from multiple English translations of the same source text.
    We showed that a co-training algorithm based on contextual and lexico-syntactic features of paraphrases achieves high performance on our data.
    The wide range of paraphrases extracted by our algorithm sheds light on the paraphrasing phenomena, which has not been studied from an empirical perspective.
    Future work will extend this approach to extract paraphrases from comparable corpora, such as multiple reports from different news agencies about the same event or different descriptions of a disease from the medical literatu
