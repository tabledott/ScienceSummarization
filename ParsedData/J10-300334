 Any English pattern can subsequently be compared to another by computing cosine similarity over their shared features.
    English collocation pairs whose similarity value exceeds some threshold are construed to be paraphrastic.
    The theme of a trade-off between the precision of the generated paraphrase set&#8212;by virtue of the increased informativeness of the distributional features&#8212;and its coverage is seen in this work as well.
    When using translations from the bilingual dictionary, a knowledge-rich resource, the authors report significantly higher precision than comparable methods that rely only on monolingual information to compute the distributional similarity.
    Predictably, they also find that recall values obtained with their dictionarybased method are lower than those obtained by other methods.
    Paraphrase generation techniques using a single monolingual corpus have to rely on some form of distributional similarity because there are no explicit clues available that indicate semant
