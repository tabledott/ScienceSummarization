l links for each test document; these links in turn define a partition over the entire set of mentions.
    In the system of Soon et. al.
    (2001) system, this is done by pairing each mention j with each preceding mention i.
    Each test instance hi, ji thus formed is then evaluated by the classifier, which returns a probability representing the likelihood that these two mentions are coreferential.
    Soon et. al.
    (2001) use &#8220;Closest-First&#8221; selection: that is, the process terminates as soon as an antecedent (i.e., a test instance with probability &gt; .5) is found or the beginning of the text is reached.
    Another option is to pick the antecedent with the best overall probability (Ng and Cardie, 2002b).
    Our features for the coreference classifier fall into three main categories: (i) features of the anaphor, (ii) features of antecedent mention, and (iii) relational features (i.e., features that describe properties which hold between the two mentions, e.g. distance).
    This feature s
