tances and a larger number of clusters tag only a few instances, are likely to have a better performance than systems that produce a more uniform distribution.
  
  
    We presented the description, evaluation framework and assessment of systems participating in the SemEval-2010 sense induction task.
    The evaluation has shown that the current state-of-the-art lacks unbiased measures that objectively evaluate clustering.
    The results of systems have shown that their performance in the unsupervised and supervised evaluation settings depends on cluster granularity along with the distribution of instances within the clusters.
    Our future work will focus on the assessment of sense induction on a task-oriented basis as well as on clustering evaluation.
