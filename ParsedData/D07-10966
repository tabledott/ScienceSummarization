e percentage of tokens with correct HEAD, and the label accuracy (LA), i.e., the percentage oftokens with correct DEPREL.
			One important difference compared to the 2006 shared task is that all to kens were counted as ?scoring tokens?, including inparticular all punctuation tokens.
			The official eval uation script, eval07.pl, is available from the shared task website.1 2.2 Multilingual Track.
			The multilingual track of the shared task was organized in the same way as the 2006 task, with an notated training and test data from a wide range of languages to be processed with one and the same parsing system.
			This system must therefore be able to learn from training data, to generalize to unseentest data, and to handle multiple languages, possibly by adjusting a number of hyper-parameters.
			Par ticipants in the multilingual track were expected to submit parsing results for all languages involved.
