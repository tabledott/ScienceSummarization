e syntactic dependencies of one language and the syntactic dependencies of another.
    How useful is the DCA?
    The experimental results show that evert the simplistic DCA can be useful when operating in conjunction with small quantities of systematic linguistic knowledge.
    Syntactic analyses projected from English to Chinese can, in principle, yield Chinese analyses that are nearly 70% accurate (in terms of unlabeled dependencies) after application of a set of linguistically principled rules.
    In the near future we will address the remaining errors, which also seem to be amenable to a uniform linguistic treatment: in large part they involve differences in category expression (nominal expressions translated as verbs or vice versa) and we believe that we can use context to effect the correct category transformations.
    We will also explore correction of errors via statistical learning t echni goes .
    The implication of this work for statistical translation modeling is that a little bit of knowled
