    In CS, seven kinds of semantic relation are distinguished: literal, metonymic, metaphorical, anomalous, redundant, inconsistent, and novel relations (this list may not be exhaustive &#8212; there could be others).
    Combinations of these seven semantic relations are the basis of (at minimum) literalness, metonymy, metaphor, anomaly, redundancy, contradiction, contrariness, and novelty.
    Semantic relations belong to two classes, the preference-based and assertion-based classes of relations, depending on the kind of lexical semantic constraint enforced.
    The preference-based class of semantic relations, which are the focus of this paper, contains literal, metonymic, metaphorical, and anomalous semantic relations.
    The assertion-based class of relations are described in greater length in Pass (1989a).
