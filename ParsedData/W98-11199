    We use a small portion of the Penn Wall Street Journal Tree-bank as our training corpus.
    From this data, we collect the three statistics detailed in the following subsections.
    The Hobbs algorithm makes a few assumptions about the syntactic trees upon which it operates that are not satisfied by the tree-bank trees that form the substrate for our algorithm.
    Most notably, the Hobbs algorithm depends on the existence of an N parse-tree node that is absent from the Penn Tree-bank trees.
    We have implemented a slightly modified version of Hobbs algorithm for the Tree-bank parse trees.
    We also transform our trees under certain conditions to meet Hobbs' assumptions as much as possible.
    We have not, however, been able to duplicate exactly the syntactic structures assumed by Hobbs.
    Once we have the trees in the proper form (to the degree this is possible) we run Hobbs' algorithm repeatedly for each pronoun unt
