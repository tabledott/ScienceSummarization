    Using two gold standards helps valid MWUs.
    It also provides evaluation using both static and dynamic resources.
    We choose to evaluate in English due to the wealth of linguistic resources.
    In particular, we use a randomly-selected corpus the first five columns as &#8220;information-like.&#8221; consisting of a 6.7 million word subset of the TREC Similarly, since the last four columns share databases (DARPA, 1993-1997). properties of the frequency approach, we will refer Table 2 illustrates a sample of rank-ordered output to them as &#8220;frequency-like.&#8221; from each of the different algorithms (following the One&#8217;s application may dictate which set of cross-source, filtered paradigm described in section algorithms to use.

    Note that algorithms in the first four columns reflects our interest in general word dictionaries, so produce results that are similar to each other as do results we obtain may differ from results we might those in
