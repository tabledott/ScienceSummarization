re based on a proper dependency grammar.
			In thefuture, we therefore want to perform more experi ments with genuine dependency treebanks like the Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajic, 1998) and the Danish Dependency Treebank (Kromann, 2003).
			We also want to apply dependency-based evaluation schemes such as the ones proposed by Lin (1998) and Carroll et al (1998).
			Acknowledgements The work presented in this paper has been supportedby a grant from the Swedish Research Council (621 2002-4207).
			The memory-based classifiers used in the experiments have been constructed using theTilburg Memory-Based Learner (TiMBL) (Daelemans et al, 2003).
			The conversion of the Penn Tree bank to dependency trees has been performed using head rules kindly provided by Hiroyasu Yamada and Yuji Matsumoto.
