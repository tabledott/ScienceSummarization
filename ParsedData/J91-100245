ambiguation.
    This concept is different from that used in our work.
    Here, by virtue of words cooccurring in a text and then also containing at least one category in common or being in the same category, they are considered lexically related and no further strength is needed.
    We use the thesaurus as a validator of lexical relations that are possible due to the semantic relations among words in a text.
    It has already been mentioned that the concept of chain strength needs much further work.
    The intuition is that the stronger a chain, the more likely it is to have a corresponding structural component.
    The integration of this tool with other text understanding tools is an area that will require a lot of work.
    Lexical chains do not always correspond exactly to intentional structure, and when they do not, other textual information is needed to obtain the correct correspondences.
    In the example given, there were cases where a lexical chain did correspond to an intention, but the senten
