    Evaluation on preexisting gold standards has shown that SIMR can map bitexts with high accuracy in a variety of language pairs and text genres, without getting lost.
    SIMR is robust in the face of translation irregularities like omissions and allows crossing correspondences to account for word-order differences.
    SIMR encapsulates its language-specific heuristics, so that it can be ported to any language pair with a minimal effort (Melamed 1997).
    These features make SIMR one of the most widely applicable bitext mapping algorithms published to date.
    For applications that require it, SIMR's bitext maps can be efficiently reduced to segment alignments, using the Geometric Segment Alignment (GSA) algorithm presented here.
    Admittedly, GSA is only useful when a good bitext map is available.
    In such cases, there are three reasons to favor GSA over other options for alignment: One, it is simply more accurate.
    Two, its expected running time is linear in the size of the bitext.
