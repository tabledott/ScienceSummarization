vidually to the preposit ional-phrase node.
  For sequences of particles which come at the end of a verb phrase or other constituent with a verbal head, the adopted standard is, likewise, to attach each individually to the top node of the constituent: Example: If initial analysis is: (We (were (out (of (oatmeal cookies))))) Then change to standard as follows: (We (were (out of (oatmeal cookies)))) ~.
  Computation of Evaluation Statistics (a) Number of Constituents Incompatible With Standard Parse For the sentence under analysis, compare the constituents as del imited by the standard parse with those del imited by the parse for evaluation.
  The first statistic computed for each sentence is the number of constituents in the parse being evaluated which "cross", i.e.
  are neither subsstrings nor superstrings of, the constituents of the standard parse.
  Example: Standard parse: ((The prospect) (of (cutting back spending))) Parse for evaluation: (The (prospect (of ((cutting back) spending)))) The (non-unary) co
