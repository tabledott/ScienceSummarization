    In Section 5.2 we describe a method of learning multiword phrases using conventional dictionaries.
    The alignment on the training corpus is trained using the original source language corpus containing inflected word forms.
    This alignment is then used to count the co-occurrences of the annotated &#8220;words&#8221; in the lemma-tag representation of the source language corpus with the words in the target language corpus.
    These event counts are used for the maximum-entropy training of the model parameters &#923;.
    The probability mass is distributed over (all readings of) the source language word forms to be supported for test (not necessarily restricted to those occurring during training).
    The only precondition is that the firing features for these unseen events are known.
    This &#8220;vocabulary supported in test,&#8221; as it is called in Figure 1, can be a predefined closed vocabulary, as is the case in Verbmobil, in which the output of a speech recognizer with limited output vo
