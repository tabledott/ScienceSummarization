rent points of view.
    From that of monolingual sense disambiguation, we exploit the fact that the mapping between words and word senses varies significantly among different languages.
    This enables us to map an ambiguous construct from one language to another, obtaining representations in which each sense corresponds to a distinct word.
    Now it is possible to collect co-occurrence statistics automatically from a corpus of the other language, without requiring manual tagging of senses.'
    From the point of view of machine translation, we suggest that some ambiguity problems are easier to solve at the level of the target language than the source language.
    The source language sentences are considered a noisy source for target language sentences, and our task is to devise a target language model that prefers the most reasonable translation.
    Machine translation is thus viewed in part as a recognition problem, and the statistical model we use specifically for target word selection may be compared
