on seems to be slightly less important since the disambiguator should be able to handle additional noise but obviously not in large amounts.
    Coverage is a very important measure for a rule set, since a rule set that can guess very accurately but only for a tiny proportion of words is of questionable value.
    Thus, we will try to maximize recall first, then coverage, and, finally, precision.
    We will measure the aggregate by averaging over measures per word (micro-average), i.e., for every single word from the test collection the precision and recall of the guesses are calculated, and then we average over these values.
    To find the optimal threshold (0,) for the production of a guessing rule set, we generated a number of similar rule sets using different thresholds and evaluated them against the training lexicon and the test lexicon of unseen 17,868 hapax words.
    Every word from the two lexicons was guessed by a rule set and the results were compared with the information the word had in the lexi
