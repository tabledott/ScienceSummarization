 word-based model on the Arabic-English translation task.
    Adding the class-based models leads to small improvements in BLEU score, with the highest improvements for both dev and nist06 being statistically significant 2.
    In the next experiment we used two predictive class-based models, a 5-gram model with 512 clusters trained on the en target data set and a 6-gram model also using 512 clusters trained on the en ldcnews data set.
    We used these models in addition to a word-based 6-gram model created by combining models trained on all four English data sets.
    Table 2 shows the BLEU scores of the machine translation system using only this word-based model, the scores after adding the class-based model trained on the en target data set and when using all three models.
    For our experiment with the English Arabic translation task we trained two 5-gram predictive classbased models with 512 clusters on the Arabic ar gigaword and ar webnews data sets.
    The wordbased Arabic 5-gram model we used was c
