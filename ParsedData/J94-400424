  Before we define and resolve each divergence type, we will first make some revi- sions to the representations used in Definitions 1 and 4 to simplify the presentation.
  The representation given in Definition 1 is revised so that Z is used to denote a logical argument from the set {Z~l ... Z~n} and Q is used to denote a logical modifier from the set {QI ... Qm}.
  The resulting representation is considerably simplified: (8) [T(X) X ([T(W) Wt],  [T(Z) Z  ] ,  [T(Q) Q])] Similarly, the representation given in Definition 4 is revised so that W is used to denote the external argument, Z is used to denote an internal argument from the set {Z-MAX1 ... Z-MAXn}, and Q is used to denote a syntactic adjunct from the set {Q-MAXI ... Q-MAXm}.
  The resulting represe
