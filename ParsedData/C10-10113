ttlenecks and im proves the performance.
			In Section 5, we describethe parallel parsing algorithms which nearly allowed us to divide the parsing times by the number of cores.
			In Section 6, we determine the opti mal setting for the Non-Projective ApproximationAlgorithm.
			In Section 7, we conclude with a sum mary and an outline of further research.
	
	
			The two main approaches to dependency parsing are transition based dependency parsing (Nivre, 2003; Yamada and Matsumoto., 2003; Titov and Henderson, 2007) and maximum spanning tree based dependency parsing (Eisner, 1996; Eisner, 2000; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
			Transition based parsers typically have a linear or quadratic complexity (Nivre et al, 2004; Attardi, 2006).Nivre (2009) introduced a transition based non projective parsing algorithm that has a worst casequadratic complexity and an expected linear pars ing time.
			Titov and Henderson (2007) combined a transition based parsing algorithm, which used abeam search with a latent variable machi
