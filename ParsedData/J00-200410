 be able to encode many levels of relative importance among the possible translations of each element of Q'.
    A typical bilingual dictionary says only what the possible translations are, which is equivalent to positing a uniform translational distribution.
    The performance of cross-language information retrieval with a uniform T is likely to be limited in the same way as the performance of conventional information retrieval without term-frequency information, i.e., where the system knows which terms occur in which documents, but not how often (Buckley 1993).
    Applications where word order is crucial include speech transcription for translation (Brousseau et al. 1995), bootstrapping of OCR systems for new languages (Philip Resnik and Tapas Kanungo, personal communication), interactive translation (Foster, Isabelle, and Plamondon 1996), and fully automatic high-quality machine translation (e.g., Al-Onaizan et al.
    1999).
    In such applications, a word-to-word translation model can serve as an inde
