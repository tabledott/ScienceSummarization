t satisfy this condition.
    These results appear more promising for the child-reordering model, with coverage ranging from 72.3% to 85.1% of the nodes, but we should keep in mind that many of these nodes are low in the tree (e.g. base NPs); extraction of 1-level transformation rules generally present no difficulties when child nodes are pre-terminals, since any crossings can be resolved by lexicalizing the elements involved in it.
    However, higher level syntactic constituents are more problematic for child-reordering models, and the main reasons they fail to provide explanation of the parses at the sentence level.
    Table 1 shows that the extraction of rules can be performed quite efficiently.
    Our first algorithm, which has an exponential running time, cannot scale to process large corpora and extract a sufficient number of rules that a syntax-based statistical MT system would require.
    The second algorithm, which runs in linear time, is on the other hand barely affected by the size of rules it
