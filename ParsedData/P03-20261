or language learning, we have assumed that learners must be informed of what kind of errors they have made, and in which part of their utterances.
    To do this, we need to have a framework that will allow us to detect learners&#8217; errors automatically.
    In this paper, we introduce a method of detecting learners&#8217; errors, and we examine to what extent this could be accomplished using our learner corpus data including error tags that are labeled with the learners&#8217; errors.
  
  
    The corpus data was based entirely on audiorecorded data extracted from an interview test, the &#8220;Standard Speaking Test (SST)&#8221;.
