hange for P(Neutral) in table 5, due to randomly splitting the data.)
			Given that the data set is currently small, for the condition named same-tune-eval, tuning was performed automatically on all data using a slightly smaller set of combinations, and thenmanually adjusted against the 10-fold cross validation process.
			Resulting parameters were: ? = 1.2, ? = 0.9, ? = 4, ? = 1, S = 0.5.
			All data was used for evaluation.
			Emotion classification was sensitive to the selected tuning data.
			Generally, a smaller tuning set resultedin pejorative parameter settings.
			The random selec tion could make a difference, but was not explored.
			5 Results and discussion.
			This section first presents the results from experiments with the two different confusion sets de scribed above, as well as feature experimentation.
			5.1 Classification results.
			Average accuracy from 10-fold cross validation forthe first experiment, i.e. classifying sentences as either NEUTRAL or EMOTIONAL, are included in ta ble 5 and f
