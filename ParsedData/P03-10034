 the fundamental problem of question answering is that of finding spaces where the distance between questions and sentences that contain correct answers is small and where the distance between questions and sentences that contain incorrect answers is large.
    In this paper, we propose a new space and a new metric for computing this distance.
    Being inspired by the success of noisy-channel-based approaches in applications as diverse as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1997), part of speech tagging (Church, 1988), machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), information retrieval (Berger and Lafferty, 1999), and text summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2002), we develop a noisy channel model for QA.
    This model explains how a given sentence SA that contains an answer sub-string A to a question Q can be rewritten into Q through a sequence of stochastic operations.
    Given a corpus of questionanswer pairs (Q, SA), we can train a probabilistic model for estimating the conditional probability P(Q  |SA).
