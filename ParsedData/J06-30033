ssifying semantic relations, LRA achieves similar gains over the VSM.
  
  
    There are at least two kinds of similarity.
    Attributional similarity is correspondence between attributes and relational similarity is correspondence between relations (Medin, Goldstone, and Gentner 1990).
    When two words have a high degree of attributional similarity, we call them synonyms.
    When two word pairs have a high degree of relational similarity, we say they are analogous.
    Verbal analogies are often written in the form A:B::C:D, meaning A is to B as C is to D; for example, traffic:street::water:riverbed.
    Traffic flows over a street; water flows over a riverbed.
    A street carries traffic; a riverbed carries water.
    There is a high degree of relational similarity between the word pair traffic:street and the word pair water:riverbed.
    In fact, this analogy is the basis of several mathematical theories of traffic flow (Daganzo 1994).
    In Section 2, we look more closely at the connections between
