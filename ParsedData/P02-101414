 both in gender and number (AGREEMENT); cannot SPAN one another (e.g.
    &#8220;government&#8221; and &#8220;government officials&#8221;); and cannot violate the BINDING constraints.
    Still other grammatical features encode general linguistic preferences either for or against coreference.
    For example, an indefinite NP (that is not in apposition to an anaphoric NP) is not likely to be coreferent with any NP that precedes it (ARTICLE).
    The last subset of grammatical features encodes slightly more complex, but generally non-linguistic heuristics.
    For instance, the CONTAINS PN feature effectively disallows coreference between NPs that contain distinct proper names but are not themselves proper names (e.g.
    &#8220;IBM executives&#8221; and &#8220;Microsoft executives&#8221;).
    Two final features make use of an in-house naive pronoun resolution algorithm (PRO RESOLVE) and a rule-based coreference resolution system (RULE RESOLVE), each of which relies on the original and expanded feature sets d
