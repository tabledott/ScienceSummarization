ives, and also to train and evaluate our subsequent algorithms, we need a 3Certain words inflected with negative affixes (such as in- or un-) tend to be mostly negative, but this rule applies only to a fraction of the negative words.
    Furthermore, there are words so inflected which have positive orientation, e.g., independent and unbiased.
    Positive: adequate central clever famous intelligent remarkable reputed sensitive slender thriving Negative: contagious drunken ignorant lanky listless primitive strident troublesome unresolved unsuspecting set of adjectives with predetermined orientation labels.
    We constructed this set by taking all adjectives appearing in our corpus 20 times or more, then removing adjectives that have no orientation.
    These are typically members of groups of complementary, qualitative terms (Lyons, 1977), e.g., domestic or medical.
    We then assigned an orientation label (either + or &#8212;) to each adjective, using an evaluative approach.
    The criterion was whether th
