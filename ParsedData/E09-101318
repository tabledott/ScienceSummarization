    Data In this work, we focus solely on inducing senses for nouns, since they constitute the largest portion of content words.
    For example, nouns represent 45% of the content words in the British National Corpus.
    Moreover, for many tasks and applications (e.g., web queries, Jansen et al. 2000) nouns are the most frequent and most important part-of-speech.
    For evaluation, we used the Semeval-2007 benchmark dataset released as part of the sense induction and discrimination task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007).
    The dataset contains texts from the Penn Treebank II corpus, a collection of articles from the first half of the 1989 Wall Street Journal (WSJ).
    It is hand-annotated with OntoNotes senses (Hovy et al., 2006) and has 35 nouns.
    The average noun ambiguity is 3.9, with a high (almost 80%) skew towards the predominant sense.
    This is not entirely surprising since OntoNotes senses are less fine-grained than WordNet senses.
    We used two corpora for training as we wante
