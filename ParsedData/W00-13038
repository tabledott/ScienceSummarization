nel function.
    Among the many kinds of Kernel functions available, we will focus on the d-th polynomial kernel: Use of d-th polynomial kernel function allows us to build an optimal separating hyperplane which takes into account all combination of features up to d. Using a Kernel function, we can rewrite the decision function as:
  
  
    This section describes a general formulation of the probability model and parsing techniques for Japanese statistical dependency analysis.
    First of all, we let a sequence of chunks be {b1, b2 , bni} by B, and the sequence dependency pattern be {Dep(1), Dep(2), , Dep(rn.
    &#8212; 1)} by D, where Dep(i) = j means that the chunk bi depends on (modifies) the chunk bi.
    In this framework, we suppose that the dependency sequence D satisfies the following constraints.
    Statistical dependency structure analysis is defined as a searching problem for the dependency pattern D that maximizes the conditional probability P(D1./3) of the input sequence under the above-menti
