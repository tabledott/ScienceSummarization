 bottom-up according to the grammar rules.
    When the parsing cost3 comes only from the features within a subtree (TM cost, in our case), the parser will find the optimal tree by keeping the single best subtree for each tuple.
    When the cost depends on the features outside of a subtree, we need to keep all the subtrees for possible different outside features (boundary words for the trigram LM cost) to obtain the optimal tree.
    Instead of keeping all the subtrees, we only retain subtrees within a beam width for each input-substring.
    Since the outside features are not considered for the beam pruning, the optimality of the parse is not guaranteed, but the required memory size is reduced. t-table pruning: Given a foreign (Chinese) sentence to the decoder, we only consider English wordsfor each foreign word such that P is high.
    In addition, only limited part-of-speech labels are considered to reduce the number of possible decoded-tree structures.
    Thus we only use the top-5 (,) pairs ranked by N
