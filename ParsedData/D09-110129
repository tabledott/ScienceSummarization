oblem of having very low precision when applying the CEAF scorer to score partitions of system mentions.
    The mention-pair baseline.
    We train our first baseline, the mention-pair coreference classifier, using the SVM learning algorithm as implemented in the SVMlight package (Joachims, 2002).6 Results of this baseline using true mentions and system mentions, shown in row 1 of Tables 3 and 4, are reported in terms of recall (R), precision (P), and F-score (F) provided by the three scoring programs.
    As we can see, this baseline achieves Fscores of 54.3&#8211;70.0 and 53.4&#8211;62.5 for true mentions and system mentions, respectively.
    The entity-mention baseline.
    Next, we train our second baseline, the entity-mention coreference classifier, using the SVM learner.
    Results of this baseline are shown in row 2 of Tables 3 and 4.
    For true mentions, this baseline achieves an Fscore of 54.8&#8211;70.7.
    In comparison to the mentionpair baseline, F-score rises insignificantly according to a
