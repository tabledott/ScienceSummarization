er allow deletion of the complement.
    Since many nodes that should not be deleted are not labeled with their syntactic role, we add another constraint that disallows deletion of NPs.
  
  
    As with Knight and Marcu&#8217;s (2000) original work, we use the same 32 sentence pairs as our Test Corpus, leaving us with 1035 training pairs.
    After adjusting the supervised weighting parameter, we fold the development set back into the training data.
    We presented four judges with nine compressed versions of each of the 32 long sentences: A humangenerated short version, the K&amp;M version, our first supervised version, our supervised version with our special rules, our supervised version with special rules and additional constraints, our unsupervised version, our supervised version with additional constraints, our semi-supervised version, and our semisupervised version with additional constraints.
    The judges were asked to rate the sentences in two ways: the grammaticality of the short sentences on a s
