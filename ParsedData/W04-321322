tain the correct role&#8212;and which may in fact be empty).
    All these percent figures are out of all argument slots (for the first set of results), and out of all slots (for the second set); see Table 3.
    Correctness is determined by the human judgements on the chunked slots, as reported above.
    Using our notion of slot class, we compare our results to a baseline that assigns all slots the role with the highest probability for that slot class, .
    When using general thematic roles, this is a more informed baseline than , as used in other work.
    We are using a very different verb lexicon, corpus, and human standard than in previous research.
    The closest work is that of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) which maps FrameNet roles to a set of 18 thematic roles very similar to our roles, and also operates on a subset of the BNC (albeit manually rather than randomly selected).
    We mention the performance of their method where appropriate below.
    However, our results are compared to human annotati
