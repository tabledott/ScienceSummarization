he sentence if it cannot get an analysis at the ? = 0.05 level.
			The percentage of sentences without an analysis is now 6%, but the parser is extremely fast,processing almost 50 sentences a second.
			This configuration of the system would be useful for obtaining data for lexical knowledge acquisition, for ex ample, for which large amounts of data are required.
			The oracle row shows the parser speed when it is provided with only the correct lexical categories.The parser is extremely fast, and in Clark and Cur ran (2004) we show that the F-score for labelled dependencies is almost 98%.
			This demonstratesthe large amount of information in the lexical categories, and the potential for improving parser ac curacy and efficiency by improving the supertagger.
			Finally, the first parser beam row corresponds to the parser using a beam search to further reduce thederivation space.
			The beam search works by prun ing categories from the chart: a category can only be part of a derivation if its beam score is wit
