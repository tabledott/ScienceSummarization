e the correct solution, since segment size will vary from the average, and false positives are not necessarily uniformly distributed throughout the document.
    Another important problem with the Pk metric is that it allows some errors to go unpenalized.
    In particular, it does not take into account the number of segment boundaries between the two ends of the probe.
    (See Figure 4.)
    Let r; indicate the number of boundaries between the ends of the probe according to the reference segmentation, and let a; indicate the number of boundaries proposed by some text segmentation algorithm for the same stretch of text.
    If r; = 1 (the reference segmentation indicates one boundary) and a; = 2 (the algorithm marks two boundaries within this range), then the algorithm makes at least one false positive (spurious boundary) error.
    However, the evaluation metric Pk does not assign a penalty in this situation.
    Similarly, if r; = 2 and a; = 1, the An illustration of the fact that the Pk metric fails to pe
