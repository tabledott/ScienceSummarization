  4.2 SuI)(*xl;agging Tlte elemmttary trees of LTAG localize dependen- (-ies, including hmg distance dependencies, by re- quiring that all and only the dependent elements be present within the same tree.
  As a result of this localization, a lexical item may be (and al- most alwws is) associated with more than one eL- ementary tree, We call these elementary trees su- pcrlags, since they conttdn more information (such as sul)categorization a d agreement information) than standard part -of  speech tags.
  Henc.e, each word is associated with more than one supertag.
  At the end of a complete l)arse, each word is asso- ciated with just one supertag (assuming there is no global ambiguity), and the supertags of all the words in a sentence are combined by sul)stitution and adju
