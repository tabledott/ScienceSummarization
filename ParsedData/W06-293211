l classification of labels had very little effect on overall labeled accuracy (79.4% to 79.7%)2.
    The major contribution was in helping to distinguish subjects, objects and other dependents of main verbs, which is the most common labeling error.
    This is not surprising since these edge labels typically are the most correlated (i.e., if you already know which noun dependent is the subject, then it should be easy to find the object).
    For instance, sequential labeling improves the labeling of 2This difference was much larger for experiments in which gold standard unlabeled dependencies are used. objects from 81.7%/75.6% to 84.2%/81.3% (labeled precision/recall) and the labeling of subjects from 86.8%/88.2% to 90.5%/90.4% for Swedish.
    Similar improvements are common across all languages, though not as dramatic.
    Even with this improvement, the labeling of verb dependents remains the highest source of error.
