rformed all the others on all tracks.
    Even if there were, the most one could say is that for the four different segmentation standards and associated corpora, this particular system outperformed the others: But there could be no implication that said system would be the most appropriate for all applications.
    One thing that we have not explicitly discussed in this paper is which type of approach shows the most promise, given the different submissions.
    While we are familiar with the approaches taken in several of the tested systems, we leave it up to the individual participants to describe their approaches and hopefully elucidate which aspects of their approaches are most responsible for their successes and failures; the participants&#8217; papers all appear in this volume.
    We leave it up to the research community as a whole to decide whether one approach or another shows most promise.
    We believe that there should be future competitions of this kind, possibly not every year, but certainly ev
