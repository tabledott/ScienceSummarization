titution, the pronoun her is rewritten as him.
			This is becausethey share the French translation lui and thus piv oting learns to replace the less common word (in legal corpora) her with him.
			This problem could be addressed by pivoting over multiple bitexts with different foreign languages.
			Possible extensions and improvements to the current model are many and varied.
			Firstly, ashinted at above, the model would benefit from extensive feature engineering, including source con ditioned features and ngram features besides theLM.
			A richer grammar would also boost perfor mance.
			This could be found by pivoting over more bitexts in many foreign languages or making use of existing or paraphrase corpora.
			Finally, we planto apply the model to other paraphrasing tasks in cluding fully abstractive document summarisation (Daum?e III and Marcu, 2002).
