tem, techniques for recognizing discourse-new descriptions play a role as important as techniques for identifying the antecedent of anaphoric ones.
    A central characteristic of the work described here is that we intended from the start to develop a system whose performance could be evaluated using the texts annotated in the experiments mentioned above.
    Assessing the performance of an NLP system on a large number of examples is increasingly seen as a much more thorough evaluation of its performance than trying to come up with counterexamples; it is considered essential for language engineering applications.
    These advantages are thought by many to offset some of the obvious disadvantages of this way of developing NLP theories&#8212;in particular, the fact that, given the current state of language processing technology, many hypotheses of interest cannot be tested yet (see below).
    As a result, quantitative evaluation is now commonplace in areas of language engineering such as parsing, and quantita
