&#8220;both&#8221;) having arguments to its left.
    C3 forces coordination arguments to the left of a conjunction to have commas in between.
    C4 avoids parses in which incompatible word classes are coordinated, such as nouns and verbs.
    Finally, P1 allows selective projective parsing: we can, for instance, forbid the crossing of &#8220;Noun-Determiner&#8221; dependencies if we add the corresponding label type to P(see Section 4.4 for more details of P) .
    If we extend P to contain all labels we forbid any type of crossing dependencies.
    This corresponds to projective parsing.
    McDonald et al. (2005b) use the Chu-LiuEdmonds (CLE) algorithm to solve the maximum spanning tree problem.
    However, global constraints cannot be incorporated into the CLE algorithm (McDonald et al., 2005b).
    We alleviate this problem by presenting an equivalent Integer Linear Programming formulation which allows us to incorporate global constraints naturally.
    Before giving full details of our formulation we f
