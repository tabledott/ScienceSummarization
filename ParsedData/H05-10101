ry drawbacks.
			In itsfavor, generative models of alignment are wellsuited for use in a noisy-channel translation system.
			In addition, they can be trained in an un supervised fashion, though in practice they do require labeled validation alignments for tuning model hyper-parameters, such as null counts orsmoothing amounts, which are crucial to pro ducing alignments of good quality.
			A primarydrawback of the generative approach to alignment is that, as in all generative models, explicitly incorporating arbitrary features of the in put is difficult.
			For example, when considering whether to align two words in the IBM models (Brown et al, 1990), one cannot easily include information about such features as orthographic similarity (for detecting cognates), presence of the pair in various dictionaries, similarity of the frequency of the two words, choices made by other alignment systems on this sentence pair, and so on.
			While clever models can implicitly capture some of these information sources, ittakes
