h.SR that have been used as context by such an action, if any.
    Note that h.SL and h.SR refer to spans that are subsequences of p. We recursively compute the score of h as where i , t represents the hypothesis consisting of a single action which assigns label t to wz.
    This provides the set of starting hypotheses.
    As for the example Agatha found that book interesting in the previous subsection, we have The most recent action of hypothesis h441 is to assign NN to w4.
    According to Equation (2), the score of this action U(h441.A) depends on the features defined on the local context of action.
    For example, where w&#8722;1 represents the left word.
    It should be noted that, for all the features depending on the neighboring tags, the value is always 0, since those tags are still unknown in the step of initialization.
    Since this operation does not depend on solved tags, we have V (h441) = U(h411.A), according to Equation (1).
    The core of the algorithm repeatedly selects a candidate span
