t 11o difference in the results (the null hypothesis) and to ask, as- suming this expectation, how mmsual are these results?
  One way to answer this question is to assulne that the diffb, rence has a normal or t dis- tribution (Box et al., 1978, Sec.
  Then one calculates the following: (d - Z  [4 ) / s  d = d/,~,~ (1) where d = x l -  x2 is the difference found be- tween xl and x2, the results for the new and current echniques, respectively.
  E[d] is the ex- pected difference (which is 0 under the null hy- pothesis) and Sd is an estimate of the standard deviation of d. Standard eviation is the square root of the variance, a measure of how much a random variable is expected to vary.
  The results of equation 1are compared to tables (c.f.
  (1978, Appendix)) to find out what the chances are of equaling or exceeding the equa- tion 1 results if the null hypothesis were true.
  The larger the equation 1 results, the more un- usual it would be under the null hypothesis.
  A complication of using equation 1 is th
