			Andmethod (Koehn et al, 2003) can be aggressively pruned using significance pruning with out worsening BLEU.

			The preservation of BLEU score in the pres-.
			ence of large-scale pruning is a strong effect insmall and moderate size phrasetables, but oc curs also in much larger phrasetables.
			5.
			In larger phrasetables based on larger corpora,.
			the percentage of the table that can be dis carded appears to decrease.
			This is plausible since a similar effect (a decrease in the benefit of smoothing) has been noted with phrasetable smoothing (Foster et al, 2006).
			Together these results suggest that, for these corpus sizes, the increase in the number of strongly supported phrase pairs is greater than the increase in the number
