tree induction systems (e.g., C5 (Quinlan, 1993)) are the first and one of the most widely used learning algorithms by coreference researchers, although rule learners (e.g., RIPPER (Cohen, 1995)) and memory-based learners (e.g., TiMBL (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 2005)) are also popular choices, especially in early applications of machine learning to coreference resolution.
    In recent years, statistical learners such as maximum entropy models (Berger et al., 1996), voted perceptrons (Freund and Schapire, 1999), and support vector machines (Joachims, 1999) have been increasingly used, in part due to their ability to provide a confidence value (e.g., in the form of a probability) associated with a classification, and in part due to the fact that they can be easily adapted to train recently proposed rankingbased coreference models (see Section 3.3).
    After training, we can apply the resulting model to a test text, using a clustering algorithm to coordinate the pairwise classification decisions and impose
