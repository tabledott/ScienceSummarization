r GALE 2006 evaluation were used in the experiments to demonstrate the performance of all three system combination methods on Arabic and Chinese to English MT tasks.
    Three systems were phrase-based (A, C and E), two hierarchical (B and D) and one syntax-based (F).
    The phrase-based systems used different sets of features and re-ordering approaches.
    The hierarchical systems used different rule sets.
    All systems were tuned on NIST MT02 evaluation sets with four references.
    Systems A and B were tuned to minimize TER, the other systems were tuned to maximize BLEU.
    As discussed in Section 2, the system combination tuning metric was chosen so that gains were observed in both TER and BLEU on development test sets.
    NIST MT05 comprising only newswire data (1056 Arabic and 1082 Chinese sentences) with four reference translations and the newsgroup portion of the GALE 2006 dry-run (203 Arabic and 126 Chinese sentences) with one reference translation were used as the test sets.
