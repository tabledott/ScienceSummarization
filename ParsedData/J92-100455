 a person can carry on a dialog with the computer, either through spoken speech or through text input.
    In both of these systems, TINA provides the interface between the recognizer and the application back-end.
    In this section, I will describe our current interfaces between TINA and the recognizer and our future plans in this area.
    In addition, I will describe briefly how we currently translate the parse tree into a semantic frame that serves as the input to database access and text response generation.
    This aspect of the system is beyond the scope of this paper, and therefore it will not be covered in detail.
    The recognizer for these systems is the SUMMIT system (Zue et al. 1989), which uses a segmental-based framework and includes an auditory model in the front-end processing.
    The lexicon is entered as phonetic pronunciations that are then augmented to account for a number of phonological rules.
    The search algorithm is the standard Viterbi search (Viterbi 1967), except that the ma
