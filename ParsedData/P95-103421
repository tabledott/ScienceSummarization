grammar is organized around semantic patterns, it nicely concentrates all of the material required to build word lattices.
    Unfortunately, it forces us to restate the same syntactic constraint in many places.
    A second problem is that sequential composition does not allow us to insert new words inside old lattices, as needed to generate sentences like John looked it up.
    We have extended our notation to allow such constructions, but the full solution is to move to a unification-based framework, in which e-structures are replaced by arbitrary feature structures with syn, sem, and lat fields.
    Of course, this requires extremely efficient handling of the disjunctions inherent in large word lattices.
  
  
    We implemented a medium-sized grammar of English based on the ideas of the previous section, for use in experiments and in the JAPANGLOSS machine translation system.
    The system converts a semantic input into a word lattice, sending the result to one of three sentence extraction programs: tio
