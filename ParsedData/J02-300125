 as for each annotated frame element, and matching each frame element with the parse constituent with the same beginning and ending points.
    Punctuation was ignored in this computation.
    Because of parsing errors, or, less frequently, mismatches between the parse tree formalism and the FrameNet annotation standards, for 13% of the frame elements in the training set, there was no parse constituent matching an annotated frame element.
    The one case of systematic mismatch between the parse tree formalism and the FrameNet annotation standards is the FrameNet convention of including both a relative pronoun and its antecedent in frame elements, as in the first frame element in the following sentence: Mismatch caused by the treatment of relative pronouns accounts for 1% of the frame elements in the training set.
    During testing, the largest constituent beginning at the frame element&#8217;s left boundary and lying entirely within the element was used to calculate the frame element&#8217;s features.
