abilities computed over the 100- word contexts, and global probabilities, probabilities computed over the entire corpus.
  There is a trade-off be- tween measurement error and bias error.
  The local prob- abilities tend to be more prone to measurement error whereas the global probabilities tend to be more prone to bias error.
  We seek to determine the relevance of the larger corpus to the conditional sample in order to find the optimal trade-off between bias and measurement er- ror.
  The interpolation procedure makes use of a prior expec- tation of how much we expect the local probabilities to differ from the global probabilities.
  In their author iden- tification work Mosteller and Wallace "expect[ed] both authors to have nearly identical rates for almost any word" (p. 61).
  In fact, just as they had anticipated, we have found that only 2% of the vocabulary in the Federalist corpus has significantly different probabilities depending on the author.
  In contrast, we expect fairly large differences in the
