ng Japanese input into words and morphemes (Asahara &amp; Matsumoto, 2000) has been linked to at least the LKB and PET systems.
    Support for connecting implementations of language-specific pre-processing packages of this kind will be preserved and extended as the matrix develops.
    Likewise, configuration files are included to support generation, at least within the LKB, provided that the grammar conforms to certain assumptions about semantic representation using the Minimal Recursion Semantics framework.
    Finally, a methodology is under development for constructing and using test suites organized around a typology of linguistic phenomena, using the implementation platform of the [incr tsdbo)] profiling package (Oepen &amp; Flickinger, 1998; Oepen &amp; Callmeier, 2000).
    These test suites will enable better communication about current coverage of a given grammar built using the matrix, and serve as the basis for identifying additional phenomena that need to be addressed cross-linguistically within
