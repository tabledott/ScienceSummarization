e between clusters.
    All such algorithms begin by placing each observation in a unique cluster, i.e. a cluster of one.
    The two closest clusters are merged to form a new cluster that replaces the two merged clusters.
    Merging of the two closest clusters continues until only some specified number of clusters remain.
    However, our data does not immediately lend itself to a distance&#8212;based interpretation.
    Our features represent part&#8212;of&#8212;speech (POS) tags, morphological characteristics, and word co-occurrence; such features are nominal and their values do not have scale.
    Given a POS feature, for example, we could choose noun = 1, verb = 2, adjective = 3, and adverb = 4.
    That adverb is represented by a larger number than noun is purely coincidental and implies nothing about the relationship between nouns and adverbs.
    Thus, before we employ either clustering algorithm, we represent our data sample in terms of a dissimilarity matrix.
    Suppose that we have N observations
