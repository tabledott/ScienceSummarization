ifier based on the labeled English reviews, and then translate Chinese reviews into English reviews.
    Lastly, we use the classifier to classify the translated English reviews.
    2) We first translate the labeled English reviews into Chinese reviews, and then learn a classifier based on the translated Chinese reviews with labels.
    Lastly, we use the classifier to classify the unlabeled Chinese reviews.
    The above two methods have been used in (Banea et al., 2008) for Romanian subjectivity analysis, but the experimental results are not very promising.
    As shown in our experiments, the above two methods do not perform well for Chinese sentiment classification, either, because the underlying distribution between the original language and the translated language are different.
    In order to address the above problem, we propose to use the co-training approach to make use of some amounts of unlabeled Chinese reviews to improve the classification accuracy.
    The co-training approach can make full u
