			In fact, the largest sourceof English dependency trees is automatically gener ated from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993)and is by convention exclusively projective.
			However, there are certain examples in which a non projective tree is preferable.
			Consider the sentenceJohn saw a dog yesterday which was a Yorkshire Ter rier.
			Here the relative clause which was a YorkshireTerrier and the object it modifies (the dog) are sep arated by an adverb.
			There is no way to draw the dependency tree for this sentence in the plane withno crossing edges, as illustrated in Figure 2.
			In lan guages with more flexible word order than English, such as German, Dutch and Czech, non-projective dependencies are more frequent.
