roblems, and make it easier to update one sub-model with other modules unchanged.
    Beyond the MaxEnt-based reordering model, another feature deserving attention in our system is the CKY style decoder which observes the ITG.
    This is different from the work of Zens et. al.
    (2004).
    In their approach, translation is generated linearly, word by word and phrase by phrase in a traditional way with respect to the incorporation of the language model.
    It can be said that their decoder did not violate the ITG constraints but not that it observed the ITG.
    The ITG not only decreases reorderings greatly but also makes reordering hierarchical.
    Hierarchical reordering is more meaningful for languages which are organized hierarchically.
    From this point, our decoder is similar to the work by Chiang (2005).
    The future work is to investigate other valuable features, e.g. binary features that explain blocks from the syntactical view.
    We think that there is still room for improvement if more
