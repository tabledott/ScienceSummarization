    In the four-class case, metric labeling and regression seem roughly equivalent.
    One possible interpretation is that the relevant structure of the problem is already captured by linear regression (and perhaps a different kernel for regression would have improved its three-class performance).
    However, according to additional experiments we ran in the four-class situation, the test-set-optimal parameter settings for metric labeling would have produced significant improvements, indicating there may be greater potential for our framework.
    At any rate, we view the fact that metric labeling performed quite well for both rating scales as a definitely positive result.
    Q: Metric labeling looks like it&#8217;s just combining SVMs with nearest neighbors, and classifier combination often improves performance.
    Couldn&#8217;t we get the same kind of results by combining SVMs with any other reasonable method?
    A: No.
    For example, if we take the strongest base SVM method for initial l
