amp;quot;the fact (SBAR that besoboru is played with a ball and a bat)&amp;quot;), and it is not uncommon for extraction to occur through several constituents, (e.g., &amp;quot;The changes (SBAR that he said the government was prepared to make TRACE)&amp;quot;).
    The second reason for an integrated treatment of traces is to improve the parameterisation of the model.
    In particular, the subcategorisation probabilities are smeared by extraction.
    In examples 1, 2 and 3 above 'bought' is a transitive verb, but without knowledge of traces example 2 in training data will contribute to the probability of 'bought' being an intransitive verb.
    Formalisms similar to GPSG (Gazdar et al. 95) handle NP extraction by adding a gap feature to each non-terminal in the tree, and propagating gaps through the tree until they are finally discharged as a trace complement (see figure 5).
    In extraction cases the Penn treebank annotation co-indexes a TRACE with the WHNP head of the SBAR, so it is straightforward to a
