s at a fixed distance from the referring expression.
    The three ranges of &#945; that we observed (middle, high, and low) show agreement on the identity of discourse antecedents, their position in the dialogue, and their position relative to referring expressions, respectively.
    The middle range shows variability of up to 10 percentage points, depending on the distance metric chosen.
    The lesson is that once we start using weighted measures we cannot anymore interpret the value of &#945; using traditional rules of thumb such as those proposed by Krippendorff or by Landis and Koch.
    This is because depending on the way we measure agreement, we can report &#945; values ranging from 0.122 to 0.998 for the very same experiment!
    New interpretation methods have to be developed, which will be task- and distance-metric specific.
    We&#8217;ll return to this issue in the conclusions.
    Word sense tagging is one of the hardest annotation tasks.
    Whereas in the case of partof-speech and dialogue a
