s inclined to hand out judgements of 4, 3, and 2.
    The judgement of 4 in the first case will go to a vastly better system output than in the second case.
    We therefore also normalized judgements on a per-sentence basis.
    The normalized judgement per sentence is the raw judgement plus (0 minus average raw judgement for this judge on this sentence).
    Systems that generally do better than others will receive a positive average normalizedjudgement per sentence.
    Systems that generally do worse than others will receive a negative one.
    One may argue with these efforts on normalization, and ultimately their value should be assessed by assessing their impact on inter-annotator agreement.
    Given the limited number of judgements we received, we did not try to evaluate this.
    Confidence Interval: To estimate confidence intervals for the average mean scores for the systems, we use standard significance testing.
    Given a set of n sentences, we can compute the sample mean x&#65533; and sample va
