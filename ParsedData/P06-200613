ed stack and lookahead symbol, so that, unlike a standard PCFG, the model discriminates between derivations which only differ in the order of application of the same rules and also conditions rule application on the PoS tag of the lookahead token.
    When there is no parse rooted in the start category, the parser returns a connected sequence of partial parses which covers the input based on subanalysis probability and a preference for longer and non-lexical subanalysis combinations (e.g.
    Kiefer et al., 1999).
    In these cases, the GR graph will not be fully connected.
    The HMM tagger has been trained on 3M words of balanced text drawn from the LOB, BNC and Susanne corpora, which are available with handcorrected CLAWS tags.
    The parser has been trained from 1.9K trees for sentences from Susanne that were interactively parsed to manually obtain the correct derivation, and also from 2.1K further sentences with unlabelled bracketings derived from the Susanne treebank.
    These bracketings guide the
