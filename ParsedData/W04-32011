 empirical utility of models such as logistic regression and support vector machines (SVMs) in flat classification tasks like text categorization, word-sense disambiguation, and relevance routing has been repeatedly demonstrated.
    For sequence tasks like part-of-speech tagging or named-entity extraction, recent top-performing systems have also generally been based on discriminative sequence models, like conditional Markov models (Toutanova et al., 2003) or conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001).
    A number of recent papers have considered discriminative approaches for natural language parsing (Johnson et al., 1999; Collins, 2000; Johnson, 2001; Geman and Johnson, 2002; Miyao and Tsujii, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004; Kaplan et al., 2004; Collins, 2004).
    Broadly speaking, these approaches fall into two categories, reranking and dynamic programming approaches.
    In reranking methods (Johnson et al., 1999; Collins, 2000; Shen et al., 2003), an initial parser is used to generate a number of c
