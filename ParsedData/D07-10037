 words representation?which, after all, is simply a real-valued feature vector?with syntactic features.
			The usual similarity measures can then be used onthe new feature representation.
			For example, Punyakanok et al (2004) used approximate tree match ing and tree-edit-distance to compute a similarity score between the question and answer parse trees.Similarly, Shen et al (2005) experimented with de pendency tree kernels to compute similarity between parse trees.
			Cui et al (2005) measured sentencesimilarity based on similarity measures between de pendency paths among aligned words.
			They used heuristic functions similar to mutual information to 23 assign scores to matched pairs of dependency links.
			Shen and Klakow (2006) extend the idea furtherthrough the use of log-linear models to learn a scor ing function for relation pairs.Echihabi and Marcu (2003) presented a noisy channel approach in which they adapted the IBM model 4 from statistical machine translation (Brown et al, 1990; Brown et al, 1993
