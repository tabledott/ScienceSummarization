sponds to the correct assignment in Figure 9 is then: [NP1-ARG1, VBD1-PRED, PP1-ARG4, NP3-ARGM-TMP] Features from Local Models.
    All features included in the local models are also included in our joint models.
    In particular, each template for local features is included as a joint template that concatenates the local template and the node label.
    For example, for the local feature PATH, we define a joint feature template that extracts PATH from every node in the candidate argument sequence and concatenates it with the label of the node.
    Both a feature with the specific argument label and a feature with the generic back-off ARG label are created.
    This is similar to adding features from identification and classification models.
    In the case of the example candidate argument sequence provided, for the node NP1 we have the features: {(NPTSIVPIVBD)-ARG1, (NPTSIVPIVBD)-ARG} When comparing a local and a joint model, we use the same set of local feature templates in the two models.
    If these we
