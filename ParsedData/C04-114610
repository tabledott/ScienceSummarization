rpus (BNC).
			3.1 Experimental set-up.
			The data from which sets of nearest neighbours are derived is direct-object data for 2000 nouns extracted from the BNC using a robust accurate statistical parser (RASP) (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002).
			For reasons of computational efficiency,we limit ourselves to 2000 nouns and directobject relation data.
			Given the goal of comparing neighbour sets generated by different mea sures, we would not expect these restrictions to affect our findings.
			The complete set of 2000 nouns (WScomp) is the union of two sets WShigh and WSlow for which nouns were selected on the basis of frequency: WShigh contains the 1000 most frequently occurring nouns (frequency &gt; 500), and WSlow contains the nouns ranked 3001-4000 (frequency ? 100).
			By excludingmid-frequency nouns, we obtain a clear sepa ration between high and low frequency nouns.The complete data-set consists of 1,596,798 cooccurrence tokens distributed over 331,079 co occurrence types.
			From this data, we computedthe
