    But now we face a question left open in Section 2: what does &amp;quot;uniform&amp;quot; mean?
    A mathematical measure of the uniformity of a conditional distribution p(ylx) is provided by the conditional entropyl Four different scenarios in constrained optimization.
    P represents the space of all probability distributions.
    In (a), no constraints are applied, and all p E P are allowable.
    In (b), the constraint C1 narrows the set of allowable models to those that lie on the line defined by the linear constraint.
    In (c), two consistent constraints C1 and C2 define a single model p E C1 n C2.
    In (d), the two constraints are inconsistent (i.e., C1 11 C3 = 0); no p E P can satisfy them both.
    The entropy is bounded from below by zero, the entropy of a model with no uncertainty at all, and from above by log Y, the entropy of the uniform distribution over all possible lyi values of y.
    With this definition in hand, we are ready to present the principle of maximum entropy.
