etween the cost of a Type I error and the cost of a Type II error.
    Nevertheless, the proposed baseline does seem to provide a usable rough estimate of the lower bound on performance.
    Table 2 shows the baseline performance for each of the twelve words in Table 1.
    Note that performance is generally above the baseline as we would 8.
    Many of the systems mentioned in Table 2 including Yarowsky (1992) do not currently take advantage of the prior probabilities of the senses, so they would be at a disadvantage relative to the baseline if one of the senses had a very high prior, as is the case for the test word issue.
    9.
    In addition, the baseline doesn't deal as well as it could with skewed distributions.
    One could almost certainly improve the model of the baseline by making use of a notion like entropy that could deal more effectively with skewed distributions.
    Nevertheless, we will stick with our simpler notion of the baseline for expository convenience. hope.
