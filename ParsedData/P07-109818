s as they proved very important for question classification.
    Figure 4 reports the plot of the F1-measure of answer classifiers trained with all combinations of the above models according to different values of the cost-factor parameter, adjusting the rate between Precision and Recall.
    We see here that the most accurate classifiers are the ones using both the answer&#8217;s BOW and PT feature and either the question&#8217;s PT or BOW feature (i.e.
    Q(BOW) + A(PT,BOW) resp.
    Q(PT) + A(PT,BOW) combinations).
    When PT is used for the answer the simple BOW model is outperformed by 2 to 3 points.
    Hence, we infer that both the answer&#8217;s PT and BOW features are very useful in the classification task.
    However, PT does not seem to provide additional information to BOW when used for question representation.
    This can be explained by considering that answer classification (restricted to description questions) does not require question type classification since its main purpose is to detec
