Table 2 summarizes all senses of the noun &#8220;box&#8221;.
    The 10 synsets are mapped to 6 supersenses: &#8220;artifact&#8221;, &#8220;quantity&#8221;, &#8220;shape&#8221;, &#8220;state&#8221;, &#8220;plant&#8221;, and &#8220;act&#8221;.
    Three similar senses (2), (7) and (9), and the probably related (8), are merged in the &#8220;artifact&#8221; supersense.
    This process can help disambiguation because it removes subtle distinctions, which are hard to discriminate and increase the size of the class space.
    One possible drawback is that senses which one might want to keep separate, e.g., the most common sense box/container (1), can be collapsed with others.
    One might argue that all &#8220;artifact&#8221; senses share semantic properties which differentiate them from the other senses and can support useful semantic inferences.
    Unfortunately, there are no general solutions to the problem of sense granularity.
    However, major senses identified by Wordnet are maintained at the supersense
