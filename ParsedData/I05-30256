n standards exist, the differences are limited, and many words are still segmented in the same way across two different segmentation standards.
  As such, in our work, we attempt to incorporate corpora from other segmentation standards as ad- ditional training data, to help reduce the OOV problem.
  Specifically, the steps taken are: 1.
  Perform training with maximum entropy modeling using the original training corpus D0 annotated in a given segmentation stan- dard.
  Use the trained word segmenter to segment another corpus D annotated in a different segmentation standard.
  Suppose a Chinese character C in D is as- signed a boundary tag t by the word seg- menter with probability p. If t is identical to the boundary tag of C in the gold-standard 162 annotated corpus D, and p is less than some threshold ?, then C (with its surrounding context in D) is used as additional training data.
  Add all such characters C as additional train- ing data to the original training corpus D0, and train a new word segmenter u
