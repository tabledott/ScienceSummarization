o-level formalism (Karttunen et al.
  We follow two simple principles: (1) Inflected forms of the same word are mapped to the same canonical dictio- nary form.
  This applies to both regular and irregular forms.
  For example, in our English analyzer the surface forms happier and better are directly matched with the lexical forms happy and good, respectively, rather than some nonwords.
  As the distance between lexical and sur- face form increases, the mapping is easier to describe by allowing one or more intermediate l vels of representation.
  The solution we adopted combines the two- level rule formalism with the cascade model of finite-state morphology dis- cussed by Kaplan &amp; Kay [7].
  Composition oftwo-level rules (2) Morphological categories are repre- sented as part of the lexical form.
  Instead of encoding morphological categories such as Plural, Comparative, lstPerson as annota- tions on strings that realize them, we in- clude them directly in the lexical represen- tation.
  Consequently, our t
