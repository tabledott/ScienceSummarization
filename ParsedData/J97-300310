on, we will introduce a general schemata for guessing rules and a guessing rule will be seen as a particular instantiation of this schemata.
    A guessing-rule schemata is a structure G =x:{b,e} [&#8212;S +M ?I-class &#8212;4Z-class] where For example, the rule e[&#8212;ied +y ?
    (VB VBP) &#8212;*(JJ VBD VBN)] says that if there is an unknown word which ends with ied, we should strip this ending from it and append the string y to the remaining part.
    If we then find this word in the lexicon as (VB VBP) (base verb or verb of present tense non-3d form), we conclude that the unknown word is of the category (II VBD VBN) (adjective, past verb, or participle).
    Thus, for instance, if the word specified was unknown to the lexicon, this rule first would try to segment the required ending ied (specified &#8212; ied = specif), then add to the result the mutative segment y (specif + y = specify), and, if the word specify was found in the lexicon as (VB VBP), the unknown word specified would be classified as (I
