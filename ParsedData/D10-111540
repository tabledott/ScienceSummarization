; in particular, we will design a paraphrasing task similar to the one proposed by Mitchell and Lapata to evaluate noun-verb constructions.
    Since we do not collect vectors for the &#8220;functor&#8221; component of a composition process (for AN constructions, the adjective), our approach naturally extends to processes that involve bound morphemes, such as affixation, where we would not need to collect independent co-occurrence information for the affixes.
    For example, to account for re- prefixation we do not need to collect a re- vector (required by all other approaches to composition), but simply vectors for a set of V/reV pairs, where both members of the pairs are words (e.g., consider/reconsider).
    Our approach can also deal, out-of-the-box, with recursive constructions (sad little red hat), and can be easily extended to more abstract constructions, such as determiner N (mapping dog to the/a/one dog).
    Still, we need to design a good testing scenario to evaluate the quality of such model-gene
