gorithm stores context information of words, POS tags and chunking tags in a decision tree and classifies new items by comparing them to the training items.
    The algorithm is very fast and it reaches the same performance as (Argamon et al., 1998) (F0=1=91.6).
    (Daelemans et al., 1999) uses cascaded MBL (rB1-IG) in a similar way for several tasks among which baseNP recognition.
    They do not report Fo=i rates but their tag accuracy rates are a lot better than accuracy rates reported by others.
    However, they use the (R,amshaw and Marcus, 1995) data set in a different, training-test division (10-fold cross validation) which makes it difficult to compare their results with others.
  
  
    We have compared seven different data formats for the recognition of baseNPs with memory-based learning (lB1-10).
    The I0B1 format, introduced in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), consistently came out as the best format.
    However, the differences with other formats were not significant.
