 with the results of our experiments.
    Section 6 contains a discussion of the results.
  
  
    The anecdotal intuition in the field is that reduction of word sparsity often improves translation quality.
    This reduction can be achieved by increasing training data or via morphologically driven preprocessing (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005).
    Recent publications on the effect of morphology on SMT quality focused on morphologically rich languages such as German (Nie&#223;en and Ney, 2004); Spanish, Catalan, and Serbian (Popovi&#180;c and Ney, 2004); and Czech (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005).
    They all studied the effects of various kinds of tokenization, lemmatization and POS tagging and show a positive effect on SMT quality.
    Specifically considering Arabic, Lee (2004) investigated the use of automatic alignment of POS tagged English and affix-stem segmented Arabic to determine appropriate tokenizations.
    Her results show that morphological preprocessing helps, but only for the smaller corpora.
