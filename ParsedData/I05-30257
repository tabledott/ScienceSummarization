  Evaluate the accuracy of the new word seg- menter on the same test data annotated in the original segmentation standard of D0.
  For the current bakeoff, when training a word segmenter on a particular training corpus, the ad- ditional training corpora are all the three corpora in the other segmentation standards.
  For example, when training a word segmenter for the AS cor- pus, the additional training corpora are CITYU, MSR, and PKU.
