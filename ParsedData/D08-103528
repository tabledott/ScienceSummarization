    Table 1 presents the performance results for three instantiations of our Bayesian framework and three competitive alternative systems.
    As shown in the table, the Bayesian models achieve the best results on both metrics for both corpora.
    On the medical textbook corpus, the Bayesian systems achieve a raw performance gain of 2-3% with respect to all baselines on both metrics.
    On the ICSI meeting corpus, the Bayesian systems perform 4-5% better than the best baseline on the Pk metric, and achieve smaller improvement on the WindowDiff metric.
    The results on the meeting corpus also compare favorably with the topic-modeling method of Purver et al. (2006), who report a Pk of .289 and a WindowDiff of .329.
    Another observation from Table 1 is that the contribution of cue phrases depends on the dataset.
    Cue phrases improve performance on the meeting corpus, but not on the textbook corpus.
