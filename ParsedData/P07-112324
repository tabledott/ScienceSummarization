utomatically annotate the English side of an existing EnglishRomanian corpus, and subsequently project the annotations onto the Romanian side of the parallel corpus across the sentence-level alignments available in the corpus.
    For the automatic subjectivity annotations, we generated two sets of the English-side annotations, one using the high-precision classifier and one using the high-coverage classifier available in the OpinionFinder tool.
    The high-precision classifier in OpinionFinder uses the clues of the subjectivity lexicon to harvest subjective and objective sentences from a large amount of unannotated text; this data is then used to automatically identify a set of extraction patterns, which are then used iteratively to identify a larger set of subjective and objective sentences.
    In addition, in OpinionFinder, the high-precision classifier is used to produce an English labeled data set for training, which is used to generate its Naive Bayes high-coverage subjectivity classifier.
