at are also in the corresponding gold standard lists.
    Smoothing would be very costly (we would need to smooth all pairs that contain a target concept) and probably counterproductive (as the most typical properties of a concept should be highly specific to it, rather than shared with neighbors).
    Because LRA (at least in a reasonably efficient implementation) requires a priori specification of the target pairs, it is not well suited to this task.
    Table 12 reports the percentage overlap with the gold standard properties (averaged across the 44 concepts) for our models as well as the only ESSLLI 2008 participant that tried this task, and for the models of Baroni et al. (2010).
    TypeDM is the best DM model, and it also does quite well compared to the state of the art.
    The difference between Strudel, the best model from the earlier literature, and TypeDM is not statistically significant, according to a paired t-test across the target concepts (t = 1.1, df = 43, p = 0.27).
    The difference betwe
