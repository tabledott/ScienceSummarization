    There are two central limitations to this paradigm, however.
    The first is the often very poor accuracy of word alignments, due both to the current limitations of word-alignment algorithms, and also to the often weak or incomplete inherent match between the two sides of a bilingual corpus.
    The paper will address and handle this problem through robust, noise-tolerant learning algorithms capable of being trained effectively on incomplete and highly inaccurate alignments.
    The second limitation is the potential mismatch in the annotation needs of two languages; not all distinctions that may be desirable for one language (such as grammatical gender in French) are compatible or even present in a parallel language such as Eng
