se 2: damit/so that Sie/you das/them eventuell/perhaps bei/in der/the Abstimmung/vote uebernehmen/adopt koennen/can These two clauses illustrate a number of syntactic phenomena in German which lead to quite different word order from English: Position of finite verbs.
    In Clause 1, which is a matrix clause, the finite verb werde is in the second position in the clause.
    Finite verbs appear rigidly in 2nd position in matrix clauses.
    In contrast, in subordinate clauses, such as Clause 2, the finite verb comes last in the clause.
    For example, note that koennen is a finite verb which is the final element of Clause 2.
    Position of infinitival verbs.
    In German, infinitival verbs are final within their associated verb phrase.
    For example, returning to Figure 1, notice that aushaendigen is the last element in its verb phrase, and that uebernehmen is the final element of its verb phrase in the figure.
    Relatively flexible word ordering.
    German has substantially freer word order than Engl
