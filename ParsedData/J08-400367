= 0.0007).
    The only language that clearly diverges from this trend is German, where the relative improvement is much smaller than expected.
    If we compare the non-projective, list-based parser to the strictly projective stackbased parsers, we see essentially the same pattern but with a little more variation.
    For the arc-eager, stack-based parser, the only anomaly is the result for Arabic, which is significantly higher than the result for the non-projective parser, but this seems to be due to a particularly bad performance of the list-based parsers as a group for this language.12 For the arc-standard, stack-based parser, the data is considerably more noisy, which is related to the fact that the arc-standard parser in itself has a higher variance than the other parsers, an observation that we will return to later on.
    Still, the correlation between relative improvement in accuracy and percentage of non-projective dependencies is significant for both the arc-eager parser (r = 0.766, p = 0.001) and
