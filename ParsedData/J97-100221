nts do not always proceed along the route in an orderly fashion; as confusions arise, they often have to return to parts of the route that have already been discussed and that one or both of them thought had been successfully completed.
    In addition, participants occasionally overview an upcoming segment in order to provide a basic context for their partners, without the expectation that their partners will be able to act upon their descriptions (for instance, describing the complete route as &amp;quot;a bit like a diamond shape ... but ... a lot more wavy than that ... &amp;quot;).

    Other types of subdialogues are possible (such as checking the placement of all map landmarks before describing any of the route, or concluding the dialogue by reviewing th
