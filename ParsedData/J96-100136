variables are deemed far less similar than the old ones.
    This can be attributed to the fact that the number of &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;s in the original variables is far smaller.
    SI(X,Y) also suffers disproportionately from estimation errors when the observed counts of &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;s are very small.
    While all similarity measures will be inaccurate when the data is sparse, the results produced by specific mutual information can be more misleading than the results of other measures, because SI is not bounded.
    This is not a problem for our application, as Champollion applies absolute frequency thresholds to avoid considering very rare words and word groups; but it indicates another potential problem with the use of SI to measure similarity.
    Finally, another criterion for selecting a similarity measure is its suitability for testing for a particular outcome, where outcome is determined by the application.
    In our case, we need a clear-cut test to decide when two events are correlated.
