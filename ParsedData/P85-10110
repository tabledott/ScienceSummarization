  Some of the basic notions of TAGs were introduced in [Jo~hi,Levy, mad Takakashi I~Sl and by [Jo~hi, l~ l .
  A detailed investigation of the linguistic relevance of TAGs has been carried out in IKroch and Joshi,1985~.
  In this paper, we will describe some new results for TAGs, espe?ially in the following areas: (I) parsing complexity of TAGs, (2) some closure results for TAGs, and (3) the relationship to Head grammars.
  INTRODUCTION lnvestigatiou of constrained grammatical sys tem from the point of view of their linguistic &amp;leqnary and their computational tractability has been a mnjor concern of computational linguists for the last several years.
