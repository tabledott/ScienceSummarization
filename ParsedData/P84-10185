endent, with fewer internal variables and states; it is apt to work by monitoring constraints laid down in the formal description and ensuring that they are maintained, rather than carrying out long and complex sequences of steps in a carefully prescribed order.
    &#8226; These advantages are available in large measure through a class of formal devices that are slowly gaining acceptance in linguistics and which are based on the relations contracted by formal objects rather than by transformations of one formal object into another.
    These systems are all procedurally monotonic in the sense that, while new information may be added to existing data structures, possibly different information on different branches of a nondeterministic process, nothing is ever deleted or changed.
    As a result, the particular order in which elementary events take place is of little importance.
    Lexical Functional Grammar and Generalized Phrase-Structure grammar share these relational and monotonic properties.
