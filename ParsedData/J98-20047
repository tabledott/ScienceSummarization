paring the parsing accuracy obtained by each of our parsers as the number of edges they create increases.
  
  
    We used as our first grammar a probabilistic context-free grammar learned from the Brown corpus (see Francis and Kiera [1982] for a description of the Brown Corpus, and Carroll and Charniak [1992a, 199213], and Charniak and Carroll [1994] for grammar and training details).
    This grammar contains about 5,000 rules using 32 terminal and nonterminal symbols.
    We parsed 500 sentences of length 3 to 30 (including punctuation) from the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) using a best-first parsing method and various estimates for p(I\/;), to,n ) as the figure of merit.
    For each figure of merit, we compared the performance of best-first parsing using that figure of merit to exhaustive parsing.
    By exhaustive parsing, we mean continuing to parse until there are no more constituents available to be added to the chart.
    We parse exhaustively
