    The system then tries to find the target verb realization for the internal representation.
    If the concepts in the representation do not have any target verb realization, the system takes nearby concepts as candidates to see whether they have target verb realizations.
    If a target verb is found, an inexact match is performed with the target verb meaning and the internal representation, with the selection restrictions associated with the target verb being imposed on the input arguments.
    Therefore, the system has two measurements in this inexact match.
    One is the conceptual similarity of the internal representation and the target verb meaning, and the other is the degree of satisfaction of the selection restrictions on the verb arguments.
    We take the conceptual similarity, i.e., the meaning, as having first priority over the selection restrictions.
