ion work is done at a finer granularity than that suggested here, multi-paragraph segmentation has many potential applications.
    TextTiling is geared towards expository text; that is, text that explicitly explains or teaches, as opposed to, say, literary texts, since expository text is better suited to the main target applications of information retrieval and summarization.
    More specifically, TextTiling is meant to apply to expository text that is not heavily stylized or structured, and for simplicity does not make use of headings or other kinds of orthographic information.
    A typical example is a 5-page science magazine article or a 20-page environmental impact report.
    This section concentrates on two application areas for which the need for multiparagraph units has been recognized: hypertext display and information retrieval.
    There are also potential applications in some other areas, such as text summarization.
    Some summarization algorithms extract sentences directly from the text.
