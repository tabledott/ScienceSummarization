  edu ABSTRACT This paper addresses the issue of word-sense ambiguity in extraction from machine-readable resources for the con- struction of large-scale knowledge sources.
  We describe two experiments: one which ignored word-sense distinctions, re- sulting in 6.3% accuracy for semantic lassification of verbs based on (Levin, 1993); and one which exploited word-sense distinctions, resulting in 97.9% accuracy.
  These experiments were dual purpose: (1) to validate the central thesis of the work of (Levin, 1993), i.e., that verb semantics and syntactic behavior are predictably related; (2) to demonstrate hat a 15-fold improvement can be achieved in deriving semantic information
