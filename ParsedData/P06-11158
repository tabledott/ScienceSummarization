Through the states that border Texas whichrivers run??, which has the same MR as the sen tence in figure 3, then the order of the children of the node ?RIVER ? TRAVERSE(STATE)?
			wouldneed to be reversed.
			To accommodate this, a se mantic derivation tree is allowed to contain MR parse tree nodes in which the children have been permuted.
			Note that given a semantic derivation of an NL sentence, it is trivial to obtain the corresponding MR simply as the string generated by the parse.
			Since children nodes may be permuted, this step also needs to permute them back to the way they should be according to the MRL productions.
			If a semantic derivation gives the correct MR of the NL sentence, then we call it a correct semantic derivation otherwise it is an incorrect semantic derivation.
			2.2 Most Probable Semantic Derivation.
			Let Ppi(u) denote the probability that a production pi of the MRL grammar covers the NL substring u. In other words, the NL substring u expressesthe semantic concept of a producti
