the named entity for the current word is known.2 The pairwise features, over adjacent labels, are computed at the same time as features over binary rules.
    Binarization of the tree is necessary for efficient computation, so the trees consist solely of unary and binary productions.
    Because of this, for all pairs of adjacent words within an entity, there will be a binary rule applied where one word will be under the left child and the other word will be under the right child.
    Therefore, we compute features over adjacent words/labels when computing the features for the binary rule which joins them.
    We construct our joint model as an extension to the discriminatively trained, feature-rich, conditional random field-based, CRF-CFG parser of (Finkel and Manning, 2008).
    Their parser is similar to a chartbased PCFG parser, except that instead of putting probabilities over rules, it puts clique potentials over local subtrees.
    These unnormalized potentials know what span (and split) the rule is ov
