 by translating an existing source language lexicon, and then build a classifier that relies on the resulting lexicon.
    Below, we describe the translation process and discuss the results of an annotation study to assess the quality of the translated lexicon.
    We then describe and evaluate a lexicon-based target-language classifier.
    The subjectivity lexicon we use is from OpinionFinder (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005), an English subjectivity analysis system which, among other things, classifies sentences as subjective or objective.
    The lexicon was compiled from manually developed resources augmented with entries learned from corpora.
    It contains 6,856 unique entries, out of which 990 are multi-word expressions.
    The entries in the lexicon have been labeled for part of speech, and for reliability &#8211; those that appear most often in subjective contexts are strong clues of subjectivity, while those that appear less often, but still more often than expected by chance, are labeled weak.
