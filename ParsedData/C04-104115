es not allow it.The second strategy is to use Eisner?s normal form constraints (Eisner, 1996).

			Eis ner only deals with a grammar without type-raising,and so the constraints do not guarantee a normal form parse when using a grammar extracted from CCGbank.
			However, the constraints are still useful in restricting the derivation space.
			As far as we are aware, this is the first demonstration of the utility of such constraints for a wide-coverage CCG parser.
