and may be regarded as a Entity Given a set of machine-annotated named entities NESet = {NE1, .
    .., NEN}, the representativeness of a named entity NEi in NESet is quantified by its density.
    The density of NEi is defined as the average similarity between NEi and all the other entities NEj in NESet as follows.
    If NEi has the largest density among all the entities in NESet, it can be regarded as the centroid of NESet and also the most representative examples in NESet.
    Diversity criterion is to maximize the training utility of a batch.
    We prefer the batch in which the examples have high variance to each other.
    For example, given the batch size 5, we try not to select five repetitious examples at a time.
    To our knowledge, there is only one work (Brinker 2003) exploring this criterion.
    In our task, we propose two methods: local and global, to make the examples diverse enough in a batch.
    For a global consideration, we cluster all named entities in NESet based on the similarity mea
