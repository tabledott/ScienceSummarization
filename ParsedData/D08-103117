e on coreference in several languages, but for this work we focus on English text.
    We split the corpus into three sets: Train, Dev, and Test.
    Our test set contains the same 107 documents as Culotta et al. (2007).
    Our training set is a random 80% of the 336 documents in their training set and our Dev set is the remaining 20%.
    For our ablation study, we further randomly split our development set into two evenly sized parts, Dev-Tune and Dev-Eval.
    For each experiment, we set the parameters of our algorithm to optimize BCubed F-Score using Dev-Tune, and use those parameters to evaluate on the Dev-Eval data.
    For the experiments in Section 5, following Culotta et al. (2007), to make experiments more comparable across systems, we assume that perfect mention boundaries and mention type labels are given.
    We do not use any other gold annotated input at evaluation time.
    In Section 6 experiments we do not use any gold annotated input and do not assume mention types or boundaries are given.
