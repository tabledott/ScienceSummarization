ndo-European languages in its current form and can be extended to other affixational schema when appropriate.
    For many applications, once the vocabulary list achieves sufficiently broad coverage, this alignment table effectively becomes a morphological analyzer simply by table lookup (independent of necessary contextual ambiguity resolution).
    While the probabilistic analyzer trained in Step 2 remains useful for previously unseen words, such words are typically quite regular and most of the difficult substance of the lemmatization problem can often be captured by a large root+Posinflection mapping table and a simple transducer to handle residual forms.
    This is not the case for agglutinative languages such as Turkish or Finnish, or for very highly inflected languages such as Czech, where sparse data becomes an issue.
    But for many languages, and to a quite practical degree, inflectional morphological analysis and generation can be viewed primarily as an alignment task on a broad coverage wordlist
