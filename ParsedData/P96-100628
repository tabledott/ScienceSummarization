d with the most frequent heuristic on this set of words.
    Most recently, Yarowsky used an unsupervised learning procedure to perform WSD (Yarowsky, 1995), although this is only tested on disambiguating words into binary, coarse sense distinction.
    The effectiveness of unsupervised learning on disambiguating words into the refined sense distinction of WORDNET needs to be further investigated.
    The work of (McRoy, 1992) pointed out that a diverse set of knowledge sources are important to achieve WSD, but no quantitative evaluation was given on the relative importance of each knowledge source.
    No previous work has reported any such evaluation either.
    The work of (Cardie, 1993) used a case-based approach that simultaneously learns part of speech, word sense, and concept activation knowledge, although the method is only tested on domain-specific texts with domain-specific word senses.
  
  
    In this paper, we have presented a new approach for WSD using an exemplar based learning algorithm.
