example should be classified as TRUE, otherwise as FALSE.3 The precision (0.767) for the class TRUE is reasonably high: if a proof is found, then an entailment is indeed very likely.
			However, recall is very low (0.058) as only 30 proofs were found on the test set (for some examples see Section 3).
			This yields an F-measure of only 0.10for the TRUE class.
			Due to the low recall, the over all accuracy of the system (0.52, see Table 1) is not significantly higher than the baseline.
			Thus, this feature behaves in the opposite way to shallow lexical overlap and overgenerates the FALSE class.
			Missing lexical and background knowledge is the major cause for missing proofs.
			Experiment 4: Approximating entailment As discussed in Section 3.5 we now try to compensate for missing knowledge and improve recall for TRUE entailments by approximating entailment with the features that are furnished by the model builder.
			Thus, Experiment 4 uses all eight deep semantic analysis features, including the features c
