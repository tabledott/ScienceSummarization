ion of them are shown in Figure 3.
    We require that each tree has a unique representation as a set of connected chart items in .
    A packed representation satisfying the uniqueness condition is created using the CKY algorithm with the observable grammar , for instance.
    The approximate distribution, , is defined as a PCFG, whose CFG rules is defined as .
    We use to denote the rule probability of rule and to denote the probability with which is generated as a root node.
    We define as where the set of connected items is the unique representation of .
    To measure the closeness of approximation by , we use the &#8216;inclusive&#8217; KL-divergence, (Frey et al., 2000): Minimizing under the normalization constraints on and yields closed form solutions for &#10050; and , as shown in Figure 4. in and&#10050;out in Figure 4 are similar to ordinary inside/outside probabilities.
    We define&#10050;in as follows: If is a pre-terminal node , then&#10050;in above where and denote non-terminal symbols of
