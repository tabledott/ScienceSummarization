European Parliament 1996-2001.
    1755 sentences of length 5-15 were reserved for testing.
    In all experiments in Section 4.1-4.6 we translate from German to English.
    We measure performance using the BLEU score [Papineni et al., 2001], which estimates the accuracy of translation output with respect to a reference translation.
    First, we compared the performance of the three methods for phrase extraction head-on, using the same decoder (Section 2) and the same trigram language model.
    Figure 1 displays the results.
    In direct comparison, learning all phrases consistent with the word alignment (AP) is superior to the joint model (Joint), although not by much.
    The restriction to only syntactic phrases (Syn) is harmful.
    We also included in the figure the performance of an IBM Model 4 wordbased translation system (M4), which uses a greedy decoder [Germann et al., 2001].
    Its performance is worse than both AP and Joint.
    These results are consistent over training corpus sizes from 10,
