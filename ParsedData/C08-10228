			5.1 Prepositions.
			At the moment, we restrict our analysis to the nine most frequent prepositions in the data: at, by, for, from, in, of, on, to, and with, to ensure a sufficient amount of data for training.
			This gives a training dataset comprising 8,898,359 instances.
			We use a standard maximum entropy classifier 4 and donot omit any features, although we plan to experiment with different feature combinations to deter mine if, and how, this would impact the classifier?s performance.
			Before testing our model on learner data, it is important to ascertain that it can correctlyassociate prepositions to a given context in gram matical, well-edited data.
			We therefore tested themodel on a section of the BNC not used in train ing, section J. Our best result to date is 70.06% accuracy (test set size: 536,193).
			Table 3 relates our results to others reported in the literature on comparable tasks.
