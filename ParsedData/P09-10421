    For English and a handful of other languages, there are large, well-annotated corpora with a variety of linguistic information ranging from named entity to discourse structure.
    Unfortunately, for the vast majority of languages very few linguistic resources are available.
    This situation is likely to persist because of the expense of creating annotated corpora that require linguistic expertise (Abeill&#233;, 2003).
    On the other hand, parallel corpora between many resource-poor languages and resource-rich languages are ample, motivating recent interest in transferring linguistic resources from one language to another via parallel text.
    For example, several early works (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Yarowsky et al., 2001; Merlo et al., 2002) demonstrate transfer of shallow processing tools such as part-of-speech taggers and noun-phrase chunkers by using word-level alignment models (Brown et al.
