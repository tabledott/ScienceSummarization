  It is intuitive that the precision score for thi s response should be 2/2 = 1, since 2 out of 2 of the response links are "correct" .
  That is, both response links are arcs in the equivalence graph generated by the key .
  For recall, Sundheim et al .
  advance the desirable score of 2/3, which is not obtained by the syntacti c scoring measure.
  This score appeals to the intuitive notion that of the three links neces- sary to make the key entities fully coreferential, the response only provides two .
  Thinking model-theoretically, we note that the response corresponds to a subgraph of the fully-connected equivalence graph .
  The recall score of 2/3 aligns with the fact that one equivalence arc is required to "complete" the response graph, yielding one of the following four spanning trees .
  B LLC /e /e ms !/c / / Note that the problem with the syntactic (link-wise) scorer is that there are combina- tonally many such spanning trees for a given equivalence class, while keys only list one .
