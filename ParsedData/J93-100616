gh, it is even possible that it would provide a superior way of solving the problem for which our heuristic methods of morphological analysis were introduced.
    Its superiority would come from the fact that it would not depend on words being formed by concatenation, but would also accommodate such phenomena as umlaut, ablaut, vowel harmony, and the nonconcatenative process of Semitic morphology.
    The problems of treating recurring sequences are less severe.
    Data structures, such as the Patricia tree (Knuth 1973; pp.
    490-493) provide efficient means of identifying all such sequences and, once identified, the data they provide could be added to 141 Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 1 the WAT much as we now add the results of morphological analysis.
    Needless to say, this would only allow for uninterrupted sequences.
    Any attempt to deal with discontinuous sequences would doubtless also involve great combinatorial problems.
    These avenues for further development are intriguing and
