distinct article types, we verified that the verb classes behaved independently of each other.
    Correlations for EVCA classes are shown in Table 6.
    These show a markedly lower level of correlation between verb classes than the results for WordNet synsets, the range being from .265 between motion and aspectual verbs to &#8212;.026 for motion verbs and agreement verbs.
    These low values of .7- for pairs of verb classes reflects the independence of the classes.
    For example, the communication and experience verb classes are weakly correlated; this, we surmise, may be due to the different ways opinions can be expressed, i.e. as factual quotes using communication class verbs or as beliefs using experience class verbs.

    This paper reports results from two approaches, one using WordNet and other based on EVCA classes.
    However, the basis for comparison must be made explicit.
    In the case of WordNet, all verb tokens (n = 10K) were considered in all senses, whereas in the case of E
