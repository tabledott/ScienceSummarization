    The task of spelling correction is a task of finding, for a misspelling w, a correct word r 2 D, where D is a given dictionary and r is the most probable word to have been garbled into w. Equivalently, the problem is to find a word r for which is maximized.
    Since the denominator is constant, this is the same as maximizing P (r)P (wjr).
    In the terminology of noisy channel modeling, the distribution P(r) is referred to as the source model, and the distribution P (wjr) is the error or channel model.
    Typically, spelling correction models are not used for identifying misspelled words, only for proposing corrections for words that are not found in a dictionary.
    Notice, however, that the noisy channel model offers the possibility of correcting misspellings without a dictionary, as long as sufficient data is available to estimate the source model factors.
    For example, if r = Osama bin Laden and w = Ossama bin Laden, the model will predict that the correct spelling r is more likely t
