    Typically, statistical approaches, augmented with keyword or phrase matching, are used to lift from the article full sentences that can serve as a summary.
    Most of the work in this category produces a summary for a single article, although there are a few exceptions.
    The other two categories correspond to the two stages of processing that would have to be carried out if sentence extraction were not used: analysis of the input document to identify information that should appear in a summary and generation of a textual summary from a set of facts that are to be included.
    In this section, we first present work on sentence extraction, next turn to work on identifying information in an article that should appear in a summary, and conclude with work on generation of summaries from data, showing how this task differs from the more general language generation task.
    This is a systems-oriented perspective on summarization-related work, focusing on techniques that have been implemented
