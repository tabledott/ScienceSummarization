 only the new NML and JJP brackets is not very high.
    This shows the difficulty of correctly bracketing NPs.
    Conversely, the figures for all brackets except NML and JJP are only a tiny amount less in our extended corpus.
    This means that performance for other phrases is hardly changed by the new NP brackets.
    We also ran an experiment where the new NML and JJP labels were relabelled as NP and AnJP.
    These are the labels that would be given if NPs were originally bracketed with the rest of the Penn Treebank.
    This meant the model would not have to discriminate between two different types of noun and adjective structure.
    The performance, as shown in Table 8, was even lower with this approach, suggesting that the distinction is larger than we anticipated.
    On the other hand, the precision on NML and JJP constituents was quite high, so the parser is able to identify at least some of the structure very well.
