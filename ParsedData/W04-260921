antics is distinctly specified by the feature pair , written shortly as .
    Given feature pair , the probability of a semantic relation r is , defined as the ratio between the number of occurrences of a relation r in the presence of feature pair over the number of occurrences of feature pair in the corpus.
    The most probable relation is Since the number of possible noun synsets combinations is large, it is difficult to measure the quantities and on a training corpus to calculate .
    One way of approximating the feature vector is to perform a semantic generalization, by replacing the synsets with their most general hypernyms, followed by a series of specializations for the purpose of eliminating ambiguities in the training data.
    There are 9 noun hierarchies, thus only 81 possible combinations at the most general level.
    Table 5 shows a row of the probability matrix for .
    Each entry, for which there is more than one relation, is scattered into other subclasses through an iterative process till
