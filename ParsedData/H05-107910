e information from T and H alone, we also supply relevant background knowledge in the form of first-order axioms.
			Instead of giving justFOL(DRS(T);DRS(H)) to the theorem prover, we sup ply it with (BK ? FOL(DRS(T);DRS(H))) where BK is short for the relevant background knowledge.
			We generate background knowledge using threekinds of sources: generic knowledge, lexical knowl edge, and geographical knowledge.
			Axioms forgeneric knowledge cover the semantics of possessives, active-passive alternation, and spatial knowledge.
			There are about 20 different axioms in the current system and these are the only manually gener ated axioms.
			An example is ?e?x?y(event(e)?agent(e,x)?in(e,y)?in(x,y)) which states that if an event is located in y, then so is the agent of that event.
			Lexical knowledge is created automatically from WordNet.
			A hyponymy relation between two 630 synsets A and B is converted into ?x(A(x)?B(x)).
			Two synset sisters A and B are translated into ?x(A(x)?
			?B(x)).
