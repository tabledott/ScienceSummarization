    We present R-2 without stop words in the running text, but full development results are presented in table 1.
    Official DUC scoring utilizes the jackknife procedure and assesses significance using bootstrapping resampling (Lin, 2004).
    In addition to presenting automated results, we also present a user evaluation in section 5.2.
  
  
    We present a progression of models for multidocument summarization.
    Inference details are given in section 4.
    The SUMBASIC algorithm, introduced in Nenkova and Vanderwende (2005), is a simple effective procedure for multi-document extractive summarization.
    Its design is motivated by the observation that the relative frequency of a non-stop word in a document set is a good predictor of a word appearing in a human summary.
    In SUMBASIC, each sentence where PD(&#183;) initially reflects the observed unigram probabilities obtained from the document collection D. A summary S is progressively built by adding the highest scoring sentence according to
