lative reduction in error of roughly 13%, while introducing clusterbased features from dep2 to dep2c yields an additional relative error reduction of roughly 14%.
    As a final note, all 16 comparisons between cluster-based features and baseline features shown in Table 2 are statistically significant.14 We performed additional experiments to evaluate the effect of the cluster-based features as the amount of training data is varied.
    Note that the dependency parsers we use require the input to be tagged with parts of speech; thus the quality of the part-ofspeech tagger can have a strong effect on the performance of the parser.
    In these experiments, we consider two possible scenarios: for training both tagger and parser.
    Table 3 displays the accuracy of first- and secondorder models when trained on smaller portions of the Treebank, in both scenarios described above.
    Note that the cluster-based features obtain consistent gains regardless of the size of the training set.
    When the tagger is tra
