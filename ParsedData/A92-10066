r kernel&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;generator front end&amp;quot;.
    This distinction is mirrored exactly by the distinction between sentence planning and realization in Joyce.
    There are two main advantages to such a tripartite architecture, one conceptual and the other practical.
    Conceptually, the advantage is that linguistic planning tasks are clearly separated from the actual grammar, which comprises word order and morphological rules.
    These rules can be stated independently of the formulation of purely semantic rules that determine lexical and syntactic choices.
    This modularity makes the system more maintainable.
    The linguistic planning tasks should, however, be clearly separated from the textual planning tasks: while the linguistic planning tasks are languagedependent, the textual planning tasks appear not to be2.
    1Note that the tasks Meteer groups together as &amp;quot;Syntax&amp;quot; - choosing the syntactic structure and linearization - are inseparable only in certain synta
