    A number of recent papers have explored the potential of using the insideoutside algorithm to automatically learn a grammar (LY90, SJM90, PS92, BW92, CC92, SR093).
    Below, we describe a new technique for grammar induction.
    The algorithm works by beginning in a very naive state of knowledge about phrase structure.
    By repeatedly comparing the results of parsing in the current state to the proper phrase structure for each sentence in the training corpus, the system learns a set of ordered transformations which can be applied to reduce parsing error.
    We believe this technique has advantages over other methods of phrase structure induction.
    Some of the advantages include: the system is very simple, it requires only a very small set of transformations, a high degree of accuracy is achieved, and only a very small training corpus is necessary.
    The trained transformational parser is completely symbolic and can bracket text in linear time with respect to sentence length.
