the colloquial Canadian French-English pair, (Wo les moteurs, Hold your horses), where no clear word-toword connection can be drawn.
    Nearly all current decoding methods have shifted to phrasal representations, gaining the ability to handle noncompositional translations, but also allowing the decoder to memorize phenomena such as monolingual agreement and short-range movement, taking pressure off of language and distortion models.
    Despite the success of phrasal decoders, knowledge acquisition for translation generally begins with a word-level analysis of the training text, taking the form of a word alignment.
    Attempts to apply the same statistical analysis used at the word level in a phrasal setting have met with limited success, held back by the sheer size of phrasal alignment space.
    Hybrid methods that combine well-founded statistical analysis with high-confidence word-level alignments have made some headway (Birch et al., 2006), but suffer from the daunting task of heuristically exploring a
