system of springs or shock absorbers connecting the wheels and axles to the chassis of a wheeled vehicle?)
  HAS-A cushion/shock absorber/shock (?a mechanical damper; absorbs energy of sudden impulses?).
  Since relHS is the only measure that takes meronymy (and other WordNet relations beyond IS-A) into account, no other measure detected this connection ?
  nor did the hu- man judges, whose task was to assess similarity, not generic relatedness; see Section 4.1).
  Finally, at the bottom portion of these two graphs, the picture becomes very dif- ferent, because relHS assigns all weakly-related pairs the value of zero.
  (In fact, it is this cut-off that we believe to be largely responsible for the relatively low ranking of the correlation coefficient of the Hirst?St-Onge measure.)
  In contrast, two other measures, Resnik?s and Lin?s, behave quite similarly to each other in the low-similarity region.
  In particular, their sets of zero-similarity pairs are identical, because the definitions of both measures i
