 and the goal is to annotate the words within the groupings post hoc using a knowledge-based catalogue of senses.
    If successful, such an approach has obvious benefits: one can use whatever sources of good word groupings are available &#8212; primarily unsupervised word clustering methods, but also on-line thesauri and the like &#8212; without folding in the complexity of dealing with word senses at the same time.3 The resulting sense groupings should be useful for a variety of purposes, although ultimately this work is motivated by the goal of sense disambiguation for unrestricted text using unsupervised methods.
  
  
    Let us state the problem as follows.
    We are given a set of words W = {w1,.
    , /D}, with each word wz having an associated set Si = {si,i, , of possible senses.
    We assume that there exists some set W' C U Si, representing the set of word senses that an ideal human judge would conclude belong to the group of senses corresponding to the word grouping W. The goal is then to defin
