ications that do not contain a standard NLG syntactic/lexical realisation component, such as text simplification (see Section 3).
    In this paper we describe a fast and robust generator for the inflectional morphology of English that generates a word form given a specification of a lemma, a part-of-speech (PoS) label, and an inflectional type.
    The morphological generator was built using data from several large corpora and machine readable dictionaries.
    It does not contain an explicit lexicon or word-list, but instead comprises a set of morphological generalisations together with a list of exceptions for specific (irregular) word forms.
    This organisation into generalisations and exceptions can save time and effort in system development since the addition of new vocabulary that has regular morphology does not require any changes to the generator.
    In addition, the generalisation-exception architecture can be used to specify----and also override&#8212;preferences in cases where a lemma has more
