ts between TypeDM and the second-best DM model (DepDM) is highly significant (paired t-test, t = 4.02, df = 29, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting that the large variance is due to different degrees of difficulty of the concepts, affecting the models in similar ways.
    Links approximating the patterns proposed in Cimiano and Wenderoth (2007).
    automated generation of commonsense concept descriptions in terms of intuitively salient properties: a dog is a mammal, it barks, it has a tail, and so forth (Almuhareb 2006; Baroni and Lenci 2008; Baroni, Evert, and Lenci 2008; Baroni et al. 2010).
    Similar property lists, collected from subjects in elicitation tasks, are widely used in cognitive science as surrogates of mental features (Garrard et al. 2001; McRae et al.
    2005; Vinson and Vigliocco 2008).
    Large-scale collections of property-based concept descriptions are also carried out in AI, where they are important for commonsense reasoning (Liu and Singh 2004).
    In the qualia task, given a concept we had
