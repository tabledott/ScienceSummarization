set proportionally to and that is, each instance is weighted the same whether it is in or in and is set to 0.
    Similarly, using standard bootstrapping, training set is also weighted the same as a source instance.
    In neither case are the target instances emphasize more than source instances.
    However, for domain adaptation, we want to focus more on the target domain instances.
    So intuitively, we want to make and somehow larger relative to As we will show in Section 4, this is indeed beneficial.
    In general, the framework provides great flexibility for implementing different adaptation strategies through these instan ce weighting parameters.
  
  
    highest prediction confidence.
    For these instances, we set = 1 for y = arg maxy, and = 0 for all other y.
    In another word, we select the top k confidently predicted instances, and include these instances together with their predicted labels in the training set.
    All other instances in are not considered.
    In our experi sidered this b
