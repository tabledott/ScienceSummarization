 analysis illustrates that our next effort should focus on improving recall.
    In order to understand the limitations of our current system, we randomly selected 60 recall errors (20 for each mention type) and investigated their causes.
    Not surprisingly, the causes are unique to each type.
    For proper nouns, 50% of recall errors are due to mention lengthening, mentions that are longer than their earlier mentions.
    For example, Washingtonbased USAir appears after USAir in the text, so our head matching components skip it because their high precision depends on disallowing new modifiers as the discourse proceeds.
    When the mentions were reversed (as is the usual case), they match.
    The common noun recall errors are very different from proper nouns: 17 of the 20 random examples can be classified as semantic knowledge.
    These errors are roughly evenly split between recognizing categories of names (e.g., Gitano is an organization name hence it should match the nominal antecedent the company),
