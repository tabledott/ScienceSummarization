cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) provide significant coverage of the words encountered in the text, a significant portion of the tokens not covered by the lexicon are proper names and domain-specific terminology (cf., e.g., Meng et al (2000)).
    This lack of translations adversely affects performance.
    For CLIR applications in particular, proper names and technical terms are especially important, as they carry the most distinctive information in a query as corroborated by their relatively low document frequency.
    Finally, in interactive IR systems where users provide very short queries (e.g.
    2-5 words), their importance grows even further.
    Unlike specialized terminology, however, proper names are amenable to a speech-inspired translation approach.
    One tries, when writing foreign names in ones own language, to preserve the way it sounds. i.e. one uses an orthographic representation which, when &#8220;read aloud&#8221; by a speaker of ones language sounds as much like it would when
