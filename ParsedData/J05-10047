ct underlying semantic components that constrain allowable arguments.
  On this principle, Levin defines verb classes based on the ability of particular verbs to occur or not occur in pairs of syntactic frames that are in some sense meaning-preserving (diathesis alternations).
  The classes also tend to share some semantic component.
  For example, the break examples above are related by a transitive/intransitive alternation called the causative/inchoative alternation.
  Break and other verbs such as shatter and smash are also characterized by their ability to appear in the middle construction, as in Glass breaks/shatters/smashes easily.
  Cut, a similar change-of-state verb, seems to share in this syntactic behavior and can also appear in the transitive (causative) as well as the middle construction: John cut the bread, This loaf cuts easily.
  However, it cannot also occur in the simple intransitive: The window broke/*The bread cut.
  In contrast, cut verbs can occur in the conative?
