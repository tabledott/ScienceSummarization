bol after the first is made into a 4-tuple as described above, and fronted to the extraposition list.
    Thus, for example, the rule rel marker ... trace --&gt; rel pronoun.
    Furthermore, for each distinct non-leading nonterminal nt (with arity n) in the left-hand side of a rule of the XG, the translation includes the clause where `virtual(C,X0,X)', defined later, can be read as &amp;quot;C is the constituent between XO and X in the extraposition list&amp;quot;, and the variables Vi transfer the arguments of the symbol in the extraposition list to the predicate which translates that symbol.
    For example, the rule marker(Var), [the] ... [of.whom], trace(Var) --&gt; [whose]. which can be used in a more complex grammar of relative clauses to transform &amp;quot;whose X&amp;quot; into &amp;quot;the X of whom&amp;quot;, corresponds to the clauses: Finally, the two auxiliary predicates 'virtual' and 'terminal' are defined as follows:gap(x(gap,T,S,X)). gap([ ]). where 'connects' is as for DCGs.
