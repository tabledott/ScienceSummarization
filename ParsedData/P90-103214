he concordances and the parse trees would then be passed to Xstat.
    Sample results of Stage two are shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3.
    Figure 3 shows phrasal templates and open compounds.
    Xstat notices that the words &amp;quot;composite and &amp;quot;index&amp;quot; are used very rigidly throughout the corpus.
    They almost always appear in one of the two sentences.
    The lexical relation composite-index thus produces two phrasal templates.
    For the lexical relation average-industrial Xtract produces an open compound collocation as illustrated in figure 3.
    Stage two also confirms pairwise relations.
    Some examples are given in figure 2.
    By examining the parsed concordances and extracting recurring patterns, Xstat produces all three types of collocations.
  
  
    Such a wide variety of lexical associations would be difficult to use with any of the existing lexicon formalisms.
    We need a flexible lexicon capable of using single word entries, multiple word entries as well as phrasal t
