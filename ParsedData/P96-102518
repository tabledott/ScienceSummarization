he two constituents, and the other for the dependency between the head words of the two constituents. the head to the left and right end of the constituent, then the lower probability constituent can be safely discarded.
    Figure 4 shows how constituents in the chart combine in a bottom-up manner.
  
  
    The parser was trained on sections 02- 21 of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 93) (approximately 40,000 sentences), and tested on section 23 (2,416 sentences).
    For comparison SPATTER (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94) was also tested on section 23.
    We use the PARSEVAL measures (Black et al. 91) to compare performance: number of correct constituents in proposed parse number of constituents in proposed parse number of correct constituents in proposed parse number of constituents in treebank parse of constituents which violate constituent boundaries with a constituent in the treebank parse.
    For a constituent to be 'correct' it must span the same set of words (ign
