is not a heuristic method, but an efficient exhaustive one.
    This is what assures that the choG 5 sen cover is optimal.
    This assumes, in addition to the scores actually being correct, that the scores are compositional, in the sense that the combined score for a set of components really represents their quality as a group.
    This might not be the case, for example, if gaps or overlaps are allowed in some cases (perhaps where they contain the same words in the same positions).
    We calculate the combined score for a sequence of D 2 components as the weighted average of their individual scores.
    Weighting by length is necessary so that G 5 the same components, when combined in a different order, produce the same combined scores.
    Otherwise the algorithm can produce inconsistent results.
    E 8.8 The chart walk algorithm can also be thought of as filling in the two-dimensional dynamic-programming arrayl .
    Figure 4 shows an intermediate point in the filling of the array.
