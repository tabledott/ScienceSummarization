o-croatian, Ukrainian) also show these characteristics.
    Many European languages exhibit FWO and HI phenomena to a lesser extent.
    Thus the techniques and results found for Czech should be relevant to parsing several other languages.
    This paper first describes a baseline approach, based on the parsing model of (Collins 97), which recovers dependencies with 72% accuracy.
    We then describe a series of refinements to the model, giving an improvement to 80% accuracy, with around 82% accuracy on newspaper/business articles.
    (As a point of comparison, the parser achieves 91% dependency accuracy on English (Wall Street Journal) text.)
  
  
    The Prague Dependency Treebank PDT (Hap, 1998) has been modeled after the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 93), with one important exception: following the Praguian linguistic tradition, the syntactic annotation is based on dependencies rather than phrase structures.
    Thus instead of &amp;quot;nonterminal&amp;quot; symbols used at the non-leaves of the tree, t
