mmatical relations between pairsof words were extracted.
			The relationships ex tracted were the following: ? Noun (assumed to be subject) Verb ? Verb Noun (assumed to be object) ? Adjective Noun?
			Noun Noun (often the first noun is modify ing the second) ? Noun and/or Noun The last of these relationships often occurs when the pair of nouns is part of a list.
			Since lists are usually comprised of objects which are similar in some way, these relationships have been used to extract lists of nouns with similar properties (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) (Roarkand Charniak, 1998).
			In this paper we too focus on nouns co-occurring in lists.
			This is be cause the noun and/or noun relationship is the only symmetric relationship in our model, andsymmetric relationships are much easier to ma nipulate than asymmetric ones.
			Our full graph contains many directed links between words of different parts of speech.
			Initial experiments with this model show considerable promise but are at too early a stage to be repo
