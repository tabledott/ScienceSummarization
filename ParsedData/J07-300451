in a similar way to relative clauses and treating Which as syntactic head of the WHNP, we obtain the desired CCG analysis: We coindex the head of the extracted NP with that of the noun (cars): (S[wq]/(S[q]/ NPi))/Ni, and the subject of do with the subject of its complement ((S[q]/(S[b]\NP1))/NPi) to obtain the following dependencies: In this example, we need to rebracket the Treebank tree so that details of forms a constituent,18 apply a special rule to assign the category (NP\NP)/NP to the preposition, and combine it via type-raising and composition with details.
    This constituent is then treated as an argument of the relative pronoun: With appropriate coindexation ((NP\NPi)/(S[dcl]\NPj))\(NP/NPi)j, we obtain the following non-local dependencies:19 Because adjuncts generally do not extract unboundedly,20 the corresponding traces (which account for 20% of all *T* traces) can be ignored by the translation procedure.
    Instead, the dependency between when and dropped is directly established by the fact tha
