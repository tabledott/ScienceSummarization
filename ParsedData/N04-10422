fficulty modeling multiple non-independent features of the observation sequence.
    The second technique is based on discriminatively-trained SVM classifiers (Han et al., 2003).
    These SVM classifiers can handle many nonindependent features.
    However, for this sequence labeling problem, Han et al. (2003) work in a two stages process: first classifying each line independently to assign it label, then adjusting these labels based on an additional classifier that examines larger windows of labels.
    Solving the information extraction problem in two steps looses the tight interaction between state transitions and observations.
    In this paper, we present results on this research paper meta-data extraction task using a Conditional Random Field (Lafferty et al., 2001), and explore several practical issues in applying CRFs to information extraction in general.
    The CRF approach draws together the advantages of both finite state HMM and discriminative SVM techniques by allowing use of arbitrary, depende
