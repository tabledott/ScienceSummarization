s reason, we apply the more general Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which permits sampling arbitrary transformations of the latent variables.
    In our framework, such transformations correspond to moves through the space of possible segmentations.
    A new segmentation z0 is drawn from the previous hypothesized segmentation z based on a proposal distribution q(z0|z).4 The probability of accepting a proposed transformation depends on the ratio of the joint probabilities and a correction term for asymmetries in the proposal distribution: The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm guarantees that by accepting samples at this ratio, our sampling procedure will converge to the stationary distribution for the hidden variables z.
    When cue phrases are included, the observation likelihood is written: As in Section 3.2, we can marginalize over the language models.
    We obtain a product of DCM distributions: one for each segment, and one for all cue phrases in the dataset.
