ve Bayes and SVMlight on these new vectors.11 As can be seen from line (2) of Figure 3, better performance (much better performance for SVMs) is achieved by accounting only for feature presence, not feature frequency.
    Interestingly, this is in direct opposition to the observations of McCallum and Nigam (1998) with respect to Naive Bayes topic classification.
    We speculate that this indicates a difference between sentiment and topic categorization &#8212; perhaps due to topic being conveyed mostly by particular content words that tend to be repeated &#8212; but this remains to be verified.
    In any event, as a result of this finding, we did not incorporate frequency information into Naive Bayes and SVMs in any of the following experiments.
    Bigrams In addition to looking specifically for negation words in the context of a word, we also studied the use of bigrams to capture more context in general.
    Note that bigrams and unigrams are surely not conditionally independent, meaning that the feature
