rther cleaning up process of the 500-abstract set, and at the same time, initial annotation of the remaining abstracts is being done, so that the full GENIA set of 2000 ab stracts will be annotated with tree structure.
			For parsers to be useful for information ex traction, they have to establish a map between syntactic structure and more semantic predicate argument structure, and between the linguistic predicate-argument structures to the factual relation to be extracted.
			Annotation of various in formation on a same set of text can help establish these maps.
			For the factual relations, we are annotating relations between proteins and genes in cooperation with a group of biologists.
			For predicate-argument annotation, we are in vestigating the use of the parse results of the Enju parser.
			Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to annotators and colleagues that helped the construction of the corpus.
