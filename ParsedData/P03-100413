is a frequent subset and w(s) is its weight.
    We use a TRIE to efficiently store the set Q.
    The example of such TRIE compression is shown in Figure 2.
    Although there are many implementations for TRIE, we use a Double-Array (Aoe, 1989) in our task.
    The actual classification of PKE can be examined by traversing the TRIE for all subsets s E Fd(X).
  
  
    To demonstrate performances of PKI and PKE, we examined three NLP tasks: English BaseNP Chunking (EBC), Japanese Word Segmentation (JWS) and Japanese Dependency Parsing (JDP).
    A more detailed description of each task, training and test data, the system parameters, and feature sets are presented in the following subsections.
    Table 1 summarizes the detail information of support examples (e.g., size of SVs, size of feature set etc.).
    Our preliminary experiments show that a Quadratic Kernel performs the best in EBC, and a Cubic Kernel performs the best in JWS and JDP.
    The experiments using a Cubic Kernel are suitable to evaluate the
