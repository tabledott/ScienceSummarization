d such as pen can be used to automatically determine its sense.
    This method has some limitations, since many ambiguities are preserved in the target language (e.g., French souris&#8212;English mouse); furthermore, the few available large-scale parallel corpora are very specialized (for example, the Hansard corpus of Canadian Parliamentary Debates), which skews the sense representation.'
    Dagan, Itai, and Schwall (1991) and Dagan and Itai (1994) propose a similar method, but instead of a parallel corpus use two monolingual corpora and a bilingual dictionary.
    This solves, in part, the problems of availability and specificity of domain that plague the parallel corpus approach, since monolingual corpora, including corpora from diverse domains and genres, are much easier to obtain than parallel corpora.
    Ide and Veronis Introduction Other methods attempt to avoid entirely the need for a tagged corpus, such as many of those cited in the section below (e.g., Yarowsky [1992] who attacks both the tagging
