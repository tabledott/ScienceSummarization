ic machines, and the space efficiency achievable with new minimization algorithms for sequential transducers.
    Both time and space concerns are important when dealing with language.
    Indeed, one of the recent trends in language studies is a large increase in the size of data sets.
    Lexical approaches have been shown to be the most appropriate in many areas of computational linguistics ranging from large-scale dictionaries in morphology to large lexical grammars in syntax.
    The effect of the size increase on time and space efficiency is probably the main computational problem of language processing.
    The use of finite-state machines in natural language processing is certainly not new.
    The limitations of the corresponding techniques, however, are pointed out more often than their advantages, probably because recent work in this field is not yet described in computer science textbooks.
    Sequential finite-state transducers are now used in all areas of computational linguistics.
