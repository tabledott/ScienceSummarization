on practice in clustering in general.
    Sch&#168;utze represents contexts in a high dimensional feature space that is created using a separate large corpus (referred to as the training corpus).
    He selects features based on their frequency counts or log-likelihood ratios in this corpus.
    In this paper, we adopt Sch&#168;utze&#8217;s approach and select features from a separate corpus of training data, in part because the number of test instances may be relatively small and may not be suitable for selecting a good feature set.
    In addition, this makes it possible to explore variations in the training data while maintaining a consistent test set.
    Since the training data used in unsupervised clustering does not need to be sense tagged, in future work we plan to develop methods of collecting very large amounts of raw corpora from the Web and other online sources and use it to extract features.
    Sch&#168;utze represents each feature as a vector of words that co&#8211;occur with that feature in th
