tion is as a fix to the first solution.
    For &amp;quot;=1&amp;quot; we substitute the relation rw-identical, and by means of axiom schema (17), we force substitutions to propagate to the eventualities they occur in, and we force the distinction between referentially transparent and referentially opaque predicates to be made explicitly.
    It is thus an indirect way of rejecting Leibniz' Law.
    The third solution is to say that 'the Evening Star' in sentence (14) does not really refer to the Evening Star, but to some abstract entity somehow related to the Evening Star.
    That is, sentence (14) is really an example of metonymy.
    This may seem counterintuitive, and even bizarre, at first blush.
    But in fact the most widely accepted classical solutions to the problem of identity are of this flavor.
    For Frege (1892) 'the Evening Stars in sentence (14) does not refer to the Evening Star but to the sense of the phrase 'the Evening Star'.
    In a more recent approach.
    Zalta (1983) takes such no
