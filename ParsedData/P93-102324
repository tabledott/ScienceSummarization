ng them.
    Second, groups 1 and 6 clearly identify separate sets of non-gradable adjectives.
    The first contains adjectives that describe the geographical scope of the problem.
    Although at first sight we would classify these adjectives as non-scalar, we observed that the phrase international, even global, problem is acceptable while the phrase *global, even international, problem is not.
    These patterns seem to suggest at least some degree of scalability.
    On the other hand, group 6 contains non-scalar relational adjectives that specify the nature of the problem.
    It is interesting to note here that the clustering algorithm discourages long groups, with the expected number of adjectives per cluster being -&#167;- ---- 2.33; nevertheless, the evidence for the adjectives in group 6 is strong enough to allow the creation of a group with more than twice the expected number of members.
    Finally, note that even in group 4 which is the weakest group produced, there is a positive semantic correla
