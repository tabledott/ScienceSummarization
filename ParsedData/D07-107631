			?= + and a is the coefficient (a is set to 0.3 using cross-validation).
			7 Here, we use the same set of flat features (i.e. word,.
			entity type, mention level, overlap, base phrase chunking, dependency tree, parse tree and semantic informa tion) as Zhou et al(2005).
			734 Table 3 evaluates the performance of the composite kernel.
			It shows that the composite kernel much further improves the performance beyond that of either the state-of-the-art linear kernel or our tree kernel and achieves the F-measures of 74.1 and 75.8 on the major relation types of the ACE RDC 2003 and 2004 corpora respectively.
			This suggests that our tree kernel and the state-of-the-art linear kernel are quite complementary, and that our composite kernel can effectively integrate both flat and structured features.
