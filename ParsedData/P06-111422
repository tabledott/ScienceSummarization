    The experiments reported in this paper suggest that current TE systems may be able to provide open-domain Q/A systems with the forms of semantic inference needed to perform accurate answer validation.
    While probabilistic or web-based methods for answer validation have been previously explored in the literature (Magnini et al., 2002), these approaches have modeled the relationship between a question and a (correct) answer in terms of relevance and have not tried to approximate the deeper semantic phenomena that are involved in determining answerhood.
    Our work suggests that considerable gains in performance can be obtained by incorporating TE during both answer processing and passage retrieval.
    While best results were obtained using the Hybrid Method (which boosted performance by nearly 28% for questions with known EATs), each of the individual methods managed to boost the overall accuracy of the Q/A system by at least 7%.
