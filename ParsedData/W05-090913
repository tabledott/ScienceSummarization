s only one chunk* In the other extreme, if there are no bigram or longer matches, there are as many chunks as there are unigram matches* The penalty is then computed through the following formula: &#65533; #unigrams matched _ For example, if the system translation was &amp;quot;the president spoke to the audience&amp;quot; and the reference translation was &amp;quot;the president then spoke to the audience&amp;quot;, there are two chunks: &amp;quot;the president&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;spoke to the audience&amp;quot;* Observe that the penalty increases as the number of chunks increases to a maximum of 0.5.
    As the number of chunks goes to 1, penalty decreases, and its lower bound is decided by the number of unigrams matched* The parameters if this penalty function were determined based on some experimentation with deveopment data, but have not yet been trained to be optimal* Finally, the METEOR Score for the given alignment is computed as follows: data sets, the MT evaluation systems analyzed in this paper
