tors, including discourse relations, because few empirical studies exist that directly link discourse structure with text quality.
    In the past, subsections of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) have been annotated for discourse relations (Carlson et al., 2001; Wolf and Gibson, 2005).
    For our study we chose to work with the newly released Penn Discourse Treebank which is the largest annotated resource which focuses exclusively on implicit local relations between adjacent sentences and explicit discourse connectives.
    The Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008) is a new resource with annotations of discourse connectives and their senses in the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994).
    All explicit relations (those marked with a discourse connective) are annotated.
    In addition, each adjacent pair of sentences within a paragraph is annotated.
    If there is a discourse relation, then it is marked implicit and annotated with one or more connectives.
