NR* Right Node Raising *EXP* EXPletive Figure 2: The four forms of pseudo-attachment Here, the SINVnode marks an inverted S structure, and the -TPC tag (ToPiC) marks a fronted (topicalized) constituent; the -GLR tag is discussed below.
  D ISCONTINUOUS CONSTITUENTS Many otherwise clear argument/adjunct relations in the current corpus cannot be recovered ue to the essentially context-free representation of the current Treebank.
  For ex- ample, currently there is no good representation for sentences in which constituents which serve as complements o the verb occur after a sententiM level adverb.
  Either the adverb is trapped within the VP, so that the complement can occur within the VP, where it belongs, or else the adverb is at- tached to the S, closing off the VP and forcing the comple- ment to attach to the S. This "trapping" problem serves as a limitation for groups that currently use Treebank material to semiautomatically derive lexicons for particular applications.
  To solve "trapping" problems and ann
