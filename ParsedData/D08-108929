ults for Arabic-English are shown in Ta bles 5 and 6.
			Similarly to C-E, we provide results for two orientation sets: {M,S,D} and {M,S,Dl,Dr}.
			We note that the four-class orientation set is overall less effective for A-E than for C-E.
			This is probably due to the fact that there is less probability mass in A-E assigned to the D category, and thus it is less helpful to split the discontinuous category into two.
			For both orientation sets, we observe in A-E that the hierarchical model significantly outperforms thelocal ordering models.
			Gains provided by the hierarchical model are no less significant than for Chinese to-English.
			This positive finding is perhaps a bitsurprising, since Arabic-to-English translation gen erally does not require many word order changes compared to Chinese-to-English translation, and thistranslation task so far has seldom benefited from hierarchical approaches to MT. In our case, one possi ble explanation is that Arabic-English translation is benefiting from the fact th
