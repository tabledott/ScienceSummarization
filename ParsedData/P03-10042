we use a polynomial kernel, all feature combinations are implicitly expanded without loss of generality and increasing the computational costs.
    Although the mapped feature space is quite large, the maximal margin strategy (Vapnik, 1995) of SVMs gives us a good generalization performance compared to the previous manual feature selection.
    This is the main reason why kernel-based learning has delivered great results to the field of NLP.
    Kernel-based text analysis shows an excellent performance in terms in accuracy; however, its inefficiency in actual analysis limits practical application.
    For example, an SVM-based NE-chunker runs at a rate of only 85 byte/sec, while previous rulebased system can process several kilobytes per second (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002).
    Such slow execution time is inadequate for Information Retrieval, Question Answering, or Text Mining, where fast analysis of large quantities of text is indispensable.
    This paper presents two novel methods that make the kernel-based
