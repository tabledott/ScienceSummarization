es of each predicate in the corpus (the British National Corpus was used) and annotating each frame element.
    The example sentences were chosen primarily for coverage of all the syntactic realizations of the frame elements, and simple examples of these realizations were preferred over those involving complex syntactic structure not immediate relevant to the lexical predicate itself.
    From the perspective of an automatic classification system, the overrepresentation of rare syntactic realizations may cause the system to perform more poorly than it might on more statistically representative data.
    On the other hand, the exclusion of complex examples may make the task artificially easy.
    Only sentences where the lexical predicate was used &amp;quot;in frame&amp;quot; were annotated.
    A word with multiple distinct senses would generally be analyzed as belonging to different frames in each sense, but may only be found in the FrameNet corpus in the sense for which a frame has been defined.
