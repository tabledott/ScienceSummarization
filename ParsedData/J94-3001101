n to an equivalent iterative one.
    This is analogous to the contrast between center-embedding context-free grammars and grammars with only right- or left-linear rules; the latter are known to generate only regular languages.
    Unfortunately, phonological theories are usually not presented in enough formal detail for us to carry out such a mathematical analysis.
    The regularity of cyclic phonological formalisms will have to be examined on a case-by-case basis, taking their more precise specifications into account.
    We have shown that every noncyclical rewriting grammar does denote a regular relation.
    We now consider the opposite question: Is every regular relation denoted by some noncyclic rewriting grammar?
    We can answer this question in the affirmative: Theorem Every regular relation is the set of input/output strings of some noncyclic rewriting grammar with boundary-context rules.
    Let R be an arbitrary regular relation and let T = (E, Q, go, F, 6) be a finite-state transducer that acc
