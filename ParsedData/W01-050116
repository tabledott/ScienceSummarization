 one for the left context classifier and one for the labeled data.
    (The right context classifier behaves similarly to the left, but its performance is slightly worse.)
    As shown, co-training results in improvement in test accuracy over the initial classifier after about 160 iterations, reducing by 36% the difference in error between the co-training classifier and the goal classifier.
    Unfortunately, the improvement in test accuracy does not continue as co-training progresses; rather, performance peaks, then declines somewhat before stabilizing at around 92.5%.
    We hypothesize that this decline is due to degradation in the quality of the labeled data.
    This hypothesis is supported by Figure 4b, indicating that labeled data accuracy decreases steadily before stabilizing at around 94%.
    Note that the accuracy of the classifier stabilizes at a point a bit lower than the stable accuracy of the labeled data, as would be expected if labeled data quality hinders further improvement from cotraining.
