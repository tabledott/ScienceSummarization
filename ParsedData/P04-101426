 the CCG formalism, and it is an interesting question whether efficient estimation and parsing algorithms can be defined for models which use all derivations.
    We have answered this question, and in doing so developed a new parsing algorithm for CCG which maximises expected recall of dependencies.
    We would like to extend the dependency model, by including the local-rule dependencies which are used by the normal-form model, for example.
    However, one of the disadvantages of the dependency model is that the estimation process is already using a large proportion of our existing resources, and extending the feature set will further increase the execution time and memory requirement of the estimation algorithm.
    We have also shown that a normal-form model performs as well as the dependency model.
    There are a number of advantages to the normal-form model: it requires less space and time resources for estimation and it produces a faster parser.
    Our normal-form parser significantly outperforms th
