  A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF LANGUAGE DATA ORIENTED PARSING RENS BOlt* Department of Computational I Jnguistics University of Amsterdmn Spuistraat 134 1012 VII Amsterdam The Netherlands rens@alf.let.uva.nl PERFORMANCE: Abstract 1)ata Oriented Parsing (IX)P) is a model where no abstract rules, but language xt~riences in the ti3ru~ of all ,malyzed COlpUS, constitute the basis for langnage processing.
  Analyzing a new input means that the system attempts to find tile most probable way to reconstruct the input out of frugments that alr"c~y exist ill the corpus.
  Disambiguation occurs as a side-effect.
  DOP can be implemented by using colivelllional parsing strategies.
  In~oducfion This paper tommlizes the model for natural Imlgnage introduced m [Sclm 199o].
  Since that article is written in Dutch, we will translate Some parts of it more or less literally in this introduction.
  According to Scba, the current radition of language processing systems is based on linguistically motivated competence models of natu
