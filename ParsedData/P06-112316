atically when one gap was allowed on the unconstrained (non-English) side of the bitext.
    Allowing two gaps on the non-English side led to almost complete coverage of these word alignments.
    Table 3 does not specify the number of gaps allowed on the English side, because varying this parameter never changed the outcome.
    The only way that a gap on that side could increase coverage is if there was a node in the constraining parse tree that had at least four children whose translations were in one of the complex permutations.
    The absence of such cases in the data implies that the failure rates under the constraints of one parse tree would be identical even if we allowed production rules of rank higher than two.
    Table 4 shows the alignment failure rates for the MTEval bitext.
    With word alignment constraints only, 3% of the sentence pairs could not be hierarchically aligned without gaps.
    Allowing a single gap on one side decreased this failure rate to zero.
