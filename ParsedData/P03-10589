3 lists the number of senses of each noun as given in the WordNet 1.7 sense inventory (Miller, 1990).
    We first lump together two senses s, and s2 of a noun if s, and s2 are translated into the same Chinese word.
    The number of senses of each noun after sense lumping is given in column 3 of Table 3.
    For the 7 nouns that are lumped into one sense (i.e., they are all translated into one Chinese word), we do not perform WSD on these words.
    The average number of senses before and after sense lumping is 5.07 and 3.52 respectively.
    After sense lumping, we trained a WSD classifier for each noun w, by using the lumped senses in the manually sense-tagged training data for w provided by the SENSEVAL-2 organizers.
    We then tested the WSD classifier on the official SENSEVAL-2 test data (but with lumped senses) for w. The test accuracy (based on fine-grained scoring of SENSEVAL-2) of each noun obtained is listed in the column labeled M1 in Table 3.
    We then used our approach of parallel text alignm
