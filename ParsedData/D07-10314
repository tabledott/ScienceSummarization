pirical and estimated tag frequencies similar to those observed here, and show that constraining the estimation procedure to preserve the empiricalfrequencies improves tagging accuracy.
			(This ap proach cannot be used in an unsupervised setting since the empirical tag distribution is not available).
			However, as Banko and Moore (2004) point out, the accuracy achieved by these unsupervised methodsdepends strongly on the precise nature of the su pervised training data (in their case, the ambiguity of the tag lexicon available to the system), which makes it more difficult to understand the behaviour of such systems.
	
	
			All of the experiments described below have the same basic structure: an estimator is used to infera bitag HMM from the unsupervised training cor pus (the words of Penn Treebank (PTB) Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al, 1993)), and then the resulting model is used to label each word of that corpus with one of the HMM?s hidden states.
