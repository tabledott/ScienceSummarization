bal tree topology, especially in applications which emphasis the whole tree structures, such as tree kernels.
    Pruning away local dependency relations by additional phrase structure information, phrase dependency parsing accelerates following processing of opinion relation extraction.
    To construct phrase dependency tree, we propose a method which combines results from an existing shallow parser and a lexical dependency parser.
    A phrase dependency tree is defined as T = (V , E ), where V is the set of phrases, E is the dependency relations among the phrases in V representing by direct edges.
    To reserve the word level dependencies inside a phrase, we define a nested structure for a phrase Ti in V : Ti = (U, Ei).
    Vi = {v1, v2, &#183; &#183; &#183; , vm} is the internal words, Ei is the internal dependency relations.
    We conduct the phrase dependency parsing in this way: traverses word level dependency tree in preorder (visits root node first, then traverses the children recursively).
