below: It seems that the nature of the lexical selection task in translation obeys Zipf's law.
    It means that, for all possible verb usages, a large portion is translated into a few target verbs, while a small portion might be translated into many different target verbs.
    Any approach that has a fixed number of target candidate verbs and provides no way to measure the meaning similarity among verbs, is not able to handle the new verb usages, i.e., the small portion outside the dictionary coverage.
