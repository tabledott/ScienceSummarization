gest that words with similar meanings should be near each other in a semantic taxonomy, and in particular will likely share a hypernym as a near parent.
    Our classifier for (m, n)-cousins is derived from the algorithm and corpus given in (Ravichandran et al., 2005).
    In that work an efficient randomized algorithm is derived for computing clusters of similar nouns.
    We use a set of more than 1000 distinct clusters of English nouns collected by their algorithm over 70 million webpages6, with each noun i having a score representing its cosine similarity to the centroid c of the cluster to which it belongs, cos(B(i, c)).
    We use the cluster scores of noun pairs as input to our own algorithm for predicting the (m, n)cousin relationship between the senses of two words i and j.
    If two words i and j appear in a cluster together, with cluster centroid c, we set our single coordinate input feature to be the minimum cluster score min(cos(B(i, c)), cos(B(j, c))), and zero otherwise.
    For each such noun
