onal forms derived from the same lemma, given a table of inflectional parts-of-speech, a list of the canonical suffixes for each part of speech, and a list of the candidate noun, verb and adjective roots of the language.
    Their algorithm does not handle multiple affixes per word.
    (Goldsmith 2000) presents an unsupervised technique based on the expectationmaximization algorithm and minimum description length to segment exactly one suffix per word, resulting in an F-score of 81.8 for suffix identification in English according to (Schone and Jurafsky 2001).
    (Schone and Jurafsky 2001) proposes an unsupervised algorithm capable of automatically inducing the morphology of inflectional languages using only text corpora.
    Their algorithm combines cues from orthography, semantics, and contextual information to induce morphological relationships in German, Dutch, and English, among others.
    They report Fscores between 85 and 93 for suffix analyses and between 78 and 85 for circumfix analyses in these l
