   The results are in Table 4.
    For F1 evaluation, which is on a very small set of sentences, we selected 500 as the value with the best speed/performance tradeoff.
    However, when reranking our entire MT corpus, we used a value of 200, sacrificing a tiny bit of performance for an extra factor of 2 in speed.8 Since our bitext parser currently operates as a reranker, the quality of the trees is limited by the quality of the k-best lists produced by the baseline parsers.
    To test this limitation, we evaluated performance on the dev set using baseline k-best lists of varying length.
    Training parameters were fixed (full training setup with k = 100) and test set pruning was disabled for these experiments.
    The results are in Table 5.
    The relatively modest gains with increasing k, even as the oracle scores continue to improve, indicate that performance is limited more by the model&#8217;s reliance on the baseline parsers than by search errors that result from the reranking approach.
    Our final
