 can be done in without dramatically increasing computational complexity.
    For this reason, we introduce a clone operation, which allows a copy of a node from the source tree to be made anywhere in the target tree.
    After the clone operation takes place, the transformation of source into target tree takes place using the tree decomposition and subtree alignment operations as before.
    The basic algorithm of the previous section remains unchanged, with the exception that the alignments &#945; between children of two elementary trees can now include cloned, as well as inserted, nodes on the target side.
    Given that &#945; specifies a new cloned node as a child of Ej, the choice of which node to clone is made as in the tree-to-string model: Because a node from the source tree is cloned with equal probability regardless of whether it has already been &#8220;used&#8221; or not, the probability of a clone operation can be computed under the same dynamic programming assumptions as the basic tree-to-tree m
