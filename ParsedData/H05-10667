			2.2 Maximum Spanning Trees.
			We represent the generic directed graph G = (V,E) by its vertex set V = {v1, . . .
			, vn} and set E ? [1 : n]?
			[1 : n] of pairs (i, j) of directed edges vi ? vj .Each such edge has a score s(i, j).
			Since G is di rected, s(i, j) does not necessarily equal s(j, i).
			A maximum spanning tree (MST) of G is a tree y ? E that maximizes the value ?
			(i,j)?y s(i, j) such thatevery vertex in V appears in y. The maximum pro jective spanning tree of G is constructed similarlyexcept that it can only contain projective edges rel ative to some total order on the vertices of G. The MST problem for directed graphs is also known as the maximum arborescence problem.
			For each sentence x we define the directed graph Gx = (Vx, Ex) given by Vx = {x0 = root, x1, . . .
			, xn} Ex = {(i, j) : i 6= j, (i, j) ? [0 : n] ? [1 : n]} That is, Gx is a graph with the sentence words and the dummy root symbol as vertices and a directed edge betw
