    Using FrameNet would also have the advantage of providing large amounts of labelled test data for our evaluation.
    We also hope to integrate some processing of adjunct roles, rather than limiting ourselves to the specified arguments.
    A unique aspect of our method is the probability model, which is novel in its generalizations over verb, slot, and noun classes for role labelling.
    However, these have room for improvement&#8212;our noun classes are coarse, and prepositions clearly have the potential to be divided into more informative subclasses, such as spatial or time relations.
    Our ongoing work is investigating better class models to make the backoff process even more effective.
