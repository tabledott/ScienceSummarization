    We develop a set of heuristics that rapidly develop a probabilistic morphological grammar, and use MDL as our primary tool to determine whether the modifications proposed by the heuristics will be adopted or not.
    The resulting grammar matches well the analysis that would be developed by a human morphologist.
    In the final section, we discuss the relationship of this style of MDL grammatical analysis to the notion of evaluation metric in early generative grammar.
  
  
    This is a report on the present results of a study on unsupervised acquisition of morphology.'
    The central task of morphological analysis is the segmentation of words into the components that form the word by the operation of concatenation.
    While that view is not free of controversy, it remains the traditional conception of morphology, and the one that we shall employ here.'
    Issues of interface with phonology, traditionally known as morphophonology, and with syntax are not directly addressed.'
