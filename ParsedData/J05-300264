 science, primarily computational biology (Gusfield 1997).
    These algorithms aim to find an overlap subtree that captures structural commonality across a set of related trees.
    A typical tree similarity measure considers the proximity, at both the node and the edge levels, between input trees.
    In addition, some algorithms constrain the topology of the resulting alignment based on the domain-specific knowledge.
    These constraints not only narrow the search space but also increase the robustness of the algorithm in the presence of a weak similarity function.
    In the NLP context, this class of algorithms has been used previously in examplebased machine translation, in which the goal is to find an optimal alignment between the source and the target sentences (Meyers, Yangarber, and Grishman 1996).
    The algorithm operates over pairs of parallel sentences, where each sentence is represented by a structure-sharing forest of plausible syntactic trees.
    The similarity function is driven by lexica
