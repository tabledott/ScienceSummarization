has provided extra appropriate English words, but those particular words are not used in the reference sentences.
    An interesting example is the translation of the Chinese sentence &#8220;A&#65533; i&#65533; IRR &#65533;&#65533; &#65533;&#65533; &#195;~ Rz &#205; &#245; &#65533;&#65533; &#8221;.
    This is similar to the example mentioned earlier.
    In this case however, those extra English words provided by Hiero+WSD, though appropriate, do not result in more n-gram matches as the reference sentences used phrases such as &#8220;will not gain&#8221;, &#8220;will not get&#8221;, etc.
    Since the BLEU metric is precision based, the longer sentence translation by Hiero+WSD gets a lower BLEU score instead.
