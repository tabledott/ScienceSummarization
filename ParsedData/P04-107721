ily of the form k&#945; where &#945; &gt; 1.
    However, in order to normalize the final ROUGE-W score, we also prefer to have a function that has a close form inverse function.
    For example, f(k)=k2 has a close form inverse function f -1(k)=k1/2.
    F-measure based on WLCS can be computed as follows, given two sequences X of length m and Y of length n: Where f -1 is the inverse function of f. We call the WLCS-based F-measure, i.e.
    Equation 12, ROUGE-W.
    Using Equation 12 and f(k)=k2 as the weighting function, the ROUGE-W scores for sequences Y1 and Y2 are 0.571 and 0.286 respectively.
    Therefore, Y1 would be ranked higher than Y2 using WLCS.
    We use the polynomial function of the form k&#945; in the ROUGE evaluation package.
    In the next section, we introduce the skip-bigram cooccurrence statistics.
  
  
    Skip-bigram is any pair of words in their sentence order, allowing for arbitrary gaps.
    Skipbigram co-occurrence statistics measure the overlap of skip-bigrams between a candidat
