 noisy than Rooth et al.&#8217;s (1999) and Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth&#8217;s (2000), as it contains only words and nouns that occur in WordNet.
    Furthermore, Stephen Clark (personal communication, 2003) points out that WordNet-based approaches are at a disadvantage when it comes to pseudodisambiguation.
    Pseudodisambiguation assumes that the correct pair is unseen in the training data; this makes the task deliberately hard, because some of the pairs might be frequent enough that reliable corpus counts can be obtained without having to use WordNet (using WordNet is likely to be more noisy than using the actual counts).
    Another problem with WordNet-based approaches is that they offer no systematic treatment of word sense ambiguity, which puts them at a disadvantage with respect to approaches that do not rely on a predefined inventory of word senses.
    Finally, recall that the results for the EM-based approaches in Tables 13 and 14 were obtained on the development set (as pseudodisambiguation was
