 row labeled &#8220;Don&#8217;t care&#8221;), seeded with patterns for earnings reports and interest rate fluctuations.
    The last column shows the number of iterations before learning stopped.
    A sample of the discovered patterns3 appears in Table 2.
    For an indirect evaluation of the quality of the learned patterns, we employ the text-filtering evaluation strategy, as in (Yangarber et al., 2000).
    As a by-product of pattern acquisition, the algorithm acquires a set of relevant documents (more precisely, a distribution of document relevance weights).
    Rather than inspecting patterns on the-th iteration by hand, we can judge the quality of this pattern set based on the quality of the documents that the patterns match.
    Viewed as a categorization task on a set of documents, this is similar to the textdeny charge/wrongdoing/allegation appeal ruling/decision settle/deny claim/charge judge/court dismiss suit Company mislead investor/public filtering task in the MUC competitions.
