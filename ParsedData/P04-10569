ey should all have label-value 0.
    This type of constraint is enforced by the overlap template whose M operator matches any two overlapping candidate entities, and which connects their label nodes (specified in S) through a potential node with a potential function cb that allows at most one of them to have label-value 1, as illustrated in Table 2.
    Continuing with the previous example, because 'gintathione S' and 'S - transferase' are two overlapping entities, the factor graph model will contain an overlap potential node connected to the label nodes of these two entities.
    An alternative solution for the overlap template is to create a potential node for each token position that is covered by at least two candidate entities in the document, and connect it to their label nodes.
    The difference in this case is that the potential node will be connected to a variable number of entity label nodes.
    However this second approach has the advantage of creating fewer potential nodes in the document facto
