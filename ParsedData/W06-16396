cated (or overly terse) document if we find within it indications of agreement with a clearly positive text.
    Obviously, incorporating agreement information provides additional benefit only when the input documents are relatively difficult to classify individually.

    First, U.S. congressional debates contain very rich language and cover an extremely wide variety of topics, ranging from flag burning to international policy to the federal budget.
    Debates are also subject to digressions, some fairly natural and others less so (e.g., &#8220;Why are we discussing this bill when the plight of my constituents regarding this other issue is being ignored?&#8221;) Second, an important characteristic of persuasive language is that speakers may spend more time presenting evidence in support of their positions (or attacking the evidence presented by others) than directly stating their attitudes.
