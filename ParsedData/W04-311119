    As mentioned in the introduction, statistical taggers are being developed in parallel with the annotation effort.
    While such taggers are part of the final goal of the project, providing the building blocks for extracting entities and relations, they are also useful in the annotation process itself, so that the annotators only need to perform correction of automatically tagged data, instead of starting from scratch.
  
  
    We are currently annotating MEDLINE abstracts for both the oncology and CYP domains.
    The flowchart for the annotation process is shown in Figure 1.
    Tokenization, POS-tagging, entity annotation (both domains), and treebanking are in full production.
    Propbank annotation and the merging of the entities and treebanking remain to be integrated into the current workflow.
    The table in Figure 2 shows the number of abstracts completed for each annotation area.
    The annotation sequence begins with tokenization an
