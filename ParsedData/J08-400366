standard parsing strategy for the stack-based parsers, on the other.
    Before we turn to the evaluation of efficiency, we will try to analyze some of these differences in a little more detail, starting with the different techniques for capturing non-projective dependencies.
    First of all, we may observe that the non-projective, list-based parser outperforms its strictly projective counterpart for all languages except Chinese.
    The result for Chinese is expected, given that it is the only data set that does not contain any non-projective dependencies, but the difference in accuracy is very slight (0.19 percentage points).
    Thus, it seems that the non-projective parser can also be used without loss in accuracy for languages with very few non-projective structures.
    The relative improvement in accuracy for the non-projective parser appears to be roughly linear in the percentage of non-projective dependencies found in the data set, with a highly significant correlation (Pearson&#8217;s r = 0.815, p
