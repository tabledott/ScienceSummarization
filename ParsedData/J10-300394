 being that items deemed to be paraphrases may behave as such only in some contexts and not others.
    Szpektor, Shnarch, and Dagan (2007) posit a similar form of evaluation for textual entailment wherein the human judges are not only presented with the entailment rule but also with a sample of sentences that match its left-hand side (called instances), and then asked to assess whether the rule holds under each specific instance.
    Sentential paraphrases may be evaluated in a similar fashion without the need for any surrounding context (Quirk, Brockett, and Dolan 2004).
    An intrinsic evaluation of this form must employ the usual methods for avoiding any bias and for maximizing inter-judge agreement.
    In addition, we believe that, given the difficulty of this task even for human annotators, adherence to strict semantic equivalence may not always be a suitable guideline and intrinsic evaluations must be very carefully designed.
    A number of these approaches also perform extrinsic evaluations, in add
