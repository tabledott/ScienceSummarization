junction and selecting the two most similar series of words that can reasonably be considered as composing a conjunctive structure (see the lower part of Figure 1).
    This procedure is realized using a dynamic programming technique.
    In our syntactic analysis method, the first step is the detection of conjunctive structures by the above-mentioned algorithm.
    Since two or more conjunctive structures sometimes exist in a sentence with very complex interrelations, the second step is to adjust tangled relations that may exist between two or more conjunctive structures in the sentence.
    In this step conjunctive structures with incorrect overlapping relations, if they exist, are found and retrials of detecting their scopes are done.
    The third step of our syntactic analysis is a very common operation.
    Japanese sentences can best be explained by kakari-uke, which is essentially a dependency structure.
    Therefore our third step, after identifying all the conjunctive structures, is to perform depe
