annotation share some similarities with the predicate&#8211;argument dependencies output by the CCG parser; and we can directly compare our parser against a non-CCG parser, namely the RASP parser&#8212;and because we are converting the CCG output into the format used by RASP the CCG parser is not at an unfair advantage.
    There is also the SUSANNE GR gold standard (Carroll, Briscoe, and Sanfilippo 1998), on which the B&amp;C annotation is based, but we chose not to use this for evaluation.
    This earlier GR scheme is less like the dependencies output by the CCG parser, and the comparison would be complicated further by fact that, unlike CCGbank, the SUSANNE corpus is not based on the Penn Treebank.
    The GRs are described in Briscoe (2006), Briscoe and Carroll (2006), and Briscoe, Carroll, and Watson (2006).
    Table 13 contains the complete list of GRs used in the evaluation, with examples taken from Briscoe.
    The CCG dependencies were transformed into GRs in two stages.
    The first stage was to
