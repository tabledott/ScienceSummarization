chy.
    A chihuahua, for instance, can be referred to as either a chihuahua or a dog.
    The latter has a special status and is called the basic level value (see, e.g., Rosch [1978]).
    According to Dale and Reiter (1995) and Reiter (1990), human speakers have a general preference for basic level values and move to more specific (subsumed) values only if these are more informative.
    This notion of a subsumption hierarchy can be modeled using the cost function.
    For a given attribute, the basic level edges should be assigned the lowest costs, and those farthest away from the basic level edge should have the highest costs.
    This implies that adding an edge labeled dog is cheaper than adding an edge labeled chihuahua.
    Hence a chihuahua edge will be selected only when there are fewer (or less expensive) additional edges required to construct a distinguishing graph than would be the case for a graph including a dog edge.
    Note that (assuming that the scene representation is well defined) a dist
