dable form.
    The generated decision procedure is also easy to augment by hand, changing or adding patterns to the list.
    The algorithm is also extremely flexible &#8212; it is quite straightforward to use any new feature for which a probability distribution can be calculated.
    This is a considerable strength relative to other algorithms which are more constrained in their ability to handle diverse types of evidence.
    In a comparative study (Yarowsky, 1994), the decision list algorithm outperformed both an N-Gram tagger and Bayesian classifier primarily because it could effectively integrate a wider range of available evidence types than its competitors.
    Although a part-of-speech tagger exploiting gender and number agreement might resolve many accent ambiguities, such constraints will fail to apply in many cases and are difficult to apply generally, given the the problem of identifying agreement relationships.
    It would also be at considerable cost, as good taggers or parsers typically invol
