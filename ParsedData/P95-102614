    The algorithm should begin with seed words that accurately and productively distinguish the possible senses.
    Such seed words can be selected by any of the following strategies: Extract seed words from a dictionary's entry for the target sense.
    This can be done automatically, using words that occur with significantly greater frequency in the entry relative to the entire dictionary.
    Words in the entry appearing in the most reliable collocational relationships with the target word are given the most weight, based on the criteria given in Yarowsky (1993).
    Remarkably good performance may be achieved by identifying a single defining collocate for each class (e.g. bird and machine for the word crane), and using for seeds only those contexts containing one of these words.
    WordNet (Miller, 1990) is an automatic source for such defining terms.
    Words that co-occur with the target word in unusually great frequency, especially in certain collocational relationships, will tend to be re
