ent, respectively, qhese grammars are themselves written in a particular variant of TAGs; the choice of this base formalism, as we will call it, is free.
			In the case at hand, we have chosen single-component lexicalized TAGs with adjunction and substitution (Schabes et el., 1988).
			Later examples are built on other bases.
			The elementary operation in a synchronous TAG is su- pervenient on the elementary operations in the base for- malism.
			A derivation step from a pair of trees (cq, a2) proceeds as follows: 1.
			. Nondeterministically choose a link in the pair con- necting two nodes (say, nl in cq and no in c~2).
			Nondeterministically choose a pair of trees (3~, 32) in the grammar.
			Form the resultant pair &lt;/3t(oq, nl), ;32(~2, n2)).
			where 3(c~, n) is the result of performing a primi- tive operation in the base formalism on a at node n using 3 (e.g., adjoining or substituting 3 into at n).
			3 2We will generalize the links later to allow sets of nodes from one tree to be linked to sets fro
