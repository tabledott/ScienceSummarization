ity is in general exponential in the number of nonterminals on the right hand side of a grammar rule.
    To alleviate this problem, we investigate bilingual binarization to factor the synchronous grammar to a smaller branching factor, although it is not guaranteed to be successful for any synchronous rule with arbitrary permutation.
    In particular: &#8226; We develop a technique called synchronous binarization and devise a fast binarization algorithm such that the resulting rule set allows efficient algorithms for both synchronous parsing and decoding with integrated n-gram language models.
    &#8226; We examine the effect of this binarization method on end-to-end machine translation quality, compared to a more typical baseline method.
    &#8226; We examine cases of non-binarizable rules in a large, empirically-derived rule set, and we investigate the effect on translation quality when excluding such rules.
