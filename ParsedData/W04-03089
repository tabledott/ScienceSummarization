ns for the parsing to be incremental in this framework.
    Ideally, we would like to require that the graph (W &#8212;I, A) is connected at all times.
    However, given the definition of Left-Reduce and Right-Reduce, it is impossible to connect a new word without shifting it to the stack first, so it seems that a more reasonable condition is that the size of the stack should never exceed 2.
    In this way, we require every word to be attached somewhere in the dependency graph as soon as it has been shifted onto the stack.
    We may now ask whether it is possible to achieve incrementality with a left-to-right bottom-up dependency parser, and the answer turns out to be no in the general case.
    This can be demonstrated by considering all the possible projective dependency graphs containing only three nodes and checking which of these can be parsed incrementally.
    Figure 4 shows the relevant structures, of which there are seven altogether.
    We begin by noting that trees (2&#8211;5) can all be constru
