: a) precision is defined as the percentage of correct instances in the expansion of a seed set; and b) recall is defined as the percentage of non-seed gold standard instances retrieved by the system.
    Since the gold standard sets vary significantly in size, we also provide the R-precision metric to normalize for set size: For the above metrics, 95% confidence bounds are computed using the randomly generated samples described in Section 5.2.
  
  
    Our goal is to study the performance gains on set expansion using our Web-scale term similarity algorithm from Section 3.
    We present a large empirical study quantifying the importance of corpus and seeds on expansion accuracy.
    We extracted statistics to build our model from Section 3 using four different corpora, outlined in Table 2.
    The Wikipedia corpus consists of a snapshot of the English articles in December 20085.
    The Web100 corpus consists of an extraction from a large crawl of the Web, from Yahoo!, of over 600 million English webpages.
