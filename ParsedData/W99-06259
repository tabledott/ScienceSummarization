    In order to normalize for text length and frequency effects, we experimented with two types of optional normalization of feature values.
    The first is for text length (measured in words), where each feature value is normalized by the of the textual units in the pair. for of textual units feature values are divided by: length(A) x length(B) (1) This operation removes potential bias in favor longer text The second type of normalization we examined was based on the relative frequency of occurrence of each primitive.
    This is motivated the fact that infrequently primiare likely to have higher impact on similarity than primitives which match more frequently.
    We perform this normalization in manner similar to the IDF part of Every primitive element is associated with a value which is the numbe
