stant from 'sales' that it is unlikely that there will be a dependency.
    This suggests that distance is a crucial variable when deciding whether two words are related.
    It is included in the model by defining an extra 'distance' variable, A, and extending C, F and P to include this variable.
    For example, C( (a, b) , (c, d) , 6.) is the number of times (a, 6) and (c, d) appear in the same sentence at a distance A apart.
    (11) is then maximised instead of (10): A simple example of Aj,hi would be Aj,hi = hj &#8212; j.
    However, other features of a sentence, such as punctuation, are also useful when deciding if two words are related.
    We have developed a heuristic 'distance' measure which takes several such features into account The current distance measure Ai,h, is the combination of 6 features, or questions (we motivate the choice of these questions qualitatively &#8212; section 4 gives quantitative results showing their merit): Question 1 Does the kith word precede or follow the jth word?
