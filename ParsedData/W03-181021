positional multiwords which have low values for these statistics, yet are highly non-compositional.
    A good example is cock up; it is the lowest ranked for compostionality by the human judges, but its MI value is only 5.02, and according to MI it is ranked between the somewhat more compositional candidates tie down and come down.
    The automatic thesaurus measures such as sameparticle-simplex give a low compositionality score and place it at the end between carry out and latch on.
    There are also candidates with high values of the statistics, yet they are in the middle range of the compositionality judgements, for example, plod on.
    This is simply because of a high co-occurrence frequency.
    Whether such an unexpectedly high cooccurrence frequency warrants an entry in the lexicon depends on the type of lexicon being built.
  
  
    We can see that there is a significant relationship between the human compositionality judgements and some of the measures from the automatic thesaurus, particularly
