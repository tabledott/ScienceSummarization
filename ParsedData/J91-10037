les a comparison view of metaphor.
    The theory addresses literal similarity, analogy, abstraction, and anomaly, which Gentner refers to as four &amp;quot;kinds of comparison.&amp;quot; An algorithm compares the semantic information from two concepts represented as sets of properties.
    Properties are either &amp;quot;attributes,&amp;quot; one-place predicates like LARGE(x), or &amp;quot;relations,&amp;quot; two-place predicates such as COLLIDE(x,y).
    The four kinds of comparison are distinguished by the relative proportions of attributes and relations that are matched, and the forms of mappings established between them.
    Mappings between relations are sought before those between attributes.
    Pairs of relations are compared using the &amp;quot;systematicity principle&amp;quot; that regular structural correspondences should exist between terms occupying the same positions in those relations.
    Mappings are purely structural and independent of the content of the relations (i.e., the predicates).
