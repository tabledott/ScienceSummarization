    This is a standard device that simplifies both theoretical definitions and computational implementations.
  
  
    Given a set L = 1l1, ... ,l|L|} of dependency labels, a dependency graph for a sentence x = (w0, w1, ... , wn) is a labeled directed graph G = (V, A), where The set V of nodes (or vertices) is the set of non-negative integers up to and including n, each corresponding to the linear position of a word in the sentence (including ROOT).
    The set A of arcs (or directed edges) is a set of ordered triples (i, l, j), where i and j are nodes and l is a dependency label.
    Because arcs are used to represent dependency relations, we will say that i is the head and l is the dependency type of j. Conversely, we say that j is a dependent of i.
  
  
    A dependency graph G = (V, A) is well-formed if and only if: We will refer to conditions 1&#8211;3 as ROOT, SINGLE-HEAD, and ACYCLICITY, respectively.
    Any dependency graph satisfying these conditions is a dependency forest; if it is also connec
