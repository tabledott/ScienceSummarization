 and our joint probability model on a French-English parallel corpus of 100,000 sentence pairs from the Hansard corpus.
    The sentences in the corpus were at most 20 words long.
    The English side had a total of 1,073,480 words (21,484 unique tokens).
    The French side had a total of 1,177,143 words (28,132 unique tokens).
    We translated 500 unseen sentences, which were uniformly distributed across lengths 6, 8, 10, 15, and 20.
    For each group of 100 sentences, we manually determined the number of sentences translated perfectly by the IBM model decoder of Germann et al. (2001) and the decoder that uses the joint probje vais me arreter la . je vais me arreter la .
    9.46e&#8722;08 i am going to stop there . ability model.
    We also evaluated the translations automatically, using the IBM-Bleu metric (Papineni et al., 2002).
    The results in Table 1 show that the phrased-based translation model proposed in this paper significantly outperforms IBM Model 4 on both the subjective and objective met
