    No kernel combinations with both PAF and SCF produce an improvement.
    On 10Unfortunately the use of a polynomial kernel on top the tree fragments to generate the XOR functions seems not successful. the contrary, the performance decreases, suggesting that the classifier is confused by this syntactic information.
    The main reason for the different outcomes is that PropBank arguments are different from semantic roles as they are an intermediate level between syntax and semantic, i.e. they are nearer to grammatical functions.
    In fact, in PropBank arguments are annotated consistently with syntactic alternations (see the Annotation guidelines for PropBank at www.cis.upenn.edu/&#57738;ace).
    On the contrary FrameNet roles represent the final semantic product and they are assigned according to semantic considerations rather than syntactic aspects.
    For example, Cause and Agent semantic roles have identical syntactic realizations.
    This prevents SCF to distinguish between them.
