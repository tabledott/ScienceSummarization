tem we used to participate in the CoNLL-2005 shared task is an enhanced version of the system described in Sections 3 and 5.
  The main difference was that the joint-inference stage was extended to combine six basic SRL systems instead of two.
  Specifically for this implementation, we first trained two SRL systems that use Collins?s parser and Charniak?s parser, respectively, because of their noticeably dif- ferent outputs.
  In evaluation, we ran the system that was trained with Charniak?s parser five times, with the top-5 parse trees output by Charniak?s parser.
  Together we have six different outputs per predicate.
  For each parse tree output, we ran the first three stages, namely, pruning, argument identification, and argument classification.
  Then, a joint-inference stage, where each individual system is weighted equally, was used to resolve the inconsistency of the output of argument classification in these systems.
