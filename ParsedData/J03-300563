ncy data set.
    This is significantly higher than the highest performance of 72.4% reported by Clark and Weir (2002) on the same data set (x2(1) = 115.50, p &lt; .01).
    The joint probability model performs worse than the conditional model, at 81.1%.
    However, this is still significantly better than the best result of Clark and Weir (2002) (x2(1) = 63.14, p &lt; .01).
    The same pattern is observed for the high-frequency data set, on which the conditional probability model achieves 87.7% correct and thus significantly outperforms Clark and Weir (2002), who obtained 73.9% (x2(1) = 283.73, p &lt; .01).
    The joint probability model achieved 85.3% on this data set, also significantly outperforming Clark and Weir (2002) (x2(1) = 119.35, p &lt; .01).
    To summarize, we demonstrated that the simple Web-based approach proposed in this article yields results for pseudodisambiguation that outperform class-based smoothing techniques, such as the ones proposed by Resnik (1993), Li and Abe (1998), and Clark
