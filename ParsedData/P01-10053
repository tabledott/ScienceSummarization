 Martin, 1997), transformation-based learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997), differential grammars (Powers, 1997), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), and a variety of Bayesian classifiers (Gale et al., 1993, Golding, 1995, Golding and Schabes, 1996).
    In all of these approaches, the problem is formulated as follows: Given a specific confusion set (e.g.
    {to,two,too}), all occurrences of confusion set members in the test set are replaced by a marker; everywhere the system sees this marker, it must decide which member of the confusion set to choose.
    Confusion set disambiguation is one of a class of natural language problems involving disambiguation from a relatively small set of alternatives based upon the string context in which the ambiguity site appears.
    Other such problems include word sense disambiguation, part of speech tagging and some formulations of phrasal chunking.
    One advantageous aspect of confusion set disambiguation, which allows us to study the effects of large data sets on performance
