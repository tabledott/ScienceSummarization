is as above and S E J*, 1, ... , 9, &gt;_101 and * means any size.
    For example, if a nonterminal with span 11 has its contents reordered, then the features (true, &gt;_10) and (true, *) would both fire.
    Grouping all sizes of 10 or more into a single feature is designed to avoid overfitting.
    Again, using MIRA makes it practical to train with the full fine-grained feature set&#8212;coincidentally also a total of 34 features.
  
  
    We now describe our experiments to test MIRA and our features, the soft-syntactic constraints and the structural distortion features, on an Arabic-English translation task.
    It is worth noting that this experimentation is on a larger scale than Watanabe et al.&#8217;s (2007), and considerably larger than Marton and Resnik&#8217;s (2008).
    The baseline model was Hiero with the following baseline features (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007): The probability features are base-100 logprobabilities.
    The rules were extracted from all the allowable parallel text from the N
