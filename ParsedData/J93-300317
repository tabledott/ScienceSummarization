incident in a story.
    On the other hand, noncohesive uses, which we would characterize as sentential, tend to be of nonreduced, accented forms.
    So, perhaps it is the intonational information present in speech, but missing generally in transcription, which aids hearers in disambiguating between discourse and sentential uses of cue phrases.
    Empirical evidence from more general studies of the intonational characteristics of word classes tends to support this possibility.
    Studies of portions of the London&#8212;Lund corpus such as Altenberg (1987) have provided intonational profiles of word classes including discourse items, conjunctions and adverbials that are roughly compatible with the notion that cue phrases tend to be deaccented, although the notion of discourse item used in this study is quite restrictive.1 However, while the instance of now in Example 6 is in fact reduced, as Halliday and Hassan (1976) propose, that in Example 10, while interpreted as a discourse use, is nonetheless clearly
