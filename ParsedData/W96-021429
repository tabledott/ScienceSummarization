ty of getting the test set he described is less than one in a million.
    In the perl script for analyzing Bod's data is available by anonymous FTP from ftp://ftp.das.harvard.eduipub/goodman/analyze.perl 4Actually, this is a slight overestimate for a few reasons, including the fact that the 75 sentences are drawn without replacement.
    Also, consider a sentence with a production that occurs only in one other sentence in the corpus; there is some probability that both sentences will end up in the test data, causing both to be ungeneratable. lower right corner we give Bod the absolute maximum benefit of the doubt: we assume he used a parser capable of parsing unary branching productions, that he used a very overgenerating grammar, and that he used a loose definition of &amp;quot;Exact Match.&amp;quot; Even in this case, there is only about a 1.5% chance of getting the test set Bod describes.
  
  
    We have given efficient techniques for parsing the DO? model.
    These results are significant since the DO
