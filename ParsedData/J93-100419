iety of settings, such as genetic code sequences from different species, speech sequences from different speakers, gas chromatograph sequences from different compounds, and geologic sequences from different locations (Sankoff and Kruskal 1983).
    We could expect these matching techniques to be useful, as long as the order of the sentences does not differ too radically between the two languages.
    Details of the alignment techniques differ considerably from one application to another, but all use a distance measure to compare two individual elements within the sequences and a dynamic programming algorithm to minimize the total distances between aligned elements within two sequences.
    We have found that the sentence alignment problem fits fairly well into this framework, though it is necessary to introduce a fairly interesting innovation into the structure of the distance measure.
    Kruskal and Liberman (1983) describe distance measures as belonging to one of two classes: trace and time-warp.
