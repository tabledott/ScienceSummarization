 finding a small lexicon of highly frequent strings.
    Our work builds on probabilistic segmentation approaches such as Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2007).
    In these approaches, models with short description length are preferred.
    Probabilities are computed for both the morpheme lexicon and the representation of the corpus conditioned on the lexicon.
    A locally optimal segmentation is identified using a task-specific greedy search.
    In contrast to previous approaches, our model induces morphological segmentation for multiple related languages simultaneously.
    By representing morphemes abstractly through the simultaneous alignment and segmentation of data in two languages, our algorithm capitalizes on deep connections between morpheme usage across different languages.
  
  
    The underlying assumption of our work is that structural commonality across different languages is a powerful source of information for morphological analysis.
    In this section, we provide several examples that motiv
