as high dimensionality, an efficient computation of Equation 1 can be carried out explicitly since the input representations defined below are extremely sparse.
    In (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b), the authors observed that a relation between two entities is generally expressed using only words that appear simultaneously in one of the following three patterns: Fore-Between: tokens before and between the two candidate interacting entities.
    For instance: binding of [P1] to [P2], interaction involving [P1] and [P2], association of [P1] by [P2].
    Between: only tokens between the two candidate interacting entities.
    For instance: [P1] associates with [P2], [P1] binding to [P2], [P1], inhibitor of [P2].
    Between-After: tokens between and after the two candidate interacting entities.
    For instance: [P1] - [P2] association, [P1] and [P2] interact, [P1] has influence on [P2] binding.
    Our global context kernels operate on the patterns above, where each pattern is represented using a bag-of-words inst
