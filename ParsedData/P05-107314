 of labels to the nodes of the tree, we define the candidate argument sequence as the sequence of nonNONE labeled nodes [n1, l1, ... , vPRED, nm, lm] (li is the label of node ni).
    A reasonable candidate argument sequence usually contains very few of the nodes in the tree &#8211; about 2 to 7 nodes, as this is the typical number of arguments for a verb.
    To make it more convenient to express our feature templates, we include the predicate node v in the sequence.
    This sequence of labeled nodes is defined with respect to the left-to-right order of constituents in the parse tree.
    Since non-NONE labeled nodes do not overlap, there is a strict left-to-right order among these nodes.
    The candidate argument sequence that corresponds to the correct assignment in Figure 1 will be: [NP1-ARG1,VBD1-PRED,PP1-ARG4,NP3-ARGM-TMP] Features from Local Models: All features included in the local models are also included in our joint models.
    In particular, each template for local features is included as a joi
