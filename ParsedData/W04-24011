ect some constraints that could arise from the nature of the data or from domain or task specific conditions.
    For example, in part-ofspeech tagging, a sentence must have at least one verb, and cannot have three consecutive verbs.
    These facts can be used as constraints.
    In named entity recognition, &#8220;no entities can overlap&#8221; is a common constraint used in various works (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).
    Efficient solutions to problems of these sort have been given when the constraints on the predictors are sequential (Dietterich, 2002).
    These solutions can be categorized into the following two frameworks.
    Learning global models trains a probabilistic model under the constraints imposed by the domain.
    Examples include variations of HMMs, conditional models and sequential variations of Markov random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001).
    The other framework, inference with classifiers (Roth, 2002), views maintaining constraints and learning classifiers as separate processe
