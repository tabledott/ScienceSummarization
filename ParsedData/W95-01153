utomatic evaluation method, allows easy investigation of the relative efficacy of cascades of each of the subsets of these four filters.
    As will be shown below, some filter cascades sift candidate word pairs so well that training corpora small enough to be hand-built can be used to induce more accurate translation lexicons than those induced from a much larger training corpus without such filters.
    In one evaluation, a training corpus of 500 sentence pairs processed with these knowledge sources achieved a precision of 0.54, while a training corpus of 100,000 training pairs alone achieved a precision of only 0.45.
    Such improvements could not be previously obtained, because Table 1 provides a qualitative demonstration of how a lexicon entry gradually improves as more filters are applied.
    The table contains actual entries for the French source word &amp;quot;premier,&amp;quot; from 7best lexicons that were induced from 5000 pairs of training sentences, using different filter cascades.
