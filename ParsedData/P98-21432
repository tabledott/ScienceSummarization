    Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaphora resolution.
    It is also an example of how anaphors in a specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing.
    Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for English, but also for other languages (in our case Polish and Arabic).
  
  
    With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semantic and discourse analysis (which is vital for realworld applications), we developed a robust, knowledge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.
    It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the leve
