 so that H(x) for Agent A is .71.
    To calculate c2 for Agent A, assume that the average number of repair utterances for Agent A's subdialogues that repair depart-city is 6, that the mean over all comparable repair subdialogues is 4, and the standard deviation is 2.79.
    Then H(c2) is .72.
    Let Agent A's repair dialogue strategy for subdialogues repairing depart-city be RA and Agent B's repair strategy for depart-city be Rg.
    Then using the performance equation above, predicted performance for RA is: For Agent B, using the appropriate subpart of Table 4 to calculate lc, assuming that the average number of depart-city repair utterances is 1.38, and using similar I2This assumption has a sound basis in theories of dialogue structure (Carberry, 1989; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Litman and Allen, 1990), but should be tested empirically. calculations, yields Performance(RB ) = .40* &#8212;.71 &#8212; .78 * &#8212;.94 = 0.45 Thus the results of these experiments predict that when an agent needs to choose betwe
