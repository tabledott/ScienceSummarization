able as long as features factor by edge, f(x, z) = &amp;;Ez f(x, z), because that ensures that q(z) will have the same form as p&#952;(z | x).
    Furthermore, since the constraints are per instance, we can use incremental or online version of EM (Neal and Hinton, 1998), where we update parameters &#952; after posterior-constrained E-step on each instance x.
  
  
    We conducted experiments on two languages: Bulgarian and Spanish, using each of the parsing models.
    The Bulgarian experiments transfer a parser from English to Bulgarian, using the OpenSubtitles corpus (Tiedemann, 2007).
    The Spanish experiments transfer from English to Spanish using the Spanish portion of the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005).
    For both corpora, we performed word alignments with the open source PostCAT (Gra&#231;a et al., 2009) toolkit.
    We used the Tokyo tagger (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005) to POS tag the English tokens, and generated parses using the first-order model of McDonald et al. (2005) with projective decoding,
