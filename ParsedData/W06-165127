 results of the ILP approach applied to the n-best sequences.
			ILP-10 reaches an F-measureof 68.0, a significant improvement over the high est performing baseline16 , and also a substantialimprovement over ILP-1.
			Note that the perfor mance of NEAREST-10 was much worse than that 16Statistically significant by paired-t test, where p &lt; 0.001.
