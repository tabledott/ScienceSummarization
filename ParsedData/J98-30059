    We collect such descriptions from on-line sources of past news and represent them using our generation formalism for reuse in later generation of summaries.
    The following section positions our research in the context of prior work in the area.
    Section 3 describes the system architecture that we have developed for the summarization task.

    Previous work related to summarization falls into three main categories.
    In the first, full text is accepted as input and some percentage of the text is produ
