e in terms of accuracy and positive, negative, and neutral F-measures.
    The drop in negative F-measure is significant for all three algorithms, the drop in neutral F-measure is significant for BoosTexter and TiMBL, and the drop in accuracy is significant for TiMBL and Ripper (and for BoosTexter at the p &#8804; 0.1 level).
    The modest drop in performance that we see when excluding the neutral&#8211;polar features in the one-step approach seems to suggest that discriminating between neutral and polar instances is helpful but not necessarily crucial.
    However, consider Figure 3.
    In this figure, we show the F-measures for the positive, negative, and both classes for the BoosTexter polarity classifier that uses the gold-standard neutral/polar instances (from Table 15) and for the BoosTexter one-step polarity classifier that uses all features (from Table 20).
    Plotting the same sets of results for the other three algorithms produces very similar figures.
    The difference when the classifiers have
