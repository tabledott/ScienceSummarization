			We observe that, on a technical domain suchas computer science, most supervised systems per formed worse due to the nature of their training set.
			Second, we still need to show that coarse senses can be useful in real applications.
			Third, a full coarse sense inventory is not yet available: this is a majorobstacle to large-scale in vivo evaluations.
			We be lieve that these aspects deserve further investigation in the years to come.
			Acknowledgments This work was partially funded by the Interop NoE (508011), 6th European Union FP.
			We would like to thank Martha Palmer for providing us the first three texts of the test corpus.
