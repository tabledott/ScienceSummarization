polysemous.We narrowed down the set of words using the crite ria: (1) frequency in the BNC 1000, (2) at most12 senses, and (3) at least 75 examples in each corpus.
			Finally a couple of words were removed because the domain-specific sense was particularly ob scure3.
			The resulting set consists of 17 words4: club,manager, record, right, bill, check, competition, conversion, crew, delivery, division, fishing, reserve, re turn, score, receiver, running We refer to this set of words as FS cds.
			The first four words occur in the BNC with high frequency ( 10000 occurrences), the last two with low frequency (  2000) and the rest are mid-frequency.
			Three further sets of words were selected on the basis of domain salience.
			We chose eight words that are particularly salient in the Sport corpus (referred to as S sal), eight in the Finance corpus (F sal), and seven that had equal (not necessarily high) salience in both, (eq sal).
			We computed salience as a ratio of normalised document frequencies, using the
