ally obtained after less than 400 iterations).
    The feature model used for the NER tagger is shown in Table 2.
    These are similar to the features used by Turian et al. (2010), with the main difference that we do not use any long range features and that we add templates that conjoin adjacent clusters and adjacent tags as well as templates that conjoin label transitions with tags, clusters and capitalization features.
    The results of the parsing experiments, measured with labeled accuracy score (LAS) on all sentence lengths, excluding punctuation, are shown in Table 3.
    The baselines are all comparable to the state-of-theart.
    On average, the addition of word cluster features yields a 6% relative reduction in error and upwards of 15% (for RU).
    All languages improve except FR, which sees neither an increase nor a decrease in LAS.
    We observe an average absolute increase in LAS of approximately 1%, which is inline with previous observations (Koo et al., 2008).
    It is perhaps not surprisin
