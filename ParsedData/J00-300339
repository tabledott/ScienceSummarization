tch (e.g., mean and range of FO over utterance, slope of FO regression line), energy (e.g., mean and range of RMS energy, same for signal-toWe found this approach to give better results than the standard multiplication of logP(W) by A.
    Note that for selecting the best hypothesis in a recognizer only the relative magnitudes of the score weights matter; however, for the summation in Equation 6 the absolute values become important.
    The parameter values for A and p, were those used by the standard recognizer; they were not specifically optimized for the DA classification task.
    Decision tree for the classification of BACKCHANNELS (B) and AGREEMENTS (A).
    Each node is labeled with the majority class for that node, as well as the posterior probabilities of the two classes.
    The following features are queried in the tree: number of frames in continuous (&gt; 1 s) speech regions (cont_speech_frames), total utterance duration (ling_dir), utterance duration excluding pauses &gt; 100 ms (ling_dur_minus_
