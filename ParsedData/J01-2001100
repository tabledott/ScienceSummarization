al problem of language acquisition is one that includes the problems of identifying morphemes, of identifying words both morphologically analyzed and nonanalyzed, of identifying syntactic categories of the words in question, and of inferring the rules guiding the distribution of such syntactic categories.
    It seems to me that the only manageable kind of approach to dealing with such a complex task is to view it as an optimization problem, of which MDL is one particular style.
    Chomsky's early conception of generative grammar (Chomsky 1975 [1955]; henceforth LSLT) was developed along these lines as well; his notion of an evaluation metric for grammars was equivalent in its essential purpose to the description length of the morphology utilized in the present paper.
    The primary difference between the LSLT approach and the MDL approach is this: the LSLT approach conjectured that the grammar of a language could be factored into two parts, one universal and one languageparticular; and when we look for the
