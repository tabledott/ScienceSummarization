e general framework for optimizing highly interdependent parameter sets.
    Simulated annealing requires an objective function to optimize.
    The objective function for bitext mapping should measure the difference between the TBM and the interpolated bitext maps produced with the current parameter set.
    In geometric terms, the difference is a distance.
    The TBM consists of a set of TPCs.
    The distance between a bitext map and each TPC can be defined in a number of ways.
    The simplest metrics are the horizontal distance or the vertical distance, but these metrics measure the error with respect to only one language or the other.
    A more robust average is the distance perpendicular to the main diagonal.
    In order to penalize large errors more heavily, root mean squared (RMS) distance, rather than mean distance, should be minimized.
    There is a slight complication in the computation of distances between two partial functions, in that linear interpolation is not well-defined for nonmonotoni
