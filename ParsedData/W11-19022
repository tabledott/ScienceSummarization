ible with the shared task and OntoNotes specifications (Hovy et al., 2006; Pradhan et al., 2007).
    Using this system, we participated in both the closed1 and open2 tracks, using both predicted and gold mentions.
    Using predicted mentions, our system had an overall score of 57.8 in the closed track and 58.3 in the open track.
    These were the top scores in both tracks.
    Using gold mentions, our system scored 60.7 in the closed track in 61.4 in the open track.
    We describe the architecture of our entire system in Section 2.
    In Section 3 we show the results of several experiments, which compare the impact of the various features in our system, and analyze the performance drop as we switch from gold mentions and annotations (named entity mentions and parse trees) to predicted information.
    We also report in this section our official results in the testing partition.
  
  
    Our system consists of three main stages: mention detection, followed by coreference resolution, and finally, post-pro
