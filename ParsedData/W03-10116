 B is the probability that a verb picked at random from those co-occurring with A will also co-occur with B; and the recall of A's prediction of B is the probability that a verb picked at random from those those cooccurring with B will also co-occur with A.
    Mutual information (MI) allows us to capture the idea that a co-occurrence of low probability events is more informative than a co-occurrence of high probability events.
    In this model, as before, we retain the definitions for feature set membership, TP, precision and recall but again change the association function.
    Here, the degree of association between a noun n and a verb v is their MI.
    Accordingly, verb v will be considered to be a feature of noun n if the probability of their cooccurrence is greater than would be expected if verbs and nouns occurred independently.
    Although we have defined a pair of numbers for similarity, in applications it will still be necessary to compute a single number in order to determine neighbourhood or cl
