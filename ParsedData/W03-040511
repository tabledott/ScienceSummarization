the number of times the word was seen as an extracted feature.
    Ideally, the raw unsupervised clustering would yield a top level distinction between the different referents.
    However, this is rarely the case.
    With this type of agglomerative clustering, the most similar pages are clustered first, and outliers are assigned as stragglers at the top levels of the cluster tree.
    This typically leads to a full clustering where the top-level clusters are significantly less discriminative than those at the roots.
    In order to compensate for this effect, we performed a type of tree refactoring, which attempted to pick out and utilize seed clusters from within the entire clustering.
    In the refactoring, the clustering is stopped before it runs to completion, based on the percentage of documents clustered and the relative size of the clusters achieved.
    At this intermediate stage, relatively large and high-precision clusters are found (e.g.
    Figure 2).
    These automatically-induced clusters ar
