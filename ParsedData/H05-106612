ecursively call the algorithm on this graph.
			Note that we need to keep track of the real endpoints of the edges into and out of wjs for reconstruction later.
			Running the algorithm, we must find the best incoming edge to all words root saw John Mary 40 30 wjs This is a tree and thus the MST of this graph.
			We now need to go up a level and reconstruct the graph.
			The edge from wjs to Mary originally was from the word saw, so we include that edge.
			Furthermore, the edge from root to wjs represented a tree from root to saw to John, so we include all those edges to get the final (and correct) MST, root saw John Mary 10 3030 A possible concern with searching the entire spaceof spanning trees is that we have not used any syntactic constraints to guide the search.
			Many lan guages that allow non-projectivity are still primarily projective.
			By searching all possible non-projective trees, we run the risk of finding extremely bad trees.
			We address this concern in Section 4.
