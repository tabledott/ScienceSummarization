  Robust Temporal Processing Of News
  
    We introduce an annotation scheme for temporal expressions, and describe a method for resolving temporal expressions in print and broadcast news.
    The system, which is based on both hand-crafted and machine-learnt rules, achieves an 83.2% accuracy (Fmeasure) against hand-annotated data.
    Some initial steps towards tagging event chronologies are also described.
  
  
    The extraction of temporal information from news offers many interesting linguistic challenges in the coverage and representation of temporal expressions.
    It is also of considerable practical importance in a variety of current applications.
    For example, in question-answering, it is useful to be able to resolve the underlined reference in &#8220;the next year, he won the Open&#8221; in response to a question like &#8220;When did X win the U.S. Open?&#8221;.
    In multidocument summarization, providing finegrained chronologies of events over time (e.g., for a biography of a person, or a
