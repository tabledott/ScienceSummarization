ance path, which can be read as the conjunction of ordered pairs {(xi, y,) Ii &lt; i &lt; n}.
    Furthermore, following Touretsky, from this we can define the set of concepts that lie on an inheritance path, the conclusion space.
    Definition The conclusion space of a set of sequences (I) is the set of all pairs (Q, P) such that a sequence (Q, , P) appears in 1.
    From these two definitions we can define the traditional is-a relation, relating the above pairs by a generalization operator, &lt;G,&amp;quot; as well as other relations that I will not discuss.27 Let us suppose that, in addition to these fixed relational structures, our semantics allows us to dynamically create arbitrary concepts through the application of certain transformations to lexical meanings.
    For example, for any predicate, Q &#8212; e.g. the value of a qualia role &#8212; we can generate its opposition, -02 (cf.
    Pustejovsky 1991).
    By relating these two predicates temporally we can generate the arbitrary transition events
