			This representationenables fast lookup of any contiguous substring us ing binary search.
			Specifically, all occurrences of a length-m substring can be found in O(m + log |T |) time (Manber and Myers, 1993).
			1 Callison-Burch et al (2005) and Zhang and Vogel (2005) use suffix arrays as follows.
			1.
			Load the source training text F , the suffix array.
			SAF , the target training text E, and the align ment A into memory.
			2.
			For each input sentence, look up each substring.
			(phrase) f?
			of the sentence in the suffix array.
			aligned phrase e?
			using the phrase extraction method of Koehn et al (2003).
			4.
			Compute the relative frequency score p(e?|f?) of.
			each pair using the count of the extracted pair and the marginal count of f?
			5.
			Compute the lexical weighting score of the.
			phrase pair using the alignment that gives the best score.
			1Abouelhoda et al (2004) show that lookup can be done in optimal O(m) time using some auxiliaray data structures.
