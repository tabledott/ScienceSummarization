n (e.g. Koike et al, 2004) in a particular target domain, they tend to suffer from low recall due to the wide variation of the surface ex pression that describe a relation between a verb and its arguments.
			In addition, the portability of such systems is low because the system has to be re-equipped with different set of rules when different kind of relation is to be extracted.
			One solution to this problem is using deep parsers which can abstract the syntactic variation of a relation between a verb and its arguments repre sented in the text, and constructing extraction rule on the abstract predicate-argument structure.
			To do so, wide-coverage and high-precision parsers are required.
			While basic NLP techniques are relatively general and portable from domain to domain, customization and tuning are inevitable, especially in order to apply the techniques effec tively to highly specialized literatures such as research papers and abstracts.
			As recent advances in NLP technology depend on machine learnin
