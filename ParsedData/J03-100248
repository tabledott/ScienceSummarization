ictionary in training on the Verbmobil and Hansards tasks, respectively.
    We compare the two methods for using the dictionary described in Section 3.4.
    We observe that the method with a fixed threshold of &#181;+ = 16 gives the best results.
    The method with a varying &#181; gives worse results, but this method has one fewer parameter to be optimized on held-out data.
    On small corpora, there is an improvement of up to 6.7% on the Verbmobil task and 3.2% on the Hansards task, but when a larger training corpus is used, the improvements are reduced to 1.1% and 0.4%, respectively.
    Interestingly, the amount of the overall improvement contributed by the use of a conventional dictionary is small compared to the improvement achieved through the use of better alignment models.
    In this section, we compare the results obtained using different translation directions and using the symmetrization methods described in Section 4.
