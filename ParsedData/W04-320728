o-string alignment on Japanese data, and Gildea (2003) performed tree-to-tree alignment on the Korean Treebank, allowing for non-isomorphic structures; he applied this to word-to-word alignment.
    Finally, inspired by these intuitive notions of translational correspondence, Cherry and Lin (2003) include dependency features in a word alignment model to improve non-syntactic baseline systems.
    In more formal work, Melamed (2003) proposes multitext grammars and algorithms for parsing them.
    Shieber and Schabes (1990) describe a synchronous tree adjoining grammar.
    While both of these formalisms require bilingual grammar rules, Eisner (2003) describes an algorithm for learning tree substitution grammars from unaligned trees.
    Working on the Penn Korean Treebank, Sarkar and Han (2002) made a single training/test split and used 91% of the sentences to train a morphological disambiguator and lexicalized tree adjoining grammar (LTAG) based parsing system.
