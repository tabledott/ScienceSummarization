through a small change to the tagset.
    The 17-tags English tagset allows for V-V transitions.
    Such a construction is generally unlikely in English.
    By separating modals from the rest of the verbs, and creating an additional class for the 5 be verbs (am,is,are,was,were), we made such transition much less probable.
    The new 19-tags tagset reflects the &#8220;verb can not follow a verb&#8221; constraint.
    Morphology-Based p(t|w) approximation English morphology is much simpler compared to that of Hebrew, making direct use of the Levinger context free approximation impossible.
    However, some morphological cues exist in English as well, in particular common suffixation patterns.
    We implemented our morphology-based context-free p(t|w) approximation for English as a special case of the linear context-based algorithm described in Sect.3.
    Instead of generating contexts based on neighboring words, we generate them using the following 5 morphological templates: suff=S The word has suffix 5 (s
