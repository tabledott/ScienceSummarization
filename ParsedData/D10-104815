tion as an acronym of another if its text equals the sequence of upper case characters in the other mention.
    We will adopt better solutions for acronym detection in future work (Schwartz, 2003).
    Demonym &#8211; one of the mentions is a demonym of the other, e.g., [Israel] ... [Israeli].
    For demonym detection we use a static list of countries and their gentilic forms from Wikipedia.3 All the above features are extremely precise.
    As shown in Table 2 the pairwise precision of the sieve after adding these features is over 95% and recall increases 5 points.
    Linking a mention to an antecedent based on the naive matching of their head words generates a lot of spurious links because it completely ignores possibly incompatible modifiers (Elsner and Charniak, 2010).
    For example, Yale University and Harvard University have similar head words, but they are obviously different entities.
    To address this issue, this pass implements several features that must all be matched in order to yield a lin
