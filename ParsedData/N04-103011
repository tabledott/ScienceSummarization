 of the head word gave a significant performance boost to their system.
			Following that, we experimented with the addition of this feature to our system.
			3.
			Verb Clustering ? Since our training data is rel-.
			atively limited, any real world test set will con tain predicates that have not been seen in training.In these cases, we can benefit from some information about the predicate by using predicate clus ter as a feature.
			The verbs were clustered into 64 classes using the probabilistic co-occurrence modelof Hofmann and Puzicha (1998).
			The clustering algorithm uses a database of verb-direct-object rela tions extracted by Lin (1998).
			We then use the verb class of the current predicate as a feature.
			4.
			Partial Path ? For the argument identification task,.
			path is the most salient feature.
			However, it is alsothe most data sparse feature.
			To overcome this prob lem, we tried generalizing the path by adding a new feature that contains only the part of the path from the constituent t
