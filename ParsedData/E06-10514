ntexts) provide useful clues to identify the roles of the entities within a relation.
    The approach has some resemblance with what was proposed by Roth and Yih (2002).
    The main difference is that we perform the extraction task in a single step via a combined kernel, while they used two separate classifiers to identify entities and relations and their output is later combined with a probabilistic global inference.
    We evaluated our relation extraction algorithm on two biomedical data sets (i.e. the AImed corpus and the LLL challenge data set; see Section 4).
    The motivations for using these benchmarks derive from the increasing applicative interest in tools able to extract relations between relevant entities in biomedical texts and, consequently, from the growing availability of annotated data sets.
    The experiments show clearly that our approach consistently improves previous results.
    Surprisingly, it outperforms most of the systems based on syntactic or semantic information, even when thi
