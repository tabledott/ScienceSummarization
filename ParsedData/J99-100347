equence of segment boundaries for each half of a bitext, the Geometric Segment Alignment (GSA) algorithm reduces sets of correspondence points to segment alignments.
    The algorithm's first step is to perform a transitive closure over the input correspondence relation.
    For instance, if the input contains (G,e), (H,e), and (H,f), then GSA adds the pairing (G,f).
    Next, GSA forces all segments to be contiguous: If segment Y corresponds with segments x and z, but not y, the pairing (Y,y) is added.
    In geometric terms, these two operations arrange all cells that contain points of correspondence into nonoverlapping rectangles, while adding as few cells as possible.
    The result is an alignment relation.
    A complete set of TPCs, together with appropriate boundary information, guarantees a perfect alignment.
    Alas, the points of correspondence postulated by SIMR are neither complete nor noise-free.
    SIMR makes errors of omission and errors of commission.
    Fortunately, the noise in SIMR's ou
