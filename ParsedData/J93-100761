  It shows that about 80% of the T collocations were accepted by the lexicographer and that about 20% were rejected.
    This shows that precision was raised from 40% to 80% with the addition of Xtract stage 3.
    In summary, these experiments allowed us to evaluate Stage 3 as a retrieval system.
    The results are: precision = 80% and recall = 94%.

    In this section, we discuss the extent to which the results are dependent on the corpus used.
