 is quite large (Melamed 1996a).
    The noise filter described in Section 4.3 reduces the chances that SIMR will be led astray by false points of correspondence.
    Before SIMR can decide where to generate candidate points of correspondence, it must be told which pairs of words have coordinates within the boundaries of the current search rectangle.
    The mapping from tokens to axis positions is performed by a language-specific axis generator (Melamed 1998b).
    SIMR calls one of its matching predicates on each pair of tokens whose coordinate falls within the search rectangle.
    A matching predicate is a heuristic for deciding whether two given tokens might be mutual translations.
    Two kinds of information that a matching predicate can rely on most often are cognates and translation lexicons.
    Two words are orthographic cognates if they have the same meaning and similar spellings.
    Similarity of spelling can be measured in more or less complicated ways.
