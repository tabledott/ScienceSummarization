ve (Rao, Gordon, &amp; Spears, 1995).
    In machine learning, bias refers to &amp;quot;any basis for choosing one generalization over another, other than strict consistency with the instances&amp;quot; (Mitchell, 1980).
    Decision-tree methods have a bias for simple decision trees, rule induction methods have a bias for simple DNF expressions, neural-network methods have a bias for linear threshold functions, 1 and naive Bayes has a bias for functions which respect conditional independence of features.
    The more the bias of a certain 'Although multi-layer networks with sufficient hidden can represent arbitrary nonlinear functions, they will tend to learn a linear function if one exists that is consistent with the training data. learning algorithm fits the characteristics of a particular problem, the better it will perform on that problem.
    Most learning algorithms have some sort of &amp;quot;Occam's razor&amp;quot; bias in which hypotheses that can be represented with fewer bits in some particular re
