ajor change to our previous algorithm is an attempt to overcome some of the weaknesses of purely semantic-based morphology induction by incorporating information about affix frequencies.
    As validated by Kazakov (1997), high frequency word endings and beginnings in inflectional languages are very likely to be legitimate affixes.
    In English, for example, the highest frequency rule is -s&#8212;e.
    CELEX suggests that 99.7% of our PPMVs for this rule would be true.
    However, since the purely semantic-based approach tends to select only relationships with contextually similar meanings, only 92% of the PPMVs are retained.
    This suggests that one might improve the analysis by supplementing semantic probabilities with orthographic-based probabilities (Prorth).
    Our approach to obtaining Prorth is motivated by an appeal to minimum edit distance (MED).
    MED has been applied to the morphology induction problem by other researchers (such as Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000).
    MED determines the mi
