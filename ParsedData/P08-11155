 is useful for our purposes because it permits any finite set of strings to be represented and allows for substrings common to multiple members of the set to be represented with a single piece of structure.
    Additionally, all paths from one node to another form an equivalence class representing, in our model, alternative expressions of the same underlying communicative intent.
    For translation, we will find it useful to encode G in a chart based on a topological ordering of the nodes, as described by Cheppalier et al. (1999).
    The nodes in the lattices shown in Figure 1 are labeled according to an appropriate numbering.
    The chart-representation of the graph is a triple of 2-dimensional matrices hF, p, Ri, which can be constructed from the numbered graph.
    Fi,j is the word label of the jth transition leaving node i.
    The corresponding transition cost is pi,j.
    Ri,j is the node number of the node on the right side of the jth transition leaving node i.
    Note that Ri,j &gt; i for all i, j
