 in n); if we drop the integer constraint the problem becomes the LP relaxation.
    As is, this formulation is no more attractive than solving the problem with the existing combinatorial algorithms discussed in &#167;2.2; however, we can now start adding non-local features to build a more powerful model.
    To cope with higher-order features of the form fa1,...,aK(x) (i.e., features whose values depend on the simultaneous inclusion of arcs a1, ... , aK on a candidate dependency tree), we employ a linearization trick (Boros and Hammer, 2002), defining extra variables zal...aK , zal &#8743;...&#8743;zaK.
    This logical relation can be expressed by the following O(K) agreement constraints:6 As shown by McDonald and Pereira (2006) and Carreras (2007), the inclusion of features that correlate sibling and grandparent arcs may be highly beneficial, even if doing so requires resorting to approximate algorithms.7 Define Rsibl , {hi, j, ki  |hi, ji &#8712; A, hi, ki &#8712; A} and Rgrand , {hi, j, ki  |hi, ji such
