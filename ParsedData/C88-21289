m- mar or unification-based formalisms.
  In particular, Pereira and Warren construct a parsing algorithm us- ing a deduction strategy which mimics Earleys algorithm.
  We would like to generalize the approach, so that the deduction strategy (or at least portions of it) are parameters of the deduction system.
  The pa- rameterization should have sufficient generality that parsers and gen- erators with w~rious control strategies, including Pereira and Warrens Barley deduction parser, are instances of the general architecture.
  We start the development of such an architecture by considering the unrestricted use of these two basic inference rules to form the deductive closure of the premises and the goals.
  The exhaustive use of prediction and completion as basic inference rules does provide a complete algorithm for proving lemmas of the sort described.
  However, several problems immediately present hemselves.
  First, proofs using these inference rules can be redundant.
  Various combinations of proof steps
