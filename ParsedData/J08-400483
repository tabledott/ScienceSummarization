s in line with the methods developed to evaluate anaphora resolution systems (Vilain et al. 1995).
    But using anaphoric chains as labels would not make unweighted measures such as K a good measure for agreement.
    Practical experience suggests that, except when a text is very short, few annotators will catch all mentions of a discourse entity: Most will forget to mark a few, with the result that the chains (that is, category labels) differ from coder to coder and agreement as measured with K is always very low.
    What is needed is a coefficient that also allows for partial disagreement between judgments, when two annotators agree on part of the coreference chain but not on all of it.
    Passonneau (2004) suggests solving the problem by using &#945; with a distance metric that allows for partial agreement among anaphoric chains.
    Passonneau proposes a distance metric based on the following rationale: Two sets are minimally distant when they are identical and maximally distant when they are disjoint;
