would have sufficed (because (Y U Z) C_ X).
    This is not unlike some of the redundancies generated by Dale and Reiter&#8217;s algorithm and, as in their case, it is unclear whether this is descriptively adequate.
    Adaptations can be made if needed.
    For instance, phases might run separately before running in combination: first (as usual) Phase 1, then 2, then (as usual) 1&amp;2, then 3, then 1&amp;3, then 2&amp;3, then (as usual) 1&amp;2&amp;3, and so on.8 As a result of this adaptation, the description Y U Z would be generated because of Phase 2 alone.
    Double incrementality, however, does not save D&amp;RBoolean from intractability.
    To estimate running time as a function of the number of properties (na) in the KB and those in the description (nl), we can mirror an argument in Dale and Reiter (1995, Section 3.1.1) to show that the maximal number of properties to be considered equals (The factor of 2 derives from inspecting both each atom and its negation.)
    If nl &#171; na, then this is on
