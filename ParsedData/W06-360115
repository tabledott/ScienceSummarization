riable in t(r).
    We then collect the resulting target-language strings and plug them into the Chinese-side s(r) of rule r, getting a translation for the subtree T*&#951;.
    We finally take the best of all translations.
    With the extended LHS of our transducer, there may be many different rules applicable at one tree node.
    For example, consider the VP subtree in Fig.
    3 (c), where both r3 and r6 can apply.
    As a result, the number of derivations is exponential in the size of the tree, since there are exponentially many decompositions of the tree for a given set of rules.
    This problem can be solved by memoization (Cormen et al., 2001): we cache each subtree that has been visited before, so that every tree node is visited at most once.
    This results in a dynamic programming algorithm that is guaranteed to run in O(npq) time where n is the size of the parse tree, p is the maximum number of rules applicable to one tree node, and q is the maximum size of an applicable rule.
