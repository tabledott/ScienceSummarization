at, if a string is generated by the PCFG, then it will be produced if and only if one of the trees in the set Tzq generated it.
    Thus the probability of the string is the probability of the set Twg, i.e., the sum of its members' probabilities.
    Up to this point, we have been discussing strings of words without specifying whether they are &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; strings or not.
    We will adopt the convention that an explicit beginning of string symbol, (s), and an explicit end symbol, (/s), are part of the vocabulary, and a string wg is a complete string if and only if Tao is (s) and tv, is (/s).
    Since the beginning of string symbol is not predicted by language models, but rather is axiomatic in the same way that St is for a parser, we can safely omit it from the current discussion, and simply assume that it is there.
    See Figure 1(b) for the explicit representation.
    While a complete string of words must contain the end symbol as its final word, a string prefix does not have this restri
