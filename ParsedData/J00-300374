c learning techniques.
    To enable such research, we need fairly large, standardized corpora that allow comparisons over time and across approaches.
    Despite its shortcomings, the Switchboard domain could serve this purpose.
  
  
    We have developed an integrated probabilistic approach to dialogue act modeling for conversational speech, and tested it on a large speech corpus.
    The approach combines models for lexical and prosodic realizations of DAs, as well as a statistical discourse grammar.
    All components of the model are automatically trained, and are thus applicable to other domains for which labeled data is available.
    Classification accuracies achieved so far are highly encouraging, relative to the inherent difficulty of the task as measured by human labeler performance.
    We investigated several modeling alternatives for the components of the model (backoff n-grams and maximum entropy models for discourse grammars, decision trees and neural networks for prosodic classification) and
