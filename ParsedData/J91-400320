, but falls short of a comprehensive semantics for all categories in language.
    No existing framework, in my view, provides a method for the decomposition of lexical categories.
    What exactly would a method for lexical decomposition give us?
    Instead of a taxonomy of the concepts in a language, categorized by sets of features, such a method would tell us the minimal semantic configuration of a lexical item.
    Furthermore, it should tell us the compositional properties of a word, just as a grammar informs us of the specific syntactic behavior of a certain category.
    What we are led to, therefore, is a generative theory of word meaning, but one very different from the generative semantics of the 1970s.
    To explain why I am suggesting that lexical decomposition proceed in a generative fashion rather than the traditional exhaustive approach, let me take as a classic example, the word closed as used in Example 21 (see Lakoff 1970). a.
