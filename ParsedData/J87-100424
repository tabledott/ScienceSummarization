ext word information.
    After executing the two shift actions, we have After executing &amp;quot;shift 10&amp;quot;, we have This time, only one leaf node has been created in the parse forest, because both shift actions regarded the word as belonging to the same category, i.e., noun.
    Now we have two active vertices, and &amp;quot;reduce 3&amp;quot; is arbitrarily chosen as the next action to execute.
    After executing The parser accepts the sentence, and returns &amp;quot;15&amp;quot; as the top node of the parse forest.
    The forest consists of only one tree which is the desired structure for That information is important is doubtful.
    In the previous subsection, we saw the parsing algorithm handling a multi-part-of-speech word just like multiple entries without any special mechanism.
    That capability can also be applied to handle unknown words (words whose categories are unknown).
    An unknown word can be thought of as a special type of a multi-part-of-speech word whose categories can be a
