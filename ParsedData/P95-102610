    8 For the purposes of exposition, I will assume a binary sense partition.
    It is straightforward to extend this to k senses using k sets of seeds.
    = Set of training examples containing the collocation &amp;quot;life&amp;quot;.
  
  
    Train the supervised classification algorithm on the SENSE-A/SENSE-B seed sets.
    The decision-list algorithm used here (Yarowsky, 1994) identifies other collocations that reliably partition the seed training data, ranked by the purity of the distribution.
    Below is an abbreviated example of the decision list trained on the plant seed data.9 STEP 3h: Apply the resulting classifier to the entire sample set.
    Take those members in the residual that are tagged as SENSE-A or SENSE-B with probability above a certain threshold, and add those examples to the growing seed sets.
    Using the decision-list algorithm, these additions will contain newly-learned collocations that are reliably indicative of the previously-trained seed sets.
