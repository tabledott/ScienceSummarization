o know that the English string &amp;quot;1988&amp;quot; and the French string &amp;quot;1988&amp;quot; are likely to correspond.
    We are currently exploring ways to integrate these kinds of clues into the framework described above.
    However, at present, the algorithm does not have access to lexical constraints, which are clearly very important.
    We expect that once these clues are properly integrated, the program will achieve performance comparable to that of the primary judge.
    However, we are still not convinced that it is necessary to process these lexical clues, since the current performance is sufficient for many applications, such as building a probabilistic dictionary.
    It is remarkable just how well we can do without lexical constraints.
    Adding lexical constraints might slow down the program and make it less useful as a first pass.
  
  
    This paper has proposed a method for aligning sentences in a bilingual corpus, based on a simple probabilistic model, described in Section 3.
