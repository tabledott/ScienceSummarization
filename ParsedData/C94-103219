apanese morphological analyzers.
  The basic idea is that morphological nalysis for a sentence can be thought of as a set of labeled brackets, where a bracket corresponds to word segmentation and its la-.
  bel corresponds to part of speech.
  We then compare the brackets contained in the systems output to the brackets contained in the standard analysis.
  For the N-best candidate, we will make the union of t],e brack- ets contained in each candidate, and compare thenr to the brackets in the standard.
  For comparison, we court{, the number of I)rackcts in the standard data (Std), the number of brackets in the system output (Sys), and the nunlber of match- ing brackets (M).
  We then calculate the nleasurcs of recall (= M/Std) and precision (= M/Sys).
  We also connt the number of crossings, which is tile mmtber of c,mes where a bracketed sequence from the standard data overlaps a bracketed sequence from tile system output, but neither sequence is completely coutained in the other.
  We defined two equaiity c
