ta would work properly.
    However, it is difficult to decide automatically when both alternatives are acceptable and when only one of them is.
    6.3.1 Using an Inappropriate Relation.
    One of the examples contained the Hebrew word matzav.
    This word has several translations, two of which are 'state' and 'position.'
    The phrase that contained this word was 'to put an end to the {statelposition} of war'.
    The ambiguous word is involved in two syntactic relations, being a complement of 'put' and also modified by 'war'.
    The corresponding frequencies were The bound of the odds ratio (Bo) for the first relation was higher than for the second, and therefore, this relation determined the translation as 'position'.
    However, the correct translation should be 'state', as determined by the second relation.
    These data suggest that while ordering the relations (or using any other weighting mechanism) it may be necessary to give different weights to the different types of syntactic relations.
