at each tree corresponds to a single lexical item in the input string.
  Therefore each tree can be used only once.
  Axioms of the system are of the form: v ---+ A where r is a completed tree rooted by A.
  The sequent T1," ? "
  ,Tn "----+ A is said to be provable if the sequent can be reduced (by the inference rules) to an axiom; we write: ~- r l , .
  Since there are finitely many ways to combine a finite num- ber of trees with each other, the system is decidable.
  The language generated by such system is defined to be: = {a i ,  .

  5 Extending the Earley-type parser for TAGs An Earley-type parser for TAGs has been proposed by Schabes and Joshi (1988a).
  It takes as input a TAG and a sentence to be parsed.
  It places no restrictions on the grammar.
  The algorithm is a bottom-up arser that uses top-down f
