, we just extend one word which is aligned to null on the boundary of target side.
    If we put some length limitation over the extracted blocks and output them, we get bilingual phrases used in standard phrase-based SMT systems and also in our system.
    Line 7 updates all links associated with the current block.
    You can attach the current block to each of these links.
    However this will increase reordering examples greatly, especially those with the straight order.
    In our Experiments, we just attach the smallest blocks to the STRAIGHT links, and the largest blocks to the INVERTED links.
    This will keep the number of reordering examples acceptable but without performance degradation.
    Line 12 and 14 extract reordering examples.
    With the extracted reordering examples, we can obtain features for our MaxEnt-based reordering model.
    We design two kinds of features, lexical features and collocation features.
    For a block b = (s, t), we use s1 to denote the first word of the source s,
