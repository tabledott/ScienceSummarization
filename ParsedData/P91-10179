uity of a source word is thus given by the number of target representations for that word in the bilingual lexicon of the translation system.
    Given a specific syntactic context the ambiguity can be reduced to the number of alternatives which may appear in that context.
    For instance, if a certain translation of a verb corresponds to an intransitive occurrence of that verb, then this possibility is eliminated when the verb occurs with a direct object.
    In this work we are interested only in those ambiguities that are left after applying all the deterministic syntactic constraints.
    For example, consider the following Hebrew sentence, taken from the daily Haaretz, September 1990: (4) Diplomatim svurim ki hitztarrfuto shell Hon Sun magdila et ha-sikkuyim 1-hassagat hitqaddmut Here, the ambiguous words in translation to English are `magdila', `hitqaddmut' and `sihot'.
