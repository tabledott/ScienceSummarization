    This account requires introducing the notion of the centers of a sentence in a discourse, a notion that cannot be defined in terms of factors that are exclusively syntactic or semantic or pragmatic.
    In Section 5, the interactions of the two levels with these factors and their effects on the uses of referring expressions in discourse are discussed.
  
  
    A discourse comprises utterances that combine into subconstituents of the discourse, namely, units of discourse that are typically larger than a single sentence, but smaller than the complete discourse.
    However, the constituent structure is not determined solely by the linear sequence of utterances.
    It is common for two contiguous utterances to be members of different subconstituents of the discourse (as with breaks between phrases in the syntactic analysis of a sentence); likewise, it is common for two utterances that are not contiguous to be members of the same subconstituent.
    An individual subconstituent of a discourse exhibits both
