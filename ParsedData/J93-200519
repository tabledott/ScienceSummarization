n MRDs, but this information can only be identified computationally through some analysis of the definition text of an entry (Atkins 1991).
    Some research has already been done in this area.
    Alshawi (1987), Boguraev et al. (1989), Vossen, Meijs, and den Broeder (1989), and the work described in Wilks et al.
    (1992) have made explicit some kinds of implicit information found in MRDs.
    Here we propose to refine and merge some of the previous techniques to make explicit the implicit information specified by a theory of generative lexicons.
    Given what we described above for the lexical structures for nominals, we can identify these semantic relations in the OALD and LDOCE by pattern matching on the parse trees of definitions.
    To illustrate what specific information can be derived by automatic seeding from machine-readable dictionaries, consider the following examples.1&#176; For example, the LDOCE definition for book is: &amp;quot;a collection of sheets of paper fastened together as a thing t
