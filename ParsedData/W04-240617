1; tagged corpora.
    Each of these corpora are made up of instances that consist of 2 or 3 sentences that include a single target word that has a manually assigned sense tag.
    However, we ignore the sense tags at all times except during evaluation.
    At no point do the sense tags enter into the clustering or feature selection processes.
    To be clear, we do not believe that unsupervised word sense discrimination needs to be carried out relative to a pre-existing set of senses.
    In fact, one of the great advantages of unsupervised technique is that it doesn&#8217;t need a manually annotated text.
    However, here we employ sense&#8211;tagged text in order to evaluate the clusters that we discover.
    The SENSEVAL-2 data is already divided into training and test sets, and those splits were retained for these experiments.
    The SENSEVAL-2 data is relatively small, in that each word has approximately 50-200 training and test instances.
    The data is particularly challenging for unsupervised algo
