s are presented in The average K scores for group T segmenters indicate weak inter-labeler reliability.
    In contrast, average i scores for group S are .8 or better, indicating a high degree of inter-labeler reliability.
    Thus, application of this somewhat stricter reliability metric confirms that the availability of speech critically influences how listeners perceive discourse structure.
    The calculation of reliability for SBEG versus nonSBEG labeling in effect tests the similarity of linearized segmentations and does not speak to the issue of how similar the labelings are in terms of hierarchical structure.
    Flammia has proposed a method for generalizing the use of the K coefficient for hierarchical segmentation that gives an upper-bound estimate on inter-labeler agreement.5 We applied this metric to our segmentation data, calculating weighted averages for pairwise n scores averaged for each task.
    Results for each condition, together with the lowest and highest average n scores over the tasks
