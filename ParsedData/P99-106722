ppeared among the top 10 of the ranked lists.
    This was true in 89 cases.5 For comparison, Fung &amp; McKeown (1997) report an accuracy of about 30% when only the top candidate is counted.
    However, it must be emphasized that their result has been achieved under very different circumstances.
    On the one hand, their task was more difficult because they worked on a pair of unrelated languages (English/Japanese) using smaller corpora and a random selection of test words, many of which were multi-word terms.
    Also, they predetermined a single translation as being correct.
    On the other hand, when conducting their evaluation, Fung &amp; McKeown limited the vocabulary they considered as translation candidates to a few hundred terms, which obviously facilitates the task.
  
  
    The method described can be seen as a simple case of the gradient descent method proposed by Rapp (1995), which does not need an initial lexicon but is computationally prohibitively expensive.
    It can also be considered a
