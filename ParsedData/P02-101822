    We experimented with lexicalizing patterns, but the simple method we tried did not improve results.
    Inspired by results suggesting that the patternmatching algorithm suffers from over-learning (e.g., testing on the training corpus), we experimented with more abstract &#8220;skeletal&#8221; patterns, which improved performance on some types of empty nodes but hurt performance on others, leaving overall performance approximately unchanged.
    Possibly there is a way to use both skeletal and the original kind of patterns in a single system.
