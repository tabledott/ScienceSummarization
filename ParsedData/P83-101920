gered restarts, for which there is one rule.
    The copying rules say that if you have two elements which are the same and they are separated by an editing signal, the first should be expunged from the structure.
    Obviously the trick here is to determine what counts as copies.
    There are three specific places where copy editing applies.
    SURFACE COPY EDITOR.
    This is essentially a nonsyntactic rule that matches the surface string on either side of the editing signal, and expunges the first copy.
    It applies to the surface string (i.e., for transcripts, the orthographic string) before any syntactic procc.&#8211;:&#8211;.6.
    For example, in (7), the underlined strings are expunged before parsing begins.
    (7a) Well if they'd-- if they'd had a knife / wou-- I wouldn't be here today.
    (7b) If they-- if they could do it.
    Typically, the Surface Copy Editor expunges a string of words that would later be analyzed as a constituent (or partial constituent), and would be expunged by the Categ
