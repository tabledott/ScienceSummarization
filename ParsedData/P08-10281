se of vector-based models.
    Examples include automatic thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994), word sense discrimination (Sch&#168;utze, 1998) and disambiguation (McCarthy et al., 2004), collocation extraction (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001), text segmentation (Choi et al., 2001) , and notably information retrieval (Salton et al., 1975).
    In cognitive science vector-based models have been successful in simulating semantic priming (Lund and Burgess, 1996; Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and text comprehension (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Foltz et al., 1998).
    Moreover, the vector similarities within such semantic spaces have been shown to substantially correlate with human similarity judgments (McDonald, 2000) and word association norms (Denhire and Lemaire, 2004).
    Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature.
    In fact, th
