egy used to find the best set of entities is shown in Algorithm 3.
    Another category of features is created by taking conjunction of the atomic features.
    For example, the model can capture how far a pronoun mention is from a named mention when the distance feature is used in conjunction with mention information feature.
    As it is the case with with mention detection approach presented in Section 2, most features used here are language-independent and are instantiated from the training data, while some are language-specific, but mostly because the resources were not available for the specific language.
    For example, syntactic features are not used in the Arabic system due to the lack of an Arabic parser.
    Simple as it seems, the mention-pair model has been shown to work well (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002).
    As will be shown in Section 4, the relatively knowledge-lean feature sets work fairly well in our tasks.
    Although we also use a mention-pair model, our tracking algorithm di
