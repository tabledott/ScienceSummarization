 used sections 2-11 for training and a subset of section 23 for testing.
			As a pre processing stage we removed many functions tagsfrom the non-terminals in the phrase structure repre sentation to make the representations more uniformwith out-of-domain test sets for the domain adapta tion track (see section 3.2).
			The resulting data set was then converted to dependency structures using the procedure described in Johansson and Nugues (2007a).
			This work was done by Ryan McDonald.
			Greek The Greek Dependency Treebank(GDT) (Prokopidis et al, 2005) adopts a de pendency structure annotation very similar to those of PDT and PADT, which means that the conversionby Prokopis Prokopidis was relatively straightfor ward.
			GDT is one of the smallest treebanks in this year?s shared task (about 65,000 tokens) and contains sentences of Modern Greek.
			Just like PDT and PADT, the treebank contains more than one level of annotation, but we only used the analytical level of GDT.
