  Structural Ambiguity And Lexical Relations
  
    We propose that ambiguous prepositional phrase attachment can be resolved on the basis of the relative strength of association of the preposition with noun and verb, estimated on the basis of word distribution in a large corpus.
    This work suggests that a distributional approach can be effective in resolving parsing problems that apparently call for complex reasoning.
  
  
    Prepositional phrase attachment is the canonical case of structural ambiguity, as in the time worn example, The existence of such ambiguity raises problems for understanding and for language models.
    It looks like it might require extremely complex computation to determine what attaches to what.
    Indeed, one recent proposal suggests that resolving attachment ambiguity requires the construction of a discourse model in which the entities referred to in a text must be reasoned about (Altmann and Steedman 1988).
    Of course, if attachment ambiguity demands reference to semanti
