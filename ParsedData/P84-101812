added to it, the same additions would be reflected in the other value.
    This would not automatically happen because a pair of values happened to be the , same.
    So, for example, if the topic of the sentence were also its object, we might write [Object = v Topic = (Object)] where v is some FD.
    Constituent sets are sets of paths identifying within a given FD the descriptions of its constituents in the sense of phrasestructure grammar.
    No constituent set is specified in example (I) above and the question of whether the subject is a constituent is therefore left open.
    Example (2), though still artificially simple, is more realistic.
    It is a syntactic description of the sentence John knows Mary.
    Perhaps the most striking property of this description is that descriptions of constituents are embedded one inside another, even though the constituents themselves are not so embedded.
    The value of the Head attribute describes a constituent of the sentence, a fact which is declared in the val
