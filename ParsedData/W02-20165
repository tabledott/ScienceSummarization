uch as SVMs, which require a polynomial computational cost on the number of given training examples.
    In this paper, we introduce a new method for Japanese dependency analysis, which does not require the probabilities of dependencies and parses a sentence deterministically.
    The proposed method can be combined with any type of machine learning algorithm that has classification ability.
    The original idea of our method stems from the cascaded chucking method which has been applied in English parsing (Abney, 1991).
    Let us introduce the basic framework of the cascaded chunking parsing method: We apply this cascaded chunking parsing technique to Japanese dependency analysis.
    Since Japanese is a head-final language, and the chunking can be regarded as the creation of a dependency between two segments, we can simplify the process of Japanese dependency analysis as follows: Figure 1 shows an example of the parsing process with the cascaded chunking model.
    The input for the model is the linguisti
