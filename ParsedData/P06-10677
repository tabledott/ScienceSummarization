he phrase Almmlkp and AlmtHdp, and their translations (Kingdom and United, respectively) are in the phrase dictionary since that would require swapping the order of the two words.
    (Och et al., 1999; Tillmann and Ney, 2003) relax the monotonicity restriction in their phrase-based decoder by allowing a restricted set of word reorderings.
    For their translation task, word reordering is done only for words belonging to the verb group.
    The context in which they report their results is a Speech-to-Speech translation from German to English.
    (Yamada and Knight, 2002) propose a syntax-based decoder that restrict word reordering based on reordering operations on syntactic parse-trees of the input sentence.
    They reported results that are better than word-based IBM4-like decoder.
    However, their decoder is outperformed by phrase-based decoders such as (Koehn, 2004), (Och et al., 1999), and (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) .
    Phrase-based SMT decoders mostly rely on the language model to select among poss
