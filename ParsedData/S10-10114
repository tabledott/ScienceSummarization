apaftis (2009) provide more details on the choice of this evaluation setting and its differences with the previous evaluation.
    The second type of evaluation, supervised evaluation, follows the supervised evaluation of the SemEval-2007 WSI task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007).
    In this evaluation, induced senses are mapped to gold standard senses using a mapping corpus, and systems are then evaluated in a standard WSD task.
    The target word dataset consisted of 100 words, i.e.
    50 nouns and 50 verbs.
    The training dataset for each target noun or verb was created by following a web-based semi-automatic method, similar to the method for the construction of Topic Signatures (Agirre et al., 2001).
    Specifically, for each WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) sense of a target word, we created a query of the following form: The &lt;Target Word&gt; consisted of the target word stem.
    The &lt;Relative Set&gt; consisted of a disjunctive set of word lemmas that were related to the target word sense for which the quer
