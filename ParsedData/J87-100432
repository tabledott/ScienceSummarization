other processes or the parser's control flow.
    A generated function takes a list of arguments, each of which is a value associated with each right-hand side symbol, and returns a value to be associated with the left-hand side symbol.
    Each value is a list of f-structures, in case of disjunction and local ambiguity.
    That a semantic grammar in the LFG-like notation can also be generated automatically from a domain semantics specification and a purely syntactic grammar is discussed further in Tomita and Carbonell (1986).
    The discussion is, however, beyond the scope of this paper.
  
  
    Our parsing algorithm parses a sentence strictly from left to right.
    This characteristics makes on-line parsing possible; i.e., to parse a sentence as the user types it in, without waiting for completion of the sentence.
    An example session of on-line parsing is presented in Figure 7.1 for the sample sentence I saw a man with a telescope.
    As in this example, the user often wants to hit the &amp;quot;ba
