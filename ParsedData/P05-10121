sumptions and estimations, so we might expect better performance from discriminatively trained models, as has been shown for other tasks like document classification (Joachims, 2002) and shallow parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003).
    Ratnaparkhi&#8217;s conditional maximum entropy model (Ratnaparkhi, 1999), trained to maximize conditional likelihood P(y|x) of the training data, performed nearly as well as generative models of the same vintage even though it scores parsing decisions in isolation and thus may suffer from the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001).
    Discriminatively trained parsers that score entire trees for a given sentence have only recently been investigated (Riezler et al., 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004; Collins and Roark, 2004; Taskar et al., 2004).
    The most likely reason for this is that discriminative training requires repeatedly reparsing the training corpus with the current model to determine the parameter updates that will improve the training criterion.
    The reparsing cost
