ing in humans.
    We plan to try SVD on the Gloss Vector measure in future work.
    In the application-oriented evaluation, the Gloss Vector measure performed relatively well (about 41% accuracy).
    However, unlike the human study, it did not outperform all the other measures.
    We think there are two possible explanations for this.
    First, the word pairs used in the human relatedness study are all nouns, and it is possible that the Gloss Vector measure performs better on nouns than on other parts of speech.
    In the application-oriented evaluation the measure had to make judgments for all parts of speech.
    Second, the application itself affects the performance of the measure.
    The Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm starts by selecting a context of 5 words from around the target word.
    These context words contain words from all parts of speech.
    Since the Jiang-Conrath measure assigns relatedness scores only to noun concepts, its behavior would differ from that of the Vector measure wh
