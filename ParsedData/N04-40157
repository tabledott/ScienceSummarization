    Systems are developed from 4 different sizes of training corpora, 3.5K, 35K, 350K and 3.3M sentence pairs, as in Table 1.
    The number in each cell indicates the number of sentence pairs in each genre (newswires, ummah, UN corpus).4 Impact of morphological analysis on IBM Model 1 is shown in Table 2. distinct tags assigned to the suffixj in the training corpus.
    Arabic prefix and its part-of-speech into an English part-of-speech in the Arabic stem tag context, stemtagA.
    Prefixi and tagik in prefixi_tagik may be interpreted in a manner analogous to suffixj and tagjk of suffixj_tagjk in (2).
    The algorithm for word-based translation model, e.g.
    IBM Model 1, implements the idea that if a morpheme in one language is robustly translated into a distinct part-of-speech in the other language, the morpheme is very likely to have its independent counterpart in the other language.
    Therefore, a robust overlap of tagE given tagA between Pr(tagE|tagA) and Pr(tagE|stemtagA, suffixj_tagjk
