support will also be needed for using the emerging grammars on other processing platforms, and for linking to other packages for pre-processing the linguistic input.
    Several other platforms exist which can efficiently parse text using the existing grammars, including the PET system developed in C++ at Saarland University (Germany) and the DFKI (Callmeier, 2000); the PAGE system developed in Lisp at the DFKI (Uszkoreit et al., 1994); the LiLFeS system developed at Tokyo University (Makino, Yoshida, Torisawa, &amp; Tsujii, 1998), and a parallel processing system developed in Objective C at Delft University (The Netherlands; van Lohuizen, 2002).
    As part of the matrix package, sample configuration files and documentation will be provided for at least some of these additional platforms.
    Existing pre-processing packages can also significantly reduce the effort required to develop a new grammar, particularly for coping with the morphology/syntax interface.
    For example, the ChaSen package for segmenti
