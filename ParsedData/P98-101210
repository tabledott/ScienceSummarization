ed coreference chains (the truth) while the term &amp;quot;response&amp;quot; refers to the coreference chains output by a system.
    An equivalence set is the transitive closure of a coreference chain.
    The algorithm, developed by (Vilain 95), computes recall in the following way.
    First, let S be an equivalence set generated by the key, and let R1 ... R,&#8222;. be equivalence classes generated by the response.
    Then we define the following functions over S: fully reunite any components of the p(S) partition.
    We note that this is simply one fewer than the number of elements in the partition, that is, m(S) = (Ip(S)I &#8212; 1) .
    Looking in isolation at a single equivalence class in the key, the recall error for that class is just the number of missing links divided by the number of correct links, i.e., Precision is computed by switching the roles of the key and response in the above formulation.
    While the (Vilain 95) provides intuitive results for coreference scoring, it however does no
