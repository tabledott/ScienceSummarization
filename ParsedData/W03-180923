s describe four methods for modelling VPC compositionality, each of which is tested over the 4 individual compositionality classification tasks.
    The results for each method are given in Table 4, in which the baseline for each task is the score obtained when we assign the most frequent label to all items.
    Each method is evaluated in terms of precision (Prec), Recall (Rec) and F-score (Q = 1, FB1), and all values which exceed the baseline are indicated in boldface.
    We decided to gain a sense of the start-of-the-art on the task by reimplementing the technique described in Lin (1999) over VPCs.
    In our implementation we replaced Lin&#8217;s collocations with our VPCs, treating the relationship between a verb and a particle as a kind of grammatical relation.
    In addition to the binary compositional/non-compositional judgement that Lin offers (which seems to be equivalent to TASK 1), we tested the method over the other three tasks.
    Acknowledging, as we must, that items can be partially composi
