   We also compare the performance of MEMT to the score of an &#8220;oracle system&#8221; that chooses the best scoring of the individual systems for each sentence.
    Note that this oracle is not a realistic system, since a real system cannot determine at runtime which of the original systems is best on a sentence-by-sentence basis.
    One goal of the evaluation was to see how rich the space of synthetic translations produced by our hypothesis generator is.
    To this end, we also compare the output selected by our current MEMT system to an &#8220;oracle system&#8221; that chooses the best synthetic translation that was generated by the decoder for each sentence.
    This too is not a realistic system, but it allows us to see how well our hypothesis scoring currently performs.
    This also provides a way of estimating a performance ceiling of the MEMT approach, since our MEMT can only produce words that are provided by the original systems (Hogan and Frederking 1998).
    Due to the computational complex
