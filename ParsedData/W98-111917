ication of a salience statistic that can indicate how confident we should be about the predictions the method makes.
    Following this, we show the results of applying this method to the 21-million-word 1987 Wall Street Journal corpus using two different pronoun reference strategies of varying sophistication, and evaluate their performance using honorifics as reliable gender indicators.
