, 2006).Formally, optimal edge cover assignments are so lutions of following optimization problem: max E is edge cover ?(ndw,ndSR)?E s(nd w,ndSR)(4)where, s(ndw,ndSR) is the compatibility score be tween the frame element node ndw and semantic role node ndSR.
			Edge covers can be computed efficiently in cubic time using algorithms for the equivalent linear assignment problem.
			Our experiments used Jonker and Volgenant?s (1987) solver.2 Figure 3 shows the semantic role assignments generated by our model for the question Q: Whodiscovered prions?
			and the candidate answer sen tence S: 1997: Stanley B. Prusiner, United States,discovery of prions.
			Here we identify two predi cates, namely discover and discovery.
			The expectedanswer phrase (EAP) who and the answer candi date Stanley B. Prusiner are assigned the COGNIZERrole.
			Note that frame elements can bear multiple se mantic roles.
			By inducing a soft labeling we hope to render the matching of questions and answers morerobust, thereby addressing to s
