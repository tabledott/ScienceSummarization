  Automatic Acquisition Of A Large Sub Categorization Dictionary From Corpora
  
    This paper presents a new method for producing a dictionary of subcategorization frames from unlabelled text corpora.
    It is shown that statistical filtering of the results of a finite state parser running on the output of a stochastic tagger produces high quality results, despite the error rates of the tagger and the parser.
    Further, it is argued that this method can be used to learn all subcategorization frames, whereas previous methods are not extensible to a general solution to the problem.
  
  
    Rule-based parsers use subcategorization information to constrain the number of analyses that are generated.
    For example, from subcategorization alone, we can deduce that the PP in (1) must be an argument of the verb, not a noun phrase modifier: Knowledge of subcategorization also aids text gereration programs and people learning a foreign language.
    A subcategorization frame is a statement of what types of syn
