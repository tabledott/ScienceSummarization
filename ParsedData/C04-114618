well i.e., it prefers distributionally more general words.
			The probability of this being the case increasesas the frequency of the potential neighbour increases and so, recall tends to select high fre quency words.
			In contrast, precision prefers words that have occurred in very few contextsthat the target word has not i.e., it prefers distributionally more specific words.
			The prob ability of this being the case increases as the frequency of the potential neighbour decreases and so, precision tends to select low frequencywords.
			The harmonic mean of precision and re call prefers words that have both high precision and high recall.
			The probability of this beingthe case is highest when the words are of sim ilar frequency and so, the harmonic mean will tend to select words of a similar frequency.
	
	
			In this section, we consider the observed fre quency effects from a semantic perspective.The concept of distributional generality in troduced in the previous section has parallels with the linguistic
