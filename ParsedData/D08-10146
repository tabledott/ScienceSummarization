The first scenario, based on a corpus manually annotated for subjectivity, is exemplified by the first experiment.
    The second scenario, based on a corpus automatically annotated with a tool for subjectivity analysis, is subsequently divided into two experiments depending on the direction of the translation and on the dataset that is translated.
    In all three experiments, we use English as a source language, given that it has both a corpus manually annotated for subjectivity (MPQA (Wiebe et al., 2005)) and a tool for subjectivity analysis (OpinionFinder (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005)).
    In this experiment, we use a corpus in the source language manually annotated for subjectivity.
    The corpus is automatically translated into the target language, followed by a projection of the subjectivity labels from the source to the target language.
    The experiment is illustrated in Figure 1.
    We use the MPQA corpus (Wiebe et al., 2005), which is a collection of 535 English-language news articles from a variety
