  Ranking Algorithms For Named Entity Extraction: Boosting And The Voted Perceptron
  
    This paper describes algorithms which rerank the top N hypotheses from a maximum-entropy tagger, the application being the recovery of named-entity boundaries in a corpus of web data.
    The first approach uses a boosting algorithm for ranking problems.
    The second approach uses the voted perceptron algorithm.
    Both algorithms give comparable, significant improvements over the maximum-entropy baseline.
    The voted perceptron algorithm can be considerably more efficient to train, at some cost in computation on test examples.
  
  
    Recent work in statistical approaches to parsing and tagging has begun to consider methods which incorporate global features of candidate structures.
    Examples of such techniques are Markov Random Fields (Abney 1997; Della Pietra et al. 1997; Johnson et al.
    1999), and boosting algorithms (Freund et al. 1998; Collins 2000; Walker et al.
    2001).
