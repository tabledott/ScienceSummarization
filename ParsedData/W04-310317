al sentence contains a speculation more often than not.
    In addition, consider the data where all sentences in an abstract were annotated (sets a &amp; b &amp; e, using Light&#8217;s annotation of a), there were 1456 definitive sentences (89%) and 173 speculative sentence Light Qiu (11%).
    Finally, if we consider the last two sentences of all the data (sets a-f), we have 1712 definitive sentences (82%) and 381 speculative sentences (18.20%).
  
  
    definite, does not receive precision and recall values.
    The substring method was run on a subset of the datasets where the gene regulation data (sets a&amp;b) was removed.
    (It performs extremely well on the gene regulation data due to the fact that it was developed on that data.)
    We decided to explore the ability of an SVMbased text classifier to select speculative sentences from the abstracts.
    For this the abstracts were first processed using the SMART retrieval system (Salton, 1971) in order to obtain representation vectors (term-based).
