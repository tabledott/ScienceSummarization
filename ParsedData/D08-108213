    Therefore model parameters can be directly estimated from the training corpus by counting.
    However, in our task, the correct correspondence between NL words and MR structures is unknown.
    Many possible derivations could reach the same NL-MR pair, where each such derivation forms a hybrid tree.
    The hybrid tree is constructed using hidden variables and estimated from the training set.
    An efficient inside-outside style algorithm can be used for model estimation, similar to that used in (Yamada and Knight, 2001), as discussed next.
    In this section, we discuss how to estimate the emission and pattern parameters with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977), by using an inside-outside (Baker, 1979) dynamic programming approach.
    Denote ni &#8801; hmi, wii as the i-th training instance, where mi and wi are the MR structure and the NL sentence of the i-th instance respectively.
    We also denote nv &#8801; hmv, wvi as an aligned pair of MR substructure and co
