    In the analysis of the parent CS, it is made clear that this CS node depends on bunsetsu &amp;quot;SHIYOU-SHI(be used),&amp;quot; and the dependency tree is transformed by supplementing it with the omitted predicate and the omitted postposition, as shown in Figure 17 (this sentence also contains a conjuncAn example of redetecting a conjunctive structure under a failure of analyzing a dependency structure. tive noun phrase and a conjunctive predicative clause, and all of them are analyzed correctly).
    On the other hand, if the dependency analysis of a CS fails and the conditions for incomplete conjunctive structures are not satisfied, we postulate that the detected scope of a CS is incorrect and start the detection of a new CS for the KB.
    To find a new CS whose pre- and post-conjuncts can be analyzed success
