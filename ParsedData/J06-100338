an performance.
  We have such an upper bound for the Miller and Charles word pairs (but not for the complete set of Rubenstein and Goodenough pairs): Resnik (1995) replicated Miller and 8 We have kept the original orderings of the pairs: from dissimilar to similar for the Rubenstein?
  Goodenough data and from similar to dissimilar for Miller?Charles.
  This explains why the two groups of graphs (Figures 2 and 3) as wholes have the opposite directions.
  Notice that because distJC measures distance, the Jiang?Conrath plot has a slope opposite to the rest of each group.
  9 Resnik (1995), Jiang and Conrath (1997), and Lin (1998b) report the coefficients of correlation between their measures and the Miller?Charles ratings to be 0.7911, 0.8282, and 0.8339, respectively, which differ slightly from the corresponding figures in Table 3.
  These discrepancies can be explained by possible minor differences in implementation (e.g., the compound-word recognition mechanism used in collecting the frequency data), differ
