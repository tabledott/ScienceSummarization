e classification algorithm, training instance selection, and the clustering algorithm.
    We plan to continue investigations along these lines, developing, for example, a true best-first clustering coreference framework and exploring a &#8220;supervised clustering&#8221; approach to the problem.
    In addition, we provide the learning algorithms with many additional linguistic knowledge sources for coreference resolution.
    Unfortunately, we find that performance drops significantly when using the full feature set; we attribute this, at least in part, to the system&#8217;s poor performance on common noun resolution and to data fragmentation problems that arise with the larger feature set.
    Manual feature selection, with an eye toward eliminating low-precision rules for common noun resolution, is shown to reliably improve performance over the full feature set and produces the best results to date on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference data sets &#8212; F-measures of 70.4 and 63.4, respectively.
