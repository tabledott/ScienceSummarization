  Grammatical Category Disambiguation By Statistical Optimization
  
    three previous efforts directed specifically to this problem.
    The first published effort is that of Klein and Simmons (1963), a simple system using suffix lists and limited frame rules.
    The second approach to lexical disambiguation is and Rubin (1971)), a system of several thousand context-frame rules.
    This algorithm was used to assign initial tags to the Brown Corpus.
    Third is the CLAWS system develto tag the (or LOB) Coris a corpus of British written English, parallel to the Brown Corpus.
    Parsing systems always encounter the problem of category ambiguity; but usually the focus of such systems is at other levels, making their responses less relevant for our purposes here.
    1.1 KLEIN AND SIMMONS Klein and Simmons (1963) describe a method directed primarily towards the task of initial categorial tagging rather than disambiguation.
    Its primary goal is avoiding &amp;quot;the labor of constructing a very large dic
