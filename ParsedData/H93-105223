to one sense should be flagged for human reinspection, as they are most likely in error.
  One can speed the sense tagging process by computing the most frequent col- locates, and for each one assigning all examples to the same sense.
  For the data in Table 2, this will apparently fail for the foreignAid/Aide example in 1 out of 719 instances ( till 99.9% correct).
  However, in this example the models classification was actually correct; the given usage was a misspelling in the 1992 AP Newswire: "Bush accelerated foreign aide and weapons ales to Iraq.".
  It is quite likely that if were in- deed a foreign assistant being discussed, this example would also have another collocation (with the verb, for example), 270 which would indicate the correct sense.
  Such inconsisten- cies should also be flagged for human supervision.
  Working from the most to least frequent collocates in this manner, one can use previously tagged collocates to automatically suggest the classification of other words appearing in differ
