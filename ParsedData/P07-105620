 electronics or kitchen appliances.
    Similarly we would also choose one domain from either electronics or kitchen appliances, but not both.
  
  
    Sentiment classification has advanced considerably since the work of Pang et al. (2002), which we use as our baseline.
    Thomas et al. (2006) use discourse structure present in congressional records to perform more accurate sentiment classification.
    Pang and Lee (2005) treat sentiment analysis as an ordinal ranking problem.
    In our work we only show improvement for the basic model, but all of these new techniques also make use of lexical features.
    Thus we believe that our adaptation methods could be also applied to those more refined models.
    While work on domain adaptation for sentiment classifiers is sparse, it is worth noting that other researchers have investigated unsupervised and semisupervised methods for domain adaptation.
    The work most similar in spirit to ours that of Turney (2002).
    He used the difference in mutual informatio
