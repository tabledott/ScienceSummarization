as presegmented by two annotators; discrepancies were resolved by the author of the tagging guidelines.
    In the final phase (about six months) all 100 documents were re-tagged with the new approach and guidelines.
    The remainder of the corpus was tagged in this manner.
    Annotators developed different strategies for analyzing a document and building up the corresponding discourse tree.
    There were two basic orientations for document analysis &#8211; hard copy or graphical visualization with the tool.
    Hard copy analysis ranged from jotting of notes in the margins to marking up the document into discourse segments.
    Those who preferred a graphical orientation performed their analysis simultaneously with building the discourse structure, and were more likely to build the discourse tree in chunks, rather than incrementally.
    We observed a variety of annotation styles for the actual building of a discourse tree.
    Two of the more representative styles are illustrated below. discourse tree by
