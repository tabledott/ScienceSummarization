e focus-space hierarchies in that work are best seen as representing attentional state.
    The task structure was used in two ways: Although the same representational scheme was used for encoding the focus-space hierarchies and the task structure (partitioned networks: Hendrix 1979), the two structures were distinct.
  
  
    Barbara J. Grosz and Candace L. Sidner Attention, Intentions, and the Structure of Discourse Several researchers (e.g., Linde and Goguen 1978, Reichman-Adar 1984) misinterpreted the original research in an unfortunate and unintended way: they took the focus-space hierarchy to include (or be identical to) the task structure.
    The conflation of these two structures forces a single structure to contain information about attentional state, intentional relationships, and general task, knowledge.
    It prevents a theory from accounting adequately for certain aspects of discourse, including interruptions (see Section 5).
    A second instance of confusion was to infer (incorrectly) that t
