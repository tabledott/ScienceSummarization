opics in sports, politics, fashion, education, and others.
    The reason for working with this collection is the fact that we also have a manual translation of the SemCor documents from English into one of the target languages used in the experiments (Romanian), which enables comparative evaluations of different scenarios (see Section 4).
    Note that in this experiment the annotation of subjectivity is carried out on the original source language text, and thus expected to be more accurate than if it were applied on automatically translated text.
    However, the training data in the target language is produced by automatic translation, and thus likely to contain errors.
    The third experiment is similar to the second one, except that we reverse the direction of the translation.
    We translate raw text that is available in the target language into the source language, and then use a subjectivity annotation tool to label the automatically translated source language text.
    After the annotation, the lab
