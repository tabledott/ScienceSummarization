ment increases if lexical information is added to the model.
			Suggestions for further research includes the further exploration of alternative models and parameter settings, but also the combination of inductive and analytical learning to impose high-level linguistic constraints, and the development of new parsing methods (e.g. involving multiple passes over the data).
			In addition, it is important to evaluate the approach with respect to other languages and corpora in order to increase the comparability with other approaches.
