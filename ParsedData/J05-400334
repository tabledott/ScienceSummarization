sh comparable corpora.
    We use a dictionary learned from a parallel corpus on 190M English tokens and a classifier trained on instances generated from a parallel corpus of 220k English tokens.
    We start with a comparable corpus consisting of 500k Chinese articles and 600k English articles.
    The article selection step (Section 2.1) outputs 7.5M similar article pairs; from each article pair we generate all possible sentence pairs and obtain 2,400M pairs.
    Of these, less than 1% (17M) pass the candidate selection stage (Section 2.2) and are presented to the ME classifier.
    The system outputs 430k sentence pairs (9.5M English tokens) that have been classified as parallel (with probability greater than 0.7).
    The figure also presents, in the lower part, the parameters that control the filtering at each stage. the particular sentence pair to be parallel; the higher the value, the higher the classifier&#8217;s confidence.
    Thus, in order to obtain higher precision, we can choose to define as par
