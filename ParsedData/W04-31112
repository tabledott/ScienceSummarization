rature for those associations that link specified variations in individual genes with known malignancies.
    In particular we are interested in extracting three entities (Gene, Variation Event, and Malignancy) in the following relationship: Gene X with genomic Variation Event Y is correlated with Malignancy Z.
    For example, WT1 is deleted in Wilms Tumor #S. Such statements found in the literature represent individual gene-variation-malignancy observables.
    A collection of such observables serves two important functions.
    First, it summarizes known relationships between genes, variation events, and malignancies in the cancer literature.
    As such, it can be used to augment information available from curated public databases, as well as serve as an independent test for accuracy and completeness of such repositories.
    Second, it allows inferences to be made about gene, variation, and malignancy associations that may not be explicitly stated in the literature, both at the fact and entity instance l
