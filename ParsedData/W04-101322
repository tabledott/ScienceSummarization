mproved performance in general except for ROUGE-1.
    Due to the large number of samples (624) in this data set, using multiple references did not improve correlations.
    In Table 3 A1, A2, and A3, we show correlation analysis results on DUC 2001, 2002, and 2003 100 words multi-document summarization data.
    The results indicated that using multiple references improved correlation and exclusion of stopwords usually improved performance.
    ROUGE-1, 2, and 3 performed fine but were not consistent.
    ROUGE-1, ROUGE-S4, ROUGE-SU4, ROUGE-S9, and ROUGESU9 with stopword removal had correlation above 0.70.
    ROUGE-L and ROUGE-W did not work well in this set of data.
    Table 3 C, D1, D2, E1, E2, and F show the correlation analyses using multiple references on the rest of DUC data.
    These results again suggested that exclusion of stopwords achieved better performance especially in multi-document summaries of 50 words.
    Better correlations (&gt; 0.70) were observed on long summary tasks, i.e.
    200
