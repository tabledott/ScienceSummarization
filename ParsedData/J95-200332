ir of retentions, Ret(Un,Un+i) and Ret(Un+i,Un+2).
    The case is analogous for pair of retentions and a pair of shifts.
    Rule 2 reflects our intuition that continuation of the center and the use of retentions when possible to produce smooth transitions to a new center provides a basis for local coherence.
    In a locally coherent discourse segment, shifts are followed by a sequence of continuations characterizing another stretch of locally coherent discourse.
    Frequent shifting leads to a lack of local coherence, as was illustrated by the contrast between Discourse (1) and Discourse (2) in Section 2.
    Thus, Rule 2 provides a constraint on speakers, and on natural-language generation systems.
    They should plan ahead to minimize the number of shifts.
    This rule does not have the same direct implementation for interpretation systems; rather it predicts that certain sequences produce a higher inference load than others.
    To empirically test the claim made by Rule 2 requires examination of dif
