r, we describe a manual annotation experiment we performed, give preliminary results on our attempts to automatically annotate sentences as containing speculative fragments, and conclude with comments on possible future work.
  
  
    In this experiment, four human annotators manually marked sentences as highly speculative, low speculative, or definite.
    Some of the questions we hoped to answer with this experiment were: can we characterize what a speculative sentence is (as demonstrated by good inter-annotator agreement), can a distinction between high and low speculation be made, how much speculative speech is there, where are speculative sentences located in the abstract, is there variation across topics?
    The annotators were instructed to follow written annotation guidelines which we provide in appendix of this paper.
    We wanted to explore how well the annotators agreed on relatively abstract classifications such as &#8220;requires extrapolation from actual findings&#8221; and thus we refrained
