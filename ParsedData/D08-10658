    Because a lattice may represent a number of candidates exponential in the size of its state set, it is often impractical to compute the MBR decoder (Equation 1) directly.
    However, if we can express the gain function G as a sum of local gain functions gi, then we now show that Equation 1 can be refactored and the MBR decoder can be computed efficiently.
    We loosely call a gain function local if it can be applied to all paths in the lattice via WFSA intersection (Mohri, 2002) without significantly multiplying the number of states.
    In this paper, we are primarily concerned with local gain functions that weight n-grams.
    Let N = {w1, ... , w|N|} be the set of n-grams and let a local gain function gw : &#163; x &#163; &#8212;* R, for w E N, be as follows: where &#952;w is a constant, #w(E0) is the number of times that w occurs in E0, and &#948;w(E) is 1 if w E E and 0 otherwise.
    That is, gw is &#952;w times the number of occurrences of w in E0, or zero if w does
