ress on the joint extraction of opinion entities and their relations, the capabilities of opinion based applications will remain limited.
			Fortunately, research in machine learning has produced methods for global inference and jointclassification that can help to address this defi ciency (e.g. Bunescu and Mooney (2004), Roth and Yih (2004)).
			Moreover, it has been shown thatexploiting dependencies among entities and/or re lations via global inference not only solves the joint extraction task, but often boosts performanceon the individual tasks when compared to clas sifiers that handle the tasks independently ? for semantic role labeling (e.g. Punyakanok et al (2004)), information extraction (e.g. Roth and Yih (2004)), and sequence tagging (e.g. Sutton et al (2004)).In this paper, we present a global inference ap proach (Roth and Yih, 2004) to the extractionof opinion-related entities and relations.
			In par ticular, we aim to identify two types of entities(i.e. spans of text): entities that express opin
