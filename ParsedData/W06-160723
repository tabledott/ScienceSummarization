their own.
    However, in combination with another phrasetable, they yield the best results, obtained by RF+ZN-IBM1 and GT+KOM-IBM1, which are statistically indistinguishable.
    In constrast to the situation in the broad-coverage setting, these are not significantly better than the best black-box method (GT) on its own, although RF+ZN-IBM1 is better than all other glass-box combinations.
    A striking difference between the broadcoverage setting and the Chinese-English setting is that in the former it appears to be beneficial to apply KN3 smoothing to the phrasetable that gets combined with the best glass-box phrasetable (ZN), whereas in the latter setting it does not.
    To test whether this was due to corpus size (as the broad-coverage corpora are around 10% of those for Chinese-English), we calculated ChineseEnglish learning curves for the RF+ZN-IBM1 and KN3-ZN-IBM1 methods, shown in figure 1.
    The results are somewhat inconclusive: although the KN3+ZN-IBM1 curve is perhaps slightly flatter, the mo
