the time complexity is linear to the beam-size.
    Computing the bilingual features further slows it down, but only fractionally so (just 1.06 times as slow as the baseline at k=16), which is appealing in practice.
    By contrast, Burkett and Klein (2008) reported their approach of &#8220;monolingual k-best parsing followed by bilingual k2-best reranking&#8221; to be &#8220;3.8 times slower&#8221; than monolingual parsing.
    Our final results on the test set (290 sentences) are summarized in Table 9.
    On both English and Chinese, the addition of bilingual features improves dependency arc accuracies by +0.6%, which is mildly significant using the Z-test of Collins et al. (2005).
    We also compare our results against the Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) as a reference system, with the exact same setting (i.e., trained on the bilingual data, and testing using gold-standard POS tags), and the resulting trees are converted into dependency via the same headrules.
    We use 5 iterations of split-me
