by devising a callingarchitecture that reinitializes the decoder with dynamically generated lexicons on a per-sentence ba sis.Unlike a n-best reranking approach, which is limited by the lexical choices made by the decoder using only the baseline context-independent transla tion probabilities, our method allows the system to make full use of WSD information for all competing phrases at all decoding stages.
	
	
			The evaluation is conducted on two standard Chinese to English translation tasks.
			We follow standard machine translation evaluation procedure us ing automatic evaluation metrics.
			Since our goal is to evaluate translation quality, we use standard MTevaluation methodology and do not evaluate the ac curacy of the WSD model independently.
