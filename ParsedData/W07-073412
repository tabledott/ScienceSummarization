ge-specific optimal parameters results in significant gains in Pearson correlation levels with human judgments on the training data (compared with those obtained using the English optimal parameters)'.
    Note that the training sets used for these optimizations are comparatively very small, and that we currently do not have unseen test data to evaluate the parameters for these three languages.
    Further validation will need to be performed once additional data becomes available.
  
  
    In this paper we described newly developed language-specific instances of the METEOR metric and the process of optimizing metric parameters for different human measures of translation quality and for different languages.
    Our evaluations demonstrate that parameter tuning improves correlation with human judgments.
    The stability of the optimized parameters on different data sets remains to be investigated for languages other than English.
    We are currently exploring broadening the set of features used in METEOR to
