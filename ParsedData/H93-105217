  performance of 69% one would expect simply by chance due to the unbalanced prior probability of the two senses.
  It should be noted that such precision is achieved at only partial recall.
  The three rightmost columns of Table 3 give the breakdown of the recall.
  On average, the model content- word-to-right could only be applied in 29% of the test samples.
  In 57% of the cases, no content word appeared to the right, so this collocational model did not hold.
  In 14% of the cases, a content word did appear to the right, but no instances of that word appeared in the training data, so the model had
