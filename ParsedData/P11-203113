nce of 1.5 BLEU, corresponding to the widely replicated result that hierarchical phrase-based systems outperform conventional phrase-based systems in Chinese-English translation.
    Crucially, although the distributions are distinct, there is a non-trivial region of overlap, and experimental samples from the overlapping region could suggest the opposite conclusion!
    To further underscore the risks posed by this overlap, Figure 2 plots the relative frequencies with which different BLEU score deltas will occur, as a function of the number of optimizer samples used.
    When is a difference significant?
    To determine whether an experimental manipulation results in a statistically reliable difference for an evaluation metric, we use a stratified approximate randomization (AR) test.
    This is a nonparametric test that approximates a paired permutation test by sampling permutations (Noreen, 1989).
    AR estimates the probability (p-value) that a measured difference in metric scores arose by chance by rand
