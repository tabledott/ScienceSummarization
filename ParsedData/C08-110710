lment rules from regular non-comparable cor pora.
			We first describe the structure of unarytemplates and then explore two conceivable approaches for learning unary rules.
			The first ap proach directly assesses the relation between twogiven templates based on the similarity of their in stantiations in the corpus.
			The second approach,which was also mentioned in (Iftene and Balahur Dobrescu, 2007), derives unary rules from learned binary rules.
			3.2 Unary Template Structure.
			To learn unary rules we first need to define theirstructure.
			In this paper we work at the syntac tic representation level.
			Texts are represented by dependency parse trees (using the Minipar parser (Lin, 1998b)) and templates by parse sub-trees.
			Given a dependency parse tree, any sub-tree can be a candidate template, setting some of its nodesas variables (Sudo et al, 2003).
			However, the num ber of possible templates is exponential in the sizeof the sentence.
			In the binary rule learning litera ture, the main solution
