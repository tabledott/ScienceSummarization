r more symbol vertices have a common state vertex immediately on their left and a common state vertex immediately on their right, they represent local ambiguity.
    Nodes pointed to by these symbol vertices are to be packed as one node.
    In Figure 2.5, for example, we see one 5-way local ambiguity and two 2-way local ambiguities.
    The algorithm is made clear by the example in the following section.
    Recently, the author (Tomita 1986) suggested a technique to disambiguate a sentence out of the sharedpacked forest representation by asking the user a minimal number of questions in natural language (without showing any tree structures).
  
  
    This section presents three examples.
    The first example, using the sentence I saw a man in the apartment with a telescope, is intended to help the reader understand the algorithm mOre clearly.
    The second example, with the sentence That information is important is doubtful, is presented to demonstrate that our algorithm is able to handle multi-part-of-sp
