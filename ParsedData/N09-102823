nn Treebank evaluation.
    As our results in Table 3 show, for all 5 languages, by using the precedence reordering rules as described in Table 1, we achieve significantly better BLEU scores compared to the baseline system.
    In the table, We use two stars (**) to mean that the statistical significance test using the bootstrap method (Koehn, 2004) gives an above 95% significance level when compared to the baselie.
    We measured the statistical significance level only for the blindtest data.
    Note that for Korean and Japanese, our precedence reordering rules achieve better absolute BLEU score improvements than for Hindi, Urdu and Turkish.
    Since we only analyzed English and Korean sentences, it is possible that our rules are more geared toward Korean.
    Japanese has almost exactly the same word order as Korean, so we could assume the benefits can carry over to Japanese.
    One of our motivations of using the precedence reordering rules is that English will look like SOV languages in word order aft
