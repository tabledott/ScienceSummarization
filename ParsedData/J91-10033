    On the whole, the two phenomena remain vague, poorly defined notions in that literature.
    In artificial intelligence (AI), detailed treatments of either metaphor or metonymy are relatively scarce.
    Moreover, most of those treatments are paper implementations that have not been coded up and run on a computer.
    The met* (pronounced &amp;quot;met star&amp;quot;) method provides a means for recognizing selected examples of metonymy and metaphor, and also anomaly and literalness, in short English sentences.'
    The method is part of Collative Semantics (hereafter CS), which is a semantics for natural language processing.
    CS, and hence the met* method, has been implemented in a program called meta5 (so called because it does more than metaphor).
    The meta5 program is, as far as
