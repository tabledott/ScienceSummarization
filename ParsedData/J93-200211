 identical, while those of others are distinct.
    As a result, using the -ed forms would have complicated the statistical model substantially.
    Since the availability of raw text is not generally a limiting factor, it makes sense to wait for the simpler cases.
    When a putative occurrence of a verb is found, the next step is to identify the syntactic types of nearby phrases and determine whether or not they are likely to be arguments of the verb.
    First, assume that a phrase P and a verb V have been identified in some sentence.
    Lerner 's strategy for determining whether P is an argument to V has two components: For example, suppose that the sequence that the were identified as the left boundary of a clause in the sentence I want to tell him that the idea won't fly.
    Because pronouns like him almost never take relative clauses, and because pronouns are known at the outset, Lerner concludes that the clause beginning with that the is probably an argument of the verb tell.'
    It is always possi
