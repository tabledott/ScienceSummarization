    Another example is the prepositional phrase where alternative attachment structures are indicated by different relations.
    Many of these distinctions are too fine and non-semantic to be of practical value.
    The SD scheme, by aiming for an intermediate level of granularity, and targeting semantic dependencies, provides a more adequate representation for applications.
    Therefore, to increase the usability of the BioInfer corpus (Pyysalo et al., 2007b), which provides manually annotated data for information extraction in the biomedical domain and originally followed the Link Grammar scheme, Pyysalo et al. (2007a) developed a version of the corpus annotated with the SD scheme.
    They also made available a program and conversion rules that they used to transform Link Grammar relations into SD graphs, which
