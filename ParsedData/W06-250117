used in a word sense disambiguation algorithm described by (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003).
    Word sense disambiguation is the task of determining the meaning (from multiple possibilities) of a word in its given context.
    For example, in the sentence The ex-cons broke into the bank on Elm street, the word bank has the &#8220;financial institution&#8221; sense as opposed to the &#8220;edge of a river&#8221; sense.
    Banerjee and Pedersen attempt to perform this task by measuring the relatedness of the senses of the target word to those of the words in its context.
    The sense of the target word that is most related to its context is selected as the intended sense of the target word.
    The experimental data used for this evaluation is the SENSEVAL-2 test data.
    It consists of 4,328 instances (or contexts) that each includes a single ambiguous target word.
    Each instance consists of approximately 2-3 sentences and one occurrence of a target word.
    1,754 of the instances include nouns as target
