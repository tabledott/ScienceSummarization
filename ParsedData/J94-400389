   The first factor in this product, which represents the target language model, may thus affect any aspect of the translation, including target word selection.
    It seems, however, that Brown et al. expect that target word selection would be determined mainly by translation probabilities (the second factor in the above term), which should be derived from a bilingual corpus (Brown et al.
    1990, p. 79).
    This view is reflected also in their elaborate method for target word selection (Brown et al. 1991), in which better estimates of translation probabilities are achieved as a result of word sense disambiguation.
    Our method, on the other hand, incorporates only target language probabilities and ignores any notion of translation probabilities.
    It thus demonstrates a possible trade-off between these two types of probabilities: using more informative statistics of the target language may compensate for the lack of translation probabilities.
    For our system, the more informative statistics are ach
