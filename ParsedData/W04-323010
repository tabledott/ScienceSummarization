rarchical tagsets.
    CRFs have a single exponential model for the joint probability of the entire paths given the input sentence, while MEMMs consist of a sequential combination of exponential models, each of which estimates a conditional probability of next tokens given the current state.
    This minimizes the influences of the label and length bias.
    As explained in Section 2.1, there is word boundary ambiguity in Japanese, and we choose to use a lattice instead of B/I tagging.
    This implies that the set of labels and the set of states are different, and the number of tokens #y varies according to a path.
    In order to accomodate this, we define CRFs for Japanese morphological analysis as the conditional probability of an output path y = ((w1, t1), ... , (w#y, t#y)) given an input sequence x: where Zx is a normalization factor over all candidate paths, i.e., fk(hwi&#8722;1, ti&#8722;1i, hwi, tii) is an arbitrary feature function over i-th token hwi, tii, and its previous token hwi&#8722;1, ti&#87
