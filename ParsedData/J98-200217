ame code length to each cut and let: where G denotes the set of all cuts in the thesaurus tree T.' This corresponds to assuming that each tree cut model is equally likely a priori, in the Bayesian interpretation of MDL.
    (See Section 3.4.)
    The parameter description length L(O I F) is calculated by: L(e I F) = x log ISI (9) where I SI denotes the sample size and k denotes the number of free parameters in the tree cut model, i.e., k equals the number of nodes in F minus one.
    It is known to be best to use this number of bits to describe probability parameters in order to minimize the expected total description length (Rissanen 1984, 1986).
    An intuitive explanation of this is that the standard deviation of the maximum-likelihood estimator of each parameter is of the orderV,-11s1, and hence describing each parameter using more than &#8211; log =1 log IS I bits would be wasteful for the estimation accuracy possible with the given sample size.
    Finally, the data description length L(S I F, e) is ca
