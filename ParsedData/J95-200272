sult of adding and multiplying among the non-negative elements of PL and Pu, respectively.
    Interestingly, a SCFG may be inconsistent and still have converging left-corner and/or unit production matrices, i.e., consistency is a stronger constraint.
    For example is inconsistent for any choice of q &gt; but the left-corner relation (a single number in this case) is well defined for all q &lt; 1, namely (1 - q)-1 p-1.
    In this case the left fringe of the derivation is guaranteed to result in a terminal after finitely many steps, but the derivation as a whole may never terminate.
  
  
    This appendix discusses some of the experiences gained from implementing the probabilistic Earley parser.
    B.1 Prediction Because of the collapse of transitive predictions, this step can be implemented in a very efficient and straightforward manner.
    As explained in Section 4.5, one has to perform a single pass over the current state set, identifying all nonterminals Z occurring to the right of dots, and add stat
