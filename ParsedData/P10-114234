re typically used.
    In the first method, the NPs are extracted automatically from a syntactic parser.
    The second method involves extracting the NPs directly from the gold standard.
    In the third method, a mention detector is first trained on the gold-standard NPs in the training texts, and is then applied to automatically extract system mentions in a test text.7 Note that these three extraction methods typically produce different numbers of NPs: the NPs extracted from a parser tend to significantly outnumber the system mentions, which in turn outnumber the gold NPs.
    The reasons are two-fold.
    First, in some coreference corpora (e.g., MUC-6 and MUC-7), the NPs that are not part of any coreference chain are not annotated.
    Second, in corpora such as those produced by the ACE evaluations, only the NPs that belong to one of the ACE entity types (e.g., PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION) are annotated.
    Owing in large part to the difference in the number of NPs extracted by these three methods,
