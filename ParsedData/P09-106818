 advance.
    By contrast, our approach induces sets of entities that appear in the argument positions of verbs in a narrative schema.
    Our model thus does not assume the set of roles is known in advance, and it learns the roles at the same time as clustering verbs into frame-like schemas.
    The resulting sets of entities (such as {police, agent, authorities, government} or {court, judge, justice}) can be viewed as a kind of schema-specific semantic role.
    How can this unsupervised method of learning roles be evaluated?
    In Section 6 we evaluate the schemas together with their arguments in a cloze task.
    In this section we perform a more qualitative evalation by comparing our schema to FrameNet.
    FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) is a database of frames, structures that characterize particular situations.
    A frame consists of a set of events (the verbs and nouns that describe them) and a set of frame-specific semantic roles called frame elements that can be arguments of the lexical units in th
