indicates substitution and a bold line indicates adjunction) while the address of the operation is indicated as part of the node label.
    The derivation tree can also be interpreted as a dependency tree with unlabeled arcs between words of the sentence, as shown in Figure 8(c).
    A broad-coverage grammar system, XTAG, has been implemented in the LTAG formalism.
    In this section, we briefly discuss some aspects related to XTAG for the sake of completeness.
    A more detailed report on XTAG can be found in XTAG-Group (1995).
    The XTAG system consists of a morphological analyzer, a part-of-speech tagger, a wide-coverage LTAG English grammar, a predictive left-to-right Earley-style parser for LTAG (Schabes 1990), and an X-windows interface for grammar development (Doran et al. 1994).
    The input sentence is subjected to morphological analysis and is tagged with parts of speech before being sent to the parser.
    The parser retrieves the elementary trees that the words of the sentence anchor and comb
