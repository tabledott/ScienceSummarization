veloped with and for L1 language, a loss of performance on L2 data is to be expected.
			These methods usually expect grammatically well-formed input; learner text is often ungrammatical, misspelled, and different in content and structure from typical L1 resources such as the WSJ and the BNC.
			6.2 Prepositions.
			For the preposition task, we extract 2523 instances of preposition use from the CLC (1282 correct, 1241 incorrect) and ask the classifier to mark them 5 The CLC is a computerised database of contemporary written learner English (currently over 25m words).
			It wasdeveloped jointly by Cambridge ESOL and Cambridge Uni versity Press.
			The Cambridge Error Coding System has been developed and applied manually to the data by Cambridge University Press.

			Ac curacy on incorrect instances refers to the classifier successfully identifying the preposition in the text as not appropriate for that context
