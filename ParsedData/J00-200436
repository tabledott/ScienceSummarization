ly if they don't conflict with previous selections.
    The probability of a link being rejected increases with the number of links that are selected before it, and thus decreases with the link's score.
    In this problem domain, the competitive linking algorithm usually finds one of the most likely assignments, as I will show in Section 6.
    Under an appropriate hashing scheme, the expected running time of the competitive linking algorithm is linear in the size of the input bitext.
    The competitive linking algorithm and its one-to-one assumption are potent weapons against the ever-present sparse data problem.
    They enable accurate estimation of translational distributions even for words that occur only once, as long as the surrounding words are more frequent.
    In most translation models, link scores are correlated with co-occurrence frequency.
    So, links between tokens u and v for which score(u,v) is highest are the ones for which there is the most evidence, and thus also the ones that are eas
