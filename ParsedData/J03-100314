 clean solution for these problems.
  
  
    In the previous section we saw that a scene can be described in terms of a domain of entities D with properties P and relations R. Such a scene can be represented as a labeled directed graph (see, e.g., Wilson [1996] for a gentle introduction or Berge [1985] for a more specialized one).
    Let L = P U R be the set of labels with P and R disjoint (i.e., P fl R = 0).
    Then G = (VG, EG) is a labeled directed graph, where VG C D is the set of vertices (or nodes) and EG C VG x L x VG is the set of labeled directed edges (or arcs).
    Where this can be done without creating confusion, the graph subscript is omitted.
    Throughout this article we use the following notations.
    If G = (V, E) is a graph and e = (v, l, w) an edge (with l E L), then the extension of G with e, denoted as G + e, is the graph (V U {v, w}, E U {e}).
    Moreover, with EG(v, w) we refer to the set of edges in EG from v to w; that is, EG(v, w) = {e E EG  |e = (v, l, w), for l E L}.
