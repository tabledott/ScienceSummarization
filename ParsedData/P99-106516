ditions, and the full model with everything but the bigram model.
    The baseline system on the fithat although the Science section only contributes 25% of the sentences in test data, it contains much longer sentences than the other sections and therefore accounts for 38% of the dependencies in test data. nal test set achieved 72.3% accuracy.
    The final system achieved 80.0% accuracy3: a 7.7% absolute improvement and a 27.8% relative improvement.
    The development set showed very similar results: a baseline accuracy of 71.9% and a final accuracy of 79.3%.
    Table 3 shows the relative improvement of each component of the mode14.
    Table 4 shows the results on the development set by genre.
    It is interesting to see that the performance on newswire text is over 2% better than the averaged performance.
    The Science section of the development set is considerably harder to parse (presumably because of longer sentences and more open vocabulary).
