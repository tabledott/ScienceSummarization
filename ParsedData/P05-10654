f reading level assessment focus on simple approximations of syntactic complexity such as sentence length.
    The widelyused Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level index is based on the average number of syllables per word and the average sentence length in a passage of text (Kincaid et al., 1975) (as cited in (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004)).
    Similarly, the Gunning Fog index is based on the average number of words per sentence and the percentage of words with three or more syllables (Gunning, 1952).
    These methods are quick and easy to calculate but have drawbacks: sentence length is not an accurate measure of syntactic complexity, and syllable count does not necessarily indicate the difficulty of a word.
    Additionally, a student may be familiar with a few complex words (e.g. dinosaur names) but unable to understand complex syntactic constructions.
    Other measures of readability focus on semantics, which is usually approximated by word frequency with respect to a reference list or corpus.
