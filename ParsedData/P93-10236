are known to possess interesting properties, derived from conventional logical entailment on the linear ordering of their elements and from Gricean scalar implicature (Levinson, 1983).
    Despite these properties and their potential usefulness in both understanding and generating natural language text, dictionary entries are largely incomplete for adjectives in this regard.
    Yet, if systems are to use the information encoded in adjectival scales for generation or interpretation (e.g. for selecting an adjective with a particular degree of semantic strength (Elhadad, 1991, Elhadad, 1993), or for handling negation), they must have access to the sets of words comprising a scale.
    Linguists have presented various tests for accepting or rejecting a particular scalar relationship between any two adjectives.
    For example, Horn (1969) proposed a test using the phrase &amp;quot;x even y&amp;quot; for two elements x and y of a totally ordered scale.
    More refined tests locate the position of an adjective in
