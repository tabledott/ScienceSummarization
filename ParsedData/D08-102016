 in each sentence requires the reader to remember more items, but may make the article more interesting.
    (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008) found that articles written for adults tended to contain many more entities than articles written for children.
    While including more verb phrases in each sentence increases the sentence complexity, adults might prefer to have related clauses explicitly grouped together.
    The correlations between readability and syntactic features is shown in Table 3.
    The strongest correlation is that between readability and number of verb phrases (0.42).
    This finding is in line with prescriptive clear writing advice (Gunning, 1952; Spandel, 2004), but is to our knowledge novel in the computational linguistics literature.
    As (Bailin and Grafstein, 2001) point out, the sentences in (1) are easier to comprehend than the sentences in (2), even though they are longer.
    Multiple verb phrases in one sentence may be indicative of explicit discourse relations, which we will disc
