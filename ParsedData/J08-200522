 example, the conjunction of the predicate and path features for the predicate assume and the constituent [S who has been elected deputy chairman] in Figure 1 is (S?NP?PP?VP?VBN, assume).
  3.2.2 Features Used When Only Shallow Parsing is Available.
  Most features used here are similar to those used by the systemwith full parsing information.
  However, for features that need full parse trees in their extraction procedures, we either try to mimic them with some heuristic rules or discard them.
  The details of these features are as follows.
  
  
  
  This aims to approximate the Path features extracted from the full parse tree.
  
  This aims to approximate the Subcategorization feature extracted from the full parse tree.
  3.3 Argument Classification This stage assigns labels to the argument candidates identified in the previous stage.
  A multi-class classifier is trained to predict the types of the argument candidates.
  In addition, to reduce the excessive candidates mistakenly output by the previous st
