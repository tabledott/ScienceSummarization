  Response: &lt;A-B C-D F-G G-H&gt; Figure 1 shows the equivalence classes corresponding to the key and response .
  Figure 2 shows how the response partitions the two key sets .
  Based on this, we can compute recall using the corpus-wide formula for recall .
  Since there are two key sets, there will be tw o terms each in the numerator and the denominator .

  1 ) (3?2)+(4?3) (3?1)+(4?1) = 2/5 or 40% This is consistent with the observation that the response only provides two out of the fiv e links that are minimally required to fully designate all the coreference relations .
  Turning to precision, Figure 3 shows the partitions induced on the three response sets by the key .
