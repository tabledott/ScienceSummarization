  Supervised Models for Coreference Resolution
  
    Traditional learning-based coreference reoperate by training a mentionfor determining whether two mentions are coreferent or not.
    Two independent lines of recent research have attempted to improve these mention-pair one by learning a mentionto rank preceding mentions for a given anaphor, and the other training an to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferent with a given mention.
    We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreference resolution that combines the strengths of mention rankers and entitymention models.
    We additionally show how our cluster-ranking framework naturally allows discourse-new entity detection to be learned jointly with coreference resolution.
    Experimental results on the ACE data sets demonstrate its superior performance to competing approaches.
  
  
    Noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution is the task of identifying which NPs (or mentions) refer to the same real-world entity or concept.
