out 53 random verbs from the 1000 most frequent ones found in a subset of the Reuters corpus2.
    For each verb entry in the lexicon, we provided the judges with the corresponding pivot template and the list of related candidate entailment templates found by the system.
    The judges were asked to evaluate entailment for a total of 752 templates, extracted for 53 pivot lexicon entries; Table 1 shows a sample of the evaluated templates; all of them are clearly good and were judged as correct ones. included in the evaluation test set.
    Concerning the ASE algorithm, threshold parameters3 were set as PHRASEMAXF=107, SETMINF=102, SETMAXF=105, SETMINP=0.066, and SETMAXP=0.666.
    An upper limit of 30 was imposed on the number of possible anchor sets used for each pivot.
    Since this last value turned out to be very conservative with respect to system coverage, we subsequently attempted to relax it to 50 (see Discussion in Section 4.3).
    Further post-processing was necessary over extracted data in order t
