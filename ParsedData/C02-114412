t is discovered in this phase defines one of the final output clusters of the algorithm.
			4.3.
			Phase III: Assign elements to clusters.
			In Phase III, every element is assigned to the cluster containing the committee to which it is most similar.
			This phase resembles K-means in that every element is assigned to its closest centroid.
			Unlike K-means, the number of clusters is not fixed and the centroids do not change (i.e. when an element is added to a cluster, it is not added to the committee of the cluster).
	
	
			Many cluster evaluation schemes have been proposed.
			They generally fall under two categories: ? comparing cluster outputs with manually generated answer keys (hereon referred to as classes); or ? embedding the clusters in an application and using its evaluation measure.
			An example of the first approach considers the average entropy of the clusters, which measures the purity of the clusters (Steinbach, Karypis, and Kumar 2000).
			However, maximum purity is trivially achieved when e
