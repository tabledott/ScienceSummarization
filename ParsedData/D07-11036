then define: C(s?, t?)
			as the number of parallel sentences that contain one or more occurrences of s?
			on the source side and t?
			on the target side; C(s?) the number of parallel sentences that contain one or more occurrences of s?
			on the source side; and C(t?) the number of parallel sentences that contain one or more occurrences of t?
			on the target side.
			Together with N , the number of parallel sentences, we haveenough information to draw up a two by two contingency table representing the unconditional relation ship between s?
			and t?.
			This table is shown in Table 1.
			A standard statistical technique used to assess theimportance of an association represented by a con tingency table involves calculating the probability that the observed table or one that is more extremecould occur by chance assuming a model of independence.
			This is called a significance test.
			Intro ductory statistics texts describe one such test called the Chi-squared test.
			There are other tests that more accur
