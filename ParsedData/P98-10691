extract domain-specific terms.
    It remains to be seen how we can also make use of the multilingual texts as NLP resources.
    In the years since the appearance of the first papers on using statistical models for bilingual lexicon compilation and machine translation(Brown et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1993; Church, 1993; Simard et al., 1992), large amount of human effort and time has been invested in collecting parallel corpora of translated texts.
    Our goal is to alleviate this effort and enlarge the scope of corpus resources by looking into monolingual, comparable texts.
    This type of texts are known as nonparallel corpora.
    Such nonparallel, monolingual texts should be much more prevalent than parallel texts.
    However, previous attempts at using nonparallel corpora for terminology translation were constrained by the inadequate availability of same-domain, comparable texts in electronic form.
    The type of nonparallel texts obtained from the LDC or university libraries
