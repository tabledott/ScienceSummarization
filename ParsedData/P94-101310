mantic evidence in lexical ambiguity resolution has been realized in (Chang et al., 1992).
    A particularly successful algorithm for integrating a wide diversity of evidence types using error driven learning was presented in Brill (1993).
    While it has been applied primarily to syntactic problems, it shows tremendous promise for equally impressive results in the area of semantic ambiguity resolution.
    The formal model of decision lists was presented in (Rivest, 1987).
    I have restricted feature conjuncts to a much narrower complexity than allowed in the original model&#8212; namely to word and class trigrams.
    The current approach was initially presented in (Sproat et al., 1992), applied to the problem of homograph resolution in textto-speech synthesis.
    The algorithm achieved 97% mean accuracy on a disambiguation task involving a sample of 13 homographs'.
  
  
    Most words in Spanish and French exhibit only one accent pattern.
    Basic corpus analysis will indicate which is the most comm
