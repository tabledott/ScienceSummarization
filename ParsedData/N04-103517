    This traversal annotates each node with its span and its complement span.
    The complement span is computed as the union of the complement span of its parent and the span of all its siblings (siblings are nodes that share the same parent).
    A node n is in the frontier set iff complement span(n) n closure(span(n)) = 0.
    Notice that the complement span merely summarizes the spans of all nodes that are neither ancestors nor descendents of n. Since this step requires only a single graph traversal, it runs in linear time.
    Step 2 can also be computed straightforwardly.
    For each node n of the frontier set, do the following: expand n, then as long as there is some sink node n' of the resulting graph fragment that is not in the frontier set, expand n'.
    Note that after computing the minimal graph fragment rooted at each node of the frontier set, every node of the alignment graph has been expanded at most once.
    Thus this step also runs in linear time.
