count collected at positions t and v in the sequence pair is the sum of all paths that generate the sequence pair and go through (t, v), divided by the sum of all paths that generate the entire sequence pair (&#945;(T, V )).
    Once the probabilities are learned, the Viterbi algorithm can be used to produce the most likely alignment as in the following equations.
    Back pointers to maximizing arguments are kept at each step so the alignment can be reconstructed.
    Given a set of words and their phonemes, alignments are made across graphemes and phonemes.
    For example, the word phoenix, with phonemes [ f i n i k s ], is aligned as: ph oe n i x || f i n i ks The letters ph are an example of the double letter problem (mapping to the single phoneme [ f ]), while the letter x is an example of the double phoneme problem (mapping to both [ k ] and [ s ] in the phoneme sequence).
    These alignments provide more accurate grapheme-to-phoneme relationships for a phoneme prediction model.
