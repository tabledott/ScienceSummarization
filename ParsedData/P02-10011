e bounded memory they are well-suited to describe many linguistic and textual processes, either exactly or approximately.
    A relation is a set of (input, output) pairs.
    Relations are more general than functions because they may pair a given input string with more or fewer than one output string.
    The class of so-called rational relations admits a nice declarative programming paradigm.
    Source code describing the relation (a regular expression) is compiled into efficient object code (in the form of a 2-tape automaton called a finite-state transducer).
    The object code can even be optimized for runtime and code size (via algorithms such as determinization and minimization of transducers).
    This programming paradigm supports efficient nondeterminism, including parallel processing over infinite sets of input strings, and even allows &#8220;reverse&#8221; computation from output to input.
    Its unusual flexibility for the practiced programmer stems from the many operations under which rational
