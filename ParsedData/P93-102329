ect associations retrieved by the system&amp;quot; by using summation of those values instead of counting.
    Then the contingency table model (Swets, 1969), widely used in Information Retrieval and Psychology, is applicable.
    Referring to the classification of the yes-no answers in Table 2, the following measures are defined: a 7&#8212; i.d In other words, recall is the percentage of correct &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; answers that the system found among the model &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; answers, precision is the percentage of correct &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; answers among the total of &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; answers that the system reported, and fallout is the percentage of incorrect &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; answers relative to the total number of &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; answers6.
    Note that in our generalized contingency table model, the symbols a, b, c, and d do not represent numbers of observed associations but rather sums of correctness or incorrectness values.
    These sums use correctness values for
