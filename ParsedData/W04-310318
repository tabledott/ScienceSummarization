    Alternative representations were tried involving stemming and term weighting (no weights versus TF*IDF weights).
    Since results obtained were similar we present only results using stemming and no weights.
    The classifier experiments followed a 10-fold cross-validation design.
    We used SV Mlight packages with all settings at default values.
    We ran experiments in two modes.
    First, we considered only the last 2 sentences.
    For this we pooled all hand tagged sentences from the three topic areas (sets a-f).
    Second, we explored classification on all sentences in the document (sets a,b,e).
    If we assume a default strategy as a simple baseline, where the majority decision is always made, then we get an accuracy of 82% for the classification problem on the last two sentences data set and 89% for the all sentences data set.
    Another baseline option is to use a set of strings and look for them as substrings in the sentences.
    The following 14 strings were identified by Light while an
