ative (i.e., critical); apart from scientific reasons, there is also a host of social reasons for citing (&#8220;politeness, tradition, piety&#8221; [Ziman 1969]).
    We concentrate on two citation contexts that are particularly important for the information needs of researchers: A distinction among these contexts would enable us to build more informative citation indexes.
    We suggest that such a rhetorical distinction can be made manually and automatically for each citation; we use a large corpus of scientific papers along with humans&#8217; judgments of this distinction to train a system to make such distinctions.
    Our rhetorical annotation scheme (cf.
    Table 1) encodes the aspects of scientific argumentation, metadiscourse, and relatedness to other work described before.
    The categories are assigned to full sentences, but a similar scheme could be developed for clauses or phrases.
    The annotation scheme is nonoverlapping and nonhierarchical, and each sentence must be assigned to exactly one
