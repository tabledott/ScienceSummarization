t estimates of the language models to reveal connections to entropy and prior work on segmentation.
    However, point estimates are theoretically unsatisfying from a Bayesian perspective, and better performance may be obtained by marginalizing over all possible laneach segment, so the overall likelihood for the pointestimate version also decomposes across segments.
    Any objective function that can be decomposed into a product across segments can be maximized using dynamic programming.
    We define B(t) as the value of the objective function for the optimal segmentation up to sentence t. The contribution to the objective function from a single segment between sentences t' and t is written, b(t', t) = p({xt, ... xt}|zt-...t = j) where pdcm refers to the Dirichlet compound multinomial distribution (DCM), also known as the multivariate Polya distribution (Johnson et al., 1997).
    The DCM distribution expresses the expectation over all multinomial language models, when conditioning on the Dirichlet prior &#
