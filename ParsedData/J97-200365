ing-toweight transducer, each path of which corresponds to a sentence.
    The weight of the path can be interpreted as a negative log of the probability of that sentence given the sequence of acoustic observations (utterance).
    Such acyclic string-to-weight transducers are called word lattices.
    For a given utterance, the word lattice obtained in such a way contains many paths labeled with the possible sentences and their associated weights.
    A word lattice often contains a lot of redundancy: many paths correspond to the same sentence but with different weights.
    Word lattices can be directly searched to find the most probable sentences, those which correspond to the best paths, the paths with the smallest weights.
    Figure 18 shows a word lattice obtained in speech recognition for the 2,000-word ARPA ATIS Task.
    It corresponds to the following utterance: Which flights leave Detroit and arrive at Saint Petersburg around nine am?
    Clearly the lattice is complex; it contains about 83 millio
