d like to retain the option of not specifying that extra argument when it is not needed and would only get in our way.
    Hence, I propose a logical notation that provides two sets of predicates that are systematically related, by introducing what might be called a -nominalization* operator '.
    Corresponding io every n-ary predicate p there will he an n + L-ary predicate p' whose first. argument can be thought of as the condition that holds when p is true of the subsequent arguments.
    Thus, if run(J) means that John runs, run' ( E J) means that E is a running event by John. or John's running.
    If slippery(F) means that floor F is slippery, then AipperylE, F) means that E is the condition of F's being slippery, or F's slipperiness.
    The effect of this notational maneuver is to provide handles by which various predications can be grasped by higher predications.
    A similar approach has been used in many Al systems.
    In discourse one not only makes predications about such ephemera as events, st
