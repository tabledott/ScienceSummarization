    However, relatively few documents have keywords assigned, and therefore finding methods to automate the assignment is desirable.
    A related research area is that of terminology extraction (see e.g., Bourigault et al. (2001)), where all terms describing a domain are to be extracted.
    The aim of keyword assignment is to find a small set of terms that describes a specific document, independently of the domain it belongs to.
    However, the latter may very well benefit from the results of the former, as appropriate keywords often are of a terminological character.
    In this work, the automatic keyword extraction is treated as a supervised machine learning task, an approach first proposed by Turney (2000).
    Two important issues are how to define the potential terms, and what features of these terms are considered discriminative, i.e., how to represent the data, and consequently what is given as input to the learning algorithm.
    In this paper, experiments with three term selection approac
