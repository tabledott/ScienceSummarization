ly a single pronunciation for each word.
    B-u-t-t-e-r had to be pronounced butter and s-o-m-e-t-h-i-n-g had to be pronounced something, and that was that.
    Any change in these pronunciations was treated as a mislabeling from the front end.
    After training, this simplified system correctly decoded 75% of 100 test sentences, which was very encouraging.
    Finally, they removed the dictionary lookup HMM, taking for the pronunciation of each word its spelling.
    Thus, a word like t-h-r-o-u-g-h was assumed to have a pronunciation like tuh huh ruh oh uu guh huh.
    After training, the system learned that with words like 1-a-t-e the front end often missed the e. Similarly, it learned that g's and h's were often silent.
    This crippled system was still able to recognize 43% of 100 test sentences correctly as compared with 35% for the original Raleigh system.
    These results firmly established the importance of a coherent, probabilistic approach to speech recognition and the importance of data for est
