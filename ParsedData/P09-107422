    Our hypothesis is that the distribution of different types of anaphoric expressions in a corpus is a major factor for coreference resolution performance.
    Our experiments confirm this hypothesis and we use our empirical results to create a coreference performance prediction (CPP) measure that successfully estimates the expected level of performance on novel data sets.
    We study the resolution complexity of a text corpus by defining resolution classes.
    Resolution classes partition the set of anaphoric CEs according to properties of the anaphor and (in some cases) the antecedent.
    Previous work has studied performance differences between pronominal anaphora, proper names, and common nouns, but we aim to dig deeper into subclasses of each of these groups.
    In particular, we distinguish between proper and common nouns that can be resolved via string matching, versus those that have no antecedent with a matching string.
    Intuitively, we expect that it is easier to resolve the cases
