			An important type of knowledge needed for such inference is entailment rules.
			An entailmentrule specifies a directional inference relation be tween two templates, text patterns with variables, such as ?X win lawsuit against Y ? X sue Y ?.

			One reason for the limited performance of generic semantic inference systems is the lack of broad-scale knowledge-bases of entailment rul
