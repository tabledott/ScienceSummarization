sing event records.
    Formally, we have a Markov model over the fields:3 Each record type has a dedicated null field with its own multinomial distribution over words, intended to model words which refer to that record type in general (e.g., the word passes for passing records).
    We also model transitions into the first field and transitions out of the final field with special START and STOP fields.
    This Markov structure allows us to capture a few elements of rudimentary syntax.
    We arrive at the final component of our model, which governs how the information about a particular field of a record is rendered into words.
    For each field fij, we generate the number of words cij from a uniform distribution over 11, 2,... , Cmax}, where Cmax is set larger than the length of the longest text we expect to see.
    Conditioned on the fields f, the words w are generated independently:4 where r(k) and f(k) are the record and field responsible for generating word wk, as determined by the segmentation c. Th
