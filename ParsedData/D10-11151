hat codes the pattern of co-occurrence of that word with other expressions in a large corpus of language (Sahlgren, 2006; Turney and Pantel, 2010).
    This approach to semantics (sometimes called distributional semantics) naturally captures word clustering, scales well to large lexicons and doesn&#8217;t require words to be manually disambiguated (Sch&#168;utze, 1997).
    However, until recently it has been limited to the level of content words (nouns, adjectives, verbs), and it hasn&#8217;t tackled in a general way compositionality (Frege, 1892; Partee, 2004), that crucial property of natural language which allows speakers to derive the meaning of a complex linguistic constituent from the meaning of its immediate syntactic subconstituents.
    Formal semantics (FS), the research program stemming from Montague (1970b; 1973), has opposite strengths and weaknesses.
    Its core semantic notion is the sentence, not the word; at the lexical level, it focuses on the meaning of function words; one of its main goa
