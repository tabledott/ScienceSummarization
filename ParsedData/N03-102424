   For each sentence group, we hold out one sentence as test sentence, and try to evaluate how much of it can be predicted from the other 10 sentences.
    We compare two different ways of estimating the predictive power.
    (a) we compute the edit distance between the test sentence and the other 10 sentences in the set.
    The minimum of this distance is ed(input).
    (b) we use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the minimum distance (ed(FSA)) between the test sentence and all the paths in the FSA built from the other 10 sentences.
    The smaller the edit distance is, the better we are predicting a test sentence.
    Mathematically, the difference between these two measures ed(input) &#8722; ed(FSA) characterizes how much is gained in predictive power by building the FSA.
    We carry out the experiment described above in a &#8220;leave-one-out&#8221; fashion (i.e. each sentence serves as a test sentence once).
    Now let edgain be the average of ed(input) &#8722; ed(FSA) over the 11 runs for a
