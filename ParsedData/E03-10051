re trees.
    To appreciate these innovations, it should be noted that the model was radically different from all other statistical parsing models at the time.
    Other models started off with a predefined grammar and used a corpus only for estimating the rule probabilities (as e.g.
    in Fujisaki et al. 1989; Black et al.
    1992, 1993; Briscoe and I Thanks to Ivan Sag for this pun.
    Waegner 1992; Pereira and Schabes 1992).
    The DOP model, on the other hand, was the first model (to the best of our knowledge) that proposed not to train a predefined grammar on a corpus, but to directly use corpus fragments as a grammar.
    This approach has now gained wide usage, as exemplified by the work of Collins (1996, 1999), Charniak (1996, 1997), Johnson (1998), Chiang (2000), and many others.
    The other innovation of DOP was to take (in principle) all corpus fragments, of any size, rather than a small subset.
    This innovation has not become generally adopted yet: many approaches still work either with l
