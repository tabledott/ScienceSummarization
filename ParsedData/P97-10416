akly statistical, but not probabilistic; transformation-based approaches conseo,--iitly require far less training data than most ..stical approaches.
    It is rule-based, but relies on 'See, for example, Sproat et al. (1996). machine learning to acquire the rules, rather than expensive manual knowledge engineering.
    The rules produced can be inspected, which is useful for gaining insight into the nature of the rule sequence and for manual improvement and debugging of the sequence.
    The learning algorithm also considers the entire training set at all learning steps, rather than decreasing the size of the training data as learning progresses, such as is the case in decision-tree induction (Quinlan, 1986).
    For a thorough discussion of transformation-based learning, see Ramshaw and Marcus (1996).
    Brill's work provides a proof of viability of transformation-based techniques in the form of a number of processors, including a (widelydistributed) part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1994), a procedure for pre
