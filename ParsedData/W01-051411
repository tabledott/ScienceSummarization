erences in the feature space are significant.
    Thus, they should be taken into account in the formulation of Ak.
    This is appropriate when the vocabulary is small and there is sufficient training data.
    A small k is used when A is sparse and the values in A are inaccurate.
    Once the similarity matrix M is calculated for the input text S, the image ranking procedure in C99 is then applied to obtain a rank matrix R (see eq.
    2).
    Rzi is the proportion of neighbours of Mzi with a lower value than Mzi.
    The motivation for applying image ranking in the new algorithm is to test whether a quantitative or qualitative interpretation of the similarity values has any impact on segmentation accuracy.
    The hypothesis is that LSA similarity values are more accurate than cosine similarity values.
    Thus, image ranking should have a smaller impact on LSA than the cosine metric.
    The input matrix X can either be the similarity matrix M or the rank matrix R, depending on whether ranking is applied
