exact inference with dynamic programming, provided that the range of features allows efficient processing.
    The baseline feature templates for Chinese segmentation and POS tagging, when added together, makes exact inference for the proposed joint model very hard.
    However, the accuracy loss from the beam decoder, as well as alternative decoding algorithms, are worth further exploration.
    The joint system takes features only from the baseline segmentor and the baseline POS tagger to allow a fair comparison.
    There may be additional features that are particularly useful to the joint system.
    Open features, such as knowledge of numbers and European letters, and relationships from semantic networks (Shi and Wang, 2007), have been reported to improve the accuracy of segmentation and POS tagging.
    Therefore, given the flexibility of the feature-based linear model, an obvious next step is the study of open features in the joint segmentor and POS tagger.
