ptation problem in this section is a simple proof of concept of the QG approach; however, more complex and realistic adaptation problems exist.
    Monolingual adaptation is perhaps most obviously useful when the source parser is a blackbox or rule-based system or is trained on unavailable data.
    One might still want to use such a parser in some new context, which might require new data or a new annotation standard.
    We are also interested in scenarios where we want to avoid expensive retraining on large reannotated treebanks.
    We would like a linguist to be able to annotate a few trees according to a hypothesized theory and then quickly use QG adaptation to get a parser for that theory.
    One example would be adapting a constituency parser to produce dependency parses.
    We have concentrated here on adapting between two dependency parse styles, in order to line up with the cross-lingual tasks to which we now turn.
  
  
    As in the adaptation scenario above, many syntactic structures can be tr
