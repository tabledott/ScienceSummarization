  Of course model A also ends up selecting a par- ent tbr each word, but its calculation plays careful politics with the set of other words that happen to appear: in the senterl(;C: word j considers both the benefit of selecting i as a parent, and the costs of spurning all the other possible parents/  .Model B takes an appro;~ch at the opposite extreme, and simply has each word blindly describe its ideal parent.
  For example, price in Figure 3 might in- sist (with some probability) that it "depend on a verb to my right."
  To capture arity, words proba- bilistically specify their ideal children as well: fell is highly likely to want only one noun to its left.
  The form and coarseness of such specifications i a parameter of the model.
  When a word stochastically chooses one set of requirements on its parents and children, it is choosing what a link grammarian would call a dis- juuct (set of selectional preferences) for
