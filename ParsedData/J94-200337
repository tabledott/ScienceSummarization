the rules and constraints given in Section 2.1.
  Attentional state in turn constrains the discourse participants interpretation process; one aspect of attentional state is the notion of discourse salience.
  In the centering model, the ordering of the forward centers is an approximation f discourse salience.
  This in turn is the main determinant of discourse interpretation processes such as the resolution of zeros in Japanese.
  A crucial question then is what discourse factors must be considered to determine the ordering of the forward centers, Cf, in Japanese discourse.
  Being a subject has been shown to be an important factor for English; this is re- flected in a Cf ordering by grammatical function (Prince 1981b; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Hudson-DZmura 1988; Brennan submitted).
  Aspects of surface or- der may also affect the interpretation (Di Eugenio 1990; Hajicova and Vrbova 1982).
  An interpretation algorithm can also use pronominalization as an indicator of what the speaker believes is
