re set.
    For this reason, we built our classifier by combining probabilities from distributions conditioned on a variety of subsets of the features.
    Table 3 shows the probability distributions used in the final version of the system.
    Coverage indicates the percentage of the test data for which the conditioning event had been seen in training data.
    Accuracy is the proportion of covered test data for which the correct role is given the highest probability, and Performance, which is the product of coverage and accuracy, is the overall percentage of test data for which the correct role is predicted.3 Accuracy is somewhat similar to the familiar metric of precision in that it is calculated over cases for which a decision is made, and performance is similar to recall in that it is calculated over all true frame elements.
    Unlike in a traditional precision/recall trade-off, however, these results have no threshold to adjust, and the task is a multiway classification rather than a binary decision.
