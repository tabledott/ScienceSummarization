q,r,Y) E Tc.
    A particular triple (q,r,Y) rules out (s, t, X) if there is no way that (s, t, X) and (q,r,Y) could both be in the same parse tree.
    In particular, if the interval (s, t) crosses the interval (q, r), then (s, t, X) is ruled out and counted as an error.
    Formally, we say that (s, t) crosses (q, r) if and only ifs&lt;q&lt;t&lt;rorq&lt;s&lt;r&lt;t.
    If Tc is binary branching, then Consistent Brackets and Bracketed Match are identical.
    The following symbols denote the number of constituents that match according to each of these criteria. crossing (s, t)} : the number of constituents in TG correct according to Consistent Brackets.
    Following are the definitions of the six metrics used in this paper for evaluating binary branching trees: ( 5 ) Consistent Brackets Recall Rate = CING.
    It is often called the Crossing Brackets Rate.
    In the case where the parses are binary branching, this criterion is the same as the Bracketed Recall Rate.
    (6) Consistent Brackets Tree Rate =
