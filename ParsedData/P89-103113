tities realized in subject position are more salient, since even if an adjunct clause linearly precedes the main subject, any noun phrases within it will be deeper in the parse tree.
    This also means that objects and indirect objects will be among the first possible antecedents found, and in general that the depth of syntactic embedding is an important determiner of discourse prominence.
    Miming to the assumptions about syntax, we note that Hobbs assumes that one can produce the correct syntactic structure for an utterance, with all adjunct phrases attached at the proper point of the parse tree.
    In addition, in order to obey linguistic constraints on coreference, the algorithm depends on the existence of a N parse tree node, which denotes a noun phrase without its determiner (See the example in the Appendix).
    Hobbs algorithm procedurally encodes contra-indexing constraints by skipping over NP nodes whose N node dominates the part of the parse tree in which the pronoun is found, which means that
