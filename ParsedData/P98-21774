problem.
    While we will be given the candidate attachment sites during testing, the training procedure assumes no a priori information about potential attachment sites.
    We generate training data from raw text by using a part-of-speech tagger, a simple chunker, an extraction heuristic, and a morphology database.
    The order in which these tools are applied to raw text is shown in Table 1.
    The tagger from (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) first annotates sentences of raw text with a sequence of partof-speech tags.
    The chunker, implemented with two small regular expressions, then replaces simple noun phrases and quantifier phrases with their head words.
    The extraction heuristic then finds head word tuples and their likely attachments from the tagged and chunked text.
    The heuristic relies on the observed fact that in English and in languages with similar word order, the attachment site of a preposition is usually located only a few words to the left of the preposition.
    Finally, numbers are replaced
