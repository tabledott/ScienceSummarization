ill more than one candidate left, picks up as the antecedent the most recent noun phrase that agrees with the anaphor.
    Our preference-based approach showed clear superiority over both baseline models.
    The first Baseline Model (Baseline Subject) was successful in only 23.7% of the cases, whereas the second (Baseline Most Recent) had a success rate of 68.4%.
    Therefore, the 93.3% success rate (see above) demonstrates a dramatic increase in precision, which is due to the use of antecedent tracking preferences.
    We have recently adapted the approach for Arabic as well (Mitkov &amp; Belguith 1998).
    Our evaluation, based on 63 examples (anaphors) from a technical manual (Sony 1992), indicates a success rate of 95.2% (and critical success rate 89.3 %).
  
  
    We have described a robust, knowledge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger.
    Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for the genre of technical manuals and at least in this
