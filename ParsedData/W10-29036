    Our experimental results show that our model with response driven learning can outperform existing models trained with annotated logical forms.
    The key contributions of this paper are: Response driven learning for semantic parsing We propose a new learning paradigm for learning semantic parsers without any annotated meaning representations.
    The supervision for learning comes from a binary feedback signal based a response generated by executing a meaning representation.
    This type of supervision signal is natural to produce and can be acquired from nonexpert users.
    Novel training algorithms Two novel training algorithms are developed within the response driven learning paradigm.
    The training algorithms are applicable beyond semantic parsing and can be used in situations where it is possible to obtain binary feedback for a structured learning problem.
    Flexible semantic interpretation process We propose a novel flexible semantic parsing model that can handle previously unseen synt
