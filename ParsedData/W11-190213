    We begin by identifying speakers within text.
    In non-conversational text, we use a simple heuristic that searches for the subjects of reporting verbs (e.g., say) in the same sentence or neighboring sentences to a quotation.
    In conversational text, speaker information is provided in the dataset.
    The extracted speakers then allow us to implement the following sieve heuristics: For example, I, my, and she in the following sentence are coreferent: &#8220;[I] voted for [Nader] because [he] was most aligned with [my] values,&#8221; [she] said.
    In addition to the above sieve, we impose speaker constraints on decisions made by subsequent sieves: For example, [my] and [he] are not coreferent in the above example (third constraint).
    To guarantee that the output of our system matches the shared task requirements and the OntoNotes annotation specification, we implement two postprocessing steps:
