 an unspecified symbol over which the corresponding tape does not advance.
    A symbol can also be written in braces, in which case the corresponding tape will move if the symbol under the read-write head is the last one on the tape.
    This is intended to capture the of autosegmental morphology, that is, the principal according to which the last item in a string may be reused when required to fill several positions. particular set of quadruples, or made up of symbols, with or without brackets or will constitute the the automata, and the &amp;quot;useful&amp;quot; alphabet must be the same for all the automata because none of them can move from one state to another unless the make an exactly parallel Not surprisingly, a considerable amount of information about the language is contained just in the constitution of the alphabet.
    Indeed, a single machine with one state which all transitions both leave and enter will generate a nontrivial subset of the material in Table I.
