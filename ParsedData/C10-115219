cess continues until the terminal nodesare reached or is stopped by a sub node.
			The function of mp operation is similar to the word mapping operation in the string-based machine trans lation.
			It maps substrings in the complex sentence which are dominated by the children of the current node to proper substrings in the simple sentences.
			Speeding Up The example above is only oneof the possible paths.
			We try all of the promis ing paths in training.
			Promising paths are thepaths which are likely to succeed in transform ing the parse tree of c into s1 and s2.
			We select the promising candidates using monolingual word mapping as shown in Fig.
			7.
			In this example,only the word ?which?
			can be a promising can didate for splitting.
			We can select the promisingcandidates for the dropping, reordering and map ping operations similarly.
			With this improvement, we can train on the PWKP dataset within 1 hour excluding the parsing time taken by the Stanford Parser.
			We initialize the probabilities
