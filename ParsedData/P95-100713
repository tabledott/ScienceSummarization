d Hearst (1993) coined the term CONCEPTUAL ASSOCIATION to refer to association values computed between groups of words.
    By assuming that all words within a group behave similarly, the parameter space can be built in terms of the groups rather than in terms of the words.
    In this study, conceptual association is used with groups consisting of all categories from the 1911 version of Roget's thesaurus.4 Given two thesaurus categories t1 and t2, there is a parameter which represents the degree of acceptability of the structure [n1n2j where ni is a noun appearing in t1 and n2 appears in t2.
    By the assumption that words within a group behave similarly, this is constant given the two categories.
    Following Lauer and Dras (1994) we can formally write this parameter as Pr(ti &#8212;.12) where the event ti t2 denotes the modification of a noun in t2 by a noun in t1.
    To ensure that the test set is disjoint from the training data, all occurrences of the test noun compounds have been removed from the tra
