    In the second subsection below, we show how the analysis of thematic distinctions enables us to determine lexical properties that we hypothesize will exhibit useful, detectable frequency differences in our corpora, and thus serve as the machine learning features for our classification experiments.
    The verb classes are exemplified below, in sentences repeated from Table 1 for ease of exposition.
    Unergative: (1a) The horse raced past the barn.
    (lb) The jockey raced the horse past the barn.
    Unaccusative: (2a) The butter melted in the pan.
    (2b) The cook melted the butter in the pan.
    Object-Drop: (3a) The boy played.
    (3b) The boy played soccer.
    The example sentences illustrate that all three classes participate in a diathesis alternation that relates a transitive and intransitive form of the verb.
    However, according to Levin (1993), each class exhibits a different type of diathesis alternation, which is determined by the particular semantic relations of the arguments to
