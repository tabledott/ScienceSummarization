			In addition to the Senseval shared tasks, which have provided standard sense inventories and data sets, WSD research has also turned increasinglyto designing specific models for a particular applica tion.
			For instance, Vickrey et al (2005) and Specia (2006) proposed WSD systems designed for Frenchto English, and Portuguese to English translation re spectively, and present a more optimistic outlook forthe use of WSD in MT, although these WSD sys tems have not yet been integrated nor evaluated in full-scale machine translation systems.Taken together, these seemingly contradictory results suggest that improving SMT lexical choice ac curacy remains a key
