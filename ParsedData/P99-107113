    We found the following most frequent paraphrasing categories: The patterns presented above cover 82% of the syntactic and lexical paraphrases (which is, in turn, 70% of all variants).
    These categories form the basis for paraphrasing rules used by our intersection algorithm.
    The majority of these categories can be identified in an automatic way.
    However, some of the rules can only be approximated to a certain degree.
    For example, identification of similarity based on semantic relations between words depends on the coverage of the thesaurus.
    We identify word similarity using synonym rel
