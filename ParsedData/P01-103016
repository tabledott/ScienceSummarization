ecoder output is similar to choosing a good TSP tour.
    Because any TSP problem instance can be transformed into a decoding problem instance, Model 4 decoding is provably NP-complete in the length of f. It is interesting to consider the reverse direction&#8212;is it possible to transform a decoding problem instance into a TSP instance?
    If so, we may take great advantage of previous research into efficient TSP algorithms.
    We may also take advantage of existing software packages, obtaining a sophisticated decoder with little programming effort.
    It is difficult to convert decoding into straight TSP, but a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems (including TSP) can be expressed in the more general framework of linear integer programming.
    A sample integer program (IP) looks like this: A solution to an IP is an assignment of integer values to variables.
    Solutions are constrained by inequalities involving linear combinations of variables.
    An optimal solution is one that respects t
