 we included the text of all documents above, though of course not looking at either their mention boundaries or reference annotations in any way.
    We also trained on the following much larger unlabeled datasets utilized in Haghighi and Klein (2009): Mention boundaries were automatically detected as follows: For each noun or pronoun (determined by parser POS tag), we associated a mention with the maximal NP projection of that head or that word itself if no NP can be found.
    This procedure recovers over 90% of annotated mentions on the A05CU dev set, but also extracts many unannotated &#8220;spurious&#8221; mentions (for instance events, times, dates, or abstract nouns) which are not deemed to be of interest by the ACE annotation conventions.
    Mention properties were obtained from parse trees using the the Stanford typed dependency extractor (de Marneffe et al., 2006).
    The mention properties we considered are the mention head (annotated with mention type), the typed modifiers of the head, and the
