or which we shall describe remedies.
    Point 2 will have some importance for us because it will turn out that the indexing scheme we propose will require the use of distinct active and inactive edges, even when the rules are all binary.
    We take up the complexity issue first, and then turn to how the efficiency of the generation chart might be enhanced through indexing.
  
  
    The exponential factor in the computational complexity of our generation algorithm is apparent in an example like (8).
    (8) Newspaper reports said the tall young Polish athlete ran fast The same set of predicates that generate this sentence clearly also generate the same sentence with deletion of all subsets of the words tall, young. and Polish for a total of 8 strings.
    Each is generated in its entirety, though finally rejected because it fails to account for all of the semantic material.
    The words newspaper and fast can also be deleted independently giving a grand total of 32 strings.
    We concentrate on the phrase
