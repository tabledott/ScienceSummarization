hat indicates whether or not it occurs in the window of context surrounding the ambiguous word.
    We use the Weka (Witten and Frank, 2000) implementations of the C4.5 decision tree learner (known as J48), the decision stump, and the Naive Bayesian classifier.
    Weka is written in Java and is freely available from www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml.
  
  
    Our empirical study utilizes the training and test data from the 1998 SENSEVAL evaluation of word sense disambiguation systems.
    Ten teams participated in the supervised learning portion of this event.
    Additional details about the exercise, including the data and results referred to in this paper, can be found at the SENSEVAL web site (www.itri.bton.ac.uk/events/senseval/) and in (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000).
    We included all 36 tasks from SENSEVAL for which training and test data were provided.
    Each task requires that the occurrences of a particular word in the test data be disambiguated based on a model learned from the sense&#8212;tagged insta
