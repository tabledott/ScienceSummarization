ifferent interactions between pairs of proteins, for a total of seven occurrences of interactions.
    For example, there are three occurrences of the interaction between IGF-IR and p52Shc (i.e. number 1, 3 and 7).
    If we adopt the OAOD methodology, all the seven occurrences have to be extracted to achieve the maximum score.
    On the other hand, if we use the OARD methodology, only one occurrence for each interaction has to be extracted to maximize the score.
    On the AImed data set both evaluations were performed, while on the LLL challenge only the OAOD evaluation methodology was performed because this is the only one provided by the evaluation server of the challenge.

    The protein names have been highlighted in bold face and their same subscript numbers indicate interaction between the proteins.
    All the experiments were performed using the SVM package LIBSVM6 customized to embed our own kernel.
