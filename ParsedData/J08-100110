    Computational Modeling.
    An important practical question is how to translate principles of these linguistic theories into a robust coherence metric.
    A great deal of research has been devoted to this issue, primarily in Centering Theory (Miltsakaki and Kukich 2000; Hasler 2004; Karamanis et al. 2004).
    Such translation is challenging in several respects: one has to determine ways of combining the effects of various constraints and to instantiate parameters of the theory that are often left underspecified.
    Poesio et al. (2004) note that even for fundamental concepts of Centering Theory such as &#8220;utterance,&#8221; &#8220;realization,&#8221; and &#8220;ranking,&#8221; multiple&#8212;and often contradictory&#8212;interpretations have been developed over the years, because in the original theory these concepts are not explicitly fleshed out.
    For instance, in some Centering papers, entiti
