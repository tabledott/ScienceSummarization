rmed by a second series of experiments, where we reverted individual categories back to head-head dependencies, which triggered a decrease in performance for all categories, with the exception of NP, AP, and AVP (see Table 6).
    On the whole, the results of Experiment 2 are at odds with what is known about parsing for English.
    The progression in the probabilistic parsing literature has been to start with lexical head-head dependencies (Collins, 1997) and then add non-lexical sisOur results show, however, that for parsing German, lexical sister-head information is more important than lexical head-head information.
    Only a model that replaced lexical head-head with lexical sister-head dependencies was able to outperform a baseline model that uses no lexicalization.3 Based on the error analysis for Experiment 1, we claim that the reason for the success of the sister-head model is the fact that the rules in Negra are so flat; using a sister-head model is a way of binarizing the rules.
