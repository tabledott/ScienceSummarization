ve logarithm of its probability.
    The probability of an alignment is inversely related to the sum of the distances associated with its component sentence beads.
    Given the size of existing bilingual corpora and the computation necessary to evaluate the probability of a sentence bead, a quadratic algorithm is still too profligate.
    However, most alignments are one-to-one, so we can reap great benefits through intelligent thresholding.
    By considering only a subset of all possible alignments, we reduce the computation to a linear one.
    Dynamic programming consists of incrementally finding the best alignment of longer and longer prefixes of the bilingual corpus.
    We prune all alignment prefixes that have a substantially lower probability than the most probable alignment prefix of the same length.
    Deletions are automatically handled within the standard dynamic programming framework.
    However, because of thresholding, we must handle large deletions using a separate mechanism.
    Because l
