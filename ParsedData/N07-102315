f model selection on the development set (e.g., by evaluating different Markov structures), and we want these findings to be as significant as possible.
    Finally, we used the same test data as K&amp;M for human evaluation purposes (32 sentence pairs).
  
  
    We now describe methods to train SCFG models from sentence pairs.
    Given a tree pair (f, c), whose respective parses (7rf, 7rc) were generated by the parser described in (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), the goal is to transform the tree pair into SCFG derivations, in order to build relative frequency estimates for our Markovized models from observed SCFG productions.
    Clearly, the two trees may sometimes be structurally quite different (e.g., a given PP may attach to an NP in 7rf, while attaching to VP in 7rc), and it is not always possible to build an SCFG derivation given the constraints in (7rf, 7rc).
    The approach taken by K&amp;M is to analyze both trees and count an SCFG rule whenever two nodes are &#8220;deemed to correspond&#8221;, i.e
