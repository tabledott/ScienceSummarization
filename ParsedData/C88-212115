  If one defines principles for building such sets of trees, these principles will correspond to syntactic rules in a derivation-based theory of grammar.
  Category and argument structures thus instantiated as the parser scans the input string are combined together in a sentence t~tructure by adjoining or substituting.
  As Gross (1984), we consider verbs, nouns, and adjec- tives as predicates yielding sentences.
  They can take nomi- nal or sentential arguments.
  If the predicate takes nominal arguments it produces an initial tree.
  If it takes a senten- tial argument then it produces an auxiliary tree.
  Putting arguments into predicates i done by substituting nomi- nal arguments or by adjoining a predicate structure to its sentential argument.
  Adjuncts are represented as auxiliary trees rooted by the category of the node they are adjoined to.
  They are also produced by a head.
  They can be reduced to a basic category or take nominal or sentential arguments intro- duced by substitution.
