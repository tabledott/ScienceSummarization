er the events occur in the same or different sentences.
    We use the entire Timebank Corpus as supervised training data, condensing the before and immediately-before relations into one before relation.
    The remaining relations are merged into other.
    The vast majority of potential event pairs in Timebank are unlabeled.
    These are often none relations (events that have no explicit relation) or as is often the case, overlap relations where the two events have no Timebank-defined ordering but overlap in time.
    Even worse, many events do have an ordering, but they were not tagged by the human annotators.
    This could be due to the overwhelming task of temporal annotation, or simply because some event orderings are deemed more important than others in understanding the document.
    We consider all untagged relations as other, and experiment with including none, half, and all of them in training.
    Taking a cue from Mani et al. (2006), we also increased Timebank&#8217;s size by applying transitiv
