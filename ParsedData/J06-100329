properties thought desirable, such as whether it is a metric (or the inverse of a metric), whether it has singularities, whether its parameter-projections are smooth functions, and so on.
  In our opinion, such analyses act at best as a coarse filter in the comparison of a set of measures and an even coarser one in the assessment of a single measure.
  The second kind of evaluation is comparison with human judgments.
  Insofar as human judgments of similarity and relatedness are deemed to be correct by definition, this clearly gives the best assessment of the ?goodness?
  Its main drawback lies in the difficulty of obtaining a large set of reliable, subject-independent judgments for comparison ?
  designing a psycholinguistic experiment, validating its results, and so on.
  (In Section 4.1 below, we will employ the rather limited data that such experiments have obtained to date.)
  The third approach is to evaluate the measures with respect to their performance in the framework of a particular application.
