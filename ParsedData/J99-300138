    Any hearer-new expression is ranked below hearer-old expressions.
    Ordering constraint (2) captures the ordering for the sets OLD or NEW when they contain elements of the same type.
    In this case, the elements of each set are ranked according to their text position.
    4.3.2 Extended Cf Ranking.
    While the basic Cf ranking criteria are sufficient for texts with a high proportion of pronouns and nominal anaphora (e.g., literary texts, newspaper articles about persons), it is necessary to refine the ranking criteria in order to deal with expository texts, e.g., test reports, discharge summaries.
    These texts usually contain few pronouns and are characterized by a large number of inferrables, which are often the major glue in achieving local coherenc
