sted levels must be obeyed in the bracketings of both languages.
    The result of the parse yields labeled bracketings for both sentences, as well as a bracket alignment indicating the parallel constituents between the sentences.
    The constituent alignment includes a word alignment as a by-product.
    The nonterminals may not always look like those of an ordinary CFG.
    Clearly, the nonterminals of an ITG must be chosen in a somewhat different manner than for a monolingual grammar, since they must simultaneously account for syntactic patterns of both languages.
    One might even decide to choose nonterminals for an ITG that do not match linguistic categories, sacrificing this to the goal of ensuring that all corresponding substrings can be aligned.
    An ITG can accommodate a wider range of ordering variation between the IanAn extremely distorted alignment that can be accommodated by an ITG. guages than might appear at first blush, through appropriate decomposition of productions (and thus constituen
