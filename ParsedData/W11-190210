    Since the input to a sieve is a collection of mention clusters built by the previous (more precise) sieves, we need to link mention clusters (rather than individual mentions) to records in these three knowledge bases.
    The following steps generate a query for these resources from a mention cluster.
    First, we select the most representative mention in a cluster by preferring mentions headed by proper nouns to mentions headed by common nouns, and nominal mentions to pronominal ones.
    In case of ties, we select the longer string.
    For example, the mention selected from the cluster {President George W. Bush, president, he} is President George W. Bush.
    Second, if this mention returns nothing from the knowledge bases, we implement the following query relaxation algorithm: (a) remove the text follo
