 variational parameters (??(`), ??(`)).A comparison between (4) and (2) reveals two dif ferences between the EM and VB updates.
			First, the Dirichlet prior parameters ? are added to the expected counts.
			Second, these posterior counts(which are in fact parameters of the Dirichlet pos terior Q2) are passed through the function f(v) = exp?(v), which is plotted in Figure 5.
			When v  0, f(v) ? v ? 0.5, so roughly speaking, VB for multinomials involves adding ??0.5 to the expected counts when they are much larger than zero, where ? is the Dirichlet prior parameter.
			Thus VB canbe viewed as a more principled version of the well known ad hoc technique for approximating Bayesian estimation with EM that involves adding ??1 to the expected counts.
			However, in the ad hoc approach the expected count plus ??1 may be less than zero,resulting in a value of zero for the corresponding parameter (Johnson et al, 2007; Goldwater and Grif fiths, 2007).
			VB avoids this problem because f(v) is always positive when v  0
