ly lower but the difference between the full parsing?
  and the shallow parsing?based systems is as observed previously.
  In terms of filtering efficiency, around 25% of the examples are predicted as positive.
  In other words, both argument identifiers filter out around 75% of the argument candidates after pruning.
  Because the recall in the argument identification stage sets the upper-bound the recall in argument classification, the threshold that determines when examples are predicted to be positive is usually lowered to allow more positive predictions.
  That is, a candidate is predicted as positive when its probability estimation is larger than the threshold.
  Table 5 shows the performance of the argument identifiers when the threshold is 0.1.2 Because argument identification is just an intermediate step in a complete system, a more realistic evaluation method is to see how each final system performs.
  Using an argument identifier with threshold = 0.1 (i.e., Table 5), Table 6 reports the final result
