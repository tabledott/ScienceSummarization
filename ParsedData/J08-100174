oposed discourse representation for coherence modeling.
    We have presented several classes of grid models Barzilay and Lapata Modeling Local Coherence achieving good performance in discerning coherent from incoherent texts.
    Our experiments also reveal a surprising property of grid models: Even though these models are not lexicalized, they are domain- and style-dependent.
    In this section, we investigate in detail this feature of grid models.
    Here, we move away from the coherence rating task and put the entity-grid representation further to the test by examining whether it can be usefully employed in style classification.
    Specifically, we embed our entity grids into a system that assesses document readability.
    The term describes the ease with which a document can be read and understood.
    The quantitative measurement of readability has attracted considerable interest and debate over the last 70 years (see Mitchell [1985] and Chall [1958] for detailed overviews) and has recently benefite
