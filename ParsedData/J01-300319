    The Prague school's notion of linguistic markedness (Jakobson 1971; Trubetzkoy 1939) enables us to establish a scale of markedness of these thematic assignments and make a principled prediction about their frequency of occurrence.
    Typical tests to determine the unmarked element of a pair or scale are simplicity&#8212;the unmarked element is simpler, distribution&#8212;the unmarked member is more widely attested across languages, and frequency&#8212;the unmarked member is more frequent (Greenberg 1966; Moravcsik and Wirth 1983).
    The claim of markedness theory is that, once an element has been identified by one test as the unmarked element of a scale, then all other tests will be correlated.
    The three thematic assignments appear to be ranked on a scale by the simplicity and distribution tests, as we describe below.
    From this, we can conclude that frequency, as a third correlated test, should also be ranked by the same scale, and we can therefore make predictions about the expected f
