s, H(DIS, B).
    (This considerably simplifies the parsing process): An estimate based on the identities of the two tokens alone is problematic.
    Additional context, in particular the relative order of the two words and the distance between them, will also strongly influence the likelihood of one word modifying the other.
    For example consider the relationship between 'sales' and the three tokens of 'of': Example 2 Shaw, based in Dalton, Ga., has annual sales of about $ 1.18 billion, and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are expected to boost the profitability of Armstrong 's brands, sold under the Armstrong and Evans-Black names.
    In this sentence 'sales' and 'of' co-occur three times.
    The parse tree in training data indicates a relationship in only one of these cases, so this sentence would contribute an estimate of that the two words are related.
    This seems unreasonably low given that 'sales of' is a strong collocation.
    The latter two instances of 'of' are so di
