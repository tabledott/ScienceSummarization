    We use the syntactic type s of e1 in a refined version of the paraphrase probability: where p(e2|e1, s(e1)) can be approximated as: We define a new phrase extraction algorithm that operates on an English parse tree P along with foreign sentence f1 , English sentence ei, and word alignment A.
    We dub this SBP for syntactic bilingual phrases: The SBP phrase extraction algorithm produces tuples containing a foreign phrase, an English phrase and a syntactic label (f, e, s).
    After enumerating these for all phrase pairs in a parallel corpus, we can calculate p(f|e1, s(e1)) and p(e2|f, s(e1)) as: By redefining the probabilities in this way we partition the space of possible paraphrases by their syntactic categories.
    In order to enumerate all phrase pairs with their syntactic labels we need to parse the English side of the parallel corpus (but not the foreign side).
    This limits the potential applicability of our refined paraphrasing method to languages which have parsers.
