 either the predicate or the argument.
    Srole.
    This is the surface-syntactic role of an argument.
    Example of values include 0 (subject) and 1 (direct object).
    Ssubcat.
    This is the surface-syntactic subcategorization frame.
    For example, the ssubcat corresponding to a transitive tree frame would be NP0 NP1.
    PPs as arguments are always annotated with the preposition.
    For example, the ssubcat for the passive version of hit would be NP1 NP2(by).
    Drole.
    This is the deep-syntactic role of an argument.
    Example of values include 0 (subject) and 1 (direct object).
    Dsubcat.
    This is the deep-syntactic subcategorization frame.
    For example, the dsubcat corresponding to a transitive tree frame would be NP0 NP1.
    Generally, PPs as arguments are annotated with the preposition.
    For example, the dsubcat for load is NP0 NP1 NP2(into).
    The exception is when the argument is not realized as a PP when the predicate is realized in a non-syntactically transformed way.
