hese features are then used to determine a new ranking for the -best list.
    The new top ranked candidate in this -best list is our new best candidate translation.
    Discriminative reranking allows us to use global features which are unavailable for the baseline system.
    Second, we can use features of various kinds and need not worry about fine-grained smoothing issues.
    Finally, the statistical machine learning approach has been shown to be effective in many NLP tasks.
    Reranking enables rapid experimentation with complex feature functions, because the complex decoding steps in SMT are done once to generate the N-best list of translations.
    First, we consider how to apply discriminative reranking to machine translation.
    We may directly use those algorithms that have been successfully used in parse reranking.
    However, we immediately find that those algorithms are not as appropriate for machine translation.
    Let be the candidate ranked at the th position for the source sentence, wher
