ever, we do not use the information contained in the parse.
    In the treebank 159 different tags are used.
    These tags were projected on a smaller system of 76 tags designed by Evelyne Tzoukermann and Peter Brown (see Appendix).
    The results quoted in this paper all refer to this smaller system.
    We built a dictionary that indicates the list of possible tags for each word, by taking all the words that occur in this text and, for each word, all the tags that are assigned to it somewhere in the text.
    In some sense, this is an optimal dictionary for this data, since a word will not have all its possible tags (in the language), but only the tags that it actually had within the text.
    We separated this data into two parts: In this experiment, we extracted N tagged sentences from the training data.
    We then computed the relative frequencies on these sentences and built a &amp;quot;smoothed&amp;quot; model using the procedure previously described.
    This model was then used to tag the 2,000 te
