rage-industrial&amp;quot; produces the ngram &amp;quot;the Dow Jones industrial average,&amp;quot; since the words are always used within rigid noun phrases in the training corpus.
    In the third stage, described in Section 8, Xtract adds syntactic information to collocations retrieved at the first stage and filters out inappropriate ones.
    For example, if a bigram involves a noun and a verb, this stage identifies it either as a subject-verb or as a verb-object collocation.
    If no such consistent relation is observed, then the collocation is rejected.
  
  
    According to Cruse's definition (Cruse 1986), a syntagmatic lexical relation consists of a pair of words whose common appearances within a single phrase structure are correlated.
    In other words, those two words appear together within a single syntactic construct more often than expected by chance.
    The first stage of Xtract attempts to identify such pairwise lexical relations and produce statistical information on pairs of words involved
