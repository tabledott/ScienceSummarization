			CCGbank is a corpus of CCG normal-form derivations obtained by translating the Penn Tree bank trees using an algorithm described by Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002).
			Almost alltypes of construction?with the exception of gap ping and UCP (?Unlike Coordinate Phrases?)
			arecovered by the translation procedure, which pro cesses 98.3% of the sentences in the training corpus (WSJ sections 02-21) and 98.5% of the sentences in the test corpus (WSJ section 23).
			The grammar contains a set of type-changing rules similar to the lexical rules described in Carpenter (1992).
			Figure1 shows a derivation taken from CCGbank.
			Categories, such as ((S[b]nNP)=PP)=NP, encode unsaturated subcat frames.
			The complement-adjunct distinction is made explicit; for instance as a nonexecutive director is marked up as PP-CLR in the Tree bank, and hence treated as a PP-complement of join, whereas Nov. 29 is marked up as an
