lem: the label of the relative clause is changed to SBAR, and an additional VP level is added to the right of the relative pronoun.
    Similar transformations were applied for relative clauses involving Wh-PPs (e.g., &amp;quot;the man to whom I gave a book&amp;quot;), Wh-NPs (e.g., &amp;quot;the man whose book I read&amp;quot;) and Wh-Adverbials (e.g., &amp;quot;the place where I live&amp;quot;).
    The PDT takes the conjunct to be the head of coordination structures (for example, and would be the head of the NP dogs and cats).
    In these cases the baseline approach gives tree structures such as that in figure 5(a).
    The non-terminal label for the phrase is JP (because the head of the phrase, the conjunct and, is tagged as J).
    This choice of non-terminal is problematic for two reasons: (1) the JP label is assigned to all coordinated phrases, for example hiding the fact that the constituent in figure 5(a) is an NP; (2) the model assumes that left and right modifiers are generated independently of ea
