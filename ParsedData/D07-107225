			In practice, this optimization has very little ef fect on performance.
			We suspect that this is because the objective function is dominated by p(x | z) andp(z | ?), while the contribution of p(?

			We now present an empirical evaluation of the HDPPCFG(-GR) model and variational inference tech niques.
			We first give an illustrative example of theability of the HDP-PCFG to recover a known gram mar and then present the results of experiments on large-scale treebank parsing.

			In this section, we show that the HDP-PCFG-GR can recover a simple grammar while a standard 694 S ?
