n is of n and call an SCFG n-ary if its longest rule is n-ary.
    Our goal is to produce an equivalent binary SCFG for an input n-ary SCFG.
    2In making one nonterminal play dual roles, we follow the definitions in (Aho and Ullman, 1972; Chiang, 2005), originally known as Syntax Directed Translation Schema (SDTS).
    An alternative definition by Satta and Peserico (2005) allows co-indexed nonterminals taking different symbols in two dimensions.
    Formally speaking, we can construct an equivalent SDTS by creating a cross-product of nonterminals from two sides.
    See (Satta and Peserico, 2005, Sec.
    4) for other details.
    However, not every SCFG can be binarized.
    In fact, the binarizability of an n-ary rule is determined by the structure of its permutation, which can sometimes be resistant to factorization (Aho and Ullman, 1972).
    So we now start to rigorously define the binarizability of permutations.
    A permuted sequence is a permutation of consecutive integers.
    For example, (3, 5,
