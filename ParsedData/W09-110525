 to the predictions, in order to check if the three classifiers would perform better.
  
  
    In this paper we have presented a metalearning approach to processing the scope of negation signals.
    Its performance is evaluated in terms of percentage of correct scopes on three test sets.
    With 66.07 % PCS on the abstracts corpus the system achieves 32.07 % of error reduction over current state of the art results.
    The architecture of the system is new for this problem, with three classifiers and a metalearner that takes as input the output of the first classifiers.
    The classification task definition is also original.
    We have shown that the system is portable to different corpora, although performance fluctuates depending on the characteristics of the corpora.
    The results per corpus are determined to a certain extent by the scores of the negation signals no and not, that are very frequent and difficult to process in some text types.
    Shorter scopes are easier to learn as reflected in the
