ted tag doesn't match the majority lexical prior.2 Sorting and filtering/weighting by the cumulative normalized score yields a subset of training data where multiple sources essentially concur on the correct tag sequence.
    While the potential exists that this higher confidence data subset may be biased in the sequence phenomena it contains, the substantial noise reduction in preliminary investigations appears to be a worthwhile tradeoff.
    Future work will focus on differential confidence weighting of sentence fragments, and iterative (E-M) re-estimation.
    2The exception is for function words (i.e. the majority lexical prior is not a Noun, Verb, Adjective or Adverb) located in a 1-to-n alignment sequence.
    Given the very high probability of these raw projections being incorrect, and their prevalence, it is expedient to attempt to correct (rather than weight/filter) these tag instances prior to the first tagsequence-model training, by replacing their raw projection tag with the majority lexical prio
