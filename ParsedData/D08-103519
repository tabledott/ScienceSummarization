segment and for the segment boundaries.
    The counts for &#966; are summed across every segment in the entire dataset, so shifting a boundary will affect the probability of every segment, not only the adjacent segments as before.
    Thus, the factorization that enabled dynamic programming inference in Section 3.3 is no longer applicable.
    Instead, we must resort to approximate inference.
    Sampling-based inference is frequently used in related Bayesian models.
    Such approaches build a stationary Markov chain by repeatedly sampling among the hidden variables in the model.
    The most commonly-used sampling-based technique is Gibbs sampling, which iteratively samples from the conditional distribution of each hidden variable (Bishop, 2006).
    However, Gibbs sampling is slow to converge to a stationary distribution when the hidden variables are tightly coupled.
    This is the case in linear topic segmentation, due to the constraint that zt E {zt&#8722;1, zt&#8722;1 + 11 (see Section 3).
