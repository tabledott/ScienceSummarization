a specific type 100 times, computing the metric based on the comparison of the reference and experimental segmentations, and averaging the 100 results.
    For example, we might generate a reference segmentation R, then generate 100 experimental segmentations that have false negatives with probability 0.5, and then compute the average of their Pk penalties.
    We carried out 10 such trials for each experiment and averaged the average penalties over these trials.
    The first set of tests was designed to test the metric&#8217;s performance on texts with different segment size distributions (Problem 3).
    We generated four sets of reference segmentations with segment size uniformly distributed between two numbers.
    Note that the units of segmentation are deliberately left unspecified.
    So a segment of size 25 can refer to 25 words, clauses, or sentences&#8212;whichever is applicable to the task under consideration.
    Also note that the same tests were run using larger segment sizes than those report
