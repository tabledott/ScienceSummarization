ense discrimination.
    In the sections that follow, we highlight some of the differences between these approaches.
    Pedersen and Bruce represent the context of each test instance as a vector of features that directly occur near the target word in that instance.
    We refer to this representation as the first order context vector.
    Sch&#168;utze, by contrast, uses the second order context representation that averages the first order context vectors of individual features that occur near the target word in the instance.
    Thus, Sch&#168;utze represents each feature as a vector of words that occur in its context and then computes the context of the target word by adding the feature vectors of significant content words that occur near the target word in that context.
    Pedersen and Bruce use a small number of local features that include co&#8211;occurrence and part of speech information near the target word.
    They select features from the same test data that is being discriminated, which is a comm
