 forest represents a set of trees of features.
    Feature forests may be regarded as a packed chart in CFG parsing.
    Although feature forests have the same structure as PCFG parse forests, nodes in feature forests do not necessarily correspond to nodes in PCFG parse forests.
    In fact, in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, we will demonstrate that syntactic structures and predicate&#8211;argument structures in HPSG can be represented with tractable-size feature forests.
    The actual interpretation of a node in a feature forest may thus be ignored in the following discussion.
    Our algorithm is applicable whenever feature forests are of a tractable size.
    The descriptive power of feature forests will be discussed again in Section 6.
    As mentioned, a feature forest is a packed representation of trees of features.
    We first define model expectations, &#181;i, on a set of unpacked trees, and then show that they can be computed without unpacking feature forests.
    We denote an unpacked tree as a set, c &#8
