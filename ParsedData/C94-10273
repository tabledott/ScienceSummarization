ed predictor.
  Using tile predictor, Nakamura et al.
  were able to improve the recognition rate of their speech recognition system from 81.0 % to 86.9 %.
  Federici and Pirrelli (199a) developed a part-of- speech tagger which is based on a special type of neural network.
  It disambiguates between alternative morphosyntactic tags which are generated by a roof phological analyzer.
  The tagger is trained with an analogy-driven learning procedure.
  Only preliminary results are presented, so that a comparison with other methods is difficult.
  Ill this paper, a part-of-speech tagger based on a multilayer perceptrou network is presented.
  It is simi- lar to tile network of Nakamura et al.
  (1990) in so far as the same training procedure (Backpropagation) is used; but it differs in the structure of tile network and also in its purpose (disambignation vs. prediction).
  The performance of tl,e presented tagger is measured and compared to that of two other taggers (Cutting et al., 1992; Kempe, 1993).
