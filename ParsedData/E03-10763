ods to split up compounds for specific applications.
    Brown [2002] proposes a approach guided by a parallel corpus.
    It is limited to breaking compounds into cognates and words found in a translation lexicon.
    This lexicon may also be acquired by training a statistical machine translation system.
    The methods leads to improved text coverage of an example based machine translation system, but no results on translation performance are reported.
    Monz and de Rijke [2001] and Hedlund et al. [2001] successfully use lexicon based approaches to compound splitting for information retrieval.
    Compounds are broken into either the smallest or the biggest words that can be found in a given lexicon.
    Larson et al. [2000] propose a data-driven method that combines compound splitting and word recombination for speech recognition.
    While it reduces the number of out-of-vocabulary words, it does not improve speech recognition accuracy.
