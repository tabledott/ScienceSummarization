 uninflected form of a verb like &amp;quot;fall&amp;quot;), present-third-person-singular (as in &amp;quot;falls&amp;quot;), past (as in &amp;quot;fell&amp;quot;), present-participle (as in &amp;quot;falling&amp;quot;) or past-participle (as in &amp;quot;fallen&amp;quot;). keywords that frequently co-occur with word w in the same sentence.
    For a sentence s, the value of feature Ki is one if the keyword Ki appears somewhere in sentence s, else the value of K2 is zero.
    The set of keywords K1, , Km are determined based on conditional probability.
    All the word tokens other than the word occurrence w in a sentence s are candidates for consideration as keywords.
    These tokens are converted to lower case form before being considered as candidates for keywords.
    Let cp(ilk) denotes the conditional probability of sense i of w given keyword k, where ing the first two criteria for a given sense i exceeds M3.
    In this case, keywords that co-occur more frequently (in terms of absolute frequency) with
