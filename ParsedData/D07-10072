t doubt on the assumption that sophisticated dedicated WSD systems that were developed independently from any particular NLP application can easily beintegrated into a SMT system so as to improve trans lation quality through stronger models of context and rich linguistic information.
			Rather, it has beenargued, SMT systems have managed to achieve sig nificant improvements in translation quality without directly addressing translation disambiguation as aWSD task.
			Instead, translation disambiguation deci sions are made indirectly, typically using only word surface forms and very local contextual information, forgoing the much richer linguistic information that WSD systems typically take advantage of.
			On the other hand, error analysis reveals that theperformance of SMT systems still suffers from inaccurate lexical choice.
			In subsequent empirical stud ies, we have shown that SMT systems perform much worse than dedicated WSD models, both supervised RGC6083/99E, RGC6256/00E, and DAG03/04.EG09.
