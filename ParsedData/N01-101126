n tree learner are not always ranked highly in the filtering step.
    In particular, we will determine if the filtering process ever eliminates bigrams that could be significant sources of disambiguation information.
    In the longer term, we hope to adapt this approach to unsupervised learning, where disambiguation is performed without the benefit of sense tagged text.
    We are optimistic that this is viable, since bigram features are easy to identify in raw text.
  
  
    This paper shows that the combination of a simple feature set made up of bigrams and a standard decision tree learning algorithm results in accurate word sense disambiguation.
    The results of this approach are compared with those from the 1998 SENSEVAL word sense disambiguation exercise and show that the bigram based decision tree approach is more accurate than the best SENSEVAL results for 19 of 36 words.
