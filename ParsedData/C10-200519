 negative or positive in terms of polarity using the unigrams that 40compose the sentences.
			We used the imple mentation provided by LingPipe (LingPipe, 2008); ? Unigrams: Pang et al (Pang et al, 2002) showed unigrams are effective for sentiment detection in regular reviews.
			Based on that, we built unigram-based classifiers for the subjectivity and polarity detections over thetraining data.
			Another approach that uses un igrams is the one used by TwitterSentiment website.
			For polarity detection, they select the positive examples for the training data from the tweets containing good emoticonsand negative examples from tweets contain ing bad emoticons.
			(Go et al, 2009).
			We built a polarity classifier using this approach (Unigrams-TS).
			TwitterSA: TwitterSA exploits the features described in Section 3 in this paper.
			Forthe subjectivity detection, we trained a classifier from the two available sources, using the cleaning process described in Sec tion 3 to remove noise in the training data, Tw
