 of entities (ACE types), we did not consider it.
    In order to determine the best performing system in the shared task, we needed to associate a single number with each system.
    This could have been one of the metrics above, or some combination of more than one of them.
    The choice was not simple, and while we consulted various researchers in the field, hoping for a strong consensus, their conclusion seemed to be that each metric had its pros and cons.
    We settled on the MELA metric by Denis and Baldridge (2009), which takes a weighted average of three metrics: MUC, B-CUBED, and CEAF.
    The rationale for the combination is that each of the three metrics represents a different important dimension, the MUC measure being based on links, the B-CUBED based on mentions, and the CEAF based on entities.
    For a given task, a weighted average of the three might be optimal, but since we don&#8217;t have an end task in mind, we decided to use the unweighted mean of the three metrics as the score on which
