of parse candidates according to a preliminary probability distribution (Section 4).
    To our knowledge, this work provides the first results of extensive experiments of parsing Penn Treebank with a probabilistic HPSG.
    The results from the Wall Street Journal are significant because the complexity of the sentences is different from that of short sentences.
    Experiments of the parsing of realworld sentences can properly evaluate the effectiveness and possibility of parsing models for HPSG.
  
  
    Discriminative log-linear models are now becoming a de facto standard for probabilistic disambiguation models for deep parsing (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2002; Geman and Johnson, 2002; Miyao and Tsujii, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004b; Kaplan et al., 2004).
    Previous studies on probabilistic models for HPSG (Toutanova and Manning, 2002; Baldridge and Osborne, 2003; Malouf and van Noord, 2004) also adopted log-linear models.
    HPSG exploits feature structures to represent linguistic constrain
