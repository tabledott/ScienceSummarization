 get answer string varies depending on the type ofthe question.
			For example, answers to factoid ques tions (e.g., Who, When, Where) are usually single words or short phrases, while definitional questions and other more complex question types (e.g., How, Why) look for sentences or short passages.
			In this work, we fix the granularity of an answer to a single sentence.
			Earlier work on answer selection relies only on the surface-level text information.
			Two approaches are most common: surface pattern matching, andsimilarity measures on the question and answer, represented as bags of words.
			In the former, pat terns for a certain answer type are either craftedmanually (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2001) or acquired from training examples automatically (Itty cheriah et al, 2001; Ravichandran et al, 2003; Licuanan and Weischedel, 2003).
			In the latter,measures like cosine-similarity are applied to (usu ally) bag-of-words representations of the question and answer.
			Although many of these systems haveach
