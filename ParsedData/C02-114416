et, we first estimate the probability of a random word belonging to a subhierarchy (a synset and its hyponyms).
			We use the frequency counts of synsets in the SemCor corpus (Landes, Leacock, Tengi 1998) to estimate the probability of a subhierarchy.
			Since SemCor is a fairly small corpus, the frequency counts of the synsets in the lower part of the WordNet hierarchy are very sparse.
			We smooth the probabilities by assuming that all siblings are equally likely given the parent.
			A class is then defined as the maximal subhierarchy with probability less than a threshold (we used e-2).
			We used Minipar 1 (Lin 1994), a broad coverage English parser, to parse about 1GB (144M words) of newspaper text from the TREC collection (1988 AP Newswire, 1989-90 LA Times, and 1991 San Jose Mercury) at a speed of about 500 words/second on a PIII-750 with 512MB memory.
			We collected the frequency counts of the grammatical relationships (contexts) output by Minipar and used them to compute the pointwise mutual informa
