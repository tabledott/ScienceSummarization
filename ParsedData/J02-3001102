me and using all the others as training material.
    Results for the path and head word feature are shown in Table 21.
    The distributions P(r  |path), P(r  |h), and P(r) of Table 21 also appeared in Table 20; the difference between the experiments is only in the division of training and test sets.
    A linear interpolation, &#955;1P(r  |path) + &#955;2P(r  |h), classifies 39.8% of frame elements correctly.
    This is no better than our result of 40.9% (Table 3) for always choosing a predicate&#8217;s most frequent role; however, the cross-domain system does not have role frequencies for the test predicates.
    As one might expect, as we make successively broader generalizations to semantically more distant predicates, performance degrades.
    Our results indicate that frame semantics give us a level at which generalizations relevant to argument linking can be made.
    Our results for unseen predicates within the same frame are encouraging, indicating that the predicates are semantically similar in wa
