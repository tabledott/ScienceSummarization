ncluded in the ensemble.
    The most accurate single classifier for line is Naive_Bayes (4,25), which attains accuracy of 84% The accuracy of the ensemble created from the most accurate classifier in each of the range categories is 88%.
    The single most accurate classifier for interest is Naive_Bayes(4,1), which attains accuracy of 86% while the ensemble approach reaches 89%.
    The increase in accuracy achieved by both ensembles over the best individual classifier is statistically significant, as judged by McNemar's test with p = .01.
    These experiments use the same sense-tagged corpora for interest and line as previous studies.
    Summaries of previous results in Tables 5 and 6 show that the accuracy of the Naive Bayesian ensemble is comparable to that of any other approach.
    However, due to variations in experimental methodologies, it can not be concluded that the differences among the most accurate methods are statistically significant.
    For example, in this work five-fold cross validation
