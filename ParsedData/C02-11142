as follows.
			Section 2 reviews previous work on semanticsimilarity and lexical acquisition.
			Section 3 de scribes how the graph model was built from the PoS-tagged British National Corpus.
			Section 4 describes a new incremental algorithm used to build categories of words step by step from thegraph model.
			Section 5 demonstrates this algo rithm in action and evaluates the results againstWordNet classes, obtaining state-of-the-art re sults.
			Section 6 describes how the graph modelcan be used to recognise when words are polysemous and to obtain groups of words represen tative of the different senses.
	
	
			Most work on automatic lexical acquisition has been based at some point on the notion of semantic similarity.
			The underlying claim is that words which are semantically similar occurwith similar distributions and in similar con texts (Miller and Charles, 1991).The main results to date in the field of au tomatic lexical acquisition are concerned withextracting lists of words reckoned to belong to g
