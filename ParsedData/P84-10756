 describe how constituents can be built up to form new constituents with associated DAGs.
    The right side of the rule lists the cat values of the DAGs associated with the filial constituents; the left side, the cat of the parent.
    The associated unifications specify equivalences that must exist among the various DAGs and sub-DAGs of the parent and children.
    Thus, the formalism uses only one representation- --DAGs---for lexical, syntactic, and semantic information, and one operation&#8212;unification--on this representation.
    By way of example, we present a trivial grammar for a fragment of English with a lexicon associating words with DAGs.
    [cat: v head: [aux: false form: nonfinite voice: active trans: [pred: knight argl: cf1134&gt; arg2: &lt;f1138&gt; [l]] syncat : [first: [cat: np head: [trans: &lt;f1134&gt;]] rest: [first: [cat: np head: [trans: &lt;f1138&gt;]] rest: &lt;f1140&gt; . lambda] tail: &lt;f1140&gt;]] Reentrant structure is notated by labeling the DAG with an arbitrary label (in
