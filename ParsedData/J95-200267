er, as both Kupiec's and our approach is based on state transitions, and dotted productions (Earley states) turn out to be equivalent to RTN states if the RTN is constructed from a CFG.
  
  
    We have presented an Earley-based parser for stochastic context-free grammars that is appealing for its combination of advantages over existing methods.
    Earley's control structure lets the algorithm run with best-known complexity on a number of grammar subclasses, and no worse than standard bottom-up probabilistic chart parsers on general SCFGs and fully parameterized CNF grammars.
    Unlike bottom-up parsers it also computes accurate prefix probabilities incrementally while scanning its input, along with the usual substring (inside) probabilities.
    The chart constructed during parsing supports both Viterbi parse extraction and Baum&#8212; Welch type rule probability estimation by way of a backward pass over the parser chart.
    If the input comes with (partial) bracketing to indicate phrase structure, this
