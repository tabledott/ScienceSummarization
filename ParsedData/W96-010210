feature relevance values than the the lowest value of the disambiguating features) are not stored in the tree.
    In our tagging application, this means that only context feature values that actually contribute to disambiguation are used in the construction of the tree.
    Leaf nodes contain the unique class label corresponding to a path in the tree.
    Nonterminal nodes contain information about the most probable or default classification given the path thus far, according to the bookkeeping information on class occurrences maintained by the tree construction algorithm.
    This extra information is essential when using the tree for classification.
    Finding the classification of a new case involves traversing the tree (i.e., matching all feature values of the test case with arcs in the order of the overall feature information gain), and either retrieving a classification when a leaf is reached, or using the default classification on the last matching non-terminal node if a feature-value match fails.
