emiring.
    For the tropical semiring, one can replace ED by min and 0 by + in the pseudocode of Figure 10.7 The algorithm is similar to the powerset construction used for the determinization of automata.
    However, since the outputs of two transitions bearing the same input label might differ, one can only output the minimum of these outputs in the resulting transducer, therefore one needs to keep track of the residual weights.
    Hence, the subsets q2 that we consider here are made of pairs (q, x) of states and weights.
    The initial weight A2 Of 72 is the minimum of all the initial weights of TI (line 2).
    The initial state i2 is a subset made of pairs (i, x), where i is an initial state of and x = A1 (i) &#8212; A2 (line 3).
    We use a queue Q to maintain the set of subsets q2 yet to be examined, as in the classical powerset construction.'
    Initially, Q contains only the subset i2.
    The subsets q2 are the states of the resulting transducer. q2 is a final state of 7-2 iff it contains at le
