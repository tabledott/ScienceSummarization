    The only clue to the start of the new intention would be the ending of chain 2 {afflicted, darkness, .

    This example also provides a good illustration (chain 2) of the importance of chain returns being used to indicate a high-level intention spanning the length of the entire chain (including all segments).
    Also, the returns coincided with intentional boundaries.
  
  
    The motivation behind this work was that lexical cohesion in text should correspond in some way to the structure of the text.

    This was found to be true.
    The lexical chains computed by the al
