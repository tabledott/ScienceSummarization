  A Program For Aligning Sentences In Bilingual Corpora
  
    Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., al., and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoulcermann, 1990) have recently become interested in studying parallel texts, texts such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings) which are available in multiple languages (French and English).
    This paper describes a method for aligning sentences in these parallel texts, based on a simple statistical model of character lengths.
    The method was developed and tested on a small trilingual sample of Swiss economic reports.
    A much larger sample of 90 million words of Canadian Hansards has been aligned and donated to the ACL/DCI.
