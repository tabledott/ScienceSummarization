  Discriminative Training And Maximum Entropy Models For Statistical Machine Translation
  
    We present a framework for statistical machine translation of natural languages based on direct maximum entropy models, which contains the widely used source-channel approach as a special case.
    All knowledge sources are treated as feature functions, which depend on the source language sentence, the target language sentence and possible hidden variables.
    This approach allows a baseline machine translation system to be extended easily by adding new feature functions.
    We show that a baseline statistical machine translation system is significantly improved using this approach.
  
  
    We are given a source (&#8216;French&#8217;) sentence fJ1 = f1, ... , fj, ... , fJ, which is to be translated into a target (&#8216;English&#8217;) sentence eI1 = e1, ... , ei, ... , eI.
    Among all possible target sentences, we will choose the sentence with the highest probability:1 The argmax operation denotes the searc
