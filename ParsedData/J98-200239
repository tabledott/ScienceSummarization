the statistical significance of the difference between P(prep I verb) and P(prep I nouni).
    If the t-score indicates that the former probability is significantly larger, Example input data as quadruples and labels. see girl in park ADV see man with telescope ADV see girl with scarf ADN then the prepositional phrase is attached to verb, if the latter probability is significantly larger, it is attached to nouni, and otherwise no decision is made.
    The second approach (Sekine et al. 1992; Chang, Luo, and Su 1992; Resnik 1993a; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Alshawi and Carter 1994) takes triples (verb, prep, noun2) and (nouni , prep, noun2), like those in Table 10, as training data for acquiring semantic knowledge and performs PP-attachment disambiguation on quadruples.
    For example, Resnik (1993a) proposes the use of the selectional association measure calculated based on such triples, as described in Section 2.
    More specifically, his method compares maxaass19noun2 A(Class, I verb, prep) and maxClass1
