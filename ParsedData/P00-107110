gger with semantic dictionaries derived from the Gazetteers and from WordNet (Miller 1995).
    In addition to the implementation of grammar rules, we have implemented heuristics capable of recognizing names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, currencies and products.
    Similar heuristics recognize named entities successfully in IE systems.
    Having these capabilities proved to be useful for locating the possible answers within a set of candidate paragraphs.
    Answer Extraction The parser enables the recognition of the answer candidates in the paragraph.
    Each expression tagged by the parser with the answer type becomes one of the answer candidates for a paragraph.
    Similar to the paragraphwindows used in ordering the paragraphs, we establish an answer-window for each answer candidate.
    To evaluate the correctness of each answer candidate, a new evaluation metric is computed for each answer-window.
    We use the following scores: The overall score for a given answer candidate is compu
