stical models that attempt to capture a relationship between syntactic structures in two languages, be they constituent models or dependency models.
    As art example of the former, consider Wu's (1995) stochastic inversion transduction grammar (SITG), in which paired sentences are simultaneously generated using context-free rules; word order differences are accounted for by allowing each rule to be read in a left-toright or right-to-left fashion, depending ort the language.
    For example, SITG can generate verb initial (English) and verb final (Japanese) verb phrases using the same rule VP V NP.
    For arty derivation using this rule, if VE and NPE are the English verb and noun phrase, and they are respectively aligned with Japanese verb and noun phrase v j and NP j, then VERB-OBJECT(VE, NPE) and VERB-OBJECT(V j, NP j) mug both be true.
    As art example where the DCA relates dependency structures, consider the hierarchical alignment algorithm proposed by Alshawi et al. (2000).
    In this framework, wo
