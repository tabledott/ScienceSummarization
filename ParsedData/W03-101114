earest neighbours7 of each noun, computed using each distributional similarity measure at each parameter setting, are then compared with the k nearest neighbours of the noun according to the WordNet based measure.
    In order to compute the similarity of two neighbour sets, we transform each neighbour set so that each neighbour is given a rank score of k &#8212; rank.
    We do not use the similarity scores directly since these require normalization if different similarity measures (using different scales) are to be compared.
    Having performed this transformation, the neighbour sets for the same word w may be represented by two ordered sets of words [wk, w1] and [w, wl].
    The similarity between such sets is computed using the same calculation as used by Lin (1998) except for simplifications due to the use of ranks: where i and j are the rank scores of the words within each neighbour set.
