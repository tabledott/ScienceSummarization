of NCCs to be discovered from each pair of induced translation models.
    It is further accelerated by heuristics for gauging the a priori likelihood of validation for each candidate NCC.
    The predictive power of a translation model depends on what the model is meant to predict.
    This paper considers two different applications of translation models, and their corresponding objective functions.
    The different objective functions lead to different mathematical formulations of predictive power, different heuristics for estimating predictive power, and different classifications of word sequences with respect to compositionality.
    Monolingual properties of NCCs are not considered by either objective function.
    So, the method will not detect phrases that are translated word-for-word despite non-compositional semantics, such as the English metaphors &amp;quot;ivory tower&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;banana republic,&amp;quot; which translate literally into French.
    On the other hand, the method will de
