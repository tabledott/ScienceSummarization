ategory of propositions under the control of such a nucleic knowledge representation structure.
    The same concept of a nucleus plays a central role in a theory of temporal reference, and of the semantics of tense, which we follow McCawley, Partee, and Isard in regarding as an anaphoric category.
    We claim that any manageable formalism for naturallanguage temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology, as will any usable temporal database for knowledge about events which is to be interrogated using natural language.
  
  
    A semantics of temporal categories in language and a theory of their use in defining the temporal relations between events both require a more complex structure on the domain underlying the meaning representations than is commonly assumed.
    This paper proposes an ontology based on such notions as causation and consequence, rather than on purely temporal primitives.
    A central notion in the ontology is that of an elementary event-complex called a &amp;quot;nucleus.&
