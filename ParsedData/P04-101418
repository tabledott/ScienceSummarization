ture applying GIS to globally optimised models such as conditional random fields, e.g.
    Sha and Pereira (2003).
    As an alternative to GIS, we have implemented a parallel version of our L-BFGS code using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard.
    L-BFGS over forests can be parallelised, using the method described in Clark and Curran (2003) to calculate the feature expectations.
    The L-BFGS algorithm, run to convergence on the cluster, takes 479 iterations and 2 hours for the normal-form model, and 1,550 iterations and roughly 17 hours for the dependency model.
  
  
    For the normal-form model, the Viterbi algorithm is used to find the most probable derivation.
    For the dependency model, the highest scoring dependency structure is required.
    Clark and Curran (2003) outlines an algorithm for finding the most probable dependency structure, which keeps track of the highest scoring set of dependencies for each node in the chart.
    For a set of equivalent entries in the chart (a disjunctiv
