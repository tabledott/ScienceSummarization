00 noun word types not included in the automatic lexicon.14 Using the automated seed lexicon, and still evaluating against our Wiktionary lexicon, MCCA-AUTO yielded 91.8 p0.33 (see table 2(b)), indicating that our system can produce lexicons of comparable accuracy with a heuristically chosen seed.
    We should note that this performance represents no knowledge given to the system in the form of gold seed lexicon entries.
    We also explored how system performance varies for language pairs other than English-Spanish.
    On English-French, for the disjoint EN-FR-D corpus (described in section 4.1), MCCA yielded 88.3 p0.33 (see table 2(c) for more performance measures).
    This verified that our model can work for another closely related language-pair on which no model development was performed.
    One concern is how our system performs on language pairs where orthographic features are less applicable.
    Results on disjoint English-Chinese and English-Arabic are given as EN-CH-D and EN-AR in table 2(c), b
