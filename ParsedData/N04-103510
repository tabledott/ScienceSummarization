vant rules that can be extracted from the triple (S, T, A).
    In this section, we show in concrete terms how to convert a derivation step into a usable rule.
    Consider the second-last derivation step of the first derivation in Figure 2.
    In it, we begin with a source symbol &#8220;ne&#8221;, followed by a target subtree rooted at V B, followed by another source symbol &#8220;pas.&#8221; These three elements of the derivation string are replaced with a target subtree rooted at V P that discards the source symbols and contains the target subtree rooted at V B.
    In general, this replacement process can be captured by the rule depicted in Figure 4.
    The input to the rule are the roots of the elements of the derivation string that are replaced (where we define the root of a symbol to be simply the symbol itself), whereas the output of the rule is a symbol tree, except that some of the leaves are labeled with variables instead of symbols from the target alphabet.
    These variables correspond to elem
