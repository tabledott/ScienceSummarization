for different derivations of a single derivation in the source language to correspond to derivations of different derivations in the "target lan~ guage; that is, derivation order in synchronous TAGs is in this respect crucial, unlike in the base TAG for- malisms.
			We rely on this property in the analysis of quantifier scope in Section 4.2.
	
	
			We turn to the question of why, in augmenting TAGs for the purposes of encoding semantic information, it is preferable to use the synchronous TAG method over more conventional methods, such as semantic rules in- volving logical operations (as in Montague grammar or generalized phrase-structure grammar) or complex- feature-structure encodings (as in unification-based or logic grammar formalisms), First, the arguments for factoring recursion and depen- dencies as TAGs do for the syntax of natural anguage have their counterparts in the semantics.
			The structure of TAGs allows syntactic dependencies--agreement, sub- categorization, and so forth--to be localized in th
