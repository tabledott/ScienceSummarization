aints that enforce equality between the probability of any French translation y of in according to the model and the probability of that translation in the empirical distribution.
    Examples of such constraints are Feature templates for word-translation modeling. lye is the size of the English vocabulary; IVFI the size of the French vocabulary.
    A maximum entropy model that uses only template 1 features predicts each French translation y with the probability p(y) determined by the empirical data.
    This is exactly the distribution employed by the basic translation model.
    Since template 1 features are independent of x, the maximum entropy model that employs only constraints derived from template 1 features takes no account of contextual information in assigning a probability to y.
    When we include constraints derived from template 2 features, we take our first step towards a context-dependent model.
    Rather than simply constraining the expected probability of a French word y to equal its empir
