 X.
    Even when this is the case (i.e., the NP is used referentially rather than attributively1), the notion of referring has its problems.
    For example, the speaker may be mistaken in her belief that Mr. X is the tenant of the house (Donnellan 1966).
    In such cases it is unclear who is being referred to.
    Such problems notwithstanding, work on coreference annotation has usually taken the notion of reference for granted, on the assumption that clear cases, where the referent of an NP is clearly defined, outnumber the problematic ones, at least in some important types of discourse.
    Let us, for now, buy into the assumption that reference is a straightforward notion.
    Then, following Bach (1987) (especially Sections 3.2 and 12.2), for example, one thing that is clear about reference is that some NPs do not refer.
    When someone says the solution NPs do not refer to any single solution, nor to any definite set of solutions.
    Most theorists would agree that they do not have a referent.
