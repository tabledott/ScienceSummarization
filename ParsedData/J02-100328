ble because, in the Satellite sets, c is always accompanied by other objects (i.e., a and b); more generally, in this example, no object in the domain is uniquely identifiable, since no object occurs in a Satellite set that is a singleton.
    Satellite sets can also be applied to the construction of descriptions.
    The entity {a, b}, for example, is uniquely described by the intersection DOG n POODLE n BLACK, and this can be read off the list of Satellite sets.
    Two of the three properties in DOG n POODLE n BLACK are redundant, however.
    Using Satellites sets for the construction of descriptions can be particularly useful when properly generalized to Boolean descriptions, but shortening the resulting descriptions in a computationally efficient way is difficult (van Deemter and Halld &#180;orsson 2001).
    The present paper will focus on another approach to Boolean descriptions, which takes the Incremental Algorithm as its point of departure (van Deemter 2001).
    In this section, we will show how f
