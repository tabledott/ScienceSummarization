nguage independent.
    This is borne out by the many recent studies on unsupervised parsing that include evaluations covering a number of languages (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Gillenwater et al., 2010; Naseem et al., 2010; Spitkovsky et al., 2011).
    However, the performance for most languages is still well below that of supervised systems and recent work has established that the performance is also below simple methods of linguistic transfer (McDonald et al., 2011).
    In this study we focus on semi-supervised and linguistic-transfer methods for multilingual structure prediction.
    In particular, we pursue two lines of research around the use of word cluster features in discriminative models for structure prediction: guages for dependency parsing and 4 languages for named-entity recognition (NER).
    This is the first study with such a broad view on this subject, in terms of language diversity.
