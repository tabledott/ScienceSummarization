ry modi- tiers in referring expressions; this presumably implies that in many cases human hearers do not make impli- catures from the presence of unnecessary modifiers.
  For example, if human subjects are shown a picture of a white bird, a black cup, and a white cup, and are asked to identify the white bird, they frequently say the white bird, even though just the bird would have been sufficient in this ease.
  A partial explanation for this use of redundancy may be that human speakers generate referring expres- sions incrementally [Pee89].
  An incremental gener- ation algorithm cannot always detect unnecessary modifiers; in the above example, for instance, one could imagine the algorithm choosing the adjective white to rule out the black cup, and then the noun bird in order to rule out the white cup, without then erasing white because the black cup is also ruled out by bird.
  Another explanation of redundancy might involve the speakers desire to make it easier for the hearer to identify the object; the sp
