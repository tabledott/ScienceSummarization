nd the current and last three sentences for nominals.
    Additionally, we disallow nominals from having direct pronoun antecedents.
    In addition to the above, if a mention is in a deterministic coreference configuration, as defined in Haghighi and Klein (2009), we force it to take the required antecedent.
    In general, antecedent affinities learn to prefer close antecedents in prominent syntactic positions.
    We also learn that new entity nominals are typically indefinite or have SBAR complements (captured by the CFG feature).
    In contrast to nominals and pronouns, the choice of entity for a proper mention is governed more by entity frequency than antecedent distance.
    We capture this by setting s,7r(i, j; X) in the proper case to 1 for past positions and to a fixed &#945; otherwise.
    2 Once the semantic module has generated entities and the discourse model selects entity assignments, each mention Mi generates word values for a set of observed properties Ri: Mention Generation For each mentio
