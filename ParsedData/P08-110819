of which parser began the iterative process.
    In retrospect, this result is not surprising.
    Since the initial integration effectively incorporates knowledge from both parsing systems, there is little to be gained by adding additional parsers in the chain.
    The experimental results presented so far show that feature-based integration is a viable approach for improving the accuracy of both graph-based and transition-based models for dependency parsing, but they say very little about how the integration benefits the two models and what aspects of the parsing process are improved as a result.
    In order to get a better understanding of these matters, we replicate parts of the error analysis presented by McDonald and Nivre (2007), where parsing errors are related to different structural properties of sentences and their dependency graphs.
    For each of the four models evaluated, we compute error statistics for labeled attachment over all twelve languages together.
