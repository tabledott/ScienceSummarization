ed from the same discourse fragment.
  However, four of the nine test words are not very interesting in the Brown Corpus antenna, drum, hull, and knife, since only one sense is observed.
  There were 106 pairs for the remain- ing five words: campaign, deposit, interior, landscape, and marine.
  The first author found that 102 of the 106 pairs were used in the same sense.
  Thus, it appears that one-sense-per-discourse tendency is also fairly strong in the Brown Corpus (102/106 ~ 96%), as well as in the Groliers Encyclopedia.
  IMPL ICAT IONS There seem to be two applications for the one-sense-per- discourse observation: first it can be used as an ad- ditional source of constraint for improving the perfor- mance of the word-sense disambiguation algorithm, and 3In contrast, of the 28 control pairs, the majority opinion found that only 1 share the same sense, and 27 did not.
  236 secondly, it could be used to help evaluate disambigua- tion algorithms that did not make use of the discourse constraint.
  Thus far
