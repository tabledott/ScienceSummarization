 a bit of recent work on sentence alignment, e.g., (Brown, Lai and Mercer, 1990, (Kay and Rbscheisen, 1988), (Catizone, Russell, and Warwick, to appear); we use a method described in (Gale and Church, 1991) which makes use of the fact that the length of a text (in characters) i~ 5ighly correlated (0.991) with the length of its translation.
  A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed match, based on the lengths of the two regions and some simple assumptions about the distributions of these two lengths.
  This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.
  After sentences have been aligned, the second step is to identify correspondences at the word level.
  That is, we would like to know which words in the English text correspond to which words in the French text.
  The identification fword level correspondences is the main topic of this paper.
  We wish to distinguish the terms alignment and correspondence, The term alignment wil
