tained a relatively high proportion of the top tier SCUs: 3/4 of the w=3 facts (75%).
    When we average over all order-3 pyramids (Avg. n=3) or use the largest pyramid (n=9), the PAL A score goes down to .46 or .52, respectively.
    Given the nine-tier pyramid, PAL A contains only 1/3 of the SCUs of w&#8805;6, a much smaller proportion of the most highly weighted ones.
    There are four missing highly weighted SCUs and they express the following facts: to deal with its financial crisis, Pal negotiated with Cathay Pacific for help; the negotiations collapsed; the collapse resulted in part from PAL&#8217;s refusal to cut jobs; and finally, President Estrada brokered an agreement to end the shutdown strike.
    These facts were in the original order-3 pyramid with relatively lower weights.
    The score variability of PAL A, along with the change in status of SCUs from having low weights to having high ones, demonstrates that to use the pyramid method reliably, we need to ask how many summaries are needed to
