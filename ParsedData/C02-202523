cy of 58.7% given a baseline accu- racy for choosing at random of 9.7%.
  The random base- line is much lower than ours for the full data set, but it is comparable for the random baseline for sentences with more than 5 analyses.
  The accuracy of our Combined model for these sentences is 59.64%, so the accuracies of the two models seem fairly similar.
  4 Related Work To the best of our knowledge, no prior research has been conducted exploring the linguistic depth, flexibil- ity in available information, and dynamic nature of tree- banks that we have proposed.
  Earlier work on building corpora of hand-selected analyses relative to an exist- ing broad-coverage grammar was carried out at Xerox PARC, SRI Cambridge, and Microsoft Research.
  As all these resources are tuned to proprietary grammars and analysis engines, the resulting treebanks are not publicly available, nor have reported research results been repro- ducible.
  Yet, especially in light of the successful LinGO open-source repository, it seems vita
