the syntactic category of T as follows: The basic types e and t are assigned syntactic categories NP and S, and all functional types are assigned categories recursively.
    For example Q(e, t)) = S|NP and Q(e, (e, t))) = S|NP|NP.
    This definition of CCG categories is unconventional in that it never assigns atomic categories to functional types.
    For example, there is no distinct syntactic category N for nouns (which have semantic type he, ti).
    Instead, the more complex category S|NP is used.
    Now, we are ready to define the set of all category splits.
    For a category A = X:h we can define which is a union of sets, each of which includes splits for a single CCG operator.
    For example, FA(X:h) is the set of category pairs where each pair can be combined with the forward application combinator, described in Section 3.2, to reconstruct X:h. The remaining three sets are defined similarly, and are associated with the backward application and forward and backward composition operators, respective
