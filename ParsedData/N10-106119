governor of the head (conjoined with the mention&#8217;s syntactic position).
    We discard determiners, but make use of them in the discourse component (Section 3.2) for NP definiteness.
    While it is possible to learn type distributions in a completely unsupervised fashion, we found it useful to prime the system with a handful of important types.
    Rather than relying on fully supervised data, we took the approach of Haghighi and Klein (2006).
    For each type of interest, we provided a (possiblyempty) prototype list of proper and nominal head words, as well as a list of allowed pronouns.
    For instance, for the PERSON type we might provide: Bush, Gore, Hussein president, minister, official he, his, she, him, her, you, ...
    The prototypes were used as follows: Any entity with a prototype on any proper or nominal head word attribute list (Section 3.1) was constrained to have the specified type; i.e. the qk factor (Section 4) places probability one on that single type.
    Similarly to Haghighi and
