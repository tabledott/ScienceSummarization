erive a value for an item, we use the additive operator of the semiring to sum them up.
    Thus, [1, S. 4] = 0.2048.
    Since [1, S, 4] is the goal item for the CKY parser, we know that the inside value for xxx is 0.2048.
    The goal item exactly parallels the return statement of the CKY inside algorithm.
    Many parsers are much more complicated than the CKY parser, and we will need to expand our notation a bit to describe them.
    Earley's algorithm (Earley 1970) exhibits most of the complexities we wish to discuss.
    Earley's algorithm is often described as a bottom-up parser with top-down filtering.
    In a probabilistic framework, the bottomup sections compute probabilities, while the top-down filtering nonprobabilistically removes items that cannot be derived.
    To capture these differences, we expand our notation for deduction rules, to the following: Ci &#8226; &#8226; CI are side conditions, interpreted nonprobabilistically, while A1 &#8226; Ak are main conditions with values in whichever s
