t does not), the &amp;quot;ng&amp;quot; ending allows our program to guess with relative security that the word has the vbg pre-terminal, and thus the probability of various rule expansions can be considerable sharpened.
    For example, the tree-bank PCFG probability of the rule &amp;quot;VP --+ vbg np&amp;quot; is 0.0145, whereas once we condition on the fact that the lexical head is a vbg we get a probability of 0.214.
    The second modification is the explicit marking of noun and verb-phrase coordination.
    We have already noted the importance of conditioning on the parent label /p.
    So, for example, information about an np is conditioned on the parent &#8212; e.g., an s, vp, pp, etc.
    Note that when an np is part of an np coordinate structure the parent will itself be an np, and similarly for a vp.
    But nps and vps can occur with np and vp parents in non-coordinate structures as well.
    For example, in the Penn Treebank a vp with both main and auxiliary verbs has the structure shown in Figu
