uated their tagger (version 0.2) on our corrected dataset. tures, affix n-grams, capitalization, emoticon patterns, etc.&#8212;and the accuracy is in fact still better than the previous work (row 4).18 We also wanted to know whether to keep the tag dictionary and name list features, but the splits reported in Fig.
    2 did not show statistically significant differences; so to better discriminate between ablations, we created a lopsided train/test split of all data with a much larger test portion (26,974 tokens), having greater statistical power (tighter confidence intervals of f 0.3%).19 The full system got 90.8% while the no&#8211;tag dictionary, no-namelists ablation had 90.0%, a statistically significant difference.
    Therefore we retain these features.
    Compared to the tagger in Gimpel et al., most of our feature changes are in the new lexical features described in &#167;3.5.20 We do not reuse the other lexical features from the previous work, including a phonetic normalizer (Metaphone), a name list
