trees.
    See Figure 4.
    These elementary trees can be composed by TAG operations to form the original parse tree.
    The extraction procedure determines the structure of each elementary tree by localizing dependencies through the use of heuristics.
    Salient heuristics include the use of a head percolation table (Magerman, 1995), and another table that distinguishes between complements and adjunct nodes in the tree.
    For our current work, we use the head percolation table to determine heads of phrases.
    Also, we treat a PropBank argument (ARG0 ... ARG9) as a complement and a PropBank adjunct (ARGM&#8217;s) as an adjunct when such annotation is available.1 Otherwise, we basically follow the approach of (Chen, 2001).2 Besides introducing one kind of TAG extraction procedure, (Chen, 2001) introduces the notion of grouping linguistically-related extracted tree frames together.
    In one approach, each tree frame is decomposed into a feature vector.
    Each element of this vector describes a single
