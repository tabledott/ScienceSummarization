ed model, the dependency between the extraposed phrase and its antecendent is neither established by functional application/composition n r by feature passing.
			It is assumed that there is a different matching process that combines the noncontiguous phrases.
			A process of this kind is independently needed for the matching of adjuncts with thematic roles that are embedded in the meaning of the functor: (26a) Tellme about French history.
			(26b) Start in 1700.
			The year 1700 is obviously not the start time for the telling.
			(27a) His call was very urgent.
			(27b) lie tried desperately from every phone booth on campus.
			It is not try that supplies here the source role but the implicit heme of try.
			If the theme role is filled, everybody would analyze the from PP as semantically belonging to the theme of try: (28) He tried to call her desperately from every phone booth on campus.
			I want to conclude this discussion with a remark on the parsing problem connected with the proposed model.
