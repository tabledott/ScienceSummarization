language understanding systems has never been carefully quantified.
  While learning syntactic subcategorization frames from corpora has been shown to be possible with reasonable accuracy (Manning 1993; Brent 1993; Briscoe and Carroll 1997), this work does not address the semantic roles associated with the syntactic arguments.
  More recent work has attempted to group verbs into classes based on alternations, usually taking Levin?s classes as a gold standard (McCarthy 2000; Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Schulte im Walde 2000; Schulte im Walde and Brew 2002).
  But without an annotated corpus of semantic roles, this line of research has not been able to measure the frequency of alternations directly, or more generally, to ascertain how well the classes defined by Levin correspond to real-world data.
  We believe that a shallow labeled dependency structure provides a feasible level of annotation which, coupled with minimal coreference links, could provide the foundation for a major advance in our ability to extract
