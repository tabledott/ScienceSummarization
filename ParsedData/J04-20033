p dispensed with linguistic analysis, at least in its earliest publications.
    Although the IBM group finally made use of morphological and syntactic information to enhance translation quality (Brown et al. 1992; Berger et al.
    1996), most of today&#8217;s statistical machine translation systems still consider only surface forms and use no linguistic knowledge about the structure of the languages involved.
    In many applications only small amounts of bilingual training data are available for the desired domain and language pair, and it is highly desirable to avoid at least parts of the costly data collection process.
    The main objective of the work reported in this article is to introduce morphological knowledge in order to reduce the amount of bilingual data necessary to sufficiently cover the vocabulary expected in testing.
    This is achieved by explicitly taking into account the interdependencies of related inflected forms.
