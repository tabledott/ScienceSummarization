    .
    . steps, to demonstrate .
    .
    . support).
    In this work, as in earlier work (Smadja 1992), we address the full range of collocations including both flexible and rigid collocations for a variety of syntactic categories.
    Another approach, begun more recently than our work, is taken by Dagan and Church (1994), who use statistical methods to translate technical terminology.
    Like van der Eijk and Kupiec, they preprocess their corpora by tagging and by identifying noun phrases.
    However, they use a word alignment program as opposed to sentence alignment and they include single words as candidates for technical terms.
    One of the major differences between their work and ours is that, like van der Eijk and Kupiec, they only handle translation of uninterrupted sequences of words; they do not handle the broader class of flexible co
