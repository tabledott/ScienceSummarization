erfitting and domain-dependence that plague supervised systems.
    Supervision by a database also means that, unlike in unsupervised approaches, the output of our classifier uses canonical names for relations.
    Our paradigm offers a natural way of integrating data from multiple sentences to decide if a relation holds between two entities.
    Because our algorithm can use large amounts of unlabeled data, a pair of entities may occur multiple times in the test set.
    For each pair of entities, we aggregate the features from the many different sentences in which that pair appeared into a single feature vector, allowing us to provide our classifier with more information, resulting in more accurate labels.
    Table 1 shows examples of relation instances extracted by our system.
    We also use this system to investigate the value of syntactic versus lexical (word sequence) features in relation extraction.
    While syntactic features are known to improve the performance of supervised IE, at least using cle
