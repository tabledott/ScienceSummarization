    Of course, we expect it to be much less probable than the alignment shown in Figure 1.
    In Figure 1 each French word is connected to exactly one English word, but more general alignments are possible and may be appropriate for some translations.
    For example, we may have a French word connected to several English words as in Figure 2, which we write as (Le reste appartenait aux autoch tones I The(1) balance(2) was(3) the(3) territory(3) of(4) the(4) aboriginal(5) people(5)).
