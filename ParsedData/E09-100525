lies in between, requiring 2 hours for completing the task, but its overall performance is well below the PageRank based Ppr w2w method.
    Note that the algorithm is coded in C++ for greater efficiency, and uses the Boost Graph Library.
    Regarding PageRank calculation, we have tried different numbers of iterations, and analyze the rate of convergence of the algorithm.
    Figure 1 depicts the performance of the Ppr w2w method for different iterations of the algorithm.
    As before, the algorithm is applied over the MCR17 + Xwn LKB, and evaluated on the Senseval-2 all words dataset.
    The algorithm converges very quickly: one sole iteration suffices for achieving a relatively high performance, and 20 iterations are enough for achieving convergence.
    The figure shows that, depending on the LKB complexity, the user can tune the algorithm and lower the number of iterations, thus considerably reducing the time required for disambiguation.
  
  
    In this paper we propose a new graph-based method that
