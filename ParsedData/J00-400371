    U.S. News' circulation in the same time was 2,303,328, down 2.6%.
    As mentioned in Section 2, our corpus annotation experiments showed bridging descriptions to be the most difficult class for humans to agree on.
    Even when our annotators agreed that a particular expression was a bridging description, different anchors would be available in the text for the interpretation of that bridging description.
    This makes the results of the system for this class very difficult to evaluate; furthermore, the results must be evaluated by hand.
    We first tested the heuristics individually on the training data (the same data used in a previous analysis of the performance of our system on bridging descriptions iVieira and Teufel 19971) by adding them to Version 1 of the system one at a time.
    These separate tests were manually evaluated, We then integrated all of these heuristics
