to extract semantic orientations of words.
    Each spin has a direction taking one of two values: up or down.
    Two neighboring spins tend to have the same direction from a energetic reason.
    Regarding each word as an electron and its semantic orientation as the spin of the electron, we construct a lexical network by connecting two words if, for example, one word appears in the gloss of the other word.
    Intuition behind this is that if a word is semantically oriented in one direction, then the words in its gloss tend to be oriented in the same direction.
    We construct a lexical network by linking two words if one word appears in the gloss of the other word.
    Each link belongs to one of two groups: the sameorientation links SL and the different-orientation links DL.
    If at least one word precedes a negation word (e.g., not) in the gloss of the other word, the link is a different-orientation link.
    Otherwise the links is a same-orientation link.
    We next set weights W = (wij) to links: w
