    Noun is subdivided into Common Noun, Proper Noun and so on.
    Proper Noun is again subdivided into Person, Organization or Place, etc.
    The bottom level can be thought as the word level (base form) with which we can completely discriminate all words as different POS.
    If we distinguish each branch of the hierarchical tree as a different label (ignoring the word level), the total number amounts to about 500, which is much larger than the typical English POS tagset such as Penn Treebank.
    The major effort has been devoted how to interpolate each level of the hierarchical structure as well as to exploit atomic features such as word suffixes and character types.
    If we only use the bottom level, we suffer from the data sparseness problem.
    On the other hand, if we use the top level, we lack in granularity of POS to capture fine
