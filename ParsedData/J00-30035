e of DA n-grams and the hidden Markov models of conversation present in earlier work, such as Nagata and Morimoto (1993, 1994) and Woszczyna and Waibel (1994) (see Section 7).
    However, our framework generalizes earlier models, giving us a clean probabilistic approach for performing DA classification from unreliable words and nonlexical evidence.
    For the speech recognition task, our framework provides a mathematically principled way to condition the speech recognizer on conversation context through dialogue structure, as well as on nonlexical information correlated with DA identity.
    We will present methods in a domain-independent framework that for the most part treats DA labels as an arbitrary formal tag set.
    Throughout the presentation, we will highlight the simplifications and assumptions made to achieve tractable models, and point out how they might fall short of reality.
    Second, we present results obtained with this approach on a large, widely available corpus of spontaneous conversati
