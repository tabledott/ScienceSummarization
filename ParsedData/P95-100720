difference made by conceptual association, the pattern training scheme has been retrained using lexical counts for both the dependency and adjacency model, but only for the words in the test set.
    If the same system were to be applied across all of Ar (a total of 90,000 nouns), then around 8.1 billion parameters would be required.
    Left-branching is favoured by a factor of two as described in the previous section, but no estimates for the category probabilities are used (these being meaningless for the lexical association method).
    Accuracy and guess rates are shown in figure 4.
    Conceptual association outperforms lexical association, presumably because of its ability to generalise.
    One problem with the training methods given in section 2.3 is the restriction of training data to nouns in H. Many nouns, especially common ones, have verbal or adjectival usages that preclude them from being in N. Yet when they occur as nouns, they still provide useful training information that the current system
