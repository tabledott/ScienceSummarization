    We thus propose a score propagation method to allow these high-confidence pairs to propagate some of their scores to other co-occurring transliteration pairs.
    As we will show later, such a propagation strategy can generally further improve the transliteration accuracy; in particular, it can further improve the already high performance from combining the two scoring methods.
    The English named entity candidate selection process was already described above.
    Candidate Chinese transliterations are generated by consulting a list of characters that are frequently used for transliterating foreign names.
    As discussed elsewhere (Sproat et al., 1996), a subset of a few hundred characters (out of several thousand) tends to be used overwhelmingly for transliterating foreign names into Chinese.
    We use a list of 495 such characters, derived from various online dictionaries.
    A sequence of three or more characters from the list is taken as a possible name.
