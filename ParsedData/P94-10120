  Aligning A Parallel English-Chinese Corpus Statistically With Lexical Criteria
  
    We describe our experience with automatic alignment of sentences in parallel English-Chinese texts.
    Our report concerns three related topics: (1) progress on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus; (2) experiments addressing applicability of Gale (1991) lengthbased statistical method to the task of alignment involving a non-Indo-European language; and (3) an improved statistical method that also incorporates domain-specific lexical cues.
  
  
    Recently, a number of automatic techniques for aligning sentences in parallel bilingual corpora have been proposed (Kay &amp; ROscheisen 1988; Catizone et al. 1989; Gale &amp; Church 1991; Brown et at.
    1991; Chen 1993), and coarser approaches when sentences are difficult to identify have also been advanced (Church 1993; Dagan el at.
    1993).
    Such corpora contain the same material that has been translated by human experts into two languages.
