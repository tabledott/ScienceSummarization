e literature (see Table 9) shows that the best BNC model fails to significantly outperform the baseline, and it performs significantly worse than the best model in the literature (Lauer&#8217;s tuned model).
    The best Altavista model, on the other hand, is not significantly different from Lauer&#8217;s tuned model and significantly outperforms the baseline.
    Hence we achieve the same performance as Lauer without recourse to a predefined taxonomy or a thesaurus.
  
  
    The second analysis task we consider is the semantic interpretation of compound nouns.
    Most previous approaches to this problem have focused on the interpretation of two word compounds whose nouns are related via a basic set of semantic relations (e.g., CAUSE relates onion tears, FOR relates pet spray).
    The majority of proposals are symbolic and therefore limited to a specific domain due to the large effort involved in hand-coding semantic information (see Lauer 1995 for an extensive overview).
    Lauer (1995) is the first to p
