iscourse boundary after each word in a sentence, and a segmenter, which uses the probabilities computed by the model for inserting discourse boundaries.
    We first focus on the statistical model.
    A good model of discourse segmentation needs to account both for local interactions at the word level and for global interactions at more abstract levels.
    Consider, for example, the syntactic tree in Figure 2.
    According to our hypothesis, the discourse boundary inserted between the words says and it is best explained not by the words alone, but by the lexicalized syntactic structure [VP(says) [VBZ(says) SBAR(will)]], signaled by the boxed nodes in Figure 2.
    Hence, we hypothesize that the discourse boundary in our example is best explained by the global interaction between the verb (the act of saying) and its clausal complement (what is being said).
    Given a sentence , we first find the syntactic parse tree of .
    We used in our experiments both syntactic parse trees obtained using Charniak&#821
