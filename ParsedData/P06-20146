., 1996), and weighted maximum matching alignment all conduct complete searches, but they would not be amenable to monitoring the syntactic interactions of links.
    The tree-to-string models of (Yamada and Knight, 2001) naturally consider syntax, but special modeling considerations are needed to allow any deviations from the provided tree (Gildea, 2003).
    The Inversion Transduction Grammar or ITG formalism, described in (Wu, 1997), is well suited for our purposes.
    ITGs perform string-to-string alignment, but do so through a parsing algorithm that will allow us to inform the objective function of our dependency tree.
    An ITG aligns bitext through synchronous parsing.
    Both sentences are decomposed into constituent phrases simultaneously, producing a word alignment as a byproduct.
    Viewed generatively, an ITG writes to two streams at once.
    Terminal productions produce a token in each stream, or a token in one stream with the null symbol 0 in the other.
    We will use standard ITG notation
