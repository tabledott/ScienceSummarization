 slightly better than the decision tree models.
  For comparison, we obtained the PP-attachment performances of 3 treebanking experts on a set of 300 randomly selected test events from the WSJ corpus.
  In the first trial, they were given only the four head words to make the attachment decision, and in the next, they were given the headwords along with the sentence in which they occurred.
  Figure 3 shows an example of the head words test a.
  The results of the treebankers and the performance of the ME model on that same set are shown in Table 5.
  We also identified the set of 274 events on which treebankers, given the sentence, unanimously agreed.
  We defined this to be the truth set.
  We show in Table 6 the agreement on PP-attachment of the original WSJ treebank parses with this consensus set, the average performance of the 3 human experts with head words only, and the ME model.
  The WSJ treebank indicates the accuracy rate of our training data, the human performance indicates how much information is i
