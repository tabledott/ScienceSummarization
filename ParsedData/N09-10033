    WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a lexical database of English, which groups nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs into sets of synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.
    Synsets are interlinked with conceptual-semantic and lexical relations, including hypernymy, meronymy, causality, etc.
    Given a pair of words and a graph-based representation of WordNet, our method has basically two steps: We first compute the personalized PageRank over WordNet separately for each of the words, producing a probability distribution over WordNet synsets.
    We then compare how similar these two discrete probability distributions are by encoding them as vectors and computing the cosine between the vectors.
    We represent WordNet as a graph G = (V, E) as follows: graph nodes represent WordNet concepts (synsets) and dictionary words; relations among synsets are represented by undirected edges; and dictionary words are linked to the synsets associated to th
