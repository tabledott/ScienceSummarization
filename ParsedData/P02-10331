ent that two factors are at play.
    On the one hand, instances of a word/sense combination are translated with some consistency into a relatively small handful of words in the second language.
    On the other hand, that handful of words is rarely a singleton set evert for a single word/sense, because the preferences of different translators and the demands of context produce semantically similar words that differ in their nuances.
