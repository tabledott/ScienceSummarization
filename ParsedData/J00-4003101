ppelt et al. 1995).
    This system achieved one of the top scores for the coreference task: a recall of 59% and a precision of 72%.
    The SRI system uses a sort hierarchy claimed to be sparse and incomplete.
    For definite descriptions, Kameyama reports the results of a test on five articles, containing 61 definite descriptions in total; recall was 46% (28/61), and for proper names, 69% (22/32).
    The precision figures for these two subclasses are not reported.
    Some of the errors in definite descriptions are said to be due to nonidentity referential relations; however, there is no mention of differences between discourse-new and bridging descriptions.
    Other errors were said to be related to failure in recognizing synonyms.
    Aone and Bennet (1995) propose an automatically trainable anaphora resolution system.
    They train a decision tree using the C 4.5 algorithm by feeding feature vectors for pairs of anaphor and antecedent.
    They use 66 features, including lexical, syntactic, semantic,
