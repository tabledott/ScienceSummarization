    RESPONSE PREPARATION Does the response contribute task/domain READY information, or does it only show evidence that communication has been successful?

    The move coding analysis is the most substantial level.
    It was developed by extending the moves that make up Houghton's (1986) interaction frames to fit the kinds of interactions found in the Map Task dialogues.
    In any categorization, there is a trade-off between usefulness and ease or consistency of coding.
    Too many semantic distinctions make coding difficult.
    These categories were chosen to be useful for a range of purposes but still be reliable.
    The distinctions used to classify moves are summarized in the action.
    The instruction can be quite indirect, as in example
