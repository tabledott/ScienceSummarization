ronics, SCL-MI actually outperforms the in-domain classifier.
    This is possible since the unlabeled data may contain information that the in-domain classifier does not have access to.
    At the beginning of Section 2 we gave examples of how features can change behavior across domains.
    The first type of behavior is when predictive features from the source domain are not predictive or do not appear in the target domain.
    The second is domain polarity negative positive books plot &lt;num&gt; pages predictable reader grisham engaging reading this page &lt;num&gt; must read fascinating kitchen the plastic poorly designed excellent product espresso leaking awkward to defective are perfect years now a breeze Table 2: Correspondences discovered by SCL for books and kitchen appliances.
    The top row shows features that only appear in books and the bottom features that only appear in kitchen appliances.
    The left and right columns show negative and positive features in correspondence, respectively. when
