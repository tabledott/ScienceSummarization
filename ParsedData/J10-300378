between this work and that of Quirk, Brockett, and Dolan (2004) (discussed in Section 3.3) because both treat paraphrasing as monolingual translation.
    However, as outlined in the discussion of that work, Quirk, Brockett, and Dolan use a relatively simplistic translation model and decoder which leads to paraphrases with little or no lexical variety.
    In contrast, Madnani et al. use a more complex translation model and an unmodified state-of-the-art SMT decoder to produce paraphrases that are much more diverse.
    Of course, the reliance of the latter approach on automatic word alignments does inevitably lead to much noisier sentential paraphrases than those produced by Quirk, Brockett, and Dolan.
    Kok and Brockett (2010) present a novel take on generating phrasal paraphrases with bilingual corpora.
    As with most approaches based on parallel corpora, they also start with phrase tables extracted from such corpora along with the corresponding phrasal translation probabilities.
    However, instead o
