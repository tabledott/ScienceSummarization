  Methods of semantic distance that are based on Roget- structured thesauri therefore rely not only on the category structure but also on the index and on the pointers within categories that cross-reference other categories.
  In part as a consequence of this, typically no numerical value for semantic distance can be obtained: rather, algorithms using the thesaurus compute a distance implicitly and return a boolean value of ?close?
  or ?not close?.
  Working with an abridged version of Roget?s Thesaurus, Morris and Hirst (1991) identified five types of semantic relations between words.
  In their approach, two words 15 Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1 were deemed to be related to one another, or semantically close, if their base forms satisfy any one of the following conditions: 1.
  They have a category in common in their index entries.
  One has a category in its index entry that contains a pointer to a category of the other.
  One is either a label in the ot
