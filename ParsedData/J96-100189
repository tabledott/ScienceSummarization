    Translating closed class words.
    In the experiments described in this paper, Champollion produced only partial collocations in the target language, because we eliminated closed-class words from our indices.
    There are two reasons for eliminating such words.
    First, they are very frequent and appear in almost any context, so that using them would blur our statistics.
    The second reason is one of time and space efficiency: since these words appear in many sentences in the corpus database, it is economical to remove them from the indices.
    However, this causes Champollion to produce only partial collocations, for example, to cause havoc gets translated as semer[0], desarrois[2].
    The position numbers indicate that a word is missing between the two French words.
    This word is the article le, and the full collocation is semer le desarrois.
    We implemented an extension that checks the positions around the words
