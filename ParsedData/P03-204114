 43 subgraphs, we must jointly hypothesize states for all frontier nodes and the root node.
    For |Q |&gt; 1, there are exponentially many ways to do this.
    To avoid having exponentially many hypotheses, one may restrict the form of possible elementary trees so that the possible states of each node of t can be determined somehow from the labels on the corresponding nodes in T. As a simple but useful example, a node labeled NP might be required to have state NP.
    Rich labels on the derived tree essentially provide supervision as to what the states must have been during the derivation.
    The tree parsing algorithm resembles bottom-up chart parsing under the derivation CFG.
    But the input is a tree rather than a string, and the chart is indexed by nodes of the input tree rather than spans of the input string:5 The &#946; values are inside probabilities.
    After running the algorithm, if r is the root of T, then &#946;r(Start) is the probability that the grammar generates T. p(t  |q) in line 4 may
