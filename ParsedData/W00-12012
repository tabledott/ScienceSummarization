ular language&#8212;almost entirely languageindependent.
    In this paper, we will explore the use of two parsing models, which were originally designed for English parsing, on parsing Chinese, using the newly-available Chinese IYeebank.
    We will show that the languagedependent components of these parsers are quite compact, and that with little effort they can be adapted to produce promising results for Chinese parsing.
    We also discuss directions for future work.
  
  
    We will briefly describe the two parsing models employed (for a full description of the BBN model, see (Miller et al., 1998) and also (Bikel, 2000); for a full description of the TAG model, see (Chiang, 2000)).
    Both parsing models discussed in this paper inherit a great deal from this model, so we briefly describe its &amp;quot;progenitive&amp;quot; features here, describing only how each of the two models of this paper differ in the subsequent two sections.
