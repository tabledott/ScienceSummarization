to be.
			In other words, there will be highoverlap between neighbour sets generated con sidering all 2000 nouns as potential neighbours and neighbour sets generated considering just the nouns in WShigh as potential neighbours.
			In the extreme case, where all of a noun?s k nearestneighbours are high frequency nouns, the over lap with the high frequency noun neighbour set will be 1 and the overlap with the low frequency noun neighbour set will be 0.
			The inverse is, ofcourse, true if a measure is biased towards se lecting low frequency words as neighbours.
			If NSwordset is the vector of neighbours (and associated rank scores) for a given word, w, andsimilarity measure, m, and generated considering just the words in wordset as potential neigh bours, then the overlap between two neighboursets can be computed using a cosine (as be fore).
			If Chigh = C(NScomp,NShigh) and Clow =C(NScomp,NSlow), then we compute the bias towards high frequency neighbours for word w us ing measure m as: biashighm(w) = Chigh Ch
