igh accuracy.
    This means that they estimated the probability of producing a parse tree from a supertagged sentence.
    Another approach to estimating log-linear models for HPSG is to extract a small informative sample from the original set T (s) (Osborne, 2000).
    Malouf and van Noord (2004) successfully applied this method to German HPSG.
    The problem with this method was in the approximation of exponentially many parse trees by a polynomial-size sample.
    However, their method has the advantage that any features on a parse tree can be incorporated into the model.
    The trade-off between approximation and locality of features is an outstanding problem.
    Other discriminative classifiers were applied to the disambiguation in HPSG parsing (Baldridge and Osborne, 2003; Toutanova et al., 2004).
    The problem of exponential explosion is also inevitable for their methods.
    An approach similar to ours may be applied to them, following the study on the learning of a discriminative classifier for
