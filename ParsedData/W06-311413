    Following this method, we repeatedly &#8212; say, 1000 times &#8212; sample sets of sentences from the output of each system, measure their BLEU score, and use these 1000 BLEU scores as basis for estimating a confidence interval.
    When dropping the top and bottom 2.5% the remaining BLEU scores define the range of the confidence interval.
    Pairwise comparison: We can use the same method to assess the statistical significance of one system outperforming another.
    If two systems&#8217; scores are close, this may simply be a random effect in the test data.
    To check for this, we do pairwise bootstrap resampling: Again, we repeatedly sample sets of sentences, this time from both systems, and compare their BLEU scores on these sets.
    If one system is better in 95% of the sample sets, we conclude that its higher BLEU score is statistically significantly better.
    The bootstrap method has been critized by Riezler and Maxwell (2005) and Collins et al. (2005), as bein
