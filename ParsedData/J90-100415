    This property is the hallmark of several linguistically reasonable analyses based on lexical encoding of grammatical information such as are found in categorial grammar and its unification-based and combinatorial variants, in head-driven phrase-structure grammar, and in lexical-functional grammar.
    The bottom-up Earley-deduction generator does not fall prey to these problems of nontermination in the face of recursion, because lexical information is available immediately.
    However, several important frailties of the Earley generation method were noted, even in the earlier work.
    For efficiency, generation using this Earley deduction method requires an incomplete search strategy, filtering the search space using semantic information.
    The semantic filter makes generation from a logical form computationally feasible, but preserves completeness of the generation process only in the case of semantically monotonic grammars&#8212;those grammars in which the semantic component of each right-hand-sid
