o evaluate both MT systems and automatic metrics, by optimizing TERp to these human judgments and examining the resulting edit costs.
    While this can make no judgement as to the preference of one type of human judgment over another, it indicates differences between these human judgment types, and in particular the difference between HTER and Adequacy and Fluency.
    This exploration is limited by the the lack of a large amount of diverse data annotated for all human judgment types, as well as the small number of edit types used by TERp.
    The inclusion of additional more specific edit types could lead to a more detailed understanding of which translation phenomenon and translation errors are most emphasized or ignored by which types of human judgments.
