 clauses fiom the nouns they modify, copying the head noun into the relative clause is simple, but leads to quite awkward sounding texts.
  IIowever, choosing an appropriate pronoun or choosing between definite and indefinite NPs involves knowledge of complex discourse information.
  Selecting the right tense when creating new sentences presents imilar problems.
  No matter how sophisticated the simplifica- tion heuristics, the subtleties of meaning in- tended by the author may be diluted, if not lost altogether.
  For many computer appli- cations, this disadvantage is outweighed by the advantages of simplification (i.e.
  gains of speed and/or accuracy), or may be corrected with the use of human l)ost-processiug.
