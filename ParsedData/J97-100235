m the same study as the results for the expert move cross-coding results.
    Since games nest, it is not possible to analyze game segmentation in the same way as was done for moves.
    Moreover, it is possible for a set of coders to agree on where the game begins and not where it ends, but still believe that the game has the same goal, since the game's goal is largely defined by its initiating utterance.
    Therefore, the best analysis considers how well coders agree on where games start and, for agreed starts, where they end.
    Since game beginnings are rare compared to word boundaries, pairwise percent agreement is used.
    Calculating as described, coders reached promising but not entirely reassuring agreement on where games began (70%, N = 203).
    Although one coder tended to have longer games (and therefore fewer beginnings) than the others, there was no striking pattern of disagreement.
    Where the coders managed to agree on the beginning of a game (i.e., for the most orderly parts of the dial
