    The score f (t) of a tile t is a function of its positive and negative counts.
    The overall score of a situated candidate is generally a function of the scores of all the tiles for the candidate, as well as the relations between the tiles' positions.
    These relations include tile adjacency, overlap between tiles, the amount of context in a tile, and so on.
    In our instantiation of the MBSL schema, we define the score f(t) of a tile t as the ratio of its positive count pos(t) and its total count total(t): for a predefined threshold 0.
    Tiles with a score of 1, and so with sufficient positive evidence, are called matching tiles.
    Each matching tile gives supporting evidence that a part of the candidate can be a part of a target instance.
    In order to combine this evidence, we try to cover the entire candidate by a set of matching tiles, with no gaps.
    Such a covering constitutes evidence that the entire candidate is a target instance.
    For example, consider the matching tiles
