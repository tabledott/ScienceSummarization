    Identifying compounds.
    In work reported in Goldsmith and Reutter (1998), we have explored the usefulness of the present system for determining the linking elements used in German compounds, but more work remains to be done to identify compounds in general.
    Here we run straight into the problem of assigning very short strings a lower likelihood of being words than longer strings.
    That is, it is difficult to avoid positing a certain number of very short stems, as in English m and an, the first because of pairs such as me and my, the second because of pairs such as an and any, but these facts should not be taken as strong evidence that man is a compound.

    As noted at the outset, the present algorithm is limited in its ability to discover the morphology of a language in which there are not a sufficient number of words with only one suffix in the corpus.
    In work in progress, we are developing a related algorithm that deals with the 33 We noted in the preceding sec
