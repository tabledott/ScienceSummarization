distinct English noun phrases and 5,100 distinct French noun phrases were extracted from the sample.
    When forming correspondences involving long sentences with many clauses, it was observed that the position at which a noun phrase occurred in Ei was very roughly proportional to the corresponding noun phrase in F. .
    In such cases it was not necessary to form correspondences with all noun phrases in Fi for each noun phrase in E. Instead, the location of a phrase in Ei was mapped linearly to a position in Fi and correspondences were formed for noun phrases occurring in a window around that position.
    This resulted in a total of 34,000 correspondences.
    The mappings are stable within a few (2-4) iterations.
    In discussing results, a selection of examples will be presented that demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm.
    To give an indication of noun phrase frequency counts in the sample, the highest ranking correspondences are shown in Table 1.
