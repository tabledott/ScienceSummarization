udying a variety of complex discourse phenomena.
    Meetings contain regions of high speaker overlap, affective variation, complicated interaction structures, abandoned or interrupted utterances, and other interesting turn-taking and discourse-level phenomena.
    In addition, meetings that occur naturally involve real topics, debates, issues, and social dynamics that should generalize more readily to other real meetings than might data collected using artificial scenarios.
    Thus meetings pose interesting challenges to descriptive and theoretical models of discourse, as well as to researchers in the speech recognition community [4,7,9,13,14,15].
    We describe a new corpus of hand-annotated dialog acts and adjacency pairs for roughly 72 hours of naturally occurring multi-party meetings.
    The meetings were recorded at the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) as part of the ICSI Meeting Recorder Project [9].
    Word transcripts and audio files from that corpus are available through the Lingu
