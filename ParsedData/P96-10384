onger pauses marking major topic shifts (Lehiste, 1979; Brown, Currie, and Kenworthy, 1980; Avesani and Vayra, 1988; Passonneau and Litman, 1993); Woodbury (1987), however, found no such correlation in his data.
    Amplitude was also found to increase at the start of a new topic and decrease at the end (Brown, Currie, and Kenworthy, 1980).
    Swerts and colleagues (1992) found that melody and duration can pre-signal the end of a discourse unit, in addition to marking the discourse-unit-final utterance itself.
    And speaking rate has been found to correlate with structural variation; in several studies (Lehiste, 1980; Brubaker, 1972; Butterworth, 1975) segment-initial utterances exhibited slower rates, and segment-final, faster rates.
    Swerts and Ostendorf (1995), however, report negative rate results.
    In general, these studies have lacked an independently-motivated notion of discourse structure.
    With few exceptions, they rely on intuitive analyses of topic structure; operational definitions of
