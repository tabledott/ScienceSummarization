e induced morphological guessing rules largely consist of the standard rules of English morphology and also include a small proportion of rules that do not belong to the known morphology of English.
    For instance, the suffix rule a -et +&amp;quot; ?
    (NN) &#8212;*(NN)] does not stand for any well-known morphological rule, but its prediction is as good as those of the standard morphological rules.
    The same situation can be seen with the prefix rule b[ -St +&amp;quot;&amp;quot; ?
    (NNS) &#8212;*(NNS)], which is quite predictive but at the same time is not a standard English morphological rule.
    The ending-guessing rules, naturally, include some proper English suffixes but mostly they are simply highly predictive ending segments of words.
    Rules which have scored lower than the threshold are merged together into more general rules.
    These new rules, if they score above the threshold, can also be included in the working rule sets.
    We merge together two rules if they scored below the thre
