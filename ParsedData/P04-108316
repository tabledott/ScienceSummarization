    The Viterbi-derivation semiring would be the most often used with Translator CT in practice.
    Given a -PMTG, Translator CT can use this semiring to find the single most probable -dimensional multitree that covers the -dimensional input.
    The multitree inferred by the translator will have the words of both the input and the output components in its leaves.
    For example, given a suitable grammar and the input Pasudu moy, Translator CT could infer the multitree in Figure 2.
    The set of inferences would be exactly the same as those listed in Figure 4, except that the items would have no d-spans in the English component.
    In practice, we usually want the output as a string tuple, rather than as a multitree.
    Under the various derivation semirings (Goodman, 1999), TransIf we have no suitable PMTG, then we can use other criteria to search for trees that have high probability.
    We shall consider the common synchronization scenario where a lexicalized monolingual grammar is av
