olysemous word plant in a previously untagged corpus.
  
  
    In a large corpus, identify all examples of the given polysemous word, storing their contexts as lines in an initially untagged training set.
    For example: TIndeed, any supervised classification algorithm that returns probabilities with its classifications may potentially be used here.
    These include Bayesian classifiers (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964) and some implementations of neural nets, but not Brill rules (Brill, 1993).
    For each possible sense of the word, identify a relatively small number of training examples representative of that sense.'
    This could be accomplished by hand tagging a subset of the training sentences.
    However, I avoid this laborious procedure by identifying a small number of seed collocations representative of each sense and then tagging all training examples containing the seed collocates with the seed's sense label.
    The remainder of the examples (typically 85-98%) constitute an untagged residual.
