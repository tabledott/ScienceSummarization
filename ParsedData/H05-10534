ora for an all-words task would be prohibitive.
			We show that the sense distributions of words in this lexical sample differ depending on domain.
			We also showthat sense distributions are more skewed in domain specific text.
			Using McCarthy et al?s method, weautomatically acquire predominant sense informa tion for the lexical sample from the (raw) corpora, and evaluate the accuracy of this and predominant sense information derived from SemCor.
			We show that in our domains and for these words, first sense information automatically acquired from a general corpus is more accurate than first senses derived from SemCor.
			We also show that deriving first senseinformation from text in the same domain as the tar get data performs best, particularly when focusing on words which are salient to that domain.
			The paper is structured as follows.
			In section 2 we summarise McCarthy et al?s predominant sense method.
			We then (section 3) describe the new gold standard corpora, and evaluate predominant sense a
