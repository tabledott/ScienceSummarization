the context of a similar project.
    Their goal essentially was to see if an inductive logic program could infer the principles of Slovene morphology to the point where it could correctly predict the nominative singular form of a word if it were given an oblique (nonnominative) form.
    Their project apparently shares with the present one the requirement that the automatic learning algorithm be responsible for the decision as to which letters constitute the stem and which are part of the suffix(es), though the details offered by Dzeroski and Etjavec are sketchy as to how this is accomplished.
    In any event, they present their learning algorithm with a labeled pair of words&#8212;a base form and an inflected form.
    It is not clear from their description whether the base form that they supply is a surface form from a particular point in the inflectional paradigm (the nominative singular), or a more articulated underlying representation in a generative linguistic sense; the former appears to be their pol
