lgorithm (not necessarily with the parsing table construction algorithm).
    The LR paring algorithm is one of the most efficient parsing algorithms.
    It is totally deterministic, and no backtracking or search is involved.
    Unfortunately, we cannot directly adopt the LR parsing technique for natural languages, because it is applicable only to a small subset of context-free grammars called LR grammars, and it is almost certain that any practical natural language grammars are not LR.
    If a grammar is non-LR, its parsing table will have multiple entries;1 one or more of the action table entries will be multiply defined (Shieber 1983).
    Figures 2.1 and 2.2 show an example of a non-LR grammar and its parsing table.
    Grammar symbols starting with &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; represent pre-terminals.
    Entries &amp;quot;sh n&amp;quot; in the action table (the left part of the table) indicate the action &amp;quot;shift one word from input buffer onto the stack, and go to state n&amp;quot;.
