  This 1)aper proposes a method to solve this problem.
  We introduce tile representation, called .matching e,,z:pressio~z, which tel)resents the combination of fragments of translation ex- amples.
  The translation process consists of three steps: (.1) Make the source matching ex- pression from lhe source sentence.
  (2) TransDr the source matching expression into the target matching expression.
  (3) Construct the target sentence from the target matching expression.
  This mechanism generates some candidates of translation.
  To select, the best translation out of them, we define the score of a translation.
