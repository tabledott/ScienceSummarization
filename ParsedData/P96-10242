researchers use algorithms that maximize performance on the Labelled Tree Rate, even in domains where they are evaluating using other criteria.
    We propose that by creating algorithms that optimize the evaluation criterion, rather than some related criterion, improved performance can be achieved.
    In Section 2, we define most of the evaluation metrics used in this paper and discuss previous approaches.
    Then, in Section 3, we discuss the Labelled Recall Algorithm, a new algorithm that maximizes performance on the Labelled Recall Rate.
    In Section 4, we discuss another new algorithm, the Bracketed Recall Algorithm, that maximizes performance on the Bracketed Recall Rate (closely related to the Consistent Brackets Recall Rate).
    Finally, we give experimental results in Section 5 using these two algorithms in appropriate domains, and compare them to the Labelled Tree (Viterbi) Algorithm, showing that each algorithm generally works best when evaluated on the criterion that it optimizes.
