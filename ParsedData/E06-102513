inary classifier that labels terms as either Positive or Negative.
    A semisupervised method is a learning process whereby only a small subset L C Tr of the training data Tr are human-labelled.
    In origin the training data in U = Tr &#8722; L are instead unlabelled; it is the process itself that labels them, automatically, by using L (with the possible addition of other publicly available resources) as input.
    The method of (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) starts from two small seed (i.e. training) sets Lp and Ln of known Positive and Negative terms, respectively, and expands them into the two final training sets Trp D Lp and Trn D Ln by adding them new sets of terms Up and Un found by navigating the WordNet graph along the synonymy and antonymy relations3.
    This process is based on the hypothesis that synonymy and antonymy, in addition to defining a relation of meaning, also define a relation of orientation, i.e. that two synonyms typically have the same orientation and two antonyms typically have opp
