ition diagram with weights and symbols on the transitions, making some output sequences more likely than others.
    A WFST is a WFSA with a pair of symbols on each transition, one input and one output.
    Inputs and outputs may include the empty symbol c. Also following (Pereira and Riley, 1996), we have implemented a general composition algorithm for constructing an integrated model P(xlz) from models P(rly) and P(yjz), treating WFSAs as WFSTs with identical inputs and outputs.
    We use this to combine an observed katakana string with each of the models in turn.
    The result is a large WFSA containing all possible English translations.
    We use Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm (Dijkstra, 1959) to extract the most probable one.
    The approach is modular.
    We can test each engine independently and be confident that their results are combined correctly.
    We do no pruning, so the final WFSA contains every solution, however unlikely.
    The only approximation is the Viterbi one, which searches
