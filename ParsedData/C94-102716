malizing the resulting frequencies.
  Thereby, relative frequencies are obtained which sum to one.
  6 Rl,~suurs The 2-layer version of the Net-Tagger w,~s trained on a 2 million word subpart of the Pe.nn-Treebank corpus.
  Its performance was tested on a 100,000 word subpart which was not part of the training corlms.
  The set- tings of the network parameters were as follows: the number of preceding words in the context p w,~s 3, the number of following words f was 2 and the number of training cycles was 4 millions.
  The training of the tagger took one day on a Sparcl0 workstation and the tagging of 100,000 words took 12 minutes on the same machine.
  In tabh; 2, the accuracy rate of the Net-Tagger is cOrolLated to that of a trigram l)msed tagger (Kempe, 1993) and a lIidden Markov Model tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) which were.
  trained and tested on the same data.
  In order to determine the influence of tim size of the training sample, the taggers were also trained on corpora of different sizes and teste
