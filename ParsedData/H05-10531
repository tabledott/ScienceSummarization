D task this automatic method is best focussed on words that are salient to the domain, and on words with a different acquired predominant sense in that domain compared to that acquired from a balanced corpus.
	
	
			From analysis of manually sense tagged corpora, Kilgarriff (2004) has demonstrated that distributions of the senses of words are often highly skewed.
			Most researchers working on word sense disambiguation(WSD) use manually sense tagged data such as SemCor (Miller et al, 1993) to train statistical classi fiers, but also use the information in SemCor on theoverall sense distribution for each word as a back off model.
			In WSD, the heuristic of just choosing themost frequent sense of a word is very powerful, especially for words with highly skewed sense distri butions (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002).
			Indeed, only 5 out of the 26 systems in the recent SENSEVAL-3 English all words task (Snyder and Palmer, 2004)outperformed the heuristic of choosing the most fre quent sense as derived from SemCor (wh
