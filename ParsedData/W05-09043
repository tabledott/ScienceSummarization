o not take into account sentence-level information.
    For example, a sentence can achieve an excellent BLEU score without containing a verb.
    As MT systems improve, the shortcomings of n-gram based evaluation are becoming more apparent.
    State-of-the-art MT output often contains roughly the correct words and concepts, but does not form a coherent sentence.
    Often the intended meaning can be inferred; often it cannot.
    Evidence that we are reaching the limits of ngram based evaluation was provided by Charniak et al. (2003), who found that a syntax-based language model improved the fluency and semantic accuracy of their system, but lowered their BLEU score.
    With the progress of MT research in recent years, we are not satisfied with the getting correct words in the translations; we also expect them to be wellformed and more readable.
    This presents new challenges to MT evaluation.
    As discussed above, the existing word-based metrics can not give a clear evaluation for the hypothesis&#8217
