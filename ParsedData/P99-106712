e several, one for each position within the window.
    For example, if we have chosen the window size 2, we would compute a first co-occurrence vector for the case that word A is two words ahead of another word B, a second vector for the case that word A is one word ahead of word B, a third vector for A directly following B, and a fourth vector for A following two words after B.
    If we added up these four vectors, the result would be the co-occurrence vector as obtained when not taking word order into account.
    However, this is not what we do.
    Instead, we combine the four vectors of length n into a single vector of length 4n.
    Since preliminary experiments showed that a window size of 3 with consideration of word order seemed to give somewhat better results than other window types, the results reported here are based on vectors of this kind.
    However, the computational methods described below are in the same way applicable to window sizes of any length with or without consideration of word or
