set of entities and events &#8211; not restricted to a few types, as has been characteristic of most coreference data available until now &#8211; has been tagged with a high degree of consistency.
    Attributive coreference is tagged separately from the more common identity coreference.
    Two different types of coreference are distinguished in the OntoNotes data: Identical (IDENT), and Appositive (APPOS).
    Appositives are treated separately because they function as attributions, as described further below.
    The IDENT type is used for anaphoric coreference, meaning links between pronominal, nominal, and named mentions of specific referents.
    It does not include mentions of generic, underspecified, or abstract entities.
    Coreference is annotated for all specific entities and events.
    There is no limit on the semantic types of NP entities that can be considered for coreference, and in particular, coreference is not limited to ACE types.
    The mentions over which IDENT coreference applies are
