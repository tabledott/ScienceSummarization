 or not recommended.
    The algorithm takes a written review as input and produces a classification as output.
    The first step is to use a part-of-speech tagger to identify phrases in the input text that contain adjectives or adverbs (Brill, 1994).
    The second step is to estimate the semantic orientation of each extracted phrase (Hatzivassiloglou &amp; McKeown, 1997).
    A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., &#8220;romantic ambience&#8221;) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., &#8220;horrific events&#8221;).
    The third step is to assign the given review to a class, recommended or not recommended, based on the average semantic orientation of the phrases extracted from the review.
    If the average is positive, the prediction is that the review recommends the item it discusses.
    Otherwise, the prediction is that the item is not recommended.
    The PMI-IR algorithm is employed to estimate the semantic orientation of a
