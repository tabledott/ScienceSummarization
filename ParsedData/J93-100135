    These constraints are rarely discussed in computational linguistics because they are not captured very well with traditional NLP techniques, especially those based on the competence approximation.
    Of course, it isn't hard to build computational models that capture at least some of these preferences.
    Even the trigram model, despite all of its obvious shortcomings, does better than many traditional methods in this regard.
    The power of the trigram approximation is illustrated in Table 4 for the sentence fragment, We need to resolve all of the important issues.
