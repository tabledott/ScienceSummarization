    &#8226; It does seem that collecting information about an entity by merging information across the various attributes of the mentions that comprise it can be useful, though not all systems that attempted this achieved a benefit.
    &#8226; System performance did not seem to vary as much across the different genres as is normally the case with language processing tasks, which could suggest that coreference is relatively genre insensitive, or it is possible that scores are two low for the difference to be apparent.
    Comparisons are difficult, however, because the spoken genres were treated here with perfect speech recognition accuracy and perfect speaker turn information.
    Under more realistic application conditions, the spread in performance between genres might be greater.
