data, it also has some limitations.
    Finding appropriate videos is time-consuming and remains a bottleneck in the process.
    Also, more abstract actions such as reducing the deficit or fighting for justice cannot be easily captured by our method.
    One possible solution is to use longer video snippets or other visual stimuli such as graphs, schemas, or illustrated storybooks to convey more complicated information.
    However, the increased complexity is also likely to reduce the semantic closeness of the parallel descriptions.
    Another limitation is that sentences produced by our framework tend to be short and follow similar syntactic structures.
    Asking annotators to write multiple descriptions or longer descriptions would result in more varied data but at the cost of more noise in the alignments.
    Other than descriptions, we could also ask the annotators for more complicated responses such as &#8220;fill in the blanks&#8221; in a dialogue (e.g.
    &#8220;If you were this person in the vide
