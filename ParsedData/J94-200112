st sentences.
    We experimented with different values of N, for each of which we indicate the value of the interpolation coefficient and the number and percentage of correctly tagged words.
    Results are indicated in Table 1.
    As expected, as the size of the training increases, the interpolation coefficient increases and the quality of the tagging improves.
    When N = 0, the model is made up of uniform distributions.
    In this case, all alignments for a sentence are equally probable, so that the choice of the correct tag is just a choice at random.
    However, the percentage of correct tags is relatively high (more than three out of four) because: Note that this behavior is obviously very dependent on the system of tags that is used.
    It can be noted that reasonable results are obtained quite rapidly.
    Using 2,000 tagged sentences (less than 50,000 words), the tagging error rate is already less than 5%.
    Using 10 times as much data (20,000 tagged sentences) provides an improvement of only
