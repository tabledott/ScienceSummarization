iven a source string f fi...fj...fj, which is to be translated into a target string ef = ei...e,...el.
    Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability: The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.
    Pr(ef) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr(fillef) is the translation model.
    Many statistical translation models (Vogel et al., 1996; Tillmann et al., 1997; Niessen et al., 1998; Brown et al., 1993) try to model word-toword correspondences between source and target words.
    The model is often further restricted that each source word is assigned exactly one target word.
    These alignment models are similar to the concept of Hidden Markov models (HMM) in speech recognition.
    The alignment mapping is j &#8212;&gt; i = aj from source position j to target position i = a3.
    The use of this alignment model raises major problems as it fails to capture dependencies betwee
