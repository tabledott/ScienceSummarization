ly the sta tistical modeling approach of phrase-based models (in fact, phrase-based models are a special case of factored models).
			The main difference lies in thepreparation of the training data and the type of mod els learned from the data.
			5.1 Training.
			The training data (a parallel corpus) has to be anno tated with the additional factors.
			For instance, if we want to add part-of-speech information on the input and output side, we need to obtain part-of-speech tagged training data.
			Typically this involves runningautomatic tools on the corpus, since manually anno tated corpora are rare and expensive to produce.
			Next, we need to establish a word-alignmentfor all the sentences in the parallel training cor pus.
			Here, we use the same methodology as in phrase-based models (typically symmetrized GIZA++ alignments).
			The word alignment methods may operate on the surface forms of words, or on anyof the other factors.
			In fact, some preliminary ex periments have shown that word alignment based
