e corresponding Cb/Cf data in Table 7.
    Let us focus on the interpretation of utterance (2e) where the centering data diverges when one compares the basic and the BFP algorithms.
    After step 2 (filtering), the algorithm has produced two readings, which are rated by the corresponding transitions in step 3.
    Since SMOOTH-SHIFT is preferred over ROUGH-SHIFT, the pronoun he is resolved to MIKE, the highest-ranked element of Cf(2d).
    Also, Rule 1 would be violated in the rejected reading.
    The crucial point underlying functional centering is to relate the ranking of the forwardlooking centers and the information structure of the corresponding utterances.
    Hence, a proper correspondence relation between the basic centering data structures and the relevant functional notions has to be established and formally rephrased in terms of the centering model.
    In this section, we first discuss two studies in which the information structure of utterances is already integrated into the centering model (Ra
