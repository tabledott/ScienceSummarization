1972; Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) iteratively so as to approach a local maximum of the likelihood of a particular set of translations that we call the training data.
    When the likelihood of the training data has more than one local maximum, the one that we approach will depend on our initial guess.
    In Models 1 and 2, we first choose a length for the French string, assuming all reasonable lengths to be equally likely.
    Then, for each position in the French string, we decide how to connect it to the English string and what French word to place there.
    In Model 1 we assume all connections for each French position to be equally likely.
    Therefore, the order of the words in e and f does not affect Pr(fl e).
    In Model 2 we make the more realistic assumption that the probability of a connection depends on the positions it connects and on the lengths of the two strings.
    Therefore, for Model 2, Pr (f I e) does depend on the order of the words in e and f. Although it is possible to obtain in
