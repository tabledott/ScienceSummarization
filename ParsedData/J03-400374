 Earlier work that is of particular relevance considered the importance of relations between lexical heads for disambiguation in parsing.
    See Hindle and Rooth (1991) for one of the earliest pieces of research on this topic in the context of prepositional-phrase attachment ambiguity.
    For work that uses lexical relations for parse disambiguation&#8212; all with very promising results&#8212;see Sekine et al. (1992), Jones and Eisner (1992a, 1992b), and Alshawi and Carter (1994).
    Statistical models of lexicalized grammatical formalisms also lead to models with parameters corresponding to lexical dependencies.
    See Resnik (1992), Schabes (1992), and Schabes and Waters (1993) for work on stochastic tree-adjoining grammars.
    Joshi and Srinivas (1994) describe an alternative &#8220;supertagging&#8221; model for tree-adjoining grammars.
    See Alshawi (1996) for work on stochastic head-automata, and Lafferty, Sleator, and Temperley (1992) for a stochastic version of link grammar.
