ts (e.g.
    &#8220;company&#8221;), and a small set of seed extraction patterns (e.g.
    &#8220;has acquired&#8221;).
    In our approach, the type of supervision is different &#8211; we ask only for pairs of entities known to exhibit the target relation or not.
    Also, KNOWITALL requires large numbers of search engine queries in order to collect and validate extraction patterns, therefore experiments can take weeks to complete.
    Comparatively, the approach presented in this paper requires only a small number of queries: one query per relation pair, and one query for each relation argument.
    Craven and Kumlien (1999) create a noisy training set for the subcellular-localization relation by mining Medline for sentences that contain tuples extracted from relevant medical databases.
    To our knowledge, this is the first approach that is using a &#8220;weakly&#8221; labeled dataset for relation extraction.
    The resulting bags however are very dense in positive examples, and they are also many and sm
