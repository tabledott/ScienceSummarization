cations (Johnson, 2008).
    A collocation adaptor grammar generates a Sentence as a sequence of Collocations, each of which expands to a sequence of Words.
    Because Colloc is adapted, the collocation adaptor grammar learns Collocations as well as Words.
    (Presumably these approximate syntactic, semantic and pragmatic interword dependencies).
    Johnson reported that the collocation adaptor grammar segments as well as the Goldwater et al. bigram model, which we confirm here.
    Recently other researchers have emphasised the utility of phonotactic constraints (i.e., modeling the allowable phoneme sequences at word onsets and endings) for word segmentation (Blanchard and Heinz, 2008; Fleck, 2008).
    Johnson (2008) points out that adaptor grammars that model words as sequences of syllables can learn and exploit these constraints, significantly improving segmentation accuracy.
    Here we present an adaptor grammar that models collocations together with these phonotactic constraints.
    This grammar is
