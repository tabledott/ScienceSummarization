 although we had shown that two cue phrases appeared to pattern similarly in this respect, we had still not demonstrated that our model could be extended to cue phrases in general.
    To address this larger issue, we next conducted a single-speaker multi-cue phrase study.
  
  
    In this study, we examined all cue phrases consisting of a single lexical item that were produced by one speaker during 75 minutes, approximately 12,500 words, of recorded speech.
    Results of a pilot study of this corpus are reported in Litman and Hirschberg (1990).
    We limited ourselves here to the examination of single lexical items, since the hypothesis we had previously developed applies only to such items; e.g., it would be meaningless to ask whether a larger phrase bears a pitch accent or not.
    The corpus consisted of a keynote address given from notes by Ronald Brachman at the First International Conference on Expert Database Systems in 1986.
    This talk yielded 953 tokens, based upon a set of possible cue phrase
