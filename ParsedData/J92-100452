ng and test data for this task, we had a number of naive subjects use the system as if they were trying to obtain actual information.
    Their speech was recorded in a simulation mode in which the speech recognition component was excluded.
    Instead, an experimenter in a separate room typed in the utterances as spoken by the subject.
    Subsequent processing by the natural language and response generation components was done automatically by the computer (Zue et al. 1989).
    We were able to collect a total, of nearly 5000 utterances in this fashion.
    The speech material was then used to train the recognizer component, and the text material was used to train the natural language and back-end components.
    We designated a subset of 3312 sentences as the training set, and augmented the original rules so as to cover a number of sentences that appeared to stay within the domain of the back-end.
    We did not try to expand the rules to cover sentences that the back-end could not deal with, because we wa
