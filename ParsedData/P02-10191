t of a single insertion, deletion, substitution or transposition of letters.
    Many of the early algorithms for spelling correction are based on the assumption that the correct word differs from the misspelling by exactly one of these operations (M. D. Kernigan and Gale, 1990; Church and Gale, 1991; Mayes and F. Damerau, 1991).
    By estimating probabilities or weights for the different edit operations and conditioning on the left and right context for insertions and deletions and allowing multiple edit operations, high spelling correction accuracy has been achieved.
    At ACL 2000, Brill and Moore (2000) introduced a new error model, allowing generic string-to-string edits.
    This model reduced the error rate of the best previous model by nearly 50%.
    It proved advantageous to model substitutions of up to 5-letter sequences (e.g ent being mistyped as ant, ph as f, al as le, etc.)
    This model deals with phonetic errors significantly better than previous models since it allows a much larger context
