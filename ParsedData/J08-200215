e a tree-CRF model is limited in its ability to model dependencies among different arguments.
    For instance, the dependency between the meal and the children for the sentence in example (4) will not be captured because these phrases are not in the same local tree according to Penn Treebank syntax.
    There have been multiple approaches to reducing the sensitivity of semantic role labeling systems to syntactic parser error.
    Promising approaches have been to consider multiple syntactic analyses&#8212;the top k parses from a single or multiple full parsers (Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih 2005), or a shallow parse and a full parse (M`arquez et al. 2005; Pradhan et al.
    2005), or several types of full syntactic parses (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2005).
    Such techniques are important for achieving good performance: The top four systems in the CoNLL 2005 shared task competition all used multiple syntactic analyses (Carreras and M`arquez 2005).
    These previous methods develop special components to combine the l
