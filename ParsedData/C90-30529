terpreted as predicates) and inner types (which could be inter- preted as arguments): they are all typed FSs, and the same deduction mechanism applies for the top-level structure ~s well as for all substructures.
  A (typed) FS is consistent with respect to a set of type def- initions if it unifies with the definition of its type, and if each of its substructures i also consistent.
  Conditions like in the definition of append above in- troduce additional constraints which are erased after having been successfidly evaluated.
  When a type iv defined as a disjunction, a structure has to be consis- tent with at, least, one element of the disjunction (but all possibilities are explored, creating as many pos- sible solutions as there are disjuncts).
  When a type is defined as a conjunction (using the AND operator noted "A"), a structure has to be consistent with every single element of the conjunction.
  The order used for type checking (roughly top-down) guaran- tees that the solution the system finds is the GL
