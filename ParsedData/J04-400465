he number of times that the parser is able, while decoding Section 00, to deliver a requested probability for the modifier-word generation model using the increasingly less-specific contexts of the three back-off levels.
    The results are presented in Table 6.
    Back-off level 0 indicates the use of the full history context, which contains the head-child&#8217;s headword.
    Note that probabilities making use of this full context, that is, making use of bilexical dependencies, are available only 1.49% of the time.
    Combined with the results from the previous experiment, this suggests rather convincingly that such statistics are far less significant than once thought to the overall discriminative power of Collins&#8217; models, confirming Gildea&#8217;s result for Model 2.36 If not bilexical statistics, then surely, one might think, head-choice is critical to the performance of a head-driven lexicalized statistical parsing model.
    Partly to this end, in Chiang and Bikel (2002), we explored methods f
