 for error rate reporting.
    Not surprisingly, one can see that n-gram TM, which benefits from the joint source-channel model coupling both source and target contextual information into the model, is superior to NCM in all the test cases.
    The C2E back-transliteration is more challenging than E2C transliteration.
    Not many studies have been reported in this area.
    It is common that multiple English names are mapped into the same Chinese transliteration.
    In Table 1, we see only 28,632 unique Chinese transliterations exist for 37,694 English entries, meaning that some phonemic evidence is lost in the process of transliteration.
    To better understand the task, let&#8217;s compare the complexity of the two languages presented in the bilingual dictionary.
    Table 1 also shows that the 5,640 transliteration pairs are cross mappings between 3,683 English and 374 Chinese units.
    In order words, on average, for each English unit, we have 1.53 = 5,640/3,683 Chinese correspondences.
