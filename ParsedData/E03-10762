translation systems.
    For instance, phrase-based translation systems [Marcu and Wong, 2002] may recover more easily from splitting regimes that do not create a one-to-one translation correspondence.
    One splitting method may mistakenly break up the word Aktionsplan into the three words Akt, Ion, and Plan.
    But if we consistently break up the word Aktion into Akt and Ion in our training data, such a system will likely learn the translation of the word pair Akt Ion into the single English word action.
    These considerations lead us to three different objectives and therefore three different evaluation metrics for the task of compound splitting: For the first objective, we compare the output of our methods to a manually created gold standard.
    For the second and third, we provide differently prepared training corpora to statistical machine translation systems.
  
  
    While the linguistic properties of compounds are widely studied [Langer, 1998], there has been only limited work on empirical meth
