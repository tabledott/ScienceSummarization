 be extracted from the paraphrase corpus constructed by Cohn, Callison-Burch, and Lapata (2008). standard test sets and manual as well as automated metrics, the task of automated paraphrasing does not.
    An obvious reason for this disparity could be that paraphrasing is not an application in and of itself.
    However, the existence of similar evaluations for other tasks that are not applications, such as dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi 2006; Nivre et al. 2007) and word sense disambiguation (Senseval), suggests otherwise.
    We believe that the primary reason is that, over the years, paraphrasing has been employed in an extremely fragmented fashion.
    Paraphrase extraction and generation are used in different forms and with different names in the context of different applications (for example: synonymous collocation extraction, query expansion).
    This usage pattern does not allow researchers in one community to share the lessons learned with those from other communities.
    In fact, it may eve
