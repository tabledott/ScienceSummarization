;Collapsed PP&#8217;.
    Now there is no increase in performance compared to the unmodified Collins model; rather, a slight drop in LR and LP is observed.
    Table 5 also displays the results of our experiments with the sister-head model.
    For TnT tags, we observe that using sister-head dependencies for NPs leads to a small decrease in performance compared to the unmodified Collins model, resulting in 67.84% LR and 65.96% LP.
    Sister-head dependencies for PPs, however, increase performance substantially to 70.27% LR and 68.45% LP.
    The highest improvement is observed if head-sister dependencies are used for all categories; this results in 71.32% LR and 70.93% LP, which corresponds to an improvement of 3% in LP and 5% in LR compared to the unmodified Collins model.
    Performance with perfect tags is around 2&#8211;4% higher than with TnT tags.
    For perfect tags, sister-head dependencies lead to an improvement for NPs, PPs, and all categories.
    The third series of experiments was designed to
