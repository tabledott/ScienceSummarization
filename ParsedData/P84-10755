se of the term graph rather than tree.
    DAGs are notated either by drawing the graph structure itself, with the labels marking the arcs, or, as in this paper, by notating the sets of label/value pairs in square brackets, with the labels separated from their values by a colon; e.g., a DAG associated with the verb &amp;quot;knight&amp;quot; (as in &amp;quot;Ether wants to knight Arthur&amp;quot;) would appear (in at least one of our grammars) as whose value will be the category of the associated lexical entry.
    Other arcs may encode information about the syntactic features, translation, or syntactic subcategorization of the entry.
    But only the label cat has any special significance; it provides the link between context-free phrase structure rules and the DAGs, as explicated below.
    PATR-II grammars consist of rules with a context-free phrase structure portion and a set of unifications on the DAGs associated with the constituents that participate in the application of the rule.
