space by multiplying them by a matrix containing the first n right singular vectors as columns.
    Merging the items used to compute the SVD and those projected onto the resulting space, we obtain a 40,999&#215;300 matrix representing 8,043 nouns, 4,016 adjectives and 28,940 ANs.
    This reduced matrix constitutes a realistically sized semantic space, that also contains many items that are not part of our test set, but will be potential neighbors of the observed and predicted test ANs in the experiments to follow.
    The quality of the SVD reduction itself was independently validated on a standard similarity judgment data-set (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965), obtaining similar (and state-of-the-art-range) Pearson correlations of vector cosines and human judgments in both the original (r = .70) and reduced (r = .72) spaces.
    There are several parameters involved in constructing a semantic space (choice of full and reduced dimensions, co-occurrence span, weighting method).
    Since our current focus is
