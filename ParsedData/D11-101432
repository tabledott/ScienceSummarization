008) focuses on manually constructing several lexica and rules for both polar words and related content-word negators, such as &#8220;prevent cancer&#8221;, where prevent reverses the negative polarity of cancer.
    Like our approach they capture compositional semantics.
    However, our model does so without manually constructing any rules or lexica.
    Recently, (Velikovich et al., 2010) showed how to use a seed lexicon and a graph propagation framework to learn a larger sentiment lexicon that also includes polar multi-word phrases such as &#8220;once in a life time&#8221;.
    While our method can also learn multiword phrases it does not require a seed set or a large web graph.
    (Nakagawa et al., 2010) introduced an approach based on CRFs with hidden variables with very good performance.
    We compare to their stateof-the-art system.
    We outperform them on the standard corpora that we tested on without requiring external systems such as POS taggers, dependency parsers and sentiment lexica.
    Our
