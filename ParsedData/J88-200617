when one relation would be assumed and when the other.
    Partee (1973) also noted the similarities between tense and definite pronouns.
    However, she subsequently recognized that taking simple past tense as directly analogous with pronouns was incompatible with the usual forward movement of time in the interpretation in a sequence of sentences denoting events (Partee 1984).
    Her response was a modification of the claim that tense is anaphoric, saying: I still believe it is reasonable to characterize tense as anaphoric, or more broadly as context-dependent, but I would no longer suggest that this requires them to be viewed as 'referring' to times as pronouns 'refer' to entities, or to treat times as arguments of predicates (256).
    The particular context-dependent process she proposes for interpreting tensed clauses follows that of Hinrichs 1986, briefly described below.
    The examples presented above to illustrate the anaphoric quality of tense were all simple past.
    However, as Leech notes (se
