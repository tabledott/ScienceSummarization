   Our intention was to see whether the distinctions proposed by Hawkins and Prince would result in a better agreement among annotators than the taxonomy used in our first experiment, i.e., whether the subjects would be more in agreement about the semantic relation between a definite description and its antecedent than they were about the relation between the head noun of the definite description and the head noun of its antecedent.
    The larger situation/unfamiliar class we had in the first experiment was split back into two classes, as in Hawkins's and Prince's schemes.
    We did this to see whether indeed these two classes were difficult to distinguish; we also wanted to get a clearer idea of the relative importance of the two kinds of definites that we had grouped together in the first annotation.
    The two classes were called Larger situation and Unfamiliar.
    We used three subjects for Experiment 2.
    Our subjects were English native speakers, graduate students of mathematics, geography, and me
