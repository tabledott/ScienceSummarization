  I I , I 2 3 4 R ink Figure 5: Tile percentage of sentences correctly seg- mented and tagged.
  Figure 5 shows tile percentage of sentences (not words) correctly segmented and tagged.
  For open texts, the sentence accuracy of the raw part of speech trigram without word model is 62.7% for the top candidate and 70.4% for the top-5, while that of smoothed trigram with word model is 66.9% for the top and 80.3% for the top-5.
  We can see that, by smoothing tile part ofsllecch trigram and by adding word model to handle unknown words, the accuracy and robustness of the morpholog- ical analyzer is significantly improved.
  Ilowever, tile sentence accuracy for closed texts is still significantly better that that for ol)en texts.
  It is clear that more research as to be done
