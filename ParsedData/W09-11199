 design decisions in an NER system.
  
  
    In this section we compare the performance of several inference (decoding) algorithms: greedy leftto-right decoding, Viterbi and beamsearch.
    It may appear that beamsearch or Viterbi will perform much better than naive greedy left-to-right decoding, which can be seen as beamsearch of size one.
    The Viterbi algorithm has the limitation that it does not allow incorporating some of the non-local features which will be discussed later, therefore, we cannot use it in our end system.
    However, it has the appealing quality of finding the most likely assignment to a second-order model, and since the baseline features only have second order dependencies, we have tested it on the baseline configuration.
    Table 1 compares between the greedy decoding, beamsearch with varying beam size, and Viterbi, both for the system with baseline features and for the end system (to be presented later).
    Surprisingly, the greedy policy performs well, this phenmenon was also ob
