= 0): we use a PAS with no arguments, i.e. all its slots are filled with null labels.
    Let r be the PAS root; since r is not a preterminal, step 3 is selected and &#916; is recursively applied to all r&#8217;s children, i.e. the slot nodes.
    For the latter, step 0 assigns &#916;(cjr, cjr) = 0.
    As a result, i TK functions can be applied to sentence parse trees, therefore their usefulness for text processing applications, e.g. question classification, is evident.
    On the contrary, the SSTK applied to one PAS extracted from a text fragment may not be meaningful since its representation needs to take into account all the PASs that it contains.
    We address such problem by defining a kernel on multiple PASs.
    Let Pt and Pty be the sets of PASs extracted from the text fragment t and t'.
    We define: While during the experiments (Sect.
    4) the Kall kernel is used to handle predicate argument structures, TK (Eq.
    1) is used to process parse trees and the linear kernel to handle POS and BOW f
