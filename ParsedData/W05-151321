ormed poorly in terms of accuracy and speed.
  
  
    We have presented a simple shift-reduce parser that uses a classifier to determine its parsing actions and runs in linear time.
    Using SVMs for classification, the parser has labeled constituent precision and recall higher than 87% when using the correct part-of-speech tags, and slightly higher than 86% when using automatically assigned partof-speech tags.
    Although its accuracy is not as high as those of state-of-the-art statistical parsers, our classifier-based parser is considerably faster than several well-known parsers that employ search or dynamic programming approaches.
    At the same time, it is significantly more accurate than previously proposed deterministic parsers for constituent structures.
    We have also shown that much of the success of a classifier-based parser depends on what classifier is used.
    While this may seem obvious, the differences observed here are much greater than what would be expected from looking, for example,
