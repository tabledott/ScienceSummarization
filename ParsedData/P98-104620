    Planar doesn't take a direct object in Portuguese, and it shows the induced action alternation the same way as flutuar (by using the light verb fazer).
    Derivar is usually said as &amp;quot;estar a deriva&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;to be adrift&amp;quot;), showing its non-controllable action more explicitly.
  
  
    We have presented a refinement of Levin classes, intersective classes, and discussed the potential for mapping them to WordNet senses.
    Whereas each WordNet synset is hierarchicalized according to only one aspect (e.g., Result, in the case of cut), Levin recognizes that verbs in a class may share many different semantic features, without designating one as primary.
    Intersective Levin sets partition these classes according to more coherent subsets of features (force, force+motion, force+ separation), in effect highlighting a lattice of semantic features that determine the sense of a verb.
    Given the incompleteness of the list of members of Levin classes, each verb mus
