), so an alignment union would probably be chosen.
    In lexicography applications, we might be interested in alignments with a very high precision obtained by performing an alignment intersection.
  
  
    In the following, we present an annotation scheme for single-word-based alignments and a corresponding evaluation criterion.
    It is well known that manually performing a word alignment is a complicated and ambiguous task (Melamed 1998).
    Therefore, in performing the alignments for the research presented here, we use an annotation scheme that explicitly allows for ambiguous alignments.
    The persons conducting the annotation are asked to specify alignments of two different kinds: an S (sure) alignment, for alignments that are unambiguous, and a P (possible) alignment, for ambiguous alignments.
    The P label is used especially to align words within idiomatic expressions and free translations and missing function words (S &#8838; P).
    The reference alignment thus obtained may contain many-to-on
