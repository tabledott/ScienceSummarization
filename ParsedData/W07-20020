	SemEval-2007 Task 02: Evaluating Word Sense Induction and Discrimination Systems
		The goal of this task is to allow for comparison across sense-induction and discrim ination systems, and also to compare thesesystems to other supervised and knowledgebased systems.
		In total there were 6 participating systems.
		We reused the SemEval 2007 English lexical sample subtask of task17, and set up both clustering-style unsuper vised evaluation (using OntoNotes senses as gold-standard) and a supervised evaluation (using the part of the dataset for mapping).
		We provide a comparison to the results ofthe systems participating in the lexical sam ple subtask of task 17.
	
	
			Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a key enabling-technology.
			Supervised WSD techniques are the best performing in public evaluations, butneed large amounts of hand-tagging data.
			Exist ing hand-annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al, 1993), which is annotated with WordNetsenses (Fellbaum, 1998) allow for a small improve ment over the
