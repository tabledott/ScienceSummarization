    The transformation-based tagger captures linguistic information in a small number of simple nonstochastic rules, as opposed to large numbers of lexical and contextual probabilities.
    This learning approach has also been applied to a number of other tasks, including prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation (Brill and Resnik 1994), bracketing text (Brill 1993a) and labeling nonterminal nodes (Brill 1993c).
    Recently, we have begun to explore the possibility of extending these techniques to other problems, including learning pronunciation networks for speech recognition and learning mappings between syntactic and semantic representations.
