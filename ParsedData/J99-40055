the same thing.
    Once the s(f le) table has been learned, there is a similar 0(mv2) algorithm for optimal decoding.
    Such methods can break English letter-substitution ciphers of moderate size.
    Given coded text f of length m, a plaintext vocabulary of v tokens, and a source model b: A naive application of the EM algorithm to break a substitution cipher.
    It runs in 0(men) time.
  
  
    In our discussion of substitution ciphers, we were on relatively sure ground&#8212;the channel model we assumed in decoding is actually the same one used by the cipher writer for encoding.
    That is, we know that plaintext is converted to ciphertext, letter by letter, according to some table.
    We have no such clear conception about how English gets converted to French, although many theories exist.
    Brown et al. (1993) recently cast some simple theories into a source-channel framework, using the bilingual Canadian parliament proceedings as training data.
    We may assume: Bilingual texts seem to exhibit
