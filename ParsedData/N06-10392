re-defined relations (Riloff, 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Sudo et al., 2003).
    Unrestricted Relation Discovery is a technique to automatically discover such relations that repeatedly appear in a corpus and present them as a table, with absolutely no human intervention.
    Unlike most existing IE research, a user does not specify the type of articles or information wanted.
    Instead, a system tries to find all the kinds of relations that are reported multiple times and can be reported in tabular form.
    This technique will open up the possibility of trying new IE scenarios.
    Furthermore, the system itself can be used as an IE system, since an obtained relation is already presented as a table.
    If this system works to a certain extent, tuning an IE system becomes a search problem: all the tables are already built &#8220;preemptively.&#8221; A user only needs to search for a relevant table.
    We implemented a preliminary system for this technique and obtained reason
