ber of paths in which this word appears at least twice (CT, i.e. number of erroneous repetitions).
    We define the repetition ratio to be CT/C, which is the proportion of &#8220;bad&#8221; paths in this FSA according to this word.
    If we compute this ratio for all the words in the lists of the first 499 groups2 and the corresponding FSAs produced by an instantiation of the MSA algorithm3, the average repetition ratio is 0.0304992 (14.76% of the words have a non-zero repetition ratio, and the average ratio for these words is 0.206671).
    In comparison, the average repetition ratio for our algorithm is 0.0035074 (2.16% of the words have a non-zero repetition ratio4, and the average ratio for these words is 0.162309).
    The presence of different constituent orderings does pose a more serious problem to the MSA algorithm.
    Recently, Papineni et al. (2002) have proposed an automatic MT system evaluation technique (the BLEU score).
    Given an MT system output and a set of reference translations, one c
