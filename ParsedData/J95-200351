 Sidner's theory, each utterance provides an immediate discourse focus, an actor focus, and a set of potential foci.
    The discourse and actor foci may coincide, but need not.
    Her potential foci are roughly analogous to our Cf.
    The Cb for an utterance sometimes coincides with her actor focus and sometimes with her discourse focus.
    She distinguishes these two to handle various cases of multiple pronouns.
    However, as we have shown, utterances do not have multiple Cbs.
    Furthermore, utterances can have more than two pronouns, so merely adding a second kind of immediate focus is of limited use.
    The difference between these two theories can be seen from the following example (from Sidner [19791): On Sidner's account, Carl is the actor focus after (34b) and Jeff is the discourse focus.
    Because the actor focus is preferred as the referent of pronominal expressions, Carl is the leading candidate for the entity referred to by he in (34c).
    It is difficult to rule this, case out without
