e three annotators for the three classes is K = 0.57; if we count them as bridges, K = 0.63; if we just discard those cases, K = 0.63 again.
    (By comparison, the agreement among annotators on the three classes was K = 0.68 overall and K = 0.70 on just the cases that the system was able to classify.)
    As mentioned above, the cases that the system can't handle are mainly discourse-new descriptions (see Figure 7).
    6.5.1 Inducing a Decision Tree.
    The decision tree discussed in Section 6.1 was derived manually, by trial and error.
    We also tried to derive the order of application of the heuristics automatically.
    To do this, we used a modified version of the system to assign Boolean feature values to each definite description in the training corpus (i.e., the system checked if the features applied to a definite description instance or not).
    The following features were used: This list of features, together with the classification assigned to each description in the standard annotation (DDUse
