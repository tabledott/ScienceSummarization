e.
    Dyer (2007) uses confusion networks to encode morphological alternatives in Czech-English translation, and Xu et al. (2005) takes an approach very similar to ours for Chinese-English translation and encodes multiple word segmentations in a lattice, but which is decoded with a conventionally trained translation model and without a sophisticated reordering model.
    The Arabic-English morphological segmentation lattices are similar in spirit to backoff translation models (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006), which consider alternative morphological segmentations and simplifications of a surface token when the surface token can not be translated.
    Parsing and formal language theory.
    There has been considerable work on parsing word lattices, much of it for language modeling applications in speech recognition (Ney, 1991; Cheppalier and Rajman, 1998).
    Additionally, Grune and Jacobs (2008) refines an algorithm originally due to Bar-Hillel for intersecting an arbitrary FSA (of which word lattices are a subse
