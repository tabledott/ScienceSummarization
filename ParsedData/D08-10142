    Second, assuming the availability of a tool for automatic subjectivity analysis in English, can we generate a corpus annotated for subjectivity in the target language by using automatic subjectivity annotations of English text and machine translation?
    Finally, third, can these automatically generated resources be used to effectively train tools for subjectivity analysis in the target language?
    Since our methods are particularly useful for languages with only a few electronic tools and resources, we chose to conduct our initial experiments on Romanian, a language with limited text processing resources developed to date.
    Furthermore, to validate our results, we carried a second set of experiments on Spanish.
    Note however that our methods do not make use of
