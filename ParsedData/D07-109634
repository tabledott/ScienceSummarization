nerally very few significant differences among the five or six best sys tems, regardless of whether we consider labeled or unlabeled attachment score.
			For the closed class of the domain adaptation track, we see a very similar pattern, with the top system (Sagae) being followed very closely by two other systems.
			For the open class, the results are more spread out, but then thereare very few results in this class.
			It is also worth not ing that the top scores in the closed class, somewhat unexpectedly, are higher than the top scores in the 4http://nextens.uvt.nl/depparse-wiki/AllScores open class.
			But before we proceed to a more detailed analysis of the results (section 6), we will make an attempt to characterize the approaches represented by the different systems.
	
	
			In this section we give an overview of the models, inference methods, and learning methods used in theparticipating systems.
			For obvious reasons the dis cussion is limited to systems that are described bya paper in the proceeding
