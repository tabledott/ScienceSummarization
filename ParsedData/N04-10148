the usual way.
    For example, the tree t = S(NP, VP(V, NP)) has labelandrankt((2)) = (VP, 2) and labelandrankt((2, 1)) = (V, 0).
    Fort &#8712; T&#931;, u &#8712; E, u(t) is the tree whose root has label u and whose single child is t. The yield of X in t is yieldt(X), the string formed by reading out the leaves labeled with X in left-to-right order.
    The usual case (the yield oft) is yieldt &#8801; yieldt(E).
  
  
    In this section, we describe the regular tree grammar, a common way of compactly representing a potentially infinite set of trees (similar to the role played by the finitestate acceptor FSA for strings).
    We describe the version (equivalent to TSG (Schabes,1990)) where the generated trees are given weights, as are strings in a WFSA.
    A weighted regular tree grammar (wRTG) G is a quadruple (E, N, S, P), where E is the alphabet, N is the finite set of nonterminals, S &#8712; N is the start (or initial) nonterminal, and P &#8838; N &#215;T&#931;(N)&#215;R+ is the finite set of weighte
