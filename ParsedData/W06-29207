  The training data derived from the original treebanks (see Section 4) and given to the shared task participants was in a simple column-based format that is an extension of Joakim Nivre&#8217;s Malt-TAB format4 for the shared task and was chosen for its processing simplicity.
    All the sentences are in one text file and they are separated by a blank line after each sentence.
    A sentence consists of one or more tokens.
    Each token is represented on one line, consisting of 10 fields.
    Fields are separated from each other by a TAB.5 The 10 fields are: resulting from the PHEAD column is guaranteed to be projective (but is not available for all data sets), whereas the structure resulting from the HEAD column will be non-projective for some sentences of some languages (but is always available).
    As should be obvious from the description above, our format assumes that each token has exactly one head.
    Some dependency grammars, and also some treebanks, allow tokens to have more than one head, althou
