e more than others.
    It also illustrates that some features contribute more to precision, others more to recall.
    For example, aligned modifiers contribute primarily to precision, whereas our learned features and our apposition features contribute to recall.
    This information can be useful when designing a coreference system in an application where recall is more important than precision, or vice versa.
    We examine the effect of some important features, selecting those that provide a substantial improvement in precision, recall, or both.
    For each such feature we examine the rate of coreference amongst mention pairs for which the feature is active, compared with the overall rate of coreference.
    We also show examples on which the coreference systems differ depending on the presence or absence of a feature.
    Apposition This feature checks whether two mentions are separated by only a comma, and it increases B-Cubed F-Score by about one percentage point.
    We hypothesize that proper names
