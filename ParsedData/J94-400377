us is a result of manual translation, and it is the translator who provides tagging of senses as a side effect of the translation process.
    Practically, whenever a bilingual corpus is available, it provides a useful source of a sense tagged corpus.
    Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992a) have also exploited this resource for achieving large amounts of testing and training materials.
    7.2.5 A Bilingual Lexicon and a Monolingual Corpus.
    The method of the current paper also exploits the fact that different senses of a word are usually mapped to different words in another language.
    However, our work shows that the differences between languages enable us to avoid any form of manual tagging of the corpus (including translation).
    This is achieved by a bilingual lexicon that maps a source language word to all its possible equivalents in the target language.
    This approach has practical advantages for the purpose of machine translation, in which a bilingual lexicon needs to be constructed in any ca
