ll discuss prior work in this area (Section 2), the nature of the MDL model we propose (Section 3), heuristics for the task of the initial splitting of words into stem and affix (Section 4), the resulting signatures (Section 5), use of MDL to search the space of morphologies (Section 6), results (Section 7), the identification of entirely spurious generalizations (section 8), the grouping of signatures into larger units (Section 9), and directions for further improvements (Section 10).
    Finally, I will offer some speculative observations about the larger perspective that this work suggests and work in progress (Section 11).
    The task of automatic word analysis has intrigued workers in a range of disciplines, and the practical and theoretical goals that have driven them have varied considerably.
    Some, like Zellig Harris (and the present writer), view the task as an essential one in defining the nature of the linguistic analysis.
    But workers in the area of data compression, dictionary construction
