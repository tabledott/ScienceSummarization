at the tagging results.
    Most importantly for this paper, the details give a better feel for the differences between the base taggers and for how well a combiner can exploit these differences.
    More generally, users of taggers or tagged corpora are rarely interested in the whole corpus.
    They focus rather on specific words or word classes, for which the accuracy of tagging may differ greatly from the overall accuracy.
    We start our detailed examination with the words that are most often mistagged.
    We use the LOB corpus for this evaluation, as it is the cleanest data set and hence the best example.
    For each base tagger, and for WPDV(Tags+Context), we list the top seven mistagged words, in terms of absolute numbers of errors, in Table 7.
    Although the base taggers have been shown (in Section 4.2) to produce different errors, we see that they do tend to make errors on the same words, as the five top-sevens together contain only nine words.
    A high number of errors for a word is due to a
