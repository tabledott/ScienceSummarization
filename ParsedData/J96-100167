are high, the actual number of candidate translations will be close to the lower bound.
    On the other hand, low values for the ri's (i.e., a low threshold Td) will result in the actual number of candidate translations being close to the upper bound.
    To estimate the average number of candidate translations examined, we make the simplifying assumption that the decisions to reject each candidate translation with i words are made independently with constant probability ri.
    Under these assumptions, the probability of generating a particular candidate translation with i words is the same for all translations with length i; the same applies to the probability Ai that a translation with i words is included in the set of translations of length i that will generate the candidate translations of length i + 1.
    Clearly, A1 =- yi = = 1 and Ai = rai for i &gt; 2.
    For a particular translation with i &gt; 3 words to be generated, at least one of its i subsets with i &#8212; 1 words must have survived the th
