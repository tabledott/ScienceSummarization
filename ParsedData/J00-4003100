 important aspects.
    First of all, these systems have to parse the texts, which often introduces errors; furthermore, these systems often cannot get complete parses for the sentences they are processing.
    Secondly, the evaluation in MUC-6 considers the coreferential chain as a whole, and not only one correct antecedent.
    The third difference is that these systems process a wider range of referring expressions, including pronouns and bare nouns, while our system only processes definite NPs.
    On the other hand, not all definite descriptions are marked in the ML1C-6 coreference task: these systems are only required to identify identity relations, and only if the antecedent was introduced by a noun phrase (not if it was a clause or a conjoined NP).
    This leaves out discoursenew descriptions and, especially, bridging descriptions, which, as we have seen, are by far the most difficult cases.
    Kameyarna (1997) analyzes in detail the coreference module of the SRI system that participated in MUC-6 (A
