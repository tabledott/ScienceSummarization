 for any unificationbased grammar.
    In particular, declaring certain category-valued features so that they cannot take variable values may lead to nontermination in the backbone construction for some grammars.
    However, it should be possible to restrict the set of features that are considered in category-valued features in an analogous way to Shieber's (1985) restrictors for Earley's (1970) algorithm, so that a parse table can still be constructed.
    Ted Briscoe and John Carroll Generalized Probabilistic LR Parsing The backbone grammar generated from the ANLT grammar is large: it contains almost 500 distinct categories and more than 1600 productions.
    When we construct the LALR(1) parse table, we therefore require an algorithm with practical time and space requirements.
    In the LR parsing literature there are essentially two approaches to constructing LALR(1) parse tables.
    One approach is graph-based (DeRemer and Pennello 1982), transforming the parse table construction problem to a set of w
