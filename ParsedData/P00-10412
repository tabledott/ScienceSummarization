  This paper describes an alternative approach to summarization capable of generating summaries shorter than a sentence, some examples of which are given in Figure 1.
    It does so by building statistical models for content selection and surface realization.
    This paper reviews the framework, discusses some of the pros and cons of this approach using examples from our corpus of news wire stories, and presents an initial evaluation.
  
  
    Most previous work on summarization focused on extractive methods, investigating issues such as cue phrases (Luhn, 1958), positional indicators (Edmundson, 1964), lexical occurrence statistics (Mathis et al., 1973), probabilistic measures for token salience (Salton et al., 1997), and the use of implicit discourse structure (Marcu, 1997).
    Work on combining an information extraction phase followed by generation has also been reported: for instance, the FRUMP system (DeJong, 1982) used templates for both information extraction and presentation.
