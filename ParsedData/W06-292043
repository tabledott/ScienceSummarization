patterns of &#8220;easy&#8221; and &#8220;difficult&#8221; parts-ofspeech, at least in so far as tag sets are comparable across treebanks.
    The one PoS that everybody got 100% correct are the German infinitival markers (tag PTKZU; like &#8220;to&#8221; in English).
    Accuracy on the Swedish equivalent (IM) is not far off at 98%.
    Other easy PoS are articles, with accuracies in the nineties for German, Dutch, Swedish, Portuguese and Spanish.
    As several participants have remarked in their papers, prepositions are much more difficult, with typical accuracies in the fifties or sixties.
    Similarly, conjunctions typically score low, with accuracies even in the forties for Arabic and Dutch.
  
  
    There are many directions for interesting research building on the work done in this shared task.
    One is the question which factors make data sets &#8220;easy&#8221; or difficult.
    Another is finding out how much of parsing performance depends on annotations such as the lemma and morphological feat
