ces for which neither judge is unsure is very high: 0.86.
    A different breakdown of the sentences is illuminating.
    For 98 of the sentences (call them SS), judges 1 and 2 tag the sentence as subjective.
    Among the other sentences, 20 appear in a block of contiguous system-identified sentences that includes a member of SS.
    For example, in Table 12, (2.a) and (2.c) are in SS and (2.b) is in the same block of subjective sentences as they are.
    Similarly, (3.a) is in SS and (3.b) is in the same block.
    Among the remaining 15 sentences, 6 are adjacent to subjective sentences that were not identified by our system (so were not annotated by the judges).
    All of those sentences contain significant expressions of subjectivity of the writer or someone mentioned in the text, the criterion used in this work for classifying a sentence as subjective.
    Samples are shown in Table 14.
    Thus, 93% of the sentences identified by the system are subjective or are near subjective sentences.
