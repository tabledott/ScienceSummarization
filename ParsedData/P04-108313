e whether a translation of the input exists.
    Under an inside-probability semiring, Translator CT can compute the total probability of all multitrees containing the input and its translations in the output components.
    All these derivation trees, along with their probabilities, can be efficiently represented as a packed parse forest, rooted at the goal item.
    Unfortunately, finding the most probable output string still requires summing probabilities over an exponential number of trees.
    This problem was shown to be NP-hard in the one-dimensional case (Sima&#8217;an, 1996).
    We have no reason to believe that it is any easier when each internal node of the tree.
    The intended ordering of the terminals in each output dimension can be assembled from these templates by a linear-time linearization post-process that traverses the finished multitree in postorder.
    To the best of our knowledge, Logic CT is the first published translation logic to be compatible with all of the semirings catalogued
