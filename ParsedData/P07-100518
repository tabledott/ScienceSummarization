Koehn et al. (2003).
    Based on these alignments, synchronous CFG rules are then extracted from the corpus.
    While Hiero is extracting grammar rules, we gathered WSD training data by following the procedure described in section 4.
    Using the MT 2002 test set, we ran the minimumerror rate training (MERT) (Och, 2003) with the decoder to tune the weights for each feature.
    The weights obtained are shown in the row Hiero of Table 2.
    Using these weights, we run Hiero&#8217;s decoder to perform the actual translation of the MT 2003 test sentences and obtained a BLEU score of 29.73, as shown in the row Hiero of Table 1.
    This is higher than the score of 28.77 reported in (Chiang, 2005), perhaps due to differences in word segmentation, etc.
    Note that comparing with the MT systems used in (Carpuat and Wu, 2005) and (Cabezas and Resnik, 2005), the Hiero system we are using represents a much stronger baseline MT system upon which the WSD system must improve.
    We then added the WSD features of Se
