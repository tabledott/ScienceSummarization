ables 6 and 7.
    In both cases the classification appears to be right in the optimal range.
    In fact, the estimated error rate for infinitives produces a better classification than any of those shown in Table 7.
    (It falls at a value between those shown.)
    The classification of clauses and infinitives remains in the optimal range when the probability threshold is varied from .01 to .05.
    Overall the tradeoff between improved precision and reduced recall seems quite good, as compared to doing no noise reduction (p_s --= 0).
    The only possible exception is the NP frame, where noise reduction causes 59 false negatives in exchange for preventing only 5 false positives.
    This is partly explained by the different prior probabilities of the different frames.
    Most verbs can take a direct object argument, whereas most verbs cannot take a direct object argument followed by a tensed clause argument.
    There is no way to know this in advance.
    There may be other factors as well.
    If the er
