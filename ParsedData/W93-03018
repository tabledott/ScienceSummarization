hese constraints will be exploited in Model 2.
    Brown et al. estimate t(fle) on the basis of a training set, a set of English and French sentences that have been aligned at the sentence level.
    Those values of t(fle) that maximize the probability of the training set are called the maximum likelihood estimates.
    Brown et a/. show that the maximum likelihood estimates satisfy It follows from the definition of Model 1 that the probability of a connection satisfies: Recall that h refers to the French word in position j of the French sentence f of length m, and that ei refers to the English word in position i of the English sentence e of length I.
    Also, remember that position 0 is reserved for the null word.
    Equations 3 and 4 are used iteratively to estimate t(f le).
    That is, we start with an initial guess for (f le).
    We then evaluation the right hand side of equation 4, and compute the probability of the connections in the training set.
    Then we evaluate equation 3, obtain new estimate
