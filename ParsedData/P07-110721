 the ACE ENGLISH-NWIRE training data, which is from a different corpora than the MUC-6 test set and from a different time period.
    This model gave 70.3 F1 and is labeled +ENGLISHNWIRE in table 2(a).
    Our results on this test set are surprisingly comparable to, though slightly lower than, some recent supervised systems.
    McCallum and Wellner (2004) report 73.4 F1 on the formal MUC-6 test set, which is reasonably close to our best MUC-6 number of 70.3 F1.
    McCallum and Wellner (2004) also report a much lower 91.6 F1 on only proper nouns mentions.
    Our system achieves a 89.8 F1 when evaluation is restricted to only proper mentions.11 The et al. (2004).
    A mention is proper if it is annotated with NER information.
    It is a pronoun if the head is on the list of English pronouns.
    Otherwise, it is a nominal mention.
    Note we do not use the NER information for any purpose but determining whether the mention is proper.
