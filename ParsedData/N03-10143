performance of a non-lexicalized parser on the Penn Treebank.
    When a relatively small vocabulary of words is used, performance is only marginally below the best current parser accuracy.
    If either the biases are reduced or the induced history representations are replaced with hand-crafted features, performance degrades.
  
  
    The parsing system we propose consists of two components, one which estimates the parameters of a probability model for phrase structure trees, and one which searches for the most probable phrase structure tree given these parameters.
    The probability model we use is generative and history-based.
    At each step, the model&#8217;s stochastic process generates a characteristic of the tree or a word of the sentence.
    This sequence of decisions is the derivation of the tree, which we will denote .
    Because there is a one-to-one mapping from phrase structure trees to our derivations, we can use the chain rule for conditional probabilities to derive the probability of a t
