of the hyponym and see if its environment tends to be similar to one of the senses of its hypernym.
  For example, if the hypernym is "bank" and the hyponym is "First National", ev- ery time, within a sample of text, the term "First National" occurs, replace it with "bank", and then run the disambiguation algorithm as usual.
  If this term can be positively classified as having one sense of bank over the others, then this would provide strong evidence as to which sense of the hypernym to link the hypouym to.
  This idea is purely speculative; we have not yet tested it.
  The second main problem with inserting new rela- tions arises when one or both terms do not occur in the hierarchy at all.
  In this case, we have to deter- mine which, if any, existing synset the term belongs in and then do the sense determination mentioned above.
  4 Conc lus ions We have described a low-cost approach for automatic acquisition of semantic lexical relations from uure- stricted text.
  This method is meant to provide an incre
