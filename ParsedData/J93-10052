m for building computational models capable of resolving such ambiguities in unrestricted text.
    There have been several structure-based proposals about ambiguity resolution in the literature; they are particularly attractive because they are simple and don't demand calculations in the semantic or discourse domains.
    The two main ones are as follows.
    For the particular case we are concerned with, attachment of a prepositional phrase in a verb + object context as in Example 1, these two principles&#8212;at least given the version of syntax that Frazier assumes&#8212;make opposite predictions: Right Association predicts noun attachment, while Minimal Attachment predicts verb attachment.
    Psycholinguistic work on structure-based strategies is primarily concerned with modeling the time course of parsing and disambiguation, and acknowledges that other information enters into determining a final parse.
    Still, one can ask what information is relevant to determining a final parse, and it seems that i
