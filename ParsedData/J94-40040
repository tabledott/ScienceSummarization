  Machine Translation Divergences: A Formal Description and Proposed Solution Bonnie J. Dorr* University of Maryland There are many cases in which the natural translation of one language into another esults in a very different form than that of the original.
  The existence of translation divergences (i.e., cross- linguistic distinctions) makes the straightforward transfer from source structures into target structures impractical.
  Many existing translation systems have mechanisms for handling diver- gent structures but do not provide a general procedure that takes advantage of the systematic relation between lexical-semantic structure and syntactic structure.
  This paper demonstrates that a systematic solution to the divergence problem can be derived from the formalization of two types of information: (1) the linguistically grounded classes upon which lexical-semantic divergences are based; and (2) the techniques by which lexical-semantic divergences are resolved.
  This formalization is advantageous in t
