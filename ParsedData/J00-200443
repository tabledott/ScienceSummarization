  Therefore, Pr(linkslmodel), as given in Equation 29, has only one global maximum in the region of interest, where 1 &gt; A+ &gt; )&gt; A- &gt; 0. and let N be the total number of word token pair co-occurrences: Equating the right-hand sides of Equations 31 and 34 and rearranging the terms, we get: In the preceding equations, either u or v can be NULL.
    However, the number of times that a word co-occurs with NULL is not an observable feature of bitexts.
    To make sense of co-occurrences with NULL, we can view co-occurrences as potential links and cooc(u, v) as the maximum number of times that tokens of u and v might be linked.
    From this point of view, cooc(u, NULL) should be set to the unigram frequency of u, since each token of u represents one potential link to NULL.
    Similarly for cooc( NULL, v).
    These co-occurrence counts should be summed together with all the others in Equation 33.
    The probability function expressed by Equations 29 and 30 may have many local maxima.
    In practice,
