 in OUT, u(s|t) is a prior distribution, and y is a prior weight.
    The original OUT counts co(s, t) are weighted by a logistic function w&#955;(s, t): To motivate weighting joint OUT counts as in (6), we begin with the &#8220;ideal&#8221; objective for setting multinomial phrase probabilities 0 = {p(s|t), dst}, which is the likelihood with respect to the true IN distribution pi(s, t).
    Jiang and Zhai (2007) suggest the following derivation, making use of the true OUT distribution po(s, t): where each fi(s, t) is a feature intended to charac- !0&#710; = argmax pf(s, t) log p&#952;(s|t) (8) terize the usefulness of (s, t), weighted by Ai. &#952; s,t pf(s, t)po(s, t) log p&#952;(s|t) The mixing parameters and feature weights (col- != argmax po (s, t) lectively 0) are optimized simultaneously using dev- &#952; s,t pf(s, t)co(s, t) log p&#952;(s|t), set maximum likelihood as before: !&#65533;argmax po (s, t) ! &#952; s,t &#65533;&#710; = argmax &#732;p(s, t) log p(s|t; 0).
