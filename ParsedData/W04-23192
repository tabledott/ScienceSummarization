    In this paper, we provide a first description of the meeting recorder dialog act (MRDA) corpus, a companion set of annotations that augment the word transcriptions with discourse-level segmentations, dialog act (DA) information, and adjacency pair information.
    The corpus is currently available online for research purposes [16], and we plan a future release through the LDC.
    The ICSI Meeting Corpus data is described in detail in [9].
    It consists of 75 meetings, each roughly an hour in length.
    There are 53 unique speakers in the corpus, and an average of about 6 speakers per meeting.
    Reflecting the makeup of the Institute, there are more male than female speakers (40 and 13, respectively).
    There are a28 native English speakers, although many of the nonnative English speakers are quite fluent.
    Of the 75 meetings, 29 are meetings of the ICSI meeting recorder project itself, 23 are meetings of a research group focused on robustness in automatic speech rec
