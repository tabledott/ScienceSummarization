y point in the discourse, some entities are considered more salient than others, and consequently are expected to exhibit different properties.
    In Centering Theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995; Walker, Joshi, and Prince 1998; Strube and Hahn 1999; Poesio et al. 2004), salience concerns how entities are realized in an utterance (e.g., whether they are they pronominalized or not).
