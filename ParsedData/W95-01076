 all the possible chunk tags for each word combined with hand-built constraint grammar patterns.
    These patterns eliminate impossible readings to identify a somewhat idiosyncratic kind of target noun group that does not include initial determiners but does include postmodifying prepositional phrases (including determiners).
    Voutilainen claims recall rates of 98.5% or better with precision of 95% or better.
    However, the sample NPtool analysis given in the appendix of (Voutilainen, 1993), appears to be less accurate than claimed in general, with 5 apparent mistakes (and one unresolved ambiguity) out of the 32 NP chunks in that sample, as listed in Table 1.
    These putative errors, combined with the claimed high performance, suggest that NPtool's definition of NP chunk is also tuned for extracting terminological phrases, and thus excludes many kinds of NP premodifiers, again simplifying the chunking task.
