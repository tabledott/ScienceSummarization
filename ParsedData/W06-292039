r&#8221; data sets offer large to middle-sized training sets.
    The most difficult data set is clearly the Turkish one.
    It is rather small, and in contrast to Arabic and Slovene, which are equally small or smaller, it covers 8 genres, which results in a high percentage of new FORM and LEMMA values in the test set.
    It is also possible that parsers get confused by the high proportion (one third!)
    of non-scoring tokens al. (2006)&#8217;s top score is more than 3% absolute above the second highest score and they offer no clear explanation for their success. and the many tokens with &#8216; &#8217; as either the FORM or LEMMA.
    There is a clear need for further research to check whether other representations result in better performance.
    The second-most difficult data set is Arabic.
    It is quite small and has by far the longest parsing units.
    The third-most difficult data set is Slovene.
    It has the smallest training set.
    However, its average as well as top score far exceed those
