est set accuracy using the transformation-based algorithm described in this paper gives an accuracy of 96.0% when trained on 350,000 words.
    Excluding punctuation, this accuracy is 95.6%.
    Note that since the Baum-Welch algorithm frequently overtrains, a tagged text would be necessary to figure out what training iteration gives peak performance.
    We have explored a method of training a transformation-based tagger when no information is known other than a list of possible tags for each word.
    Next we explore weakly supervised learning, where a small amount of human intervention is permitted.
    With Markov-model based taggers, there have been two different methods proposed for adding knowledge to a tagger trained using the Baum-Welch algorithm.
    One method is to manually alter the tagging model, based on human error analysis.
    This method is employed in [Kupiec, 1992; Cutting et al., 1992].
    Another approach is to obtain the initial probabilities for the model directly from a manually tag
