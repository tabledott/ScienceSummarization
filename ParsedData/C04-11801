nk, but without traces and co indexation.
			However, the usefulness of this outputis limited, since the underlying meaning (as repre sented in a predicate-argument structure or logical form) is difficult to reconstruct from such skeletal parse trees.In this paper we demonstrate how a widecoverage statistical parser using Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) can be used to generate semantic representations.
			There are a number of ad vantages to using CCG for this task.
			First, CCG provides ?surface compositional?
			analysis of certainsyntactic phenomena such as coordination and ex traction, allowing the logical form to be obtained for such cases in a straightforward way.
			Second, CCG isa lexicalised grammar, and only uses a small num ber of semantically transparent combinatory rules tocombine CCG categories.
			Hence providing a compositional semantics for CCG simply amounts to assigning semantic representations to the lexical en tries and interpreting the combinatory rules.
