using training data manually annotated at the expression level for subjective elements and then tested on data annotated at the document level for opinion pieces.
    All of the selected parameters led to increases in precision on the test data, and most lead to increases over 100%.
    Once again we found consistency between expression-level and document-level annotations.
    PSE sets defined by density have high precision in both the subjective-element data and the opinion piece data.
    The large differences between training and testing suggest that our results are not brittle.
    Using a density feature selected from a training set, sentences containing highdensity PSEs were extracted from a separate test set, and manually annotated by two judges.
    Fully 93% of the sentences extracted were found to be subjective or to be near subjective sentences.
    Admittedly, the chosen density feature is a high-precision, lowfrequency one.
    But since the process is fully automatic, the feature could be appli
