e more likely the boundary occurs at that location, modulo adjustments as necessary to place the boundaries at orthographically marked paragraphs (if available).
    A proviso check is made to prevent assignment of very close adjacent segment boundaries.
    Currently, at least three intervening token-sequences are required between boundaries.
    This helps control for the fact that many texts have spurious header information and single-sentence paragraphs.
    An alternative to this method of computing depth scores is to use the slope of the valley's sides, or the &amp;quot;sharpness&amp;quot; of the vocabulary change.
    However, because deeper valleys with smaller slopes indicate larger, although more gradual, shifts in vocabulary usage than shallower valleys with larger slopes, they are preferable for detecting subtopic boundaries.
    Furthermore, steep slopes can sometimes indicate a spurious change associated with a very short digression.
    The depth score is more robust for the purposes of subtopi
