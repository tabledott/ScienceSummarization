ese out simplifies other componentsof the algorithm); traces (translates traces and coin dexation in trees into corresponding reentrancies in f-structure ( 1 in Figure 3)); catch all and clean-up.

			L/R Context ? Coordination ? Traces ? Catch-All Figure 2: Annotation AlgorithmThe f-structure annotations are passed to a con straint solver to produce f-structures.
			Annotationis evaluated in terms of coverage and quality, sum marised in Table 1.
			Coverage is near complete with 99.82% of the 48K Penn-II sentences receiving a single, connected f-structure.
			Annotation quality is measured in terms of precision and recall (P&amp;R) against the DCU 105.
			The algorithm achieves an F-score of 96.57% for full f-structures and 94.3% for preds-only f-structures.4 S S-TPC- 1 NP U.N. VP V signs NP treaty NP Det the N headline VP V said S T- 1 ? ?
