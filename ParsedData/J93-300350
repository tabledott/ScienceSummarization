sagreed, 13 (81.3%) were conjunctions.
    The fact that conjunctions account for a large number of the ambiguities we found in the corpus and the disagreements we had about classification is not surprising when we note that the discourse meanings of conjunction as described in the literature (see Table 14) seem to be quite similar to the meanings of sentential conjunction.

    Here, while the first and seems intuitively sentential, the second is much more problematic.
    But instead actually we are bringing some thoughts on expert databases from a place that is even stranger and further away and that of course is the magical world of artificial intelligence.
    However, wh
