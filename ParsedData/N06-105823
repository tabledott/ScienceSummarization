he same time, the filtering erroneously eliminates 27 positive examples (21%).
    Even at this level of false negatives, the filtering has an overall positive effect.
  
  
    This paper presents a comprehensive study of the impact of paraphrases on the accuracy of automatic evaluation.
    We found a strong connection between the quality of automatic paraphrases as judged by humans and their contribution to automatic evaluation.
    These results have two important implications: (1) refining standard measures such as BLEU with paraphrase information moves the automatic evaluation closer to human evaluation and (2) applying paraphrases to MT evaluation provides a task-based assessment for paraphrasing accuracy.
    We also introduce a novel paraphrasing method based on contextual substitution.
    By posing the paraphrasing problem as a discriminative task, we can incorporate a wide range of features that improve the paraphrasing accuracy.
    Our experiments show improvement of the accuracy of WordNet para
