vidual tagger that can be corrected by combination (Err).
    *c5.0 was not able to cope with the large amount of data involved in all Tags+Word experiments and the Tags+Context experiment with Wotan.
    In Table 6 the results of our experiments with the various combination methods are shown.
    Again we list both the accuracies of the combiners (&amp;quot;Yo) and the error reduction in relation to the best base tagger (AE&#8222;).
    For example, on LOB, TagPair produces 2,321 errors (corresponding to an accuracy of 97.98%), which is 17.8% less than HMM's 2,824 errors.
    Although the combiners generally fall short of the &amp;quot;All ties correct&amp;quot; level (cf.
    Table 5), even the most trivial voting system (Majority), significantly outperforms the best individual tagger on all data sets.
    Within the simple voting systems, it appears that use of more detailed voting weights does not necessarily lead to better results.
    TagPrecision is clearly inferior to TotPrecision.
