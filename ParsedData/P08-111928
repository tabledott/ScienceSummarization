p is expensive, however, because it exhaustively applies the pattern to the web until no more extractions are found.
    In our evaluation, we ran this process on a single PC and it usually finished overnight, and we were able to learn a substantial number of new class instances.
    If more hyponym patterns are used, then this could get considerably more expensive, but the process could be easily parallelized to perform queries across a cluster of machines.
    With access to a cluster of ordinary PCs, this technique could be used to automatically create extremely large, high-quality semantic lexicons, for virtually any categories, without external training resources.
