 how Miyao and Tsujii&#8217;s feature forest approach can be applied to a particular grammar formalism, namely CCG.
    As Chiang (2003) points out, Miyao and Tsujii do not provide a way of constructing a feature forest given a sentence, but provide the mathematical tools for estimation once the feature forest has been constructed.
    In our packed charts, entries are equivalent when they have the same category type, identical head, and identical unfilled dependencies.
    The equivalence test must account for heads and unfilled dependencies because equivalent entries form the same dependencies in any subsequent parsing.
    Individual entries in the chart are obtained by combining canonical representatives of equivalence classes, using the rules of the grammar.
    Equivalence classes in the chart are sets of equivalent individual entries.
    A feature forest &#934; is defined as a tuple (C, D, R,&#947;, &#948;) where: The interpretation of a packed chart as a feature forest is straightforward.
