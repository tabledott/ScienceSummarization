if i E Xj, xji = 0 otherwise.
    The dot product of x1 and x2 is given by x1 &#183; x2 = |X1 n X2|.
    Kd(x, y) = Kd(X, Y ) = (1 + |X n Y |)d, (3) where d = 1, 2,3, ....
    In this paper, (3) will be referred to as an implicit form of the Polynomial Kernel.
    It is known in NLP that a combination of features, a subset of feature set F in general, contributes to overall accuracy.
    In previous research, feature combination has been selected manually.
    The use of a polynomial kernel allows such feature expansion without loss of generality or an increase in computational costs, since the Polynomial Kernel of degree d implicitly maps the original feature space F into Fd space.
    (i.e., 0 : F &#8212;* Fd).
    This property is critical and some reports say that, in NLP, the polynomial kernel outperforms the simple linear kernel (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002).
    Here, we will give an explicit form of the Polynomial Kernel to show the mapping function 0(&#183;).
