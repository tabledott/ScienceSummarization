 as well as the cognitive correlates of the attentional state as modeled in this paper.
    Second, although each focus space contains a DSP, the focus structure does not include the intentional structure as a whole.
    Figure 1 illustrates how the focusing structure, in addition to modeling attentional state, serves during processing to coordinate the linguistic and intentional structures.
    The discourse segments (to the left of the figure) are tied to focus spaces (drawn vertically down the middle of the figure).
    The focusing structure is a stack.
    Information in lower spaces is usually accessible from higher ones (but less so than the information in the higher spaces); we use a line with intersecting hash marks to denote when this is not the case.
    Subscripted terms are used to indicate the relevant contents of the focus spaces because the spaces contain representations of entities (i.e., objects, properties, and relations) and not linguistic expressions.
    Part one of Figure 1 shows the st
