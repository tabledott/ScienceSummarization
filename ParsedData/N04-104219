  Comparing the rows, one can see that the second-order model performs the best, but not dramatically better than the firstorder+transitions and the third order model.
    However, the first-order model performs significantly worse.
    The difference does not come from sharing the weights, but from ignoring the f(yt&#8722;1i yt).
    The first order transition feature is vital here.
    We would expect the third order model to perform better if enough training data were available.
    Comparing the second and the third columns, we can see that using all features including unsupported features, consistently performs better than ignoring them.
    Our preliminary experiments with incremental support have shown performance in between that of supported-only and all features, and are still ongoing.
    Effects of layout features To analyze the contribution of different kinds of features, we divide the features into three categories: local features, layout features, and external lexicon resources.
    The features
