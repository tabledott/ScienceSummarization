ubtree can always be rebalanced at its root if either of its children is a singleton of either language.
    Let x be an Li-singleton, y be an L2-singleton, and A, B, C be arbitrary terminal or nonterminal symbols.
    Then the following properties hold for the [ ] and () operators, where the relation means that the same two output strings are generated, and the matching of the symbols is preserved: The method of Figure 8 modifies the input tree to attach singletons as closely as possible to couples, but remaining consistent with the input tree in the following sense: singletons cannot &amp;quot;escape&amp;quot; their immediately surrounding brackets.
    The key is that for any given subtree, if the outermost bracket involves a singleton that should be rotated into a subtree, then exactly one of the singleton rotation properties will apply.
    The method proceeds depth-first, sinking each singleton as deeply as possible.
    Alternative ITG parse trees for the same matching.
    For example, after rebalanci
