e the ensembles, it directly handles non-local output features by optimizing a single global objective.
    Perhaps more importantly, it makes it possible to exploit expert knowledge through the form of hard global constraints.
    Although not pursued here, the same kind of constraints employed by Riedel and Clarke (2006) can straightforwardly fit into our model, after extending it to perform labeled dependency parsing.
    We believe that a careful design of fea13Unlike our model, the hybrid models used here as baselines make use of the dependency labels at training time; indeed, the transition-based parser is trained to predict a labeled dependency parse tree, and the graph-based parser use these predicted labels as input features.
    Our model ignores this information at training time; therefore, this comparison is slightly unfair to us.
