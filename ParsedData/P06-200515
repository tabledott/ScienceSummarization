fferent from that of normalization given in equation (7) in that, here we have an aligned input sentence pair, s and .
    The alignment process is just to find the alignment segmentation between the two sentences that maximizes the joint probability.
    Therefore, in step (2) of the EM algorithm given at Figure 1, only the joint probabilities P(s&#65533;k, e&#65533;k ) are involved and updated.
    Since EM may fall into local optimization, in order to speed up convergence and find a nearly global optimization, a string matching technique is exploited at the initialization step to identify the most probable normalization pairs.
    The orthographic similarities captured by edit distance and a SMS lingo dictionary3 which contains the commonly used short-forms are first used to establish phrase mapping boundary candidates.
    Heuristics are then exploited to match tokens within the pairs of boundary candidates by trying to combine consecutive tokens within the boundary candidates if the numbers of tokens do
