compared the number of edges needed to find the first parse for averagelength sentences.
    The average length of a sentence in our test data is about 22 words.
    Figure 13 shows the percentage of sentences of length 18 through 26 for which a parse could be found within 2,500 edges.
    For this experiment, we used a separate test set from the Wall Street Journal corpus, containing approximately 570 sentences in the desired length range.
    This measure also shows a real advantage of the boundary trigram estimate over the trigram estimate.
  
  
    Table 4 summarizes the results obtained for each figure of merit.
    To verify that our results are not an artifact of the particular grammar we chose for testing, we also tested using a treebank grammar introduced in Charniak (1996).
    This % of the 18- to 26-word sentences finding a parse in a fixed number of edges. grammar was trained in a straightforward way by reading the grammar directly (with minor modifications) from a portion of the Penn Treebank W
