el et al., 1996).
    By rewriting the translation probability using word classes, we obtain (corresponding to Eq.
    (1)): (8) The variables F and E denote special classes in and E. We use relative frequencies to estimate p(FIE) and p(fIF): The function nt(FIE) counts how often the words in class F are aligned to words in class E. If we insert these relative frequencies into Eq.
    (8) and apply the same transformations as in the monolingual case we obtain a similar optimization criterion for the translation probability part of Eq.
    (6).
    Thus the full optimization criterion for bilingual word classes is: The two count functions n(E1E) and nt(FIE) can be combined into one count function ng (X1Y) n(X1Y) + nt (X1Y) as for all words f and all words e and e' holds n(f le) = 0 and nt(ele1) = 0.
    Using the function n9 we arrive at the following optimization criterion: Here we defined ng,i (X) = Ex, ng (XIX') and n9,2(X) = Ex, n9(X11X).
    The variable X runs over the classes in &#163; and F. In the opt
