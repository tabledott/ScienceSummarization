f the measures.
    Spearman&#8217;s Correlation Coefficient (Spearman, 1904) is used to assess the equivalence of two rankings.
    If the two rankings are exactly the same, the Spearman&#8217;s correlation coefficient between these two rankings is 1.
    A completely reversed ranking gets a value of &#8722;1.
    The value is 0 when there is no relation between the rankings.
    We determine the correlation coefficient of the ranking of each measure with that of the human relatedness.
    We use the relatedness scores from both the human studies &#8211; the Miller and Charles study as well as the Rubenstein and Goodenough research.
    Table 1 summarizes the results of our experiment.
    We observe that the Gloss Vector has the highest correlation with humans in both cases.
    Note that in our experiments with the Gloss Vector measure, we have used not only the gloss of the concept but augmented that with the gloss of all the concepts directly related to it according to WordNet.
    We observed a signific
