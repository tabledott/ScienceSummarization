ing is resolving syntactic variations of the same meaning, we also compare with RESOLVER (Yates and Etzioni, 2009), a state-of-the-art unsupervised system based on TextRunner for jointly resolving entities and relations, and DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001), which resolves paraphrases of binary relations.
    Finally, we also compared to an informed baseline based on keyword matching.
    Keyword: We consider a baseline system based on keyword matching.
    The question substring containing the verb and the available argument is directly matched with the input text, ignoring case and morphology.
    We consider two ways to derive the answer given a match.
    The first one (KW) simply returns the rest of sentence on the other side of the verb.
    The second one (KW-SYN) is informed by syntax: the answer is extracted from the subject or object of the verb, depending on the question.
    If the verb does not contain the expected argument, the sentence is ignored.
    TextRunner: TextRunner inputs text and outputs r
