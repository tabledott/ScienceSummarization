h methods.
    But an alternative approach that explicitly incorporates information about item similarities together with label similarity information (for instance, &#8220;one star&#8221; is closer to &#8220;two stars&#8221; than to &#8220;four stars&#8221;) is to think of the task as one of metric labeling (Kleinberg and Tardos, 2002), where label relations are encoded via a distance metric.
    This observation yields a meta-algorithm, applicable to both semi-supervised (via graph-theoretic techniques) and supervised settings, that alters a given -ary classifier&#8217;s output so that similar items tend to be assigned similar labels.
    In what follows, we first demonstrate that humans can discern relatively small differences in (hidden) evaluation scores, indicating that rating inference is indeed a meaningful task.
    We then present three types of algorithms &#8212; one-vs-all, regression, and metric labeling &#8212; that can be distinguished by how explicitly they attempt to leverage similarity betwe
