 derived from the input documents and knowledge acquired from a large text corpus.
    Generation is performed by reusing and altering phrases from input sentences.
    As the evaluation described in Section 4 shows, our method accurately identifies common information and in most cases generates a well-formed fusion sentence.
    Our algorithm outperforms the shortest-sentence baseline in terms of content selection, without a significant drop in grammaticality.
    We also show that augmenting the fusion process with paraphrasing knowledge improves the output by both measures.
    However, there is still a gap between the performance of our system and human performance.
    An important goal for future work on sentence fusion is to increase the flexibility of content selection and realization.
    We believe that the process of aligning theme sentences can be greatly improved by having the system learn the similarity function, instead of using manually assigned weights.
    An interesting question is how such
