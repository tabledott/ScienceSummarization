d this distortion limit value for all test-set experiments presented in this paper.
			Our main results for Chinese-English are shownin Table 3.
			It appears that hierarchical models provide significant gains over all non-hierarchical models.
			Improvements on MT06 and MT05 are very sig nificant (p ? .01).
			In the case of MT08, significant improvement is reached through the combination ofboth phrase-based and hierarchical models.
			We of ten observe substantial gains when we combine such models, presumably because we get the benefit of identifying both local and long-distance swaps.
			Since most orientations in the phrase-based model are discontinuous, it is reasonable to ask whether8Note that we ran MERT separately for each distinct distor tion limit.
