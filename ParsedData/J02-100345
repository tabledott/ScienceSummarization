it operates on unlimited cases&#8221; (Barton, Berwick, and Ristad 1987, Section 1.4.1).
    Be this as it may, we believe that complexity theory can offer valuable insights into the structure of GRE algorithms and that the growing attention to complexity in this area is a healthy development even if the practical implications are not always straightforward.
    Recent work also highlights an interesting mirror image of GRE complexity: a logically superfluous property may make it easier for the reader to find the referent. van Deemter Generating Referring Expressions An interesting class of cases is explored in Paraboni (2000), which focuses on descriptions of document parts.
    Consider the description the medicine depicted in Section 2.3.
    If Section 2 happens to contain only one figure, then the description the medicine depicted in Section 2 would have been logically sufficient, but this description would have made it necessary for the reader, in the worst case, to search through all of Section 2, maki
