oth models essentially learn a scoring function s : X &#8212;* R, where the domain X is different for the two models.
    For the graph-based model, X is the set of possible dependency arcs (i, j, l); for the transition-based model, X is the set of possible configuration-transition pairs (c, t).
    But in both cases, the input is represented by a k-dimensional feature vector f : X &#8212;* Rk.
    In the feature-based integration we simply extend the feature vector for one model, called the base model, with a certain number of features generated by the other model, which we call the guide model in this context.
    The additional features will be referred to as guide features, and the version of the base model trained with the extended feature vector will be called the guided model.
    The idea is that the guided model should be able to learn in which situations to trust the guide features, in order to exploit the complementary strength of the guide model, so that performance can be improved with respect to
