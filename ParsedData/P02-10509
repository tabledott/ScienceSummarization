; many-to-one if wjE, wnE E E are all uniquely aligned to WF E F, then delete all alignments between wiE (1 &lt; i &lt; n) and WF except for the head (denoted as whE ); moreover, if wiE , a modifier of .tchE, had its own modifiers, R(tviE, wjE) R(tch, wJF).
    The many-to-many case is decomposed into a two-step process: first perform one-to-many, then perform many-to-one.
    In the cases of unaligned Chinese words, they are left out of the projected syntactic tree.
    The asymmetry in the treatment of one-to-many and many-to-one and of the unaligned words for the two languages arises from the asymmetric nature of the projection.
    The corpus for this experiment was constructed by obtaining manual English translations for 124 Chinese newswire sentences (with 40 words or less) contained in sections 001-015 of the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xia et al., 2000).
    The Chinese data in our set ranged from simple sentences to some complicated constructions such as complex relative clauses, multiple run-on clauses,
