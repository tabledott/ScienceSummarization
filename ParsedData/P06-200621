d over the counts for the five fully specified modifier relations listed immediately after it in Table 1.
    This allows comparison of overall accuracy on modifiers with, for instance overall accuracy on arguments.
    Figures in italics to the right are discussed in the next section.
    Kaplan et al.&#8217;s microaveraged scores for Collins&#8217; Model 3 and the cut-down and complete versions of the XLE parser are given in Table 2, along with the microaveraged scores for our parser from Table 1.
    Our system&#8217;s accuracy results (evaluated on the reannotated DepBank) are better than those for Collins and the cut-down XLE, and very similar overall to the complete XLE (evaluated on DepBank).
    Speed of processing is also very competitive.5 These results demonstrate that a statistical parser with roughly state-of-the-art accuracy can be constructed without the need for large in-domain treebanks.
    However, the performance of the system, as measured by microraveraged F1-score on GR extraction alone,
