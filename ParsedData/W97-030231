these is essentially beam thresholding for each rule P R if nonterminal L in left cell if nonterminal R in right cell add P to parent cell; Algorithm One for each nonterminal L in left cell for each&#8226;nonterminal R in right cell for each rule P L R add P to parent cell; without a prior.
    In the second technique, there is a constant probability threshold.
    Any nodes with a probability below this threshold are pruned.
    If the parse fails, parsing is restarted with the constant lowered.
    We attempted to duplicate this technique, but achieved only negligible performance improvements.
    Collins (personal communication) reports a 38% speedup when this technique is combined with loose beam thresholding, compared to loose beam thresholding alone.
    Perhaps our lack of success is due to differences between our grammars, which are fairly different formalisms.
    When Collins began using a formalism somewhat closer to ours, he needed to change his beam thresholding to take into account the prior, so
