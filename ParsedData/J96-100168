    With our assumptions, we have From this recurrence equation and the boundary conditions given above we can compute the values of and A, for all i.
    Then the expected (average) number of candidate translations with i &gt; 3 words examined by Champollion will be and the sum of these terms for i = 3 to m, plus the terms Q and (?
    ), gives the total complexity of our algorithm.
    In Table 6 we show the number of candidate translations examined by the exhaustive algorithm and the corresponding best-, worst-, and average-case behavior of Champollion for several values of Q and m, using empirical estimates of the ri's.
    We showed above that filtering is necessary to bring the number of proposed translations down to manageable levels.
    For any corpus of reasonable size, we can find cases where a valid translation is missed because a part of it does not pass the threshold.
    Let N be the size of the corpus in terms of matched sentences.
    Separate the N sentences into eight categories, d
