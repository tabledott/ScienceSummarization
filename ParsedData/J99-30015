red by different types of referring expressions, given a particular attentional state of the hearer in a discourse setting (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995, 204-205).
    The claim is made then that the lower the inference load put on the hearer, the more coherent the underlying discourse appears.
    The centering model as formulated by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) refines the structure of &amp;quot;centers&amp;quot; of discourse, which are conceived as the representational device for the attentional state at the local level of discourse.
    They distinguish two basic types of centers, which can be assigned to each utterance U,&#8212;a single backwardlooking center, Cb(U,), and a partially ordered set of discourse entities, the forwardlooking centers, Cf(U,).
    The ordering on Cf is relevant for determining the Cb.
    It can be viewed as a salience ranking that reflects the assumption that the higher the ranking of a discourse entity in Cf, the more likely it will be mentioned again in the immedia
