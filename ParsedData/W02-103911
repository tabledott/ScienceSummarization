ts show a significantly larger number of head crossings than modifier crossings.
    One possibility is that this is due to most phrases having a head and modifier pair to test, while many do not have multiple modifiers and therefore there are fewer opportunities for modifier crossings.
    Thus, it is informative to examine how many potential crossings actually turn out to be crossings.
    Table 2 provides this result in the form of the percentage of crossing tests which result in detection of a crossing.
    To calculate this, we kept totals for the number of head ( ) and modifier ( ) crossing tests performed as well as the number of phrasal translations detected ( ).
    Note that when the phrasal translation filter is turned on, these totals differ for each of the different alignment types (S, S P, and P).
    The percentages are calculated after summing over all sentencesin the corpus: There are still many more crossings in the S P and P alignments than in the S alignments.
    The S alignment has 1.58%
