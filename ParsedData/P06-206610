ee of a dependency graph G, gd(G), is the maximum among the gap degrees of its nodes.
    Thus, the gap degree of the graphs in Figure 3 is 0, 1 and 2, respectively, since the node i has the maximum gap degree in all three cases.
    The well-nestedness constraint restricts the positioning of disjoint subtrees in a dependency forest.
    Two subtrees are called disjoint, if neither of their roots dominates the other.
    Definition 8 Two subtrees T1, T2 interleave, if there are nodes l1, r1 E T1 and l2, r2 E T2 such that l1 &lt; l2 &lt; r1 &lt; r2.
    A dependency graph is well-nested, if no two of its disjoint subtrees interleave.
    Both Graph 3a and Graph 3b are well-nested.
    Graph 3c is not well-nested.
    To see this, let T1 be the subtree rooted at the node labelled i, and let T2 be the subtree rooted at j.
    These subtrees interleave, as T1 contains the nodes 2 and 4, and T2 contains the nodes 3 and 5.
    The notion of edge degree was introduced by Nivre (2006) in order to allow mildly non-pro
