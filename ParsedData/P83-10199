hat should be removed.
    A first guess suggests that this must be a non-deterministic problem, requiring complex reasoning about what the speaker meant to say.
    Labov claimed that a simple set of rules operating on the surface string would specify exactly what should be changed, transforming nearly all non-fluent strings into fully grammatical sentences.
    The specific set of transformational rules Labov proposed were not formally adequate, in part because they were surface transformations which ignored syntactic constituenthood.
    But his work forms the basis of this current analysis.

    Labov's claim was not of course that ungrammatical sentences are never produced in speech, for that clearly would be false.
    Rather, it seems that truly ungrammatical productions represent only a tiny fraction of the spoken output, and in th
