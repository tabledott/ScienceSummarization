    The system lacks the information that the &lt;ANSWER&gt; tag should be replaced exactly by one word.
    Simple extensions could be made to the system so that instead of searching in the range of 50 bytes for the answer phrase it could search for the answer in the range of 1&#8211;2 chunks (basic phrases in English such as simple NP, VP, PP, etc.).

    It cannot work for types of question that require multiple words from the question to be in the answer sentence, possibly apart from each other.
