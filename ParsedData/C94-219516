			Accuracy improved to 75.8% r using the larger training set, still significantly lower than accuracy obtained us-- lag tam tl:ansformal;ion-based approach.
			The t.ech- nique described in (Res93b, 1{1t93), which com- bined Hindle and Rooth's lexical association tech- nique with a WordNet-based conceptual associa- tion measure, resulted in an accuracy of 76.0%, also lower than the results obtained using trans- formations.
			Since llindle and Rooth's approach does not make reference to n2, we re-ran the transformation-learner disalk)wing all transforma- tions that make reference ~o n2.
			Doing so resulted in an accuracy of 79.2%.
