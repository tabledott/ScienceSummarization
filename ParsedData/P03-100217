esults for the statistical model for comparing with the inductive learning model because we used the same feature extraction code for both models.
    Lines 3 and 4 list the results of the inductive learning model with boosting enabled, when the features were only from FS1, and from FS1 and FS2 respectively.
    When comparing the results obtained for both models when using only features from FS1, we find that almost the same results were obtained for role classification, but an enhancement of almost 13% was obtained when recognizing argument constituents.
    When comparing the statistical model with the inductive model that uses all features, there is an enhancement of 17.12% for argument identification and 4.87% for argument role recognition.
    Another significant advantage of our inductive learning approach is that it scales better to unknown predicates.
    The statistical model introduced in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) uses predicate lexical information at most levels in the probability lattice, hence
