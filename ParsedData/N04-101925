  The statistic rs can be used to test the hypothesis that the two ways to assign scores leading to the respective rankings are independent.
    The null hypothesis can be rejected with one-sided test with level of significance &#945; = 0.05, given our sample size N = 5, if rs &#8805; 0.85.
    Since there are multiple pyramids of order n &lt; 5, we computed the average ranking coefficient, as shown in Table 4.
    Again we can see that in order to have a ranking of the summaries that is reasonably close to the rankings produces by a pyramid of order n = 9, 4 or more summaries should be used.
    Lin and Hovy (2003) have shown that a unigram cooccurrence statistic, computed with stop words ignored, between a summary and a set of models can be used to assign scores for a test suite that highy correlates with the scores assigned by human evaluators at DUC.
    We have illustrated in Figure 1 above that human scores on human summaries have large variance, and we assume the same holds for machine summaries, so we
