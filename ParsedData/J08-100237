 to dispute2 (&#946; in Figure 16).
    The nodes of the predicate&#8211;argument structure &#945; are all instantiated, that is, it contains only inactives.
    The corresponding conjunctive node (&#945;' in Figure 18) has two inactives, for want and dispute1.
    The other structure &#946; has an unfilled object in the argument (ARG28) of dispute2, which will be filled by the non-local dependency.
    Hence, the corresponding conjunctive node &#946;' has only one inactive corresponding to want, and the remaining part that corresponds to dispute2 is passed on for further processing.
    When we process the phrase the fact that I wanted to dispute, the object of dispute2 is filled by fact (&#947; in Figure 16), and the predicate&#8211;argument structure of dispute2 is then placed into a conjunctive node (&#947;' in Figure 18).
    A feature forest representation of predicate&#8211;argument structures.
    One of the beneficial characteristics of this packed representation is that the representation is isomorp
