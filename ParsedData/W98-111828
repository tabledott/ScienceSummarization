superior performance on the formal run relative to the MENE-Proteus hybrid system (93.39 vs 88.80), but it isn't clear whether their advantage came from superior handcoded rules or superior statistical techniques, because their system is not as easily broken down into separate components as is MENE-Proteus.
    It is also possible that tighter system integration between the statistical and handcoded components was responsible for some of LTG's relative advantage, but note that MENE-Proteus appears to have an advantage over LTG in terms of portability.
    We are currently experimenting with porting MENE to Japanese, for instance, and expect that it could be combined with a pre-existing Japanese handcoded system, but it isn't clear that this could be done with the LTG system.
    Nevertheless, one of our avenues for future research is to look at tighter multi-system integration methods which won't compromise MEN E's essential portability.
