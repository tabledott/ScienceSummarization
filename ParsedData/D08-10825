tence) and its corresponding meaning representation structure (MR structure).
    Consider the following instance taken from the GEOQUERY corpus (Kate et al., 2005): The NL sentence &#8220;How many states do not have rivers ?&#8221; consists of 8 words, including punctuation.
    The MR is a hierarchical tree structure, as shown in Figure 1.
    Following an inorder traversal of this MR tree, we can equivalently represent it with the following list of meaning representation productions (MR productions): Each such MR production consists of three components: a semantic category, a function symbol which can be omitted (considered empty), and a list of arguments.
    An argument can be either a child semantic category or a constant.
    Take production (1) for example: it has a semantic category &#8220;NUM&#8221;, a function symbol &#8220;count&#8221;, and a child semantic category &#8220;STATE&#8221; as its only argument.
    Production (5) has &#8220;RIVER&#8221; as its semantic category, &#8220;river&#8221; as
