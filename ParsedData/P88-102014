   The effect field contains a description of the intended effect of the relation (i.e., the goal that the plan achieves, if properly executed).
    Since the goals in generation are communicative, the intended effect must be seen as the inferences that the speaker is licensed to make about the hearer's knowledge after the successful completion of the relation.
    Since the relations are used as plans, and since their satellite and nucleus constraints must be reformulated as subgoals to the structurer, these constraints are best represented in terms of the communicative intent of the speaker.
    That is, they are best represented in terms of what the hearer will know &#8212; i.e., what inferences the hearer would run &#8212; upon being told the nucleus or satellite filler.
    As it turns out, suitable terms for this purpose are provided by the formal theory of rational interaction currently being developed by, among others, Cohen, Levesque, and Perrault.
    For example, in (Cohen &amp; Levesque 851, Cohen
