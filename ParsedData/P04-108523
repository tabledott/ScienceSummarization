inferring a model in a non-sequential case.
    We compute the most probable sequence by performing a left-to-right decoding using a beam search.
    The algorithm is exactly the same as the one described in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) to find the most probable part-of-speech sequence.
    We used a large beam of size =100, which is not computationally prohibitive, since the tagset contains only four elements.
    Note however that this algorithm can lead to search errors.
    An alternative would be to use a variant of the Viterbi algorithm, which was successfully used in (McCallum et al., 2000) to decode the most probable sequence in a CMM.
  
  
    We had 8135 spurts available for training and testing, and performed two sets of experiments to evaluate the performance of our system.
    The tools used to perform the training are the same as those described in section 3.4.
    In the first set of experiments, we reproduced the experimental setting of (Hillard et al., 2003), a three-way classification (BACKCHANNEL a
