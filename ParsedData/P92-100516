la with an uninstantiated scoping constraint so that it reduces to application of other rules: Two rules are applicable to form expressions, corresponding to the cases of an uninstantiated or instantiated resolution meta-variable: In a more complete description of the semantics we would also have to state that the evaluation rules provided give the only way of determining membership of the relation W. The claim of monotonicity for QLF is that for formulas Fl and F2, if Fl is a more resolved version of F2 then Fl is a less partial interpretation than F2.
    Scoping Constraints: The quantification rules, (Q7) and (Q8), (i) select a term from a formula, (ii) discharge all occurrences of the term and its index in the formula and the term's restriction, replacing them by a variable, and (iii) apply the term's quantifier to the discharged restriction and formula.
    The difference between (Q7) and (Q8) is simply that the latter also discharges the head of the scoping list, in this case by removing it rather than
