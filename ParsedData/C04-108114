			Since no vocabulary list could ever be complete,new word (unknown word) identification is an im portant issue in Chinese segmentation.
			Unknownwords cause segmentation errors in that these outof-vocabulary words in input text are often in correctly segmented into single-character or otheroverly-short words (Chen and Bai, 1998).
			Tradi tionally, new word detection has been considered as a standalone process.
			We consider here new word detection as an integral part of segmentation, aimingto improve both segmentation and new word detec tion: detected new words are added to the word list lexicon in order to improve segmentation; improved segmentation can potentially further improve new word detection.
			We measure the performance ofnew word detection by its improvements on seg mentation.
			Given a word segmentation proposed by the CRF, we can compute a confidence in each segment.
			We detect as new words those that are no
