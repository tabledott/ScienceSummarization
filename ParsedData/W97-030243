eneral, global thresholding works better on simpler grammars.
    In some complicated grammars we explored in other work, there were systematic, strong correlations between nodes, which violated the independence approximation used in global thresholding.
    This prevented us from using global thresholding with these grammars.
    In the future, we may modify global thresholding to model some of these correlations.
    While global thresholding works better than beam thresholding in general, each has its own strengths.
    Global thresholding can threshold across cells, but because of the approximations used, the thresholds must generally be looser.
    Beam thresholding can only threshold within a cell, but can do so fairly tightly.
    Combining the two offers the potential to get the advantages of both.
    We ran a series of experiments using the thresholding optimization algorithm of Section 5.
    Figure 13 gives the results.
    The combination of beam and global thresholding together is clearly better
