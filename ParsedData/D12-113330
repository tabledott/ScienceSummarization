n dependency parsing, most state-of-the-art parsers based on PCFG models naturally incorporate part-of-speech tagging and usually achieve better parsing accuracy (albeit not always tagging accuracy) with a joint model than with a pipeline approach (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).
    Models that in addition incorporate morphological analysis and segmentation have been explored by Tsarfaty (2006), Cohen and Smith (2007), and Goldberg and Tsarfaty (2008) with special reference to Hebrew parsing.
  
  
    We have presented the first system for joint partof-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with non-projective dependency trees.
    Evaluation on four languages shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy over a pipeline system with state-of-the-art results across the board.
    The error analysis reveals improvements in tagging accuracy for syntactically central categories, mainly verbs, with improvement in syntactic accuracy for
