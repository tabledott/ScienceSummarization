ames to their Chinese transliteration.
    Thus even the initial requirement of creating candidate transformation rules, which may require knowledge of the phonology of the target language, is eliminated.
    We also investigate incorporation of this transliteration system in a cross-lingual spoken document retrieval application, in which English text queries are used to index and retrieve Mandarin audio from the TDT corpus.
  
  
    We break down the transliteration process into various steps as depicted in Figure 1.
    Steps 1. and 3. are deterministic transformations, while Steps 2. and 4. are accomplished using statistical means.
    The IBM source-channel model for statistical machine translation (P. Brown et al., 1993) plays a central role in our system.
    We therefore describe it very briefly here for completeness.
    In this model, a word foreign language sentence is modeled as the output of a &#8220;noisy channel&#8221; whose input is its correct -word English translation , and having observed t
