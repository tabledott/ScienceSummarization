en first-order, non-projective model.
    Flipping all three of these parameters for Danish, we confirmed the pattern by instead measuring search error under a higher-order, projective model (PTREE+LINK+GRAND), when PTREE was weakened during decoding.
    Compared to the MBR parse under that model, the search errors from decoding with weaker hard constraints were 2.2% for NOT2, 2.1% for EXACTLY1, 1.7% for EXACTLY1 + NO2CYCLE, and 0.0% for PTREE.
  
  
    Belief propagation improves non-projective dependency parsing with features that would make exact inference intractable.
    For projective parsing, it is significantly faster than exact dynamic programming, at the cost of small amounts of search error, We are interested in extending these ideas to phrase-structure and lattice parsing, and in trying other higher-order features, such as those used in parse reranking (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Huang, 2008) and history-based parsing (Nivre and McDonald, 2008).
    We could also introduce new variables, e.g.,
