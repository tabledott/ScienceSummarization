emantic roles that underlies our system?
    For example, could the optimal choice of semantic roles be very dependent on the application that needs to exploit their information?
    Although there may well be application-specific constraints on semantic roles, our semantic role classifiers seem in practice to be relatively independent of the exact set of semantic roles under consideration.
    Section 9.1 describes an experiment in which we collapsed the FrameNet roles into a set of 18 abstract thematic roles.
    We then retrained our classifier and achieved roughly comparable results; overall performance was 82.1% for abstract thematic roles, compared to 80.4% for frame-specific roles.
    Although this doesn&#8217;t show that the detailed set of semantic roles is irrelevant, it does suggest that our statistical classification algorithm, at least, is relatively robust to even quite large changes in role identities.
  
  
    Assignment of semantic roles is an important part of language understanding, and t
