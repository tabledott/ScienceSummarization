  Word-Sense Disambiguation Using Decomposable Models
  
    is composed of interdependent variables.
    The test used to evaluate a model gives preference to those that have the fewest number of interdependencies, thereby selecting models expressing only the most systematic variable interactions.
    To summarize the method, one first identifies informative contextual features (where &amp;quot;informative&amp;quot; is a well-defined notion, discussed in Section 2).
    Then, out of all possible decomposable models characterizing interdependency relationships among the selected variables, those that are found to produce good approximations to the data are identified (using the test mentioned above) and one of those models is used to perform disambiguation.
    Thus, we are able to use multiple contextual features without the need for untested assumptions regarding the form of the model.
    Further, approximating the joint distribution of all variables with a model identifying only the most important system
