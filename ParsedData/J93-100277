son-month to produce this training corpus.
    As a rough guide, it takes an average of 15 seconds to resolve a single interaction with the parser.
    However, the time a parse takes can often be lengthened by incorrect choices (and the consequent need to back up manually) and by the process of adding lexical entries and occasional rules.
    The resultant parse histories were used to construct the probabilistic parser (as described in the previous section).
    This parser was then used to reparse the training corpus, and the most highly ranked analyses were automatically compared with the original parse histories.
    We have been able to reparse in a breadth-first fashion all but 3 of the 150 definitions that were parsed manually.'
    (These three are each over 8 The corpus contains about 17,000 unique headwords and 13,500 distinct word forms in the definitions.
    Its perplexity (PP) measures based on bigram and trigram word models and an estimate of an infinite model were PP(2) = 104, PP(3) = 41, and
