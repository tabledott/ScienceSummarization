ined alignment models, however, namely, Models 3, 4, 5, and 6, maximization over all alignments cannot be efficiently carried out.
    The corresponding search problem is NP-complete (Knight 1990a).
    For short sentences, a possible solution could be an A* search algorithm (Och, Ueffing, and Ney 2001).
    In the work presented here, we use a more efficient greedy search algorithm for the best alignment, as suggested in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993).
    The basic idea is to compute the Viterbi alignment of a simple model (such as Model 2 or HMM).
    This alignment is then iteratively improved with respect to the alignment probability of the refined alignment model.
    (For further details on the greedy search algorithm, see Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer [1993].)
    In the Appendix, we present methods for performing an efficient computation of this pseudo-Viterbi alignment.
  
  
    In this section, we describe our approach to determining the model parameters 0.
