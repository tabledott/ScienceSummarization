wever, it would be inefficient to expand nodes at arbitrary positions of the tree, as duplicated enumeration is inevitable.
    The algorithm, rightmost extension, avoids such duplicated enumerations by restricting the position of attachment.
    We here give the definition of rightmost extension to describe this restriction in detail.
    Definition 4 Rightmost Extension (Abe et al., 2002; Zaki, 2002) Let t and t' be labeled ordered trees.
    We say t' is a rightmost extension of t, if and only if t and t' satisfy the following three conditions: Consider Figure 2, which illustrates example tree t with the labels drawn from the set G = {a, b, c}.
    For the sake of convenience, each node in this figure has its original number (depth-first enumeration).
    The rightmost-path of the tree t is (a(c(b))), and occurs at positions 1, 4 and 6 respectively.
    The set of rightmost extended trees is then enumerated by simply adding a single node to a node on the rightmost path.
    Since there are three nodes on t
