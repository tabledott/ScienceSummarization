andling non-projective relations and also performs dependency labeling.
    Parsing is deterministic and proceeds bottom-up.
    Labeling is integrated within a single processing step.

    The submitted runs used Maximum Entropy and I present accuracy and performance comparisons with other learning algorithms.
    No additional resources are used.
    No pre-processing or post-processing is used, except stemming for Danish, German and Swedish.
  
  
    LEMMA was used in features whenever available, otherwise the FORM was used.
    For Danish, German and Swedish the Snowball stemmer (Porter 2001) was used to generate a value for LEMMA.
