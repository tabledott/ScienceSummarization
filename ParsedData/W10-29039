sumed a fully supervised setting where a training set is available consisting of either: input sentences and logical forms {(xl, zl)}Nl=1 (e.g., (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005)) or input sentences, logical forms and a mapping between their constituents {(xl, yl, zl)}Nl=1 (e.g., (Ge and Mooney, 2005)).
    Given such training examples a weight vector w can be learned using structured learning methods.
    Obtaining, through annotation or other means, this form of training data is an expensive and difficult process which presents a major bottleneck for semantic parsing.
    To reduce the burden of annotation we focus on a new learning paradigm which uses feedback from a teacher.
    The feedback signal is binary (+1, &#8722;1) and informs the learner whether a predicted logical form z&#710; when executed on the target domain produces the desired response or outcome.
    This is a very natural method for providing supervision in many situations and requires no expertise.
    For example, a user can observe the r
