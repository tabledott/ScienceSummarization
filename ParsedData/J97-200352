gorithm that we previously presented applies as well to transducers mapping strings to other semirings.
    We gave the pseudocode of the algorithm in the general case.
    The algorithm applies for instance to the real semiring (R,,+,., 0,1).
    One can also verify that (E*Uf oo}, A, oo, f), where A denotes the longest common prefix operation and &#8226; concatenation, oo a new element such that for any string w E (E*U fool), WA oo = co A w = w and w oo oo &#8226; w = oo, defines a left semiring.'
    We call this semiring the string semiring.
    The algorithm of Figure 10 used with the string semiring is exactly the determinization algorithm for subsequentiable string-to-string transducers, as defined by Mohri (1994c).
    The cross product of two semirings defines a semiring.
    The algorithm also applies when the semiring is the cross product of Sequential transducer 72 with outputs in E* x R obtained from (31 by determinization.
    (E* U fool, A, oo, &#8364;) and (R+ U { oo }, min, +, 00, 0), which a
