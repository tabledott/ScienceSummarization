    The L-BFGS algorithm requires the following values at each iteration: the expected value and the empirical expected value of each feature, for calculating the gradient; and the value of the likelihood function.
    For the normal-form model, the empirical expected values and the likelihood can be easily obtained, because these only involve the single gold-standard derivation for each sentence.
    For the dependency model, the computations of the empirical expected values and the likelihood function are more complex, because these involve sums over just those derivations leading to the goldstandard dependency structures.
    We explain how these derivations can be found in Section 5.4.
    The next section explains how CCG charts can be represented in a way which allows efficient estimation.
    The packed charts perform a number of roles.
    First, they compactly represent every (derivation, dependency-structure) pair, by grouping together equivalent chart entries.
