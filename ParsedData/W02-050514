    Arabic employs a cursive writing system, so typically letters in the same word are connected to each other.
    Most letters can be connected from both sides, but some (such as &amp;quot; , , &amp;quot; J&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot; j' )' can be connected only from the right side.
    After any of these letters, a space might be incorrectly deleted (e.g., &amp;quot;,:y3_,J.,ti...a:jit,&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;,:y3_,J.,ti...a) bytr mndlswn&amp;quot;) or inserted (e.g., &amp;quot;Alfl Ats b d allh&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;ABlats.
    &#8364;bdcillh&amp;quot;).
    Additionally, there are common misspellings that can be found even in the most respected Arabic newspapers, e.g., interchanging one form of an alif (&amp;quot;i&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;p', &amp;quot;p', or &amp;quot;p') with another, especially at the beginning of a word; or interchanging &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; at the end of a word; etc.
    These kinds of typos and misspellings are more common than we expected
