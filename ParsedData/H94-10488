  Feature  Search The search problem here is to find an optimal set of features A4 for use in the ME model.
  We begin with a search space 79 of putative features, and use a feature ranking criterion which incrementally selects the features in .A4, and also incremen- tally expands the search space 79.
  Initially 79 consists of all 1, 2, 3 and 4-gram word features of the four headwords that occur in the training histories 2, and 4 all possible unigram class features 3.
  We obtain E (~) = 15 k=l word features from each training history, and, assuming each word is assigned m bits, a total of 2m * 4 unigram class features, e.g., there are 2m features per word: B i t  1 o f Verb  =
