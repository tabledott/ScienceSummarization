he forest, rather than only at the root node as in pure rescoring.
    By adapting the k-best parsing Algorithm 2 of Huang and Chiang (2005), it achieves significant speed-up over full-integration on Chiang&#8217;s Hiero system.
    We push the idea behind this method further and make the following contributions in this paper: Cube pruning and cube growing are collectively called forest rescoring since they both approximately rescore the packed forest of derivations from &#8722;LM decoding.
    In practice they run an order of magnitude faster than full-integration with beam search, at the same level of search errors and translation accuracy as measured by BLEU.
  
  
    We establish in this section a unified framework for translation with an integrated n-gram language model in both phrase-based systems and syntaxbased systems based on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs).
    An SCFG (Lewis and Stearns, 1968) is a context-free rewriting system for generating string pairs.
