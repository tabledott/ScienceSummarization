he questions are: how many man-hours are required to convert to each new domain? and how many of the rules from one domain are applicable to each new domain?
    There are no clear answers to these questions.
    The library of planning operators used in SUMMONS is extensible and can be ported to other domains, although it is likely that new operators will be needed.
    In addition, new vocabulary will also be needed.
    The authors plan to perform a portability analysis and report on it in the future.
    Given that no alternative approaches to conceptual summarization of multiple articles exist, we have found it very hard to perform an adequate evaluation of the summaries generated by SUMMONS.
    We consider several potential evaluations: qualitative (user satisfaction and readability) and task-based.
    In a task-based evaluation, one set of judges would have access to the full set of articles, while another set of evaluators would have the summaries generated by SUMMONS.
    The task would involve dec
