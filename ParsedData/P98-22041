algorithm prevents it from being applied incrementally (cf.
    Kehler (1997)).
    In my approach, I propose to replace the functions of the backward-looking center and the centering transitions by the order among the elements of the list of salient discourse entities (S-list).
    The S-list ranking criteria define a preference for hearer-old over hearer-new discourse entities (Prince, 1981) generalizing Strube &amp; Hahn's (1996) approach.
    Because of these ranking criteria, I can account for the difference in salience between definite NPs (mostly hearer-old) and indefinite NPs (mostly hearer-new).
    The S-list is not a local data structure associated with individual utterances.
    The S-list rather describes the attentional state of the hearer at any given point in processing a discourse.
    The S-list is generated incrementally, word by word, and used immediately.
    Therefore, the S-list integrates in the simplest manner preferences for inter- and intrasentential anaphora, making further specifi
