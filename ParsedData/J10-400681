e have full access to the results, we use a heuristic bootstrap procedure to obtain confidence intervals around the purities (Efron and Tibshirani 1994).
    We resample with replacement 10K data sets (clusterassignment+true-label pairs) of the original size.
    Empirical 95% confidence intervals are then computed from the distribution of the purities in the bootstrapped data sets (for the ESSLLI results, we only perform the procedure for 6-way clustering).
    The confidence intervals give a rough idea of how stable purity estimates are across small variations of the items in the data sets.
    The Random models for this task are baselines assigning the concepts randomly to the target clusters, with the constraint that each cluster must contain at least one concept.
    Random assignment is repeated 10K times, and we obtain means and confidence intervals from the distribution of these simulations.
    Table 6 reports purity results for the three data sets, comparing our models to those in the literature.
