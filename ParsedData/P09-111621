h query class, we train a logistic regression classifier (Vapnik 1999) with L2 regularization. complete set of 800,000.
    The participating systems were evaluated by their average F-scores (F1) and average precision (P) over these three sets of answer keys for the 800 selected queries.
    Given an input x, represented as a vector of m features: (x1, x2, , xm), a logistic regression classifier with parameter vector &#157; _(w1, w2, , wm) computes the posterior probability of the output y, which is either 1 or -1, as We tag a query as belonging to a class if the probability of the class is among the highest 5 and is greater than 0.5.
    The baseline system uses only the words in the queries as features (the bag-of-words representation), treating the query classification problem as a typical text categorization problem.
    We found the prior distribution of the query classes to be extremely important.
    In fact, a system that always returns the top-5 most frequent classes has an F1 score of 26.55, which w
