 produce rankings across summaries that we can have confidence in.
    We now turn to this analysis.
    Here we address two questions raised by the data from Table 2, i.e., that scores change as pyramid size increases: To have confidence in relative ranking of summaries by pyramid scores, we need to answer the above questions.
    It has often been noted that different people write different summaries; we observe that with only a few summaries in a pyramid, there is insufficient data for the scores associated with a pyramid generated from one combination of a few summaries to be relatively the same as those using a different combination of a few summaries.
    Empirically, we observed that as pyramids grow larger, and the range between higher weight and lower weight SCUS grows larger, scores stabilize.
    This makes sense in light of the fact that a score is dominated by the higher weight SCUS that appear in a summary.
    However, we wanted to study more precisely at what point scores become independent of
