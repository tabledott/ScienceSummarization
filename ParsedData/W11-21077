ean of P and R (van Rijsbergen, 1979) is then calculated: To account for gaps and differences in word order, a fragmentation penalty is calculated using the total number of matched words (m, average over hypothesis and reference) and number of chunks (ch): The parameters &#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, and wi...wn are tuned to maximize correlation with human judgments.
  
  
    The 2009 and 2010 WMT shared evaluation data sets are made available as development data for WMT 2011.
    Data sets include MT system outputs, reference translations, and human rankings of translation quality.
    Table 3 lists the number of judgments for each evaluation and combined totals.
    To evaluate a metric&#8217;s performance on a data set, we count the number of pairwise translation rankings preserved when translations are re-ranked by metric score.
    We then compute Kendall&#8217;s &#964; correlation coefficient as follows: For each WMT language, we learn Meteor parameters that maximize T over the combined 2009 and 2010
