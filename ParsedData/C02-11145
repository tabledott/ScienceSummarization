n feature-vectors (Lin, 1998; Schu?tze, 1998).Clustering techniques can also be used to discriminate between different senses of an ambiguous word.
			A general problem for such cluster ing techniques lies in the question of how many clusters one should have, i.e. how many senses are appropriate for a particular word in a given domain (Manning and Schu?tze, 1999, Ch 14).
			Lin?s approach to this problem (Lin, 1998) isto build a ?similarity tree?
			(using what is in ef fect a hierarchical clustering method) of words related to a target word (in this case the word duty).
			Different senses of duty can be discerned as different sub-trees of this similarity tree.
