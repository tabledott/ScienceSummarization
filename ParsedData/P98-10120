  Entity-Based Cross-Document Core f erencing Using the Vector Space Model
  
    Cross-document coreference occurs when the same person, place, event, or concept is discussed in more than one text source.
    Computer recognition of this phenomenon is important because it helps break &amp;quot;the document boundary&amp;quot; by allowing a user to examine information about a particular entity from multiple text sources at the same time.
    In this paper we describe a cross-document coreference resolution algorithm which uses the Vector Space Model to resolve ambiguities between people having the same name.
    In addition, we also describe a scoring algorithm for evaluating the cross-document coreference chains produced by our system and we compare our algorithm to the scoring algorithm used in the MUC- 6 (within document) coreference task.
