s case New Mexico is the desired response.
    In response driven semantic parsing, the learner is provided with a set of natural language sentences and a feedback function that encapsulates the teacher.
    The feedback function informs the learner whether its interpretation of the input sentence produces the desired response.
    We consider scenarios where the feedback is provided as a binary signal, correct +1 or incorrect &#8722;1.
    This weaker form of supervision poses a challenge to conventional learning methods: semantic parsing is in essence a structured prediction problem requiring supervision for a set of interdependent decisions, while the provided supervision is binary, indicating the correctness of a generated meaning representation.
    To bridge this difference we propose two novel learning algorithms suited to the response driven setting.
    Furthermore, to account for the many syntactic variations associated with the MR, we propose a new model for semantic parsing that allows us to learn
