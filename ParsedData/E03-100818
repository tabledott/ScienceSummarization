 situation where there is only a very limited amount of labelled material in the novel domain.
    The upper curve in Figure 8 shows the outcome of this experiment.
    Not surprisingly, the 100 additional labelled WSJ sentences improved the initial performance of the parser (to 76.7%).
    While the amount of improvement in performance is less than the previous case, co-training provides an additional boost to the parsing performance, to 78.7%.
  
  
    The various experiments are summarised in Table 1.
    As is customary in the statistical parsing literature, we view all our previous experiments using section 0 of the Penn Treebank WSJ as contributing towards development.
    Here we report on system performance on unseen material (namely section 23 of the WSJ).
    We give F-score results for the Collins-CFG parser before and after cotraining for section 23.
    The results show a modest improvement under each co-training scenario, indicating that, for the Collins-CFG parser, there is useful information
