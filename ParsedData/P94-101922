    With examples from the translation of English to Chinese we have shown that verb semantic representation has great impact on the quality of lexical selection.
    Selection restrictions on verb arguments can only define default situations for verb events, and are often overridden by context information.
    Therefore, we propose a novel method for defining verbs based on a set of shared semantic domains.
    This representation scheme not only takes care of the semantic-syntactic correspondence, but also provides similarity measures for the system for the performance of inexact matches based on verb meanings.
    The conceptual similarity has priority over selection constrants on the verb arguments.
    We leave scaling up the system to future work.
