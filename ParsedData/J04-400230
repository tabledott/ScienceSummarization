task.
    Note that this tuning depends on the starting point of the model parameters and is not guaranteed to converge to the global optimum on the training data.
    As a result, this approach is limited to a very small number of model parameters.
    An efficient algorithm for performing this tuning for a larger number of model parameters can be found in Och (2003).
    A standard approach to training the log-linear model parameters of the maximum class posterior probability criterion is the GIS (Generalized Iterative Scaling) algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff 1972).
    To apply this algorithm, we have to solve various practical problems.
    The renormalization needed in equation (3) requires a sum over many possible sentences, for which we do not know of an efficient algorithm.
    Hence, we approximate this sum by extracting a large set of highly probable sentences as a sample from the space of all possible sentences (n-best approximation).
    The set of considered sentences is computed by means of an a
