    The parsing model defines a conditional distribution pg(z I x) over each projective parse tree z for a particular sentence x, parameterized by a vector 0.
    The probability of any particular parse is where z is a directed edge contained in the parse tree z and &#966; is a feature function.
    In the fully supervised experiments we run for comparison, parameter estimation is performed by stochastic gradient ascent on the conditional likelihood function, similar to maximum entropy models or conditional random fields.
    One needs to be able to compute expectations of the features &#966;(z, x) under the distribution p&#952;(z  |x).
    A version of the insideoutside algorithm (Lee and Choi, 1997) performs this computation.
    Viterbi decoding is done using Eisner&#8217;s algorithm (Eisner, 1996).
    We also used a generative model based on dependency model with valence (Klein and Manning, 2004).
    Under this model, the probability of a particular parse z and a sentence with part of s
