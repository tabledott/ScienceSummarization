    In order to determine the major classes of errors made by our system, we randomly chose five test documents from MUC-6 and determined the coreference links that were either missing (false negatives) or spurious (false positives) in these sample documents.
    Missing links result in recall errors; spurious links result in precision errors.
    Breakdowns of the number of spurious and missing links are shown in Table 5 and Table 6, respectively.
    The following two subsections describe the errors in more detail.
    This section describes the five major types of errors summarized in Table 5 in more detail.
    5.1.1 Prenominal Modifier String Match.
    This class of errors occurs when some strings of the prenominal modifiers of two markables match by surface string comparison and thus, by the C5 decision tree in Figure 2, the markables are treated as coreferring.
    However, the entire markable actually does not corefer.
