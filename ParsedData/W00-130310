at appear in a sentence but are not in a dependency relation as a negative example.
    (tank E aklYkIK Via, flij) &#177; b (11) k,t;fkiEsvs (11) shows that the distance between test data and the separating hyperplane is put into the sigmoid function, assuming it represents the probability value of the dependency relation.
    We adopt this method in our experiment to transform the distance measure obtained in SVMs into a probability function and analyze dependency structure with a framework of conventional probability model 2.
    Features that are supposed to be effective in Japanese dependency analysis are: head words and their parts-of-speech, particles and inflection forms of the words that appear at the end of chunks, distance between two chunks, existence of punctuation marks.
    As those are solely defined by the pair of chunks, we refer to them as static features.
    Japanese dependency relations are heavily constrained by such static features since the inflection forms and postpositional particles
