nsider for example the pair (chapter, describes), which does not occur in our corpusl .
    This pair was found to be similar to the pairs (introduction, describes), (book, describes) and (section, describes), that do occur in the corpus.
    Since these pairs occur in the corpus, we estimate their mutual information values using equation 2, as shown in Table 1.
    We then take the average of these mutual information values as the similarity based estimate for I(chapter, describes), denoted as Achapter, describes)2 .
    This represents the assumption that the word 'describes' is associated with the word 'chapter' to a similar extent as it is associated with the words 'introduction', 'book' and 'section'.
    Table 2 demonstrates how the analogy is carried out also for a pair of unassociated words, such as (chapter, knows).
    In our current implementation, we compute /(wi, w2) using up to 6 most similar words to each of w1 and w2, and averaging the mutual information values of similar pairs that occur in t
