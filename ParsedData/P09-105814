rface forms can overfit the training data and lead to poor predictions on the test data.
    To alleviate this problem, we use two generalized features of the surface forms.
    The first is the beginning and end characters of the surface (A0&#8211;A7).
    For example, (AB(w0)) denotes the beginning character of the current word w0, and (AB(w0), AE(w0)) denotes the beginning and end characters in the word.
    The second is the types of beginning and end characters of the surface (T0&#8211;T7).
    We define a set of general character types, as shown in Table 4.
    Templates C0&#8211;C6 are basic character-level unigram features taken from (Nakagawa, 2004).
    These templates operate over a window of f2 characters.
    The features include characters (C0), pairs of characters (C1&#8211;C2), character types (C3), and pairs of character types (C4&#8211;C5).
    In addition, we add pairs of characters and character types (C6).
    Bigram features: Table 3 shows our bigram features.
