(Roark and Charniak, 1998) refined this algorithm to focus more explicitly on certain syntactic structures.
    Hale, Ge, and Charniak (Ge et al., 1998) devised a technique to learn the gender of words.
    Caraballo (Caraballo, 1999) and Hearst (Hearst, 1992) created techniques to learn hypernym/hyponym relationships.
    None of these previous algorithms used extraction patterns or similar contexts to infer semantic class associations.
    Several learning algorithms have also been developed for named entity recognition (e.g., (Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999)).
    (Collins and Singer, 1999) used contextual information of a different sort than we do.
    Furthermore, our research aims to learn general nouns (e.g., &#8220;artist&#8221;) rather than proper nouns, so many of the features commonly used to great advantage for named entity recognition (e.g., capitalization and title words) are not applicable to our task.
    The algorithm most closely related to Basilisk is meta-bootstrappi
