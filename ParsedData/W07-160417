ction in recall (to 0.16).
    To address the problem of low recall, we have targeted another type of ESL preposition error: extraneous prepositions.
  
  
    Our strategy of training the ME classifier on grammatical, edited text precluded detection of extraneous prepositions as these did not appear in the training corpus.
    Of the 500-600 errors in the ESL test set, 142 were errors of this type.
    To identify extraneous preposition errors we devised two rule-based filters which were based on analysis of the development set.
    Both used POS tags and chunking information.
    Plural Quantifier Constructions This filter addresses the second most common extraneous preposition error where the writer has added a preposition in the middle of a plural quantifier construction, for example: some ofpeople.
    This filter works by checking if the target word is preceded by a quantifier (such as &#8220;some&#8221;, &#8220;few&#8221;, or &#8220;three&#8221;), and if the head noun of the quantifier phrase is plural
