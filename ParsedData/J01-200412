ction.
    For example, &amp;quot;Spot chased the ball (/s)&amp;quot; is a complete string, and the following is the set of prefix strings of this complete string: &amp;quot;Spot&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Spot chased&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Spot chased the&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Spot chased the ball&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;Spot chased the ball Us}&amp;quot;.
    A PCFG also defines a probability distribution over string prefixes, and we will present this in terms of partial derivations.
    A partial derivation (or parse) d is defined with respect to a prefix string w as follows: it is the leftmost derivation of the string, with wj on the right-hand side of the last expansion in the derivation.'
    Let Dw, be the set of all partial derivations for a prefix string 4.
    Then We left-factor the PCFG, so that all productions are binary, except those with a single terminal on the right-hand side and epsilon productions.'
    We do this because it delays predictions about what nonterminals we expect later in the string u
