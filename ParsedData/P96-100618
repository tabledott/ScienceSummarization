4 separate runs of 100 random trials each.
    In each run, we utilized only one knowledge source and compute the average classification accuracy and the standard deviation.
    The results are given in Table 4.
    Local collocation knowledge yields the highest accuracy, followed by POS and morphological form.
    Surrounding words give lower accuracy, perhaps because in our work, only the current sentence forms the surrounding context, which averages about 20 words.
    Previous work on using the unordered set of surrounding words have used a much larger window, such as the 100-word window of (Yarowsky, 1992), and the 2-sentence context of (Leacock et al., 1993).
    Verb-object syntactic relation is the weakest knowledge source.
    Our experimental finding, that local collocations are the most predictive, agrees with past observation that humans need a narrow window of only a few words to perform WSD (Choueka and Lusignan, 1985).
    The processing speed of LEXAS is satisfactory.
