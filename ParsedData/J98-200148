ider the definite descriptions marked as doubts (in which case we have 464 descriptions and five classes), K = 0.63 if we leave them out (430 descriptions and the four classes I-IV).
    We also measured the extent of agreement among subjects on the antecedents for coreferential and bridging definite descriptions.
    A total of 164 descriptions were classified as coreferential by all three coders; of these, 155 (95%) were taken by all coders to refer to the same entity (although not necessarily to the same mention of that entity).
    There were only 7 definite descriptions classified by all three annotators as bridging references; in 5 of these cases (71%) the three annotators also agreed on a textual antecedent (i.e., on the discourse entity to which the bridging reference was related to).
    4.4.1 Distribution into Classes.
    As shown in Table 8, the distribution of definite descriptions among discourse-new, on the one side, and coreferential with bridging references, one the other, is roughly the same
