 and Littman 2003), word sense disambiguation (Yuret and Yatbaz 2009), contextspelling correction (Jones and Martin 1997), fact extraction (Pa&#351;ca et al. 2006), semantic role labeling (Erk 2007), and applications in IR such as query expansion (Cao et al.
    2008) and textual advertising (Chang et al. 2009).
    For commercial engines such as Yahoo! and Google, creating lists of named entities found on the Web is critical for query analysis, document categorization, and ad matching.
    Computing term similarity is typically done by comparing cooccurrence vectors between all pairs of terms (Sarmento et al. 2007).
    Scaling this task to the Web requires parallelization and optimizations.
    In this paper, we propose a large-scale term similarity algorithm, based on distributional similarity, implemented in the MapReduce framework and deployed over a 200 billion word crawl of the Web.
    The resulting similarity matrix between 500 million terms is applied to the task of expanding lists of named entities
