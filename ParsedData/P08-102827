the human ratings.
    In order to establish which ones fit our data better, we examined whether the correlation coefficients achieved differ significantly using a t-test (Cohen and Cohen, 1983).
    The lowest correlation (p = 0.04) is observed for the simple additive model which is not significantly different from the non-compositional baseline model.
    The weighted additive model (p = 0.09) is not significantly different from the baseline either or Kintsch (2001) (p = 0.09).
    Given that the basis of Kintsch&#8217;s model is the summation of the verb, a neighbor close to the verb and the noun, it is not surprising that it produces results similar to a summation which weights the verb more heavily than the noun.
    The multiplicative model yields a better fit with the experimental data, &#961; = 0.17.
    The combined model is best overall with &#961; = 0.19.
    However, the difference between the two models is not statistically significant.
    Also note that in contrast to the combined model, the mu
