    (One exception is Collins 1999, whose Model 2 includes a distinction between arguments and adjuncts, and whose Model 3 additionally captures wh-movement in relative clauses with a GPSG-like &#8220;slash-feature-passing&#8221; mechanism.)
    The reasons for this shift away from linguistic adequacy are easy to trace.
    The very healthy turn towards quantitative evaluation interacts with the fact that just about every dimension of linguistic variation exhibits a Zipfian distribution, where a very small proportion of the available alternatives accounts for most of the data.
    This creates a temptation to concentrate on capturing the few high-frequency cases at the top end of the distribution, and to ignore the &#8220;long tail&#8221; of rare events such as non-local dependencies.
    Despite the fact that these occur in a large number of sentences, they affect only a small number of words, and have thus a small im
