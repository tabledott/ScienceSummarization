n T is known to be unambiguous.
    In many practical cases, the transducer one wishes to determinize is ambiguous.
    It is always possible to construct an unambiguous transducer T' from T (Eilenberg 1974-1976).
    The complexity of such a construction is exponential in the worst case.
    Thus the overall complexity of the test of determinizability is also exponential in the worst case.
    Notice that if one wishes to construct the result of the determinization of T for a given input string w, one does not need to expand the whole result of the determinization, but only the necessary part of the determinized transducer.
    When restricted to a finite set the function realized by any transducer is subsequentiable, since it has bounded variation.'
    Acyclic transducers have the twins property, so they are determinizable.
    Therefore, it is always possible to expand the result of the determinization algorithm for a finite set of input strings, even if T is not determinizable.
