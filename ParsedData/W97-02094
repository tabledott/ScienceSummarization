e p is having on its argument, and therefore the less strong its selectional preference.
    Given this definition, a natural way to characterize the &amp;quot;semantic fit&amp;quot; of a particular class as the argument to a predicate is by its relative contribution to the overall selectional preference strength.
    In particular, classes that fit very well can be expected to have higher posterior probabilities, compared to their priors, as is the case for (insect) in Figure 1.
    Formally, selectional association is defined as: This model of selectional preference has turned out to make reasonable predictions about human judgments of argument plausibility obtained by psycholinguistic methods (Resnik, 1993a).
    Closely related proposals have been applied in syntactic disambiguation (Resnik, 1993b; Lauer, 1994) and to automatic acquisition of more KatzFodoresque selection restrictions in the form of weighted disjunctions (Ribas, 1994).
    The selectional association has also been used recently to explore
