    Percent agreement is high, but as argued in Krippendorff (1980), percent agreement is relatively uninformative because it fails to take into account the response rate of individual subjects, a factor built into both Cochran's Q and Krippendorff's a.
    3.2.2 Significance.
    The segmentation data from the 20 narratives can be represented as a set of 20 i x j matrices, each of the form shown in Table 1.
    Each matrix has a height of i = 7 subjects and width of j = n prosodic phrases less 1.
    (Table 1 is a partial matrix of width j = 11.)
    The value in a cell cid is a 1 if the ith subject assigned a boundary at site j, and blank if they did not.
    We use Cochran's Q to evaluate the significance of the distributions in the matrices.'
    Cochran's test evaluates the null hypothesis that the sums of is in the columns, representing the total number of subjects assigning a boundary at the jth site (Tj), are randomly distributed.
    It does so by evaluating the significance of the differences i
