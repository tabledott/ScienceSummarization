    Morphological analysis presupposes the availability of highly language-specific resources such as a morpheme lexicon, spelling rules, morphological rules, and heuristics to prioritise possible analyses of a word according to their plausibility.
    This is a serious knowledge engineering bottleneck when the goal is to develop a language and annotation-independent tagger generator.
    In our memory-based approach, we provide morphological information (especially about suffixes) indirectly to the tagger by encoding the three last letters of the word as separate features in the case representation.
    The first letter is encoded as well because it contains information about prefix and capitalization of the word.
    Context information is added to the case representation in a similar way as with known words.
    It turned out that in combination with the 'morphological' features, a context of one disambiguated tag of the word to the left of the unknown word and one ambiguous category of the word to the
