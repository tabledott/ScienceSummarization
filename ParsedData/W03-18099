 of the particle, and (b) the particle chunk tag in the chunker output, where we similarly locate the rightmost verb associated with each particle chunk occurrence.
    Finally, we ran a stochastic chunk-based grammar over the chunker output to extend extraction coverage to include mistagged particles and also more reliably determine the valence of the VPC.
    The token output of these three methods was amalgamated by weighted voting.
    The above method extracted 461 distinct VPC types occurring at least 50 times, attested in a total of 110,199 sentences.
    After partitioning the sentence data by type, we randomly selected 5 sentences for each VPC type.
    We then randomly selected 40 VPC types (with 5 sentences each) to use in the entailment experiment.
    That is, all results described in this paper are over 40 VPC types.
    28 participants took part in our initial experiment.
    They were all native speakers of English, recruited by advertisements posted to newsgroups and mailing lists.
