 classification-based coreference resolver, modeled after the systems of Ng and Cardie (2002b) and Bengtson and Roth (2008).
    First it classifies pairs of CEs as coreferent or not coreferent, pairing each identified CE with all preceding CEs.
    The CEs are then clustered into coreference chains2 based on the pairwise decisions.
    RECONCILE has a pipeline architecture with four main steps: preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, and clustering.
    We will refer to the specific configuration of RECONCILE used for this paper as RECONCILEACL09.
    Preprocessing.
    The RECONCILEACL09 preprocessor applies a series of language analysis tools (mostly publicly available software packages) to the source texts.
    The OpenNLP toolkit (Baldridge, J., 2005) performs tokenization, sentence splitting, and part-of-speech tagging.
    The Berkeley parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) generates phrase structure parse trees, and the de Marneffe et al. (2006) system produces dependency relations.
    We employ
