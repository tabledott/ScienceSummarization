rs of roles.
    Test sentences were parsed, were annotated with these features, and were then passed through the classifiers.
    Our system achieves 82% accuracy in identifying the semantic role of presegmented constituents.
    At the more difficult task of simultaneously segmenting constituents and identifying their semantic role, the system achieved 65% precision and 61% recall.
    Our study also allowed us to compare the usefulness of different features and feature combination methods in the semantic role labeling task.
    We also explore the integration of role labeling with statistical syntactic parsing and attempt to generalize to predicates unseen in the training data.
  
  
    We present a system for identifying the semantic relationships, or semantic roles, filled by constituents of a sentence within a semantic frame.
    Given an input sentence and a target word and frame, the system labels constituents with either abstract semantic roles, such as AGENT or PATIENT, or more domain-specific sema
