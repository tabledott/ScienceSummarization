ral and the non-literal meaning.
    Our technique relies on these meaning being highly distinct.
    If the meanings are similar, it is likely that local context will be inadequate to distinguish a compositional from a non-compositional use of the expression.
    In our investigation it became apparent, in fact, that in the newspaper genre, highly idiomatic expressions such as ins Wasser fallen were often
  
  
    To summarize, in order to classify an MWE as non-compositional, we compute an approximation of its compositional meaning and compare this with the meaning of the expression as it is used on the whole.
    One of the obvious improvements to the algorithm could come from better models for simulating compositional meaning.
    A further issue that can be explored is whether linguistic preprocessing would influence the results.
    We worked only on raw text data.
    There is some evidence (Baldwin et al., 2003) that part of speech tagging might improve results in this kind of task.
    We also only
