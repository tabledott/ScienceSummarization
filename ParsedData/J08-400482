s Some of the coders in a study we carried out (Poesio and Artstein 2005) indicated the noun phrase engine E2 as antecedent for the second it in utterance 3.1, whereas others indicated the immediately preceding pronoun, which they had previously marked as having engine E2 as antecedent.
    Clearly, we do not want to consider these coders to be in disagreement.
    A solution to this dilemma has been proposed by Passonneau (2004): Use the emerging coreference sets as the &#8216;labels&#8217; for the purpose of calculating agreement.
    This requires using weighted measures for calculating agreement on such sets, and consequently it raises serious questions about weighted measures&#8212;in particular, about the interpretability of the results, as we will see shortly.
    4.4.1 Passonneau&#8217;s Proposal.
    Passonneau (2004) recommends measuring agreement on anaphoric annotation by using sets of mentions of discourse entities as labels, that is, the emerging anaphoric/coreference chains.
