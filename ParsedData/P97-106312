ds (Melamed, 1997).
    To account for this difference, we can estimate separate values of A+ and A- for different ranges of n(&#8222;,v).
    Similarly, the hidden parameters can be conditioned on the linked parts of speech.
    Word order can be taken into account by conditioning the hidden parameters on the relative positions of linked word tokens in their respective sentences.
    Just as easily, we can model links that coincide with entries in a pre-existing translation lexicon separately from those that do not.
    This method of incorporating dictionary information seems simpler than the method proposed by Brown et al. for their models (Brown et al., 1993b).
    When the hidden parameters are conditioned on different link classes, the estimation method does not change; it is just repeated for each link class.
  
  
    A word-to-word model of translational equivalence can be evaluated either over types or over tokens.
    It is impossible to replicate the experiments used to evaluate other translation
