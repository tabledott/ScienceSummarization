desktop computer, except step 3, finding the phrases for each word pair, which used a 16 CPU Beowulf cluster.
    Most of the other steps are parallelizable; with a bit of programming effort, they could also be executed on the Beowulf cluster.
    All CPUs (both desktop and cluster) were 2.4 GHz Intel Xeons.
    The desktop computer had 2 GB of RAM and the cluster had a total of 16 GB of RAM. from Turney and Littman (2005).
    As mentioned in Section 4.2, we estimate this corpus contained about 5 &#215; 1011 English words at the time the VSM-AV experiments took place.
    VSM-WMTS refers to the VSM using the WMTS, which contains about 5 &#215; 1010 English words.
    We generated the VSM-WMTS results by adapting the VSM to the WMTS.
    The algorithm is slightly different from Turney and Littman&#8217;s (2005), because we used passage frequencies instead of document frequencies.
    All three pairwise differences in recall in Table 14 are statistically significant with 95% confidence, using the Fisher Exact
