constraint.
    This fraction is surprisingly small: It turns out that the bulk of the Master Metaphor List consists of subtle refinements of a few highly abstract metaphors.
    The concept pairs and corresponding domain pairs for the target metaphors in the Master Metaphor List are given in Table 18.
    A mapping discovered by CorMet is considered correct if submappings specified in the Master Metaphor List are nearly all present with high salience and incorrect submappings are present with comparatively low salience.
    The mappings discovered that best represent the targeted metaphors are shown in Table 19.
    Some of these test cases are marked successes.
    For instance, ECONOMIC HARM IS PHYSICAL INJURY seems to be captured by the mapping from the loss-3 cluster to the harm-1 cluster.
    CorMet found reasonable mappings in 10 of 13 cases attempted.
    This implies 77% accuracy, although in light of the small test and the subjectivity of judgment, this number must not be taken too seriously.
    So
