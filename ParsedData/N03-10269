sing the generator as a filter.
    The filtering is done by running each transferred structure through the generator to see whether it produces an output string.
    If it does not, the structure is rejected.
    For example, for the f-structure in Fig.
    1, the transfer system proposed 32 possible reductions.
    After filtering these structures by generation, 16 reduced f-structures comprising possible condensations of the input sentence survive.
    The 16 wellformed structures correspond to the following strings that were outputted by the generator (note that a single structure may correspond to more than one string and a given string may correspond to more than one structure): A prototype is ready.
    A prototype is ready for testing.
