make use of generation from resolved QLFs for confirmation by a user.
    Generation: There is a strong connection between monotonicity and reversibility in language processing systems.
    Monotonicity of unification means that algorithms such as head-driven generation (Shieber et a/ 1990) can be applied to grammars developed for analysis.
    We use a variant of this algorithm for generating from QLFs, and the monotonicity of semantic interpretation means that the grammar used for generating from unresolved QLFs (the normal 'output' of the grammar) can also be used for generation from resolved QLFs.
    In parallel to the distinction between grammatical analysis (of NL into unresolved QLFs) and interpretation, we make the distinction between grammatical synthesis (of NL from QLFs) and description.
    Description is the process of deriving a QLF from which synthesis proceeds by taking a fact (e.g. a database assertion) as input.
    We hope to report on our approach to description elsewhere.
    However, on
