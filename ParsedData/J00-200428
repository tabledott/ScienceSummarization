French and English have very similar word order.
    A word order correlation bias, as well as the phrase structure biases in Brown et al. 's (1993b) Models 4 and 5, would be less beneficial with noisier training bitexts or for language pairs with less similar word order.
    Nevertheless, one should use all available information sources, if one wants to build the best possible translation model.
    Section 5.3 suggests a way to add the word order correlation bias to the models presented in this article.
    At about the same time that I developed the models in this article, Hiemstra (1996) independently developed his own bag-to-bag model of translational equivalence.
    His model is also based on a one-to-one assumption, but it differs from my models in that it allows empty words in only one of the two bags, the one representing the shorter sentence.
    Thus, Hiemstra's model is similar to the first model in Section 5, but it has a little less explanatory power.
    Hiemstra's approach also differs from m
