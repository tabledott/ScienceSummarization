changeable at the solution of the parameter estimation equations, since the model is assumed to be able to represent correctly the data at that solution point.
    In practice, the data may not come exactly from the chosen model class, but the model obtained by solving the estimation equations may still be the closest one to the data.
  
  
    While variations of p(nic) and p(vic) in equation (4) are not independent, we can treat them separately.
    First, for fixed average distortion between the cluster centroid distributions p(i)lc) and the data p(vin), we find the cluster membership probabilities, which are the Bayes inverses of the p(n1c), that maximize the entropy of the cluster distributions.
    With the membership distributions thus obtained, we then look for the p(vic) that maximize the log likelihood /(S).
    It turns out that this will also be the values of p(v lc) that minimize the average distortion between the asymmetric cluster model and the data.
    Given any similarity measure d(n, c) bet
