rs somewhere to the right, 'nil' otherwise.
    The parse tree of Figure 4.3 shows the variable values when the grammar of Figure 4.2 is used to analyse the noun phrase &amp;quot;the man that John met&amp;quot;.
    Intuitively, we either can see noun phrases moving to the left, leaving traces behind, or traces appearing from markers and moving to the right.
    In a phrase &amp;quot;noun phrase(Hole 1 ,Hole2)&amp;quot;, Holel will have the value 'trace' when a trace occurs somewhere to the right of the left end of the phrase.
    In that case, Hole2 will be 'nil' if the noun phrase contains the trace, 'trace' if the trace appears to the right of the right end of this noun phrase.
    Thus, rule (2) in Figure 4.2 specifies that a noun phrase expands into a trace if a trace appears from the left, and as this trace is now placed, it will not be found further to the right.
    The non-terminal 'relative' has no arguments, because the complex-NP constraint prevents noun phrases from moving out of a relative claus
