e to the concepts in the projective conclusion space of tape, as mentioned in Section 1.
    To illustrate this procedure on another semantic category, consider the term mouse in its computer artifact sense.
    In our corpus, it appears in the object position of the verb use in a &amp;quot;use NP to&amp;quot; construction, as well as the object of the preposition with following a transitive verb and its object: These constructions are symptomatic of its role as an instrument; and the VP complement of to as well as the VP dominating the with-PP identify the telic predicates for the noun.
    Other verbs, for which mouse appears as a direct object are currently defaulted into the formal role, resulting in an entry for mouse as follows: The above experiments have met with limited success, enough to warrant continuing our application of lexical semantic theory to knowledge acquisition from corpora, but not enough to remove the human from the loop.
    As they currently exist, the algorithms described here can be
