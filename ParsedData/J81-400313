he constructions which involve left extraposition.
    With extraposition grammars, I attempt to provide a formalism in which such rules can be written.
    In this informal introduction to the XG formalism, I will avoid the extra complications of non-terminal arguments.
    So, in the discussion that follows, we may look at XGs as an extension of CFGs.
    Sometimes it is easier to look at grammar rules in the left-to-right, or synthesis, direction.
    I will say then that a rule is being used to expand or rewrite a string.
    In other cases, it is easier to look at a rule in the rightto-left, or analysis, direction.
    I will say then that the rule is being used to analyse a string.
    Let us first look at the following XG fragment: sentence --&gt; noun_phrase, verb_phrase. noun_phrase --&gt; determiner, noun, relative. noun_phrase --&gt; trace. relative --&gt; [ 1. relative --&gt; rel marker, sentence. rel marker ... trace --&gt; rel pronoun.
    All rules but the last are context-free.
