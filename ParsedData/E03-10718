    CCG supertagging is more difficult than POS tagging because the set of &amp;quot;tags&amp;quot; assigned by the supertagger is much larger (398 in this implementation, compared with 45 POS tags).
    The supertagger assigns CCG lexical categories (Steedman, 2000) which encode subcategorisation information.
    Table 1 gives some examples.
    The features used by each tagger are binary valued, and pair a tag with various elements of the context; for example: fi(x ) = { 1 if word(x)= the &amp; y = DT ,y
  
  
    (12) word(x) = the is an example of what Ratnaparkhi calls a contextual predicate.
    The contextual predicates used by the two taggers are given in Table 2, where w, is the ith word and ti is the ith tag.
    We insert a special end of sentence symbol at sentence boundaries so that the features looking forwards and backwards are always defined.
    The supertagger uses POS tags as additional features, which Clark (2002) found improved performance significantly, and does
