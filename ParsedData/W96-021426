mance between his results and ours must be due to an extraordinarily fortuitous choice of test data.
    It would be very interesting to see how our algorithm performed on Bod's split into test and training, but he has not provided us with this split.
    Bod did examine versions of DOP that smoothed, allowing productions which did not occur in the training set; however his reference to coverage is with respect to a version which does no smoothing.
    In order to perform our analysis, we must determine certain details of Bod's parser which affect the probability of having most sentences correctly parsable.
    When using a chart parser, as Bod did, three problematic cases must be handled: &#8364; productions, unary productions, and n-ary (n&gt; 2) productions.
    The first two kinds of productions can be handled with a probabilistic chart parser, but large and difficult matrix manipulations are required (Stolcke, 1993); these manipulations would be especially difficult given the size of Bod's grammar.
