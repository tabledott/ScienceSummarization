uments that could not contain any of the query terms (Smeaton et al., 1995).
    However, it has produced few successful experiments.
    For instance, (Voorhees, 1994) manually expanded 50 queries over a TREC-1 collection (Harman, 1993) using synonymy and other semantic relations from WordNet 1.3.
    Voorhees found that the expansion was useful with short, incomplete queries, and rather useless for complete topic statements -where other expansion techniques worked better-.
    For short queries, it remained the problem of selecting the expansions automatically: doing it badly could degrade retrieval performance rather than enhancing it.
    In (Richardson and Smeaton, 1995), a combination of rather sophisticated techniques based on WordNet, including automatic disambiguation and measures of semantic relatedness between query/document concepts resulted in a drop of effectiveness.
    Unfortunately, the effects of WSD errors could not be discerned from the accuracy of the retrieval strategy.
    However, in (
