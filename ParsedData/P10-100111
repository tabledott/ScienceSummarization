    The algorithm progresses from small widths to large in the usual manner, but after defining the endpoints (i, j) there is an additional loop that enumerates all possible grandparents.
    Since each derivation is defined by three fixed indices (the g-span) and one free index (the split point), the complexity of the algorithm is O(n4) time and O(n3) space.
    Note that the grandparent indices cause each gspan to have non-contiguous structure.
    For example, in Figure 4(a) the words between g and h will be controlled by some other g-span.
    Due to these discontinuities, the correctness of the Model 0 dynamic-programming algorithm may not be immediately obvious.
    While a full proof of correctness is beyond the scope of this paper, we note that each structure on the right-hand side of Figure 4 lies completely within the structure on the left-hand side.
    This nesting of structures implies, in turn, that the usual properties required to ensure the correctness of dynamic programming hold.
    We now
