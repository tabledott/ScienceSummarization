 the multiple reference translations for the sentence.
    We then evaluated the quality of these &#8220;oracle&#8221; translations with all error measures.
    In a contrastive experiment, for each sentence we simply selected the translation with the lowest WER from the original 4 MT system outputs.
    Table 6 shows that the potential for improvement is significantly larger for the consensus-based combination of translation outputs than for simple selection of the best translation1.
    In our future work, we plan to improve the scoring of hypotheses in the confusion networks to explore this large potential.
    Some state-of-the-art speech translation systems can translate either the first best recognition hypotheses or the word lattices of an ASR system.
    It has been previously shown that word lattice input generally improves translation quality.
    In practice, however, the translation system may choose, for some sentences, the paths in the lattice with many recognition errors and thus produce inferi
