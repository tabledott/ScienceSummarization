ed by the argument and value categories.
			But often, syntacticians want to make more fine grained distinctions.
			An example is VP modification.
			In a traditional categorial grammar, two different VP modifiers, lets say an adverb and an adverbial clause, would receive the same translation.
			(12) Peter called him angrily N (S\N)fN N (S\N)/(S~q) (13) Peter called him at work N (S\N)/N N (S\N)/(S~aN) 190 But what should be the category for very?
			If it receives the category ((S\N)\(S\N))/((S\N)\(S~N)) to allow the derivation of (14), the ungrammatical sentence (15) is also permitted.
			(14) Peter called him very angrily N (S\N)/N N ((S\N)\(SLN))/ (S\N)/(S~X\[) ((S\N)\(S~N')) (15) *Peter called him very N (S\N)/N N ((S\N)\(S~))/ ((S\N)\(S\N)) at work (S\N)/(S~) If functor categories are permitted to carry features of their own that are not necessarily bound to to any features of their argument and value categories, this problem disappears.
			Adverbs and adverbial clauses could receive different feature
