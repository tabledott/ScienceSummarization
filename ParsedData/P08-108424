in our corpus of short parallel phrases, we preprocessed each language pair using the Giza++ alignment toolkit.6 Given word alignments for each language pair, we extract a list of phrase pairs that form independent sets in the bipartite alignment graph.
    This process allows us to group together phrases like fy s.bah. in Arabic and bbqr in Hebrew while being reasonably certain that all the relevant morphemes are contained in the short extracted phrases.
    The number of words in such phrases ranges from one to four words in the Semitic languages and up to six words in English.
    Before performing any experiments, a manual inspection of the generated parallel phrases revealed that many infrequent phrase pairs occurred merely as a result of noisy translation and alignment.
    Therefore, we eliminated all parallel phrases that occur fewer than five times.
    As a result of this process, we obtain 6,139 parallel short phrases in Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, and English.
