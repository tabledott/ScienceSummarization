    The first attempts at automated sense disambiguation were made in the context of machine translation (MT).
    In his famous memorandum (available mimeographed in 1949, but not printed until 1955) Weaver discusses the need for WSD in machine translation and outlines the basis of an approach to WSD that underlies all subsequent work on the topic: If one examines the words in a book, one at a time as through an opaque mask with a hole in it one word wide, then it is obviously impossible to determine, one at a time, the meaning of the words....
    But if one lengthens the slit in the opaque mask, until one can see not only the central word in question but also say N words on either side, then if N is large enough one can unambiguously decide the meaning of the central word....
    The practical question is: &amp;quot;What minimum value of N will, at least in a tolerable fraction of cases, lead to the correct choice of meaning for the central word?&amp;quot; (1955, 20) A well-known early
