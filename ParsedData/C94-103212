tart position of the last word in addition to tim combined state.
  This distinction is crucial for the proposed N best algorithm, l"or tim tbrward search to tind a parse that maximizes Equation (1), it is the parts of speech se- quence that matters.
  For the backward N-best search, how(wet, we want N most likely word segmentation and part of speech sequence.
  Parse-list may shadow less probable candidates that have the same part of speech sc:qnence for the best scoring candidate, but differ in tim segmentaL,on of the last word.
  As shown in Figure 1, path-map is made during the forward search by the function reg is ter -parse - to -path -map,  which regis- ters a parse  structure to path-map and maintains the best partial parses in the tables criteria.
  Now we describe the central part of tim backward A* search algorithm.
  But we assume that the readers know the A* algorithm, and exphtin only the way we applied the algorithm to the problem.
  We consider a parse structure ,~q a state in A* search.
