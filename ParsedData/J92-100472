mple - in general there would be multiple ways to get to a particular next word, and there are also constraints which kill certain paths and make it necessary to readjust probabilities on the fly.
    In practice, one must find all possible ways to extend a word sequence, computing total path probability for each one, and then renormalize to assure that with probability 1.0 there is an advance to some next word.
    It is the normalized probability contribution of all paths that can reach the next word that is used to update the log P calculation.
  
  
    This research has benefited significantly from interactions with Lynette Hirschman and Victor Zue.
    In addition, Jim Glass, David Goodine, and Christine Pao have all made significant contributions to the programming of the TINA system, for which I am deeply grateful.
    I would also like to thank several anonymous reviewers for their careful critiques, the outcome of which was a substantially improved document.
