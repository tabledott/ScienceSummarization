ing data did not result in a significant improvement in transliteration performance.
    We continue to believe that careful data-selection is the key to successful use of this beta-release of the LDC Named Entity corpus.
    We therefore went back to Step 3 of the procedure outlined above, where we had used alignment scores from an MT system to select &#8220;good&#8221; sentence-pairs from our training data, and instead of using the MT system trained in Step 2 immediately preceding it, we used the previously built Big MT system of Section 2.1, which we know is trained on a small but clean data-set of 3625 namepairs.
    With a similar threshold as above, we again selected roughly 300K name-pairs, being careful to leave out any pair which appears in the 3122 pair test set described above, and reestimated the entire phoneme-to-GIF translation system on this new corpus.
    We evaluated this system on the 3122 namepair test set for transliteration performance, and the results are included in Table 3.
