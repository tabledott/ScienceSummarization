bly useful features.
    We investigated scoring each remaining type based on its estimated ability to predict (positively or negatively) a particular grade.
    We used a form of Log-Odds Ratio, which has been shown to give superior performance for multinomial na&#239;ve Bayes classifiers (Mladenic and Grobelnik, 1998).
    Our modified Log-Odds measure computes the largest absolute change in loglikelihood between a given grade and all other grades.
    We tried various thresholds for our Log-Odds measure and found that the highest accuracy was achieved by using all remaining features.
    We found that we could reduce prediction variance with two changes to the model.
    First, rather than choosing the single most likely grade language model, we calculate the average grade level of the top N results, weighted by the relative differences in likelihood (essentially the expected class).
    The tradeoff is a small bias toward the middle grades.
    All results reported here use this averaging method, with N=2
