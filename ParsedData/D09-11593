#8221; and &#8220;recommend&#8221;.
    The example shows that more than one relation may appear in a sentence, and the correct relations are not simple Cartesian product of opinion expressions and product features.
    Simple inspection of the data reveals that product features usually contain more than one word, such as &#8220;LCD screen&#8221;, &#8220;image color&#8221;, &#8220;Canon PowerShot SD500&#8221;, and so on.
    An incomplete product feature will confuse the successive analysis.
    For example, in passage &#8220;Image color is disappointed&#8221;, the negative sentiment becomes obscure if only &#8220;image&#8221; or &#8220;color&#8221; is picked out.
    Since a product feature could not be represented by a single word, dependency parsing might not be the best approach here unfortunately, which provides dependency relations only between words.
    Previous works on relation extraction usually use the head word to represent the whole phrase and extract features from the word level dependency tree
