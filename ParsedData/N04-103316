h will perform better than what the preceding estimates indicate.
    The reason is that we assumed a perfect nonmonotone search, which is difficult to achieve in practice.
    This is not only a hard search problem, but also a complicated modeling problem.
    We will see in the next section that the monotone search will perform very well on both the Xerox task and the Canadian Hansards task.
  
  
    So far, in machine translation research a single generally accepted criterion for the evaluation of the experimental results does not exist.
    Therefore, we use a variety of different criteria.
    The WER is computed as the minimum number of substitution, insertion and deletion operations that have to be performed to convert the generated sentence into the reference sentence.
    A shortcoming of the WER is that it requires a perfect word order.
    The word order of an acceptable sentence can be different from that of the target sentence, so that the WER measure alone could be misleading.
    The PER compa
