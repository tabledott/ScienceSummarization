CMC.
			As Figure 2 shows, when the Dirichlet prior parameter ?r approaches 0 the priorprobability PD(?r|?)
			becomes increasingly concen trated around 0.
			This ability to bias the sampler toward sparse grammars (i.e., grammars in which many productions have probabilities close to 0) isuseful when we attempt to identify relevant produc tions from a much larger set of possible productions via parameter estimation.The Bantu language Sesotho is a richly agglutina tive language, in which verbs consist of a sequence of morphemes, including optional Subject Markers (SM), Tense (T), Object Markers (OM), Mood (M) and derivational affixes as well as the obligatory Verb stem (V), as shown in the following example: re SM -a T -di OM -bon V -a M ?We see them?
			1It is easy to demonstrate that the poor quality of the PCFG models is the cause of these problems rather than search or other algorithmic issues.
			If one initializes either the IO or Bayesian estimation procedures with treebank parses and then runs theproce
