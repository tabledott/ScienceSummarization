classic intuition that dependency paths are a good approximation to semantic relations between words (Grefenstette 1994; Curran and Moens 2002; Pad&#180;o and Lapata 2007; Rothenh&#168;ausler and Sch&#168;utze 2009).
    DepDM is also the model with the least degree of link lexicalization among the three DM instances we have built (its only lexicalized links are prepositions).
    LDepDM includes the following noun&#8211;verb, noun&#8211;noun, and adjective&#8211;noun links (in order to select more reliable dependencies and filter out possible parsing errors, dependencies between words with more than five intervening items were discarded): sbj intr: subject of a verb that has no direct object: The teacher is singing -4 (teacher, sbj intr, sing); The soldier talked with his sergeant -4 (soldier, sbj intr, talk); sbj tr: subject of a verb that occurs with a direct object: The soldier is reading a book -4 (soldier, sbj tr, read); obj: direct object: The soldier is reading a book -4 (book, obj, read); iobj: indir
