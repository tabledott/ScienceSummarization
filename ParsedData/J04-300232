nt over baseline of 0.16.
    The difference in the proportion of words that are unique in opinion pieces and the proportion of words that are unique in nonopinion pieces is highly significant, with p &lt; 0.001 (z &#8805; 22) for all of the data sets.
    Note that not only does the set of unique words have higher than baseline precision, the set is a frequent feature.
    The question arises, how does corpus size affect the precision of the set of unique words?
    Presumably, uniqueness in a larger corpus is more meaningful than uniqueness in a smaller one.
    The results in Figure 1 provide evidence that it is.
    The y-axis in Figure 1 represents increase in precision over baseline and the x-axis represents corpus size.
    Five graphs are plotted, one for the set of words that appear exactly once (uniques), one for the set of words that appear exactly twice ( freq2), one for the set of words that appear exactly three times ( freq3), etc.
    In Figure 1, increases in precision are given for corpora of
