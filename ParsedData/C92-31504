 occurrences in text of a terminological unit systematically refer to a concept, that a relationship of representation is established, out of any textual context, between the terminological unit and the concept.
  This underpins the specific status of the terminological unit as opposed to that of the word in language, a status close to that of a descriptor in Information Science ([Le Guern 1984]).
  Syntactic form : synaptic composition We put forward the hypothesis that his function of representing the concept out of context puts a certain number of constraints on the form that terminological units may take on.
  It has been seen that he construction of terminological units obey well-known rules of syntactic formation, called synaptic composition ([Benveniste 1966]).
  For example : terminological units are noun phrases, generally made up of nouns and adjectives, and pratically never containing conjugated verbs; the prepositions used most often are "de" and "~", rarely followed by a determiner.
