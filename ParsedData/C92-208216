 text corpora includes Brents (Brent 1991) verb subcategorization frame recognition technique and Smadjas (Smadja &amp; McKeown 1990) collocation ac- quisition algorithm.
  (Calzolari &amp; Bindi 1990) use corpus-based statistical association ratios to deter- mine lexical information such as prepositional com- plementation relations, modification relations, and significant compounds.
  Our methodology is similar to Brents in its effort to distinguish clear pieces of evidence from ambigu- ous ones.
  The assumption is that that given a large enough corpus, the algorithm can afford wait until it encounters clear examples.
  Brents algorithm re- lies on a clever trick: in the configuration of interest (in this case, verb valence descriptions), where noun phrases are the source of ambiguity, it uses only sen- tences which have pronouns in the crucial position, since pronouns do not allow this ambiguity.
  This approach is qnite effective, but the disadvantage is that it isnt clear that it is applicable to any oth
