g from 5 to 20 keywords (e.g.
    (Turney, 1999) limits the number of keywords extracted with his GenEx system to five), we are using a more flexible approach, which decides the number of keywords based on the size of the text.
    For the data used in our experiments, which consists of relatively short abstracts, is set to a third of the number of vertices in the graph.
    During post-processing, all lexical units selected as potential keywords by the TextRank algorithm are marked in the text, and sequences of adjacent keywords are collapsed into a multi-word keyword.
    For instance, in the text Matlab code for plotting ambiguity functions, if both Matlab and code are selected as potential keywords by TextRank, since they are adjacent, they are collapsed into one single keyword Matlab code.
    Figure 2 shows a sample graph built for an abstract from our test collection.
    While the size of the abstracts ranges from 50 to 350 words, with an average size of 120 words, we have deliberately selected a very
