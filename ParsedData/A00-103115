rning curve of the tagger, i.e., the accuracy depending on the amount of training data.
    Training length is the number of tokens used for training.
    Each training length was tested ten times, training and test sets were randomly chosen and disjoint, results were averaged.
    The training length is given on a logarithmic scale.
    It is remarkable that tagging accuracy for known words is very high even for very small training corpora.
    This means that we have a good chance of getting the right tag if a word is seen at least once during training.
    Average percentages of unknown tokens are shown in the bottom line of each diagram.
    We exploit the fact that the tagger not only determines tags, but also assigns probabilities.
    If there is an alternative that has a probability &amp;quot;close to&amp;quot; that of the best assignment, this alternative can be viewed as almost equally well suited.
    The notion of &amp;quot;close to&amp;quot; is expressed by the distance of probabilities, and this
