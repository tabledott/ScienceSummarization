erview Relaxation labeling is an unsupervised classification technique which takes as input: a) a set of objects (e.g., words) b) a set of labels (e.g., SO labels) c) initial probabilities for each object?s possible labels d) the definition of an object o?s neighborhood (a set of other objects which influence the choice of o?s label) e) the definition of neighborhood features f) the definition of a support function for an object labelThe influence of an object o?s neighborhood on its label L is quantified using the support function.
			The support function computes the probability of the label L being assigned to o as a function of o?s neighborhood fea tures.
			Examples of features include the fact that a certainlocal constraint is satisfied (e.g., the word nice partic ipates in the conjunction and together with some other word whose SO label is estimated to be positive).
			Relaxation labeling is an iterative procedure whoseoutput is an assignment of labels to objects.
			At each itera tion, the algorithm u
