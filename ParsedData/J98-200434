f data at this level.
    At a low edge count, very few sentences have actually been parsed, and since these sentences tend to be short and simple, the parses are likely to be correct.
    The sentences that could not be parsed do not contribute to the measurement of precision.
    As more sentences are parsed, precision settles at about 47%, the highest precision attainable by our particular test grammar, and remains there as edge counts increase.
    Recall of the best parse found in a fixed number of edges for the estimates.
    Recall of the best parse found in a fixed number of edges for the boundary estimates.
    Caraballo and Charniak Figures of Merit This level of precision is independent of the figure of merit used, so measurement of precision does not help evaluate our figures of merit.
    A much more useful measure is recall.
    Recall is defined as the percentage of constituents in the treebank test data that are found by our parser.
    Again, we measured the recall of the best parse of each s
