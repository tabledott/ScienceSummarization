ll the nouns to obtain a single learning curve representing all the nouns.
    In Figure 2, the curve r represents the adaptation process of the baseline approach, where additional WSJ examples are randomly selected during each adaptation iteration.
    The adaptation process using active learning is represented by the curve a, while applying count-merging with active learning is represented by the curve a-c.
    Note that random selection r achieves its highest WSD accuracy after all the adaptation examples are added.
    To reach the same accuracy, the a approach requires the addition of only 57% of adaptation examples.
    The a-c approach is even more effective and requires only 42% of adaptation examples.
    This demonstrates the effectiveness of count-merging in further reducing the annotation effort, when compared to using only active learning.
    To reach the MFS accuracy of 61.1% as shown earlier in Table 1, a-c requires just 4% of the adaptation examples.
