    We have presented an introduction to the CoNLL-2000 shared task: dividing text into syntactically related non-overlapping groups of words, so-called text chunking.
    For this task we have generated training and test data from the Penn Treebank.
    This data has been processed by eleven systems.
    The best performing system was a combination of Support Vector Machines submitted by Taku Kudoh and Yuji Matsumoto.
    It obtained an Fo=1 score of 93.48 on this task.
