ish ends in -ing, then it is quite likely to be a present participle.
    We can distinguish this sort of information, which perhaps could better be called orthotactic or phonotactic information from a richer sort which incorporates relational information between the words &#8212; thus given a novel word that ends in &amp;quot;ing&amp;quot; such as &amp;quot;derailing&amp;quot; one could use the information that we had already seen the token &amp;quot;derailed&amp;quot; as additional evidence.
    One way to incorporate this simple source of information would be to use a mixture of string models alone, without distributional evidence.
    Some preliminary experiments not reported here established that this approach could only separate out the most basic differences, such as sequences of numbers.
    A more powerful approach is to combine the distributional information with the morphological information by composing the Ney-Essen clustering model with a model for the morphology within a Bayesian framework.
