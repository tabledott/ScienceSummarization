 which is the mean and the standard deviation over the sample .
    The statistic indicates how far and in which direction the frequency of occurrence of the pair in pattern deviates from the sample&#8217;s mean, expressed in units of the sample&#8217;s standard deviation.
    To decide whether is a canonical pattern for the target pair, we check whether , where is a threshold.
    For evaluation, we set to , based on the distribution of and through examining the development data.
    We evaluate the appropriateness of this approach in determining the Cform(s) of idiomatic pairs by verifying its predicted forms against ODCIE and CCID.
    Specifically, for each of the idiomatic pairs in TEST , we calculate the precision and recall of its predicted Cforms (those whose -scores are above ), compared to the Cforms listed in the two dictionaries.
    The average precision across the 100 test pairs is 81.7%, and the average recall is 88.0% (with 69 of the pairs having 100% precision and 100% recall).
    Moreover,
