    This is the purpose of the scanning The elements SCAN-I, OPP-1, etc., are part of a network provided to the Penman structurer by PEA.
    These elements are defined as propositions in a property-inheritance network of the usual kind written in NIKL aSchmolze dc Lipkis 831, [Kaczmarek et al. 861), a descendant of KL.. ONE Prachman 78D.
    Some input for this example sentence is: The relations are used as plans; their intended effects are interpreted as the goals they achieve.
    In other words, in order to bring about the state in which both speaker and hearer know that OPP-1 is the purpose of SCAN-1 (and know that they both know it, etc.
    ), the structurer uses Purpose as a plan and tries to satisfy its constraints.
    In this system, constraints and goals are interchangable; for example, in the event that (RESULT SCAN-1 FIND-1) is believed not known by the hearer, satellite constraint 3 of the Purpose relation simply becomes the goal to achieve (BMB S H (RESULT SCAN-1 FIND-1)).
