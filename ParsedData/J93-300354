tokens we both judged sentential, 361 (67.2%) fit one of the prosodic sentential models.
    The overall ratio of cue phrases judged discourse to those judged sentential was about 2:3.
    A X2 test shows significance at the .001 level.'
    While these results are highly significant, they clearly do not match the previous findings for now and well discussed in Section 4, in which all but three tokens fit our model.
    So, for this larger study, the tokens which did not fit our prosodic model remain to be explained.
    In fact, there is some regularity among these counter-examples.
    For example, 8 (20%) of the items judged discourse that did not fit our discourse prosodic model were tokens of the cue phrase say.
    All of these failed to fit our prosodic discourse model by virtue of the fact that they occurred in noninitial phrasal position; such items are illustrated in Example 8.
    Of the 176 items judged sentential that failed to fit our sentential prosodic model, 138 (78.4%) were conjunctions.
