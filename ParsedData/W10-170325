n particular, Bleu performed in the bottom half of the into-English and out-of-English directions.
    The method employed to collect human judgments of rank preferences at the segment level produces a sparse matrix of decision points.
    It is unclear whether attempts to normalize the segment level rankings to 0.0&#8211;1.0 values, representing the relative rank of a system per segment given the number of comparisons it is involved with, is proper.
    An intuitive display of how well metrics mirror the human judgments may be shown via a confusion matrix.
    We compare the human ranks to the ranks as determined by a metric.
    Below, we show an example of the confusion matrix for the SVM-rank metric which had the highest summed diagonal (occurrences when a particular rank by the metric&#8217;s score exactly matches the human judgments) for all segments translated into English.
    The numbers provided are percentages of the total count.
    The summed diagonal constitutes 39.01% of all counts in this exam
