is now assumed to be generated in the following three step process: where Lo is defined as a special NULL symbol.
    Thus the previous modifier, Li_1, is added to the conditioning context (in the previous model the left modifiers had probability Introducing bigram-dependencies into the parsing model improved parsing accuracy by about 0.9 % (as shown in Table 3).
    Part of speech (POS) tags serve an important role in statistical parsing by providing the model with a level of generalization as to how classes of words tend to behave, what roles they play in sentences, and what other classes they tend to combine with.
    Statistical parsers of English typically make use of the roughly 50 POS tags used in the Penn Treebank corpus, but the Czech PDT corpus provides a much richer set of POS tags, with over 3000 possible tags defined by the tagging system and over 1000 tags actually found in the corpus.
    Using that large a tagset with a training corpus of only 19,000 sentences would lead to serious sparse data
