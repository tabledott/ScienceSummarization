y paths that derive c from X.
    This is the justification for the way these probabilities can be used in modified prediction and completion steps, described next.
    4.7.2 Prediction with null productions.
    Prediction is mediated by the left-corner relation.
    For each X occurring to the right of a dot, we generate states for all Y that are reachable from X by way of the X &#8212;&gt;L Y relation.
    This reachability criterion has to be extended in the presence of null productions.
    Specifically, if X has a production X ---&gt; Y,_i Y,A then Y, is a left corner of X iff Yi, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , Y,_1 all have a nonzero probability of expanding to &#8364;.
    The contribution of such a production to the left-corner probability P(X --&gt;L Y1) is The old prediction procedure can now be modified in two steps.
    First, replace the old PL relation by the one that takes into account null productions, as sketched above.
    From the resulting PL compute the reflexive transitive closure RL, and use
