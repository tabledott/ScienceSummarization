maller data sets, the sustained increase is probably due to observing more data with different supertag contexts, which enables the model to select better target language phrases.
    Adding a grammaticality factor As described in section 4.3, we integrate an impoverished grammaticality factor based on two standard CCG combination operations, namely Forward and Backward Application.
    Table 6 compares the results of the baseline, the CCG with an n-gram LM-only system (CCG-LARGE) and CCG-LARGE with this &#8216;grammaticalized&#8217; LM system (CCG-LARGE-GRAM).
    We see that bringing the grammaticality tests to bear onto the supertagged system gives a further improvement of 0.79 BLEU points, a 1.7% relative increase, culminating in an overall increase of 2.7 BLEU points, or a 6.1% relative improvement over the baseline system.
    A natural question to ask is whether LTAG and CCG supertags are playing similar (overlapping, or conflicting) roles in practice.
