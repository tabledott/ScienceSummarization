 al., 1993; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993).
    However, in our case, more indirect relations can also be clues for paraphrasing, because we know a priori that input sentences convey the same information.
    For example, in sentences from Figure 3, the verbs &#8220;ringing&#8221; and &#8220;sounding&#8221; do not share identical subject nouns, but the modifier of both subjects &#8220;Evening&#8221; is identical.
    Can we conclude that identical modifiers of the subject imply verb similarity?
    To address this question, we need a way to identify contexts that are good predictors for paraphrasing in a corpus.
    To find &#8220;good&#8221; contexts, we can analyze all contexts surrounding identical words in the pairs of aligned sentences, and use these contexts to learn new paraphrases.
    This provides a basis for a bootstrapping mechanism.
    Starting with identical words in aligned sentences as a seed, we can incrementally learn the &#8220;good&#8221; contexts, and in turn use them to learn new p
