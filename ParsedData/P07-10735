 multiple instance learning.
    However, there are important properties that set it apart from problems previously considered in MIL.
    The most distinguishing characteristic is that the number of bags is very small, while the average size of the bags is very large.
  
  
    Since its introduction by Dietterich (1997), an extensive and quite diverse set of methods have been proposed for solving the MIL problem.
    For the task of relation extraction, we consider only MIL methods where the decision function can be expressed in terms of kernels computed between bag instances.
    This choice was motivated by the comparatively high accuracy obtained by kernel-based SVMs when applied to various natural language tasks, and in particular to relation extraction.
    Through the use of kernels, SVMs (Vapnik, 1998; Sch&#168;olkopf and Smola, 2002) can work efficiently with instances that implicitly belong to a high dimensional feature space.
    When used for classification, the decision function computed by the
