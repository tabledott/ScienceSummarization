 relatively large value.
    Then we defined &#945;k = &#945;0 * 2&#8722;7k, where 77k is the number of times that L(u(k')) &gt; L(u(k'&#8722;1)) for k0 &lt; k. This learning rate drops at a rate of 1/21, where t is the number of times that the dual increases from one iteration to the next.
    See Koo et al. (2010) for a similar, but less aggressive step size used to solve a different task.
