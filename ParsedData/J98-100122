ck (1985), sets of microfeatures have to be manually primed by a user to activate a context for disambiguating a subsequent input word, but Bookman (1987) describes a dynamic process in which the microfeatures are automatically activated by the preceding text, thus acting as a short-term context memory.
    In addition to these local models (i.e., models in which one node corresponds to a single concept), distributed models have also been proposed (see, for example, Kawamoto [1988]).
    However, whereas local models can be constructed a priori, distributed models require a learning phase using disambiguated examples, which limits their practicality.
    The difficulty of hand-crafting the knowledge sources required for AI-based systems restricted them to &amp;quot;toy&amp;quot; implementations handling only a tiny fraction of the language.
    Consequently, disambiguation procedures embedded in such systems are most usually tested on only a very small test set in a limited context (most often, a single sente
