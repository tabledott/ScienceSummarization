defined based on the contribution of the word to the conditional entropy of the predicate.
    The association between each pair of words in the compound is then computed by taking the maximum selectional association from all possible ways of regarding the pair as predicate and argument.
    Whilst this association metric is complicated, the decision procedure still follows the outline devised by Marcus (1980) above.
    Resnik (1993) used unambiguous noun compounds from the parsed Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus to estimate the association N alues and analysed a test set of around 160 compounds.
    After some tuning, the accuracy was about 73%, as compared with a baseline of 64% achieved by always bracketing the first two nouns together.
    The fourth algorithm, first described in Lauer (1994), differs in one striking manner from the other three.
    It uses what I will call the DEPENDENCY MODEL.
    This model utilises the following procedure when given three nouns ni, n2 and n3: Figure 1 shows a graphic
