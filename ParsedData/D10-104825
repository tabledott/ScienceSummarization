transductive.
    Our work instead focuses on an approach that does not require access to the dataset beforehand.
    We thus did not include a similar semantic component in our system, given that running a bootstrapping learner whenever a new data set is encountered is not practical and, ultimately, reduces the usability of this NLP component.
    However, our results show that our sieve algorithm with minimal semantic information still performs as well as the Haghighi and Klein (2009) system with semantics.
    The sieve architecture offers benefits beyond improved accuracy.
    Its modular design provides a flexibility for features that is not available in most supervised or unsupervised systems.
    The sieve allows new features to be seamlessly inserted without affecting (or even understanding) the other components.
    For instance, once a new high precision feature (or group of features) is inserted as its own stage, it will benefit later stages with more precise clusters, but it will not interfere wit
