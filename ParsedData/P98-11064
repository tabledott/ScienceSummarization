hown by the example of Figure 2, which includes a non-projective arc (marked with a star).

    The non projective structures found in linguistics represent a small subset of the potential non projective structures.
    We will define a property (more exactly a family of properties), weaker than projectivity, called pseudo-projectivity, which describes a subset of the set of ordered dependency trees, containing the non-projective linguistic structures.
    In order to define pseudo-projectivity, we introduce an operation on dependency trees called lifting.
    When applied to a tree, this operation leads to the creation of a second tree, a lift of the first one.
    An ordered tree T' is a lift of the ordered tree T if and only if T and T' have the same nodes in the same order and for every node X, X+T &lt;TX&#177;T .
    We will say that the node x has been lifted from X+T (its syntactic governor) to X+Ti (its linear governor).
    Recall that the linear position of a node i
