ing labeled data.
    To test the flexibility of our language model approach, we did a preliminary study for French reading difficulty prediction.
    We created a corpus of 189 French Web pages labeled at 5 levels of difficulty, containing a total of 394,410 tokens and 27,632 types (unstemmed).
    The classification algorithm was identical to that used for English except for a minor change in the feature selection step.
    We found that, because of the inflected nature of French and the relatively small training set, we obtained better accuracy by normalizing types into &#8216;type families&#8217; by using a simplified stemming algorithm that removed plurals, masculine/feminine endings, and basic verb endings.
    A chart of the actual versus predicted difficulty label is shown in Figure 4.
    The classifier consistently underpredicts difficulty for the highest level, while somewhat over-predicting for the lowest level.
    This may be partly due to the bias toward central grades caused by averaging the t
