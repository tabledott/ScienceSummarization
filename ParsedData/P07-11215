 WASP, each SCFG production has the following form: where &#945; is an NL phrase and &#946; is the MR translation of &#945;.
    Both &#945; and &#946; are strings of terminal and nonterminal symbols.
    Each non-terminal in &#945; appears in &#946; exactly once.
    We use indices to show the correspondence between non-terminals in &#945; and &#946;.
    All derivations start with a pair of co-indexed start symbols, (S1 , S1 ).
    Each step of a derivation involves the rewriting of a pair of co-indexed non-terminals by the same SCFG production.
    The yield of a derivation is a pair of terminal strings, (e, f), where e is an NL sentence and f is the MR translation of e. For convenience, we call an SCFG production a rule throughout this paper.
    While WASP works well for target MRLs that are free of logical variables such as CLANG (Wong and Mooney, 2006), it cannot easily handle various kinds of logical forms used in computational semantics, such as predicate logic.
    The problem is that WASP lacks a p
