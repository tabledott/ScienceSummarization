extraction, Riloff (1993) builds a dictionary of patterns for filling slots in a specific domain such as terrorist attacks, and Riloff and Schmelzenbach (1998) extend this technique to derive automatically entire &#8220;case frames&#8221; for words in the domain.
    These last systems make use of a limited amount of hand labor to accept or reject automatically generated hypotheses.
    They show promise for a more sophisticated approach to generalizing beyond the relatively small number of frames considered in the tasks.
    More recently, a domain-independent system has been trained by Blaheta and Charniak (2000) on the function tags, such as MANNER and TEMPORAL, included in the Penn Treebank corpus.
    Some of these tags correspond to FrameNet semantic roles, but the Treebank tags do not include all the arguments of most predicates.
    In this article, we aim to develop a statistical system for automatically learning to identify all semantic roles for a wide variety of predicates in unrestricted text.
