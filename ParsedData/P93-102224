ly to members of the non-occurring set.
    Frequency based estimation, on the other hand, makes a much poorer distinction between the two sets.
    Figure 4 plots the two types of estimation for pairs in the occurring set as a function of their true frequency in the corpus.
    It can be seen that while the frequency based estimates are always low (by construction) the similarity based estimates are in most cases closer to the true value.
  
  
    In both evaluations, similarity based estimation performs better than frequency based estimation.
    This indicates that when trying to estimate cooccurrence probabilities, it is useful to consider the cooccurrence patterns of the specific words and not just their frequencies, as smoothing methods do.
    Comparing with class based models, our approach suggests the advantage of making the most specific analogies for each word, instead of making analogies with all members of a class, via general class parameters.
    This raises the question whether generalization
