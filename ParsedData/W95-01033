    The probability of the attachment variable A being 1 or 0 (signifying noun or verb attachment respectively) is a probability, p, which is conditional on the values of the words in the quadruple.
    In general a probabilistic algorithm will make an estimate, .75, of this probability: The decision can then be made using the test: If this is true the attachment is made to the noun, if not then it is made to the verb.
    When evaluating an algorithm it is useful to have an idea of the lower and upper bounds on its performance.
    Some key results are summarised in the table below.
    All results in this section are on the IBM training and test data, with the exception of the two 'average human' results.
    'Always noun attachment' means attach to the noun regardless of (v,n1,p,n2).
    'Most likely for each preposition' means use the attachment seen most often in training data for the preposition seen in the test quadruple.
    The human performance results are taken from [RRR94], and ar
