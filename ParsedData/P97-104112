    A very simple initial segmentation for Chinese is to consider each character a distinct word.
    Since the average word length is quite short in Chinese, with most words containing only 1 or 2 characters,6 this character-as-word segmentation correctly identified many one-character words and produced an initial segmentation score of F=40.3.
    While this is a low segmentation score, this segmentation algorithm identifies enough words to provide a reasonable initial segmentation approximation.
    In fact, the CAW algorithm alone has been shown (Buckley et al., 1996; Broglio et al., 1996) to be adequate to be used successfully in Chinese information retrieval.
    Our algorithm learned 5903 transformations from the 2000 sentence training set.
    The 5903 transformations applied to the test set improved the score from F=40.3 to 78.1, a 63.3% reduction in the error rate.
    This is a very surprising and encouraging result, in that, from a very naive initial approximation using no lexicon except th
