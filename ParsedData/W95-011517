    Simard et al. used the criterion that the first four characters must be identical for alphabetic tokens to be considered cognates [Sim92].
    Unfortunately, this criterion produces false negatives for pairs like &amp;quot;government&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;gouvernement&amp;quot;, and false positives for words with a great difference in length, like &amp;quot;conseil&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;conservative.&amp;quot; I used an approximate string matching algorithm to capture a more general notion of cognateness.
    Whether a pair of words is considered a cognate pair depends on the ratio of the length of their longest (not necessarily contiguous) common subsequence to the length of the longer word.
    This is called the Longest Common Subsequence Ratio (LCSR).
    For example, &amp;quot;gouvernement,&amp;quot; which is 12 letters long, has 10 letters that appear in the same order in &amp;quot;government.&amp;quot; So, the LCSR for these two words is 10/12.
    On the other hand, the LCSR for &amp;quot;con
