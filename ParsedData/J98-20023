    The case frame (case slot) pattern acquisition process consists of two phases: extraction of case frame instances from corpus data, and generalization of those instances to case frame patterns.
    The generalization step is needed in order to represent the input case frame instances more compactly as well as to judge the (degree of) acceptability of unseen case frame instances.
    For the extraction problem, there have been various methods proposed to date, which are quite adequate (Hindle and Rooth 1991; Grishman and Sterling 1992; Manning 1992; Utsuro, Matsumoto, and Nagao 1992; Brent 1993; Smadja 1993; Grefenstette 1994; Briscoe and Carroll 1997).
    The generalization problem, in contrast, is a more challenging one and has not been solved completely.
    A number of methods for generalizing values of a case frame slot for a verb have been proposed.
    Some of these methods make use of prior knowledge in the form of an existing thesaurus (Resnik 1993a, 1993b; Framis 1994; Almuallim et
