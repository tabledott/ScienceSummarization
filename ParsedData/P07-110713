aws are not (all) observed, we must now sample the unobserved ones as well as the entity indices Z.
    For instance, we could sample Ti,j, the entity type of pronominal mention j in document i, using, P(Ti,j|Z, N, G, H, T&#8722;i,j) &#8733; P(Ti,j|Z)P(Hi,j|T, N, G, H), where the posterior distributions on the right hand side are straightforward because the parameter priors are all finite Dirichlet.
    Sampling G and N are identical.
    Of course we have prior knowledge about the relationship between entity type and pronoun head choice.
    For example, we expect that he is used for mentions with T = PERSON.
    In general, we assume that for each pronominal head we have a list of compatible entity types, which we encode via the prior on 0.
    We assume 0 is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution where each pronoun head is given a synthetic count of (1 + AP) for each (t, g, n) where t is compatible with the pronoun and given AP otherwise.
    So, while it will be possible in the posterior to use he to refer t
