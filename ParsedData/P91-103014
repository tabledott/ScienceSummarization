nnot readily be identified by the parser, so we proceed with these errors included in the bigrams.
    After agreeing on the 'correct' attachment for the sample of 1000 triples, we are left with 880 verb-noun-preposition triples (having discarded the 120 parsing errors).
    Of these, 586 are noun attachments and 294 verb attachments.
    First, consider how the simple structural attachment preference schemas perform at predicting the human judges and the lexical association procedure (LA). outcome in our test set.
    Right Association, which predicts noun attachment, does better, since in our sample there are more noun attachments, but it still has an error rate of 33%.
    Minimal Attachment, interpreted to mean verb attachment, has the complementary error rate of 67%.
    Obviously, neither of these procedures is particularly impressive.
    Now consider the performance of our attachment procedure for the 880 standard test sentences.
    Table 2 shows the performance for the two human judges and for the l
