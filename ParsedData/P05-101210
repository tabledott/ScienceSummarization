IRA) (Crammer and Singer, 2003; Crammer et al., 2003) employs this optimization directly within the online framework.
    On each update, MIRA attempts to keep the norm of the change to the parameter vector as small as possible, subject to correctly classifying the instance under consideration with a margin at least as large as the loss of the incorrect classifications.
    This can be formalized by substituting the following update into line 4 of the generic online algorithm, This is a standard quadratic programming problem that can be easily solved using Hildreth&#8217;s algorithm (Censor and Zenios, 1997).
    Crammer and Singer (2003) and Crammer et al. (2003) provide an analysis of both the online generalization error and convergence properties of MIRA.
    In equation (1), s(x, y) is calculated with respect to the weight vector after optimization, w(Z+1).
    To apply MIRA to dependency parsing, we can simply see parsing as a multi-class classification problem in which each dependency tree is one of man
