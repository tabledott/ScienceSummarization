  Since the translingual projections are essentially unsupervised and have no data on which to mimic arbitrary conventions, it is also rea- sonable to evaluate the degree to which the induced bracketings are deemed acceptable and consistent with the arbitrary goldstandard (e.g.
  no crossing brackets).
  To this end, an additional pool of 3 judges were asked to further adjudicate the differences between the goldstandard and the projection output, annotating such situations as either acceptable/compatible or unacceptable/incompatible.
  Overall, these translingual projection results are quite encourag- ing.
  For the Chinese, they are similar to Wu?s 78% precision r
