    The first step in finding a subcategorization frame is finding a verb.
    Because of widespread and productive noun/verb ambiguity, dictionaries are not much use &#8212; they do not reliably exclude the possibility of lexical ambiguity.
    Even if they did, a program that could only learn SFs for unambiguous verbs would be of limited value.
    Statistical disambiguators make dictionaries more useful, but they have a fairly high error rate, and degrade in the presence of many unfamiliar words.
    Further, it is often difficult to understand where the error is coming from or how to correct it.
    So finding verbs poses a serious challenge for the design of an accurate, general-purpose algorithm for detecting SFs.
    In fact, finding main verbs is more difficult than it might seem.
    One problem is distinguishing participles from adjectives and nouns, as shown below.
    In each case the main verb is have or be in a context where most parsers (and statistical disambigua
