ize a loss function representing the quality only of the resulting translations.
    Thus, we make use of the following general decision rule: In principle, one could decode according to (2) simply by enumerating and decoding each f&#65533; &#8712; F(o); however, for any interestingly large F(o) this will be impractical.
    We assume that for many interesting cases of F(o), there will be identical substrings that express the same content, and therefore a lattice representation is appropriate.
    In Section 2, we discuss decoding with this model in general, and then show how two classes of translation models can easily be adapted for lattice translation; we achieve a unified treatment of finite-state and hierarchical phrase-based models by treating lattices as a subcase of weighted finite state automata (FSAs).
    In Section 3, we identify and solve issues that arise with reordering in non-linear FSAs, i.e.
    FSAs where every path does not pass through every node.
    Section 4 presents two applications o
