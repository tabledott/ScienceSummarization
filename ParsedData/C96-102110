ermined by first eliminating from consideration those discourse referents to which an anaphoric expression cannot possibly refer, then se- lecting the optimal antecedent from the candidates that remain, where optimality is determined by a salience measure.
			In order to present the details of anaphora resolution, we define below our notions--and implementations-- of coreference and salience.
			2.2.1 Coreference As in the Lappin and Leass algorithm, the anaphor- antecedent relation is established between two dis- course referents (cf.
			(Helm, 1982), (Kamp, 1981)), @hile the more general notion of coreference is represented in terms of equivalence classes of anaphorically re- lated discourse referents, which we will refer to as "COREF classes".
			Thus, the problem of interpreting an anaphoric expression boils down to the problem of es- tablishing an anaphoric link between the anaphor and some previously interpreted iscourse referent (pos- sibly another anaphor); a consequence of establishing 114 this link
