ehn et al., 2008), they are problematic for two reasons.
    First, there is no principled way to incorporate additional features (such as phonotactics) which might be useful to determining whether a word break should occur.
    Second, the heuristic scoring offers little insight into which segmentations should be included in a lattice.
    We would like our model to consider a wide variety of segmentations of any word (including perhaps hypothesized morphemes that are not in the dictionary), to make use of a rich set of features, and to have a probabilistic interpretation of each hypothesized split (to incorporate into the downstream decoder).
    We decided to use the class of maximum entropy models, which are probabilistically sound, can make use of possibly many overlapping features, and can be trained efficiently (Berger et al., 1996).
    We thus define a model of the conditional probability distribution Pr(sN1 Iw), where w is a surface form and sN1 is the segmented form consisting of N segments as: Nex
