plication program can use the derivation as well as the semantics of the derivative form.
    The : ASSOC field, not currently used in processing, includes the lexicographer's choice of synonym or closely related words for each sense.
    The : SYNTAX field encodes syntactic constraints and subcategorizations for each sense.
    When senses share constraints (not the case in this example), they can be encoded at the level of the word entry.
    When the syntactic constraints (such as io-rec, one-obj, and no-obj) influence semantic preferences, they are attached to the sense entry.
    For example, in this case, issue used as an intransitive verb (no-obj) would favor 'passive moving' even though it is a secondary sense.
    The lo-re c subcategorization in the first two senses means indirect object as recipient: the ditransitive form will fill the RECIPIENT role.
    The grammatical knowledge base of the system relates these subcategories to semantic roles.
