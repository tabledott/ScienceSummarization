In other words, A is a subalignment of A' if A aligns two elements only if A' also aligns them.
    We can see this intuitively by examining Figures 2 and 3.
    Notice that the two derivations that seem &#8220;right&#8221; (the first and the third) are superalignments of the alignment given in Figure 1, while the derivation that is clearly wrong is not.
    Hence we now have a formal definition of the derivations that we are interested in.
    We say that a derivation is admitted by an alignment A if it induces a superalignment of A.
    The set of derivations from source string S to target tree T that are admitted by alignment A can be denoted 6A(S, T).
    Given this, we are ready to obtain a formal characterization of the set of rules that can be inferred from the source string, target tree, and alignment.
    In essence, a derivation step can be viewed as the application of a rule.
    Thus, compiling the set of derivation steps used in any derivation of 6A(S, T) gives us, in a meaningful sense, all rele
