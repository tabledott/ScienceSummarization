again, reproducibility in the abstract is higher (K = .79) than in the entire document (K = .71), but the effect is much weaker.
    Abstracts might be easier to annotate than the rest of a paper, but this does not necessarily make it possible to define a gold standard solely by looking at the abstracts.
    As foreshadowed in section 2.5, abstracts do not contain all types of rhetorical information.
    AIM and OWN sentences make up 74% of the sentences in abstracts, and only 5% of all CONTRAST sentences and 3% of all BASIS sentences occur in the abstract.
    Abstracts in our corpus are also not structurally homogeneous.
    When we inspected the rhetorical structure of abstracts in terms of sequences of rhetorical zones, we found a high level of variation.
    Even though the sequence AIM&#8211;OWN is very common (contained in 73% of all abstracts), the 80 abstracts still contain 40 different rhetorical sequences, 28 of which are unique.
    This heterogeneity is in stark contrast to the systematic structu
