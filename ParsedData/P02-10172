t require heavy smoothing, and exhibits a reliable correspondence between the maximized objective and parsing accuracy.
    It is also much faster, not requiring a fitting phase for each iteration.
    Klein and Manning (2001b) and Clark (2001) take treebank part-of-speech sequences as input.
    We followed this for most experiments, but in section 4.3, we use distributionally induced tags as input.
    Performance with induced tags is somewhat reduced, but still gives better performance than previous models.
  
  
    Early work on grammar induction emphasized heuristic structure search, where the primary induction is done by incrementally adding new productions to an initially empty grammar (Olivier, 1968; Wolff, 1988).
    In the early 1990s, attempts were made to do grammar induction by parameter search, where the broad structure of the grammar is fixed in advance and only parameters are induced (Lari and Young, 1990; Carroll and Charniak, 1992).1 However, this appeared unpromising and most recent work h
