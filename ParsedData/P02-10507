 Having made the DCA explicit, we would suggest that the right questions are: to what extent is it true, and how useful is it when it holds?
    In the remainder of the paper, we focus on answering the first question empirically by considering the syntactic relationships and alignments between translated sentence pairs in two distant languages (English and Chinese).
    In our experimental framework, a system is given the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; syntactic analyses for the English sentences and English-Chinese word-alignments, and it uses a Direct Projection Algorithm (described below) to project the English syntactic annotations directly across to the Chinese sentences in accordance with the DCA.
    The resulting Chinese dependency analyses are then compared with an independently derived gold standard, enabling us to determine recall and precision figures for syntactic dependencies (cf.
    (Lin, 1998)) and to perform a qualitative error analysis.
    This error analysis led us to revise our projection app
