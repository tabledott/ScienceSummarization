e the reliability of the polarity annotation scheme, we conducted an agreement study with two annotators4 using 10 documents from the MPQA corpus.
    The 10 documents contain 447 subjective expressions.
    Table 3 shows the contingency table for the two annotators&#8217; judgments.
    Overall agreement is 82%, with a kappa value of 0.72.
    As part of the annotation scheme, annotators are asked to judge how certain they are in their polarity tags.
    For 18% of the subjective expressions, at least one annotator used the uncertain tag when marking polarity.
    If we consider these cases to be borderline and exclude them from the study, percent agreement increases to 90% and kappa rises to 0.84.
    Table 4 shows the revised contingency table with the uncertain cases removed.
    This shows that annotator agreement is especially high when both annotators are certain, and that annotators are certain for over 80% of their tags.
    Note that all annotations are included in the experiments.
    In total, all
