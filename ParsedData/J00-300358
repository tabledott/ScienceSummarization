but the highest wins were observed for typically short DAs, such as ANSWERS and BACKCHANNELS.
    This is to be expected, as such DAs tend to be syntactically and lexically highly constrained.
    Furthermore, the distribution of number of words across DA types is very uneven (Figure 5).
    STATEMENTS and OPINIONS, the DA types dominating in both frequency and number of words (83% of total), see no more than 0.5% absolute improvement, thus explaining the small overall improvement.
    In hindsight, this is also not surprising, since the bulk of the training data for the baseline LM consists of these DAs, allowing only little improvement in the DA-specific LMs.
    A more detailed analysis of the effect of DA modeling on speech recognition errors can be found elsewhere (Van Ess-Dykema and Ries 1998).
    In summary, our experiments confirmed that DA modeling can improve word recognition accuracy quite substantially in principle, at least for certain DA types, but that the skewed distribution of DAs (especiall
