imization process it cannot be allowed that words of different languages occur in one class.
    It can be seen that Eq.
    (3) is a special case of Eq.
    (9) with ng,1 = n9,2.
    Another possibility to perform bilingual word clustering is to apply a two-step approach.
    In a first step we determine classes S optimizing only the monolingual part of Eq.
    (6) and secondly we determine classes F optimizing the bilingual part (without changing 6): By using these two optimization processes we enforce that the classes E are mono-lingually 'good' classes and that the classes .7- correspond to 6.
    Interestingly enough this results in a higher translation quality (see section 5).
  
  
    An efficient optimization algorithm for LPI is the exchange algorithm (Martin et al., 1998).
    For the optimization of LP2 we can use the same algorithm with small modifications.
    Our starting point is a random partition of the training corpus vocabulary.
    This initial partition is improved iteratively by moving
