 Elhadad, 2006) and Arabic (Smith et al., 2005) present similar models.
    We suggest that in unlexicalized PCFGs the syntactic context may be explicitly modeled in the derivation probabilities.
    Hence, we take the probability of the event fmnh analyzed as REL VB to be This means that we generate f and mnh independently depending on their corresponding PoS tags, and the context (as well as the syntactic relation between the two) is modeled via the derivation resulting in a sequence REL VB spanning the form fmnh. based on linear context.
    In our model, however, all lattice paths are taken to be a-priori equally likely.
  
  
    We represent all morphological analyses of a given utterance using a lattice structure.
    Each lattice arc corresponds to a segment and its corresponding PoS tag, and a path through the lattice corresponds to a specific morphological segmentation of the utterance.
    This is by now a fairly standard representation for multiple morphological segmentation of Hebrew utterances (
