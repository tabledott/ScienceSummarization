  EM Can Find Pretty Good HMM POS-Taggers (When Given a Good Start)
  
    We address the task of unsupervised POS tagging.
    We demonstrate that good results can be obtained using the robust EM-HMM learner when provided with good initial conditions, even with incomplete dictionaries.
    We present a family of algorithms to compute effective estimations We test the method on the task of full morphological disambiguation in Hebrew achieving an error reduction of 25% over a strong uniform distribution baseline.
    We also test the same method on the standard WSJ unsupervised POS tagging task and obtain results competitive with recent state-ofthe-art methods, while using simple and efficient learning methods.
  
  
    The task of unsupervised (or semi-supervised) partof-speech (POS) tagging is the following: given a dictionary mapping words in a language to their possible POS, and large quantities of unlabeled text data, learn to predict the correct part of speech for a given word in context.
