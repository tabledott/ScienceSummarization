 cooccurrence with a given noun.
    Kendall's T coefficient compares the two variables by repeatedly comparing two pairs of their corresponding observations.
    Formally, if (Xi,Yi) and (XJ,Yi) are two pairs of observations for the adjectives X' and Y on the nouns i and j respectively, we call these pairs concordant if Xi&gt;XJ. and Y.&gt;Y. or if X&lt;X. and Y t &lt;11, otherwise these pairs are discordant.
    We discard ties, that is pairs of observations where Xi=Xf or Y/.YJ.'
    For example, Table 1 shows the frequencies observed for the co-occurrences of the nouns coordination and market and the adjectives global and international in the test corpus which is described in Section 4.
    From the table we observe that for i=coordination, j=market, X=global, and Y=intemational, we have Xi=16 &lt; 24=Xi and Y1=19 &lt;33=Y so this particular pair of paired' observations is concordant and contributes positively to the similarity between global and international.
    In general, if the distributions for the
