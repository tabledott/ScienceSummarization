emes from distribution E, n language-F morphemes from distribution F, and k abstract morphemes from distribution A.
    This step is illustrated in part (b) of Figure 1.
    The m + k resulting language-&#163; morphemes are then ordered and fused to form a phrase in language &#163;, and likewise for the n + k resulting languageF morphemes.
    The ordering and fusing decisions are modeled as draws from a uniform distribution over the set of all possible orderings and fusings for sizes m, n, and k. These final steps are illustrated in parts (c)-(d) of Figure 1.
    Now we describe the model more formally.
    Stray Morpheme Distributions Sometimes a morpheme occurs in a phrase in one language without a corresponding foreign language morpheme in the parallel phrase.
    We call these &#8220;stray morphemes,&#8221; and we employ language-specific morpheme distributions to model their generation.
    For each language, we draw a distribution over all possible morphemes (finite-length strings composed of character
