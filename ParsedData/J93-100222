e use of supervised training and a more sophisticated grammatical model.
    It is likely that these differences derive from the corpus material used for training and testing, and that the results reported by Fujisaki et al. will not be achieved with all corpora.
    Pereira and Schabes (1992) report an experiment using Baum-Welch re-estimation to infer a grammar and associated rule probabilities from a category set containing 15 nonterminals and 48 terminals, corresponding to the Penn Treebank lexical tagset (Santorini 1990).
    The training data was 770 sentences, represented as tag sequences, drawn from the treebank.
    They trained the system in an unsupervised mode and also in a 'semi-supervised' mode, in which the manually parsed version of the corpus was used to constrain the set of analyses used during re-estimation.
    In supervised training analyses were accepted if they produced bracketings consistent but not necessarily identical with those assigned manually.
    They demonstrate that in superv
