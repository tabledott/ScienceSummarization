a single rhetorical relation &#8211; agreement vs. contrast &#8211; to model dependencies between different opinions.

    An avenue for future research is to consider the impact of additional rhetorical relations between aspects.
    We also plan to theoretically analyze the convergence properties of this and other joint perceptron algorithms.
