rove performance on the news-related corpora.
    In both cases, the instanceweighting approach improved over a wide range of baselines, giving gains of over 2 BLEU points over the best non-adapted baseline, and gains of between 0.6 and 1.8 over an equivalent mixture model (with an identical training procedure but without instance weighting).
    In future work we plan to try this approach with more competitive SMT systems, and to extend instance weighting to other standard SMT components such as the LM, lexical phrase weights, and lexicalized distortion.
    We will also directly compare with a baseline similar to the Matsoukas et al approach in order to measure the benefit from weighting phrase pairs (or ngrams) rather than full sentences.
    Finally, we intend to explore more sophisticated instanceweighting features for capturing the degree of generality of phrase pairs.
