 a limited number of high-interest topics, so this may be a reasonable solution from an engineering point of view.
    This line of research was first proposed by (Aone and Ramos-Santacruz 00) and the ACE evaluations of event detection follow s line (ACE Home Page).
    An unsupervised learning method has been applied to a more restricted IE task, Relation Discovery.
    (Hasegawa et al. 2004) used large corpora and an Extended Named Entity tagger to find novel relations and their participants.
    However, the results are limited to a pair of participants and because of the nature of the procedure, the discovered relations are static relations like a country and its presidents rather than events.
    Topic-oriented summarization, currently pursued by the DUC evaluations (DUC Home Page), is also closely related.
    The systems are trying to create summaries based on the specified topic for a manually prepared set of documents.
    In this case, if the result is suitable to present in table format, it can be
