			This indicated the need to develop a measure of strength of sentiment polarity (the alternative was simply to discard such ambiguous words)?to determine how strongly a word is positive and also how strongly it is negative.
			This would enable us to discard sentiment-ambiguous words but retain those with strengths over some threshold.
			Armed with such a measure, we can also assign strength of sentiment polarity to as yet unseen words.
			Given a new word, we use WordNet again to obtain a synonym set of the unseen word to determine how it interacts with our sentiment seed lists.
			That is, we compute (1) ).....,|(maxarg )|(maxarg 21 n c c synsynsyncP wcP ? where c is a sentiment category (positive or negative), w is the unseen word, and synn are the WordNet synonyms of w. To compute Equation (1), we tried two different models: (2) )|()(maxarg )|()(maxarg )|()(maxarg)|(maxarg 1 ))(,( ...3 2 1 ? = = = = m k wsynsetfcount k c n c cc kcfPcP csynsynsynsynPcP cwPcPwcP where fk is the kth fea
