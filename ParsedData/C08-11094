 current meth ods of annotating ESL data and evaluating errordetection systems, which are not limited to prepo sition errors.
			While the need for annotation by multiple raters has been well established in NLP tasks (Carletta, 1996), most previous work in error detection has surprisingly relied on only one raterto either create an annotated corpus of learner errors, or to check the system?s output.
			Some grammatical errors, such as number disagreement be tween subject and verb, no doubt show very highreliability, but others, such as usage errors involv ing prepositions or determiners are likely to be much less reliable.
			Our results show that relyingon one rater for system evaluation can be problem atic, and we provide a sampling approach which can facilitate using multiple raters for this task.
			In the next section, we describe a system that automatically detects errors involving incorrect preposition selection (?We arrived to the station?)
			and extraneous preposition usage (?He went to outside?).
