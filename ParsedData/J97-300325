 etc.
    The longer the length, the smaller the sample that will be considered representative enough for a confident rule estimation.
    Setting the threshold (8s) at a certain level we include in the working rule sets only those rules whose scores are higher than the threshold.
    The method for finding the optimal threshold is based on empirical evaluations of the rule sets and is described in Section 3.4.
    Usually, the threshold is set in the range of 65-80 points and the rule sets are reduced down to a few hundred entries.
    For example, when we set the threshold (Os) to 75 points, the obtained ending-guessing rule collection (Ending*) comprised 1,876 rules, the suffix rule collection without mutation (Suffix&#176;) comprised 591 rules, the suffix rule collection with mutation (Suffixi) comprised 912 entries and the prefix rule collection (Prefix) comprised 235 rules.
    Table 2 shows the highest-rated rules from the induced Prefix and Suffix&#176; rule sets.
    In general, it looks as though th
