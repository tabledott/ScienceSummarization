    The relations considered were WordNet&#8217;s hypernyms, hyponyms, synonyms, meronyms and holonyms.
    Each query was manually checked by one of the organisers to remove ambiguous words.
    The following example shows the query created for the first1 and second2 WordNet sense of the target noun failure.

    For each page we extracted fragments of text that occurred in &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; html tags and contained the target word stem.
    In the final stage, each extracted fragment of text was POS-tagged using the Genia tagger (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005) and was only retained, if the POS of the target word in the extracted text matched the POS of the target word in our dataset.
    The testing dataset consisted of instances of the same target words from the training dataset.
    This dataset is part of OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006).
    We used the sense-tagged dataset in w
