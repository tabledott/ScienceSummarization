arsing are directly compared to the output of supervised parsers.
    Certain differences in the applicability of the usual methods of smoothing to our parser cause the lower accuracy as compared to other state of the art statistical parsers.
    However, we have consistently seen increase in performance when using the Co-Training method over the baseline across several trials.
    It should be emphasised that this is a result based on less than 20% of data that is usually used by other parsers.
    We are experimenting with the use of an even smaller set of labeled data to investigate the learning curve.
  
  
    The two-step procedure used in our Co-Training method for statistical parsing was incipient in the SuperTagger (Srinivas, 1997) which is a statistical model for tagging sentences with elementary lexicalized structures.
    This was particularly so in the Lightweight Dependency Analyzer (LDA), which used shortest attachment heuristics after an initial SuperTagging stage to find syntactic dependencie
