ty of hedge forms.
    For example, the learning models were unsuccessful in identifying assertive statements of knowledge paucity, eg: There is no clear evidence for cytochrome c release during apoptosis in C elegans or Drosophila.
    Whether it is possible to learn such examples without additional seed information is an open question.
    This example also highlights the potential benefit of an enriched sample representation, in this case one which accounts for the negation of the phrase &#8216;clear evidence&#8217; which otherwise might suggest a strongly non-speculative assertion.
    In many cases hedge classification is challenging even for a human annotator.
    For instance, distinguishing between a speculative assertion and one relating to a pattern of observed non-universal behaviour is often difficult.
    The following example was chosen by the learner as a spec sentence on the 150th training iteration: Each component consists of a set of subcomponents that can be localized within a larger distri
