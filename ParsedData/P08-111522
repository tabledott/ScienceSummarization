em et al. (2004) only report results of monotonic decoding for the systems they describe.
    Bertoldi et al. (2007) solve the problem by requiring that their input be in the format of a confusion network, which enables the standard distortion penalty to be used.
    Finally, the system described by Zhang et al. (2005) uses IBM Model 4 features to translate lattices.
    For the distortion model, they use the maximum probability value over all possible paths in the lattice for each jump considered, which is similar to the approach we have taken.
    Mathias and Byrne (2006) build a phrase-based translation system as a cascaded series of FSTs which can accept any input FSA; however, the only reordering that is permitted is the swapping of two adjacent phrases.
    Applications of source lattices outside of the domain of spoken language translation have been far more limited.
    Costa-juss`a and Fonollosa (2007) take steps in this direction by using lattices to encode multiple reorderings of the source languag
