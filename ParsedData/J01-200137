nother, and then higher structure with various pair brackets (parentheses, etc.) for orthographic convenience; there is no theoretical significance to the difference between &amp;quot;( )&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;, etc.
    De Marcken's analysis succeeds quite well at identifying words, but does not make any significant effort at identifying morphemes as such.
    Applying de Marcken's algorithm to a &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot; corpus of a language in which word boundaries are indicated (for example, English) provides interesting results, but none that provide anything even approaching a linguistic analysis, such as identification of stems and affixes.
    The broken character of the corpus serves essentially as an upper bound for the chunks that are postulated, while the letters represent the lower bound.
    De Marcken's MDL-based figure of merit for the analysis of a substring of the corpus is the sum of the inverse log frequencies of the components of the string in question; the best analysis is
