anually-constructed lexicon to find stems and parts of speech.
    Exhaustive lexicons of this sort are expensive, if not impossible, to produce.
    Fortunately, a small set of words accounts for the vast majority of word occurences.
    Thus high coverage can be obtained without prohibitive effort.
    Words not found in the manually constructed lexicon are generally both open class and regularly inflected.
    As a second stage, a language-specific method can be employed to guess ambiguity classes for unknown words.
    For many languages (e.g., English and French), word suffixes provide strong cues to words' possible categories.
    Probabalistic predictions of a word's category can be made by analyzing suffixes in untagged text [Kupiec, 1992, Meteer et al., 1991].
    As a final stage, if a word is not in the manually constructed lexicon, and its suffix is not recognized, a default ambiguity class is used.
    This class typically contains all the open class categories in the language.
