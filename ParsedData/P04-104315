d Word explicitly appear as structure fragments.
    For example, in Figure 4 are shown fragments like [NP [DT] [N]] or [NP [DT a] [N talk]] which explicitly encode the Phrase Type feature NP for the Arg 1 in Figure 2.b.
    The Predicate Word is represented by the fragment [V delivers] and the Head Word is encoded in [N talk].
    The same is not true for SCF since it does not contain information about a specific argument.
    SCF, in fact, aims to characterize the predicate with respect to the overall argument structures rather than a specific pair &lt;p, a&gt;.
    Third, Governing Category, Position and Voice features are not explicitly contained in both PAF and SCF.
    Nevertheless, SCF may allow the learning algorithm to detect the active/passive form of verbs.
    Finally, from the above observations follows that the PAF representation may be used with PAK to classify arguments.
    On the contrary, SCF lacks important information, thus, alone it may be used only to classify verbs in syntactic categor
