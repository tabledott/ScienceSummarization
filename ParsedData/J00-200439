have two senses, corresponding to its French translations peine (judicial sentence) and phrase (grammatical sentence).
    If a token of sentence occurs in the vicinity of a word like jury or prison, then it is far more likely to be translated as peine than as phrase.
    &amp;quot;In the vicinity of&amp;quot; is one kind of collocation.
    Co-occurrence The ratio links(u, v) I cooc (u, v), for several values of cooc(u, v). in bitext space is another kind of collocation.
    If each word's translation is treated as a sense tag (Resnik and Yarowsky 1997), then &amp;quot;translational&amp;quot; collocations have the unique property that the collocate and the word sense are one and the same!
    Method B exploits this property under the hypothesis that &amp;quot;one sense per collocation&amp;quot; holds for translational collocations.
    This hypothesis implies that if u and v are possible mutual translations, and a token u co-occurs with a token v in the bitext, then with very high probability the pair (u, v)
