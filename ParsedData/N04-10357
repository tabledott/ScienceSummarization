    Given the vast space of possible derivations (according to the definition above), how do we distinguish between good ones and bad ones?
    Here is where the notion of an alignment becomes useful.
    Let S be a string of source symbols and let T be a target tree.
    First observe the following facts about derivations from S to T (these follow directly from the definitions): 1.
    Each element of S is replaced at exactly one step of the derivation.
    Thus for each element s of S, we can define replaced(s, D) to be the step of the derivation D during which s is replaced.
    For instance, in the leftmost derivation of Figure 2, &#8220;va&#8221; is replaced by the second step of the derivation, thus replaced(va, D) = 2.
    Similarly, for each node t of T, we can define created(t, D) to be the step of derivation D during which t is created.
    For instance, in the same derivation, the nodes labeled by &#8220;AUX&#8221; and &#8220;VP&#8221; are created du
