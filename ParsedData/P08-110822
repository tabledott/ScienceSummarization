erent distances from the root (predicted arcs for precision, gold standard arcs for recall).
    Again, we find the clearest patterns in the graphs for precision, where Malt has very low precision near the root but improves with increasing depth, while MST shows the opposite trend (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).
    Considering the guided models, it is clear that MaltMST improves in the direction of its guide model, with a 5-point increase in precision for dependents of the root and smaller improvements for longer distances.
    Similarly, MSTMalt improves precision in the range where its base parser is inferior to Malt and for distances up to 4 has an accuracy comparable to or higher than its guide parser Malt.
    This again provides evidence that the guided parsers are learning from their guide models.
    Table 3 gives the accuracy for arcs relative to dependent part-of-speech.
    As expected, we see that MST does better than Malt for all categories except nouns and pronouns (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).
