to be resolved effectively.
    Figure 8 summarizes the amount of interaction required in the experiment reported below for parsing a set of 150 LDOCE noun definitions with the ANLT grammar.
    To date, the largest number of interactions we have observed for a single phrase is 55 for the (30-word) LDOCE definition for youth hostel: Achieving the correct analysis interactively took the first author about 40 minutes (including the addition of two lexical entries).
    Definitions of this length will often have many hundreds or even thousands of parses; computing just the parse forest for this definition takes of the order of two hours of CPU time (on a DEC 3100 Unix workstation).
    Since in a more general corpus of written material the average sentence length is likely to be 30-40 words, this example illustrates clearly the problems with any approach based on post hoc on-line selection of the correct parse.
    However, using Numbers of definitions requiring particular amounts of interaction. the incremental
