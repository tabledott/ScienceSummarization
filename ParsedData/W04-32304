lect lexicons which contain prior knowledge about word segmentation.
    We cannot ignore a lexicon since over 90% accuracy can be achieved even using the longest prefix matching with the lexicon.
    Moreover, B/I tagging produces a number of redundant candidates which makes the decoding speed slower.
    Traditionally in Japanese morphological analysis, we assume that a lexicon, which lists a pair of a word and its corresponding part-of-speech, is available.
    The lexicon gives a tractable way to build a lattice from an input sentence.
    A lattice represents all candidate paths or all candidate sequences of tokens, where each token denotes a word with its partof-speech 1.
    Figure 1 shows an example where a total of 6 candidate paths are encoded and the optimal path is marked with bold type.
    As we see, the set of labels to predict and the set of states in the lattice are different, unlike English part-of-speech tagging that word boundary ambiguity does not exist.
    Formally, the task of Japanese
