 in wording to the machine output than the original reference.
    For instance, given the pair of sentences in Table 1, we automatically transform the reference sentence (1a.) into However, Israel&#8217;s answer failed to completely remove the U.S. suspicions.
    Thus, among many possible paraphrases of the reference, we are interested only in those that use words appearing in the system output.
    Our paraphrasing algorithm is based on the substitute in context strategy.
    First, the algorithm identifies pairs of words from the reference and the system output that could potentially form paraphrases.
    We select these candidates using existing lexico-semantic resources such as WordNet.
    Next, the algorithm tests whether the candidate paraphrase is admissible in the context of the reference sentence.
    Since even synonyms cannot be substituted in any context (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002), this filtering step is necessary.
    We predict whether a word is appropriate in a new context by analyzing its di
