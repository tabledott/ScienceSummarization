ill be able to calculate generative joint probabilities for entire strings; however, it will not be able to calculate probabilities for each word conditioned on previously generated words, unless each derivation generates the words in the string in exactly the same order.
    For example, suppose that there are two possible verbs that could be the head of a sentence.
    For a head-first parser, some derivations will have the first verb as the head of the sentence, and the second verb will be generated after the first; hence the second verb's probability will be conditioned on the first verb.
    Other derivations will have the second verb as the head of the sentence, and the first verb's probability will be conditioned on the second verb.
    In such a scenario, there is no way to decompose the joint probability calculated from the set of derivations into the product of conditional probabilities using the chain rule.
    Of course, the joint probability can be used as a language model, but it cannot be inter
