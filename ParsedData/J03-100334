dge and vertex) can be seen as a generalization of Dale&#8217;s (1992) full brevity algorithm, in the sense that there is a guarantee that the algorithm will output the shortest possible description, if one exists.
    It is also an extension of the full brevity algorithm, since it allows for relational descriptions.
    In this respect it is comparable to the Dale and Haddock (1991) algorithm, granted that here the problems with infinite recursions do not arise, since a particular edge is either present in a graph or not.
    Moreover, the approach is fully general and applies to n-ary relations (and relation/property combinations) as well.
    It is worth noting that Dale&#8217;s (1992) greedy heuristic algorithm (also discussed in Dale and Reiter [1995]) can be cast in the graph framework as well.
    In fact, this would give us a handle on the order in which different adjacent edges could be tried.
    The edges associated with the intended referent should be sorted on their descriptive power, which is in
