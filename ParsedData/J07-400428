dman (2000) gives a more precise definition of generalized forward composition.
    Further combinatory rules in the theory of CCG include backward composition (&lt; B) and backward crossed composition (&lt; BX): Clark and Curran Wide-Coverage Efficient Statistical Parsing Backward composition provides an analysis for sentences involving &#8220;argument cluster coordination,&#8221; such as I gave a teacher an apple and a policeman a flower (Steedman 2000).
    Backward crossed composition is required for heavy NP shift and coordinations such as I shall buy today and cook tomorrow the mushrooms.
    In this coordination example from Steedman (2000), backward crossed composition is used to combine the categories for buy, (S\NP)/NP, and today, (S\NP)\(S\NP), and similarly for cook and tomorrow, producing categories of the same type which can be coordinated.
    This rule is also generalized in an analogous way to forward composition.
    Finally, there is a coordination rule which conjoins categories of the same
