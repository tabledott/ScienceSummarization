ew of our fusion algorithm and detail on its main steps: identification of common information (Section 3.1), fusion lattice computation (Section 3.2), and lattice linearization (Section 3.3).
    Evaluation results and their analysis are presented in Section 4.
    Analysis of the system&#8217;s output reveals the capabilities and the weaknesses of our textto-text generation method and identifies interesting challenges that will require new insights.
    An overview of related work and a discussion of future directions conclude the article.
  
  
    Sentence fusion is the central technique used within the MultiGen summarization system.
    MultiGen takes as input a cluster of news stories on the same event and produces a summary which synthesizes common information across input stories.
    An example of a MultiGen summary is shown in Figure 1.
    The input clusters are automatically produced from a large quantity of news articles that are retrieved by Newsblaster from 30 news sites each day.
