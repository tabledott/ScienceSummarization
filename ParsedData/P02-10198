o phones usually start off with training data in the form of a set of examples, consisting of letters in context and their corresponding phones (classifications).
    Pronunciation dictionaries are the major source of training data for these algorithms, but they do not contain information for correspondences between letters and phones directly; they have correspondences between sequences of letters and sequences of phones.
    A first step before running a machine learning algorithm on a dictionary is, therefore, alignment between individual letters and phones.
    The alignment algorithm is dependent on the phone set used.
    We experimented with two dictionaries, the NETtalk dataset and the Microsoft Speech dictionary.
    Statistics about them and how we split them into training and test sets are shown in Table 1.
    The NETtalk dataset contains information for phone level alignment and we used it to test our algorithm for automatic alignment.
    The Microsoft Speech dictionary is not aligned at the pho
