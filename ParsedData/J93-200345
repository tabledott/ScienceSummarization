    The first translation should be much more probable than the second, but this defect is of little concern because while we might have to translate the first string someday, we will never have to translate the second.
    We do not use our translation models to predict French given English but rather as a component of a system designed to predict English given French.
    They need only be accurate to within a constant factor over well-formed strings of French words.
    Often the words in an English string constitute phrases that are translated as units into French.
    Sometimes, a translated phrase may appear at a spot in the French string different from that at which the correspond
