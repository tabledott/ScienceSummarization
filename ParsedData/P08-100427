 88.3% and a recall of 45.2%4.
    Open IE is essential when the number of relationships of interest is massive or unknown.
    Traditional IE is more appropriate for targeted extraction when the number of relations of interest is small and one is willing to incur the cost of acquiring labeled training data.
    Compared to traditional IE, the recall of our Open IE system is admittedly lower.
    However, in a targeted extraction scenario, Open IE can still be used to reduce the number of hand-labeled examples.
    As Table 4 shows, numerous hand-labeled examples (ranging from 50 for one relation to over 3,000 for another) are necessary to match the precision of O-CRF.
    In the future, O-CRF&#8217;s recall may be improved by enhancements to its ability to locate the various ways in which a given relation is expressed.
    We also plan to explore the capacity of Open IE to automatically provide labeled training data, when traditional relation extraction is a more appropriate choice.
