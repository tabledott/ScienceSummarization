L appearing as a top feature is less surprising because Go et al. (2009) report that tweets containing URLs tend to be positive.
    The learning curve for the 2-way classification task is in Figure 2.
    The curve shows that when limited data is used the advantages in the performance of our best performing systems is even more pronounced.
    This implies that with limited amount of training data, simply using unigrams has a critical disadvantage, while both tree kernel and unigram model with our features exhibit promising performance.
    This is a 3-way classification task with classes of sentiment polarity: positive, negative and neutral.
    We use a balanced data-set of 1709 instances for each class and therefore the chance baseline is 33.33%.
    For this task the unigram model achieves a gain of 23.25% over chance baseline.
    Table 8 compares the performance of our three models.
    We report mean and standard deviation of 5-fold test accuracy.
    We observe that the tree kernels outperform the un
