t;incidentally&amp;quot;.
    The levels of discourse structure just discussed are hierarchically ordered.
    For instance, any DU must be part of a Speech Event, while it must be built up out of dcu's.
    The levels may thus be viewed as an expansion of the familiar linguistic hierarchy of phoneme, morpheme, word and clause.
    This does not mean, however, that every discourse is to be analysed in terms of a five level tree structure, with levels corresponding to dcu, DU, Topic, Speech Event and Interaction.
    To be able to describe discourse as it actually occurs, discourse constituents of various types must be allowed to be embedded in constituents of the same and other types.
    We shall see various examples of this in later sections.
    It is worth emphasizing here already that &amp;quot;high level constituents&amp;quot; may be embedded in &amp;quot;low level constituents&amp;quot;.
    For instance, a dcu may be interrupted by a clause which initiates another Interaction.
    Thus, a structural d
