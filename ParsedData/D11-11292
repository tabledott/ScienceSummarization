; Lambek, 2008) and distributional models of lexical semantics (Schutze, 1998; Firth, 1957) have provided two partial orthogonal solutions to the question.
    Compositional formal semantic models stem from classical ideas from mathematical logic, mainly Frege&#8217;s principle that the meaning of a sentence is a function of the meaning of its parts (Frege, 1892).
    Distributional models are more recent and can be related to Wittgenstein&#8217;s later philosophy of &#8216;meaning is use&#8217;, whereby meanings of words can be determined from their context (Wittgenstein, 1953).
    The logical models relate to well known and robust logical formalisms, hence offering a scalable theory of meaning which can be used to reason inferentially.
    The distributional models have found their way into real world applications such as thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994; Curran, 2004) or automated essay marking (Landauer, 1997), and have connections to semantically motivated information retrieval (Manning et al.,
