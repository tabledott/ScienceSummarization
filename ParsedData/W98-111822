consisted of about 270,000 words, which our system turned into 321,000 tokens).
    Note the smooth progression of the scores as more data is added to the system.
    Also note that, when combined under MENE, the three weakest systems, MENE, Proteus, and Manitoba outperform the strongest single system, IsoQuest's.
    Finally, the top score of 97.12 from combining all three systems is a very strong result.
    On a different set of data, the MUC-7 formal run data, the accuracy of the two human taggers who were preparing the answer key was tested and it was discovered that one of them had an F-Measure of 96.95 and the other of 97.60 (Marsh and Perzanowski, 1998).
    Although we don't have human performance measures on the dry run test set, it seems that we have attained a result which is at least competitive with that of a human.
    We also did a series of runs to examine how the systems performed with different amounts of training data.
    These experiments are summarized in table 3.
    Note the 97.38 all
