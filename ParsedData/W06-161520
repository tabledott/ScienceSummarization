small amounts of target domain training data.
    In this case, we make use of the out-of-domain data by using features of the source domain tagger&#8217;s predictions in training and testing the target domain tagger (Florian et al., 2004).
    Though other methods for incorporating small amounts of training data in the target domain were available, such as those proposed by Chelba and Acero (2004) and by Daum&#180;e III and Marcu (2006), we chose this method for its simplicity and consistently good performance.
    We use as features the current predicted tag and all tag bigrams in a 5-token window around the current token.
    Figure 6(a) plots tagging accuracy for varying amounts of MEDLINE training data.
    The two horizontal lines are the fixed accuracies of the SCL WSJ-trained taggers using one thousand and forty thousand sentences of training data.
    The five learning curves are for taggers trained with varying amounts of target domain training data.
    They use features on the outputs of taggers f
