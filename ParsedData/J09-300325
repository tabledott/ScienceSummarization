e if it seems to evoke something negative.
    If a word has both positive and negative meanings, it is tagged with the polarity that seems the most common.
    A word is tagged as both if it is at the same time both positive and negative.
    For example, the word bittersweet evokes something both positive and negative.
    Words like brag are also tagged as both, because the one who is bragging is expressing something positive, yet at the same time describing someone as bragging is expressing a negative evaluation of that person.
    A word is tagged as neutral if it does not evoke anything positive or negative.
    For words that came from positive and negative word lists (Stone et al. 1966; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997), we largely retained their original polarity.
    However, we did change the polarity of a word if we strongly disagreed with its original class.8 For example, the word apocalypse is listed as positive in the General Inquirer; we changed its prior polarity to negative for our lexicon.
