tions were scored against a blind test set manually annotated with relevant quality judgments.
    The primary objectives of WMT are to evaluate the state of the art in machine translation, to disseminate common test sets and public training data with published performance numbers, and to refine evaluation methodologies for machine translation.
    As with previous workshops, all of the data, translations, and collected human judgments are publicly available.1 We hope these datasets form a valuable resource for research into statistical machine translation, system combination, and automatic evaluation or automatic prediction of translation quality.

    We created a test set for each language pair by translating newspaper articles.
    We additionally provided training data and two baseline systems.
