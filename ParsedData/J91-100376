n with Afzal Ballim, is a modification of the notation shown in Section 5.
    The key differences are reformulation by rewriting the five and seven column arrays in terms of the predicateargument notation used in the rest of semantic vectors, and extension by adding the domain knowledge connected by every network path and cell match.
    Figure 16 shows the semantic vector in Figure 11 reformulated and extended.
    The advantage of vectors like the one in Figure 16 is that they record both how the senseframes of two word senses are matched (i.e., as various kinds of network path and cell match) and what information in the sense-frames is matched (i.e., all the cells).
    For example, the part of Figure 16 that begins &amp;quot;[relevant, &amp;quot; contains all the information found in Figure 7, the match of the relevant cell from animall against the cells of car1, both the types of cell matches and the cells matched.
    The equivalent part of Figure 11 only records the types of cell matches.
