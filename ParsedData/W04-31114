his is similar to other work in biomedical extraction projects (Hirschman et al., 2002).
    Creating good pattern-action rules for an IE problem is far from simple.
    There are many complexities in the different ways that a relation can be expressed in language, such as syntactic alternations and the heavy use of coordination.
    While sufficiently complex patterns can deal with these issues, it requires a good amount of time and effort to build such hand-crafted rules, particularly since such rules are developed for each specific problem.
    A corpus that is annotated with sufficient syntactic and semantic structure offers the promise of training taggers for quicker and easier information extraction.
    The corpus that we are developing for the two different application demands consists of three levels of annotation: the entities and relations among the entities for the oncology or CYP domain, syntactic structure (Treebank), and predicate-argument structure (Propbank).
    This is a novel approach from
