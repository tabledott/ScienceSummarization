 be extracted as target units.
    However, when a certain application is given, only the source and target units that can achieve the application will be kept.
    We call this process paraphrase planning, which is formally defined as in Figure 2.
    An example is depicted in Figure 3.
    The application in this example is sentence compression.
    All source and target units are listed below the input sentence, in which the first two source units are phrases, while the third and fourth are a pattern and a collocation, respectively.
    As can be seen, the first and fourth source units are filtered in paraphrase planning, since none of their paraphrases achieve the application (i.e., shorter in bytes than the source).
    The second and third source units are kept, but some of their paraphrases are filtered.
    Our SPG model contains three sub-models: a paraphrase model, a language model, and a usability model, which control the adequacy, fluency, and usability of the paraphrases, respectively1.
