entage of failures is more susceptible to random variation in such cases.
    Furthermore, since the same sample (for a given No) is used for all values of a, any such random variation due to small sample size will be replicated in all curves of Figure 3. our samples into five groups, based on the Dice coefficient between the two parts A and B (which does not directly enter the computations of the algorithm).
    Figure 4 shows the failure rate for the groups of low (0 to 0.2), middle (0.4 to 0.6), and high (0.8 to 1) Dice(A,B) values, using the same threshold at both levels.
    We observe that the algorithm tends to fail much less frequently when the two parts of the final translation are strongly related.
    But this is desirable behavior, since a strong correlation between the two subparts of the word group indicates that it is indeed a collocation in the target language.
    Therefore, failures of the algorithm act, to some extent, as an (unintentional) filter, rejecting uninteresting translations that
