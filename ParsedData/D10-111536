dicted AN neighbor is at least not obviously worse than the observed AN neighbor.
    There is a high inverse correlation between the frequency of occurrence of an AN and the rank of the observed AN with respect to the predicted one (p =&#8722;0.48), suggesting that our model is worse at approximating the observed vectors of rare forms, that might, in turn, be those for which the corpusbased representation is less reliable.
    In these cases, dissimilarities between observed and expected vectors, rather than signaling problems with the model, might indicate that the predicted vector, based on a composition function learned from many examples, is better than the one directly extracted from the corpus.
    The examples in the right panel of Table 4 bring some preliminary support to this hypothesis, to be systematically explored in future work.
  
  
    If adjectives are functions, and not corpus-derived vectors, is it still possible to compare them meaningfully?
    We explore two ways to accomplish this in o
