le-based, memory-based, exemplarbased, case-based, analogical, lazy, nearest-neighbour, and instance-based (Stanfill and Waltz, 1986; Kolodner, 1993; Aha et al. 1991; Salzberg, 1990).
    Ideas about this type of analogical reasoning can be found also in non-mainstream linguistics and pyscholinguistics (Skousen, 1989; Derwing &amp; Skousen, 1989; Chandler, 1992; Scha, 1992).
    In computational linguistics (apart from incidental computational work of the linguists referred to earlier), the general approach has only recently gained some popularity: e.g., Cardie (1994, syntactic and semantic disambiguation); Daelemans (1995, an overview of work in the early nineties on memory-based computational phonology and morphology); Jones (1996, an overview of example-based machine translation research); Federici and Pirrelli (1996).
    Performance of a memory-based system (accuracy on the test set) crucially depends on the distance metric (or similarity metric) used.
    The most straightforward distance metric would b
