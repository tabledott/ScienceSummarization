    When an edge is moved, all interactions between it and edges already in the chart are considered and any new edges that they give rise to are added to the agenda. positions in the string at which phrases begin and end can be used to index edges so that the algorithm schema need consider interactions only between adjacent pairs.
    Chart parsing is attractive for the analysis of natural languages, as opposed to programming languages, for the way in which it treats ambiguity.
    Regardless of the number of alternative structures for a particular string that a gi
