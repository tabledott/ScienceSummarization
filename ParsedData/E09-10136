 as input to the chosen clustering method.
    A variety of clustering algorithms have been employed ranging from k-means (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), to agglomerative clustering (Sch&#168;utze, 1998), and the Information Bottleneck (Niu et al., 2007).
    Graph-based methods have also been applied to the sense induction task.
    In this framework words are represented as nodes in the graph and vertices are drawn between the target and its co-occurrences.
    Senses are induced by identifying highly dense subgraphs (hubs) in the co-occurrence graph (V&#180;eronis, 2004; Dorow and Widdows, 2003).
    Although LDA was originally developed as a generative topic model, it has recently gained popularity in the WSD literature.
    The inferred document-level topics can help determine coarsegrained sense distinctions.
    Cai et al. (2007) propose to use LDA&#8217;s word-topic distributions as features for training a supervised WSD system.
    In a similar vein, Boyd-Graber and Blei (2007) infer LDA topics from
