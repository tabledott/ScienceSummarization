the ACE-style coreference system back into the MUC format.
    Since MUC does not require entity label and level, the conversion from ACE to MUC is &#8220;lossless.&#8221; Table 5 tabulates the test results on the true mentions of the MUC6 formal test set.
    The numbers in the table represent the optimal operating point determined by ECM-F.
    The MUC scorer cannot be used since it inherently favors systems that output fewer number of entities (e.g., putting all mentions of the MUC6 formal test set into one entity will yield a recall and precision of links, which gives an F-measure).
    The MUC6-small system compares favorably with the similar experiment in Harabagiu et al. (2001) in which an F-measure is reported.
    When measured by the ECM-F measure, the MUC6-small system has the same level of performance as the ACE system, while the MUC6-big system performs better than the ACE system.
    The results show that the algorithm works well on the MUC6 data despite some information is lost in the conversio
