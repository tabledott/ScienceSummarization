ranslation of E is expressed as the sum over all possible alignments A between E and F of the probability of F and A given E: The sum in equation (31) is computationally unwieldy; it involves a sum over all Ft Fl possible alignments between the words in the two sentences.
    We sometimes make the simplifying assumption that there exists one extremely probable alignment A, called the &amp;quot;Viterbi alignment,&amp;quot; for which where n(e) denotes the number of French words aligned with e,.
    In this expression We call the model described by equations (31) and (33) the basic translation model.
    We take the probabilities p(nle) and p(yle) as the fundamental parameters of the model, and parametrize the distortion probability in terms of simpler distributions.
    Brown et al. (1991) describe a method of estimating these parameters to maximize the likelihood of a large bilingual corpus of English and French sentences.
    Their method is based on the Estimation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a well-known i
