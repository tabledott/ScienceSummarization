condition 3, each C must align to a satisfying literal, while condition 4 assures that all available literals are consistent with this assignment to v, which therefore satisfies C. Claim 2.
    If (v, C) is satisfiable, then wsp(v, C) has an alignment a with 0(a) = 1.
    Proof.
    We construct such an alignment a from the satisfying assignment v. For each C, we choose a satisfying literal E consistent with the assignment.
    Align fC to the first available E token in e if the corresponding v is true, or the last if v is false.
    Align each fassign(v) to all remaining literals for v. Claims 1 and 2 together show that D is NPcomplete, and therefore that O is NP-hard.
    With another construction, we can show that S is #Phard, meaning that it is at least as hard as any #Pcomplete problem.
    #P is a class of counting problems related to NP, and #P-hard problems are NPhard as well.
