soon as the decision tree is induced, classifying an unseen quadruple is a relatively simple procedure.
    At first, the word senses of the quadruple are disambiguated by the algorithm described in Chapter 2, which is modified to exclude the SDT iteration cycles.
    Then a path is traversed in the decision tree, starting at its root and ending at a leaf.
    At each internal node, we follow the branch labelled by the attribute value which is the semantic ancestor of the attribute value of the quadruple (i.e. the branch attribute value is a semantic ancestori0 of the value of the quadruple attribute).
    The quadruple is assigned the attachment type associated with the leaf, i.e. adjectival or adverbial.
    If no match is found for the attribute value of the quadruple at any given node, the quadruple is assigned the majority type of the current node.
