l coverage than WordNet.
    For example, several of the instances contained proper names as either the X or Y argument (WordNet has poor proper name coverage).
    When an argument is not covered by any class, the inference is rejected.
    Figure 2 also illustrates how our three different ISP algorithms behave.
    The strictest filters, ISP.JIM and ISP.IIM.n, have the poorest overall performance but, as expected, have a generally very low rate of false positives.
    ISP.IIM.v, which is a much more permissive filter because it does not require both arguments of a relation to match, has generally many more false positives but has an overall better performance.
    We did not include in Figure 2 an analysis of the minimum, maximum, and average ranking strategies presented in Section 3.2 since they generally produced nearly identical results.
    For the most accurate system, ISP.IIM.v, we explored the impact of the cutoff threshold i on the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, as shown in Figure 3.
