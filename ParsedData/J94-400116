    That is, a path is a series of elements from a non-zero element in the lowest row in An to the element in the leftmost column in A.
    It has only one element in each column and extends toward the upper left.
    The series of bunsetsus on the left side of the path (sbi in Figure 2) and the series under the path (sb2 in Figure 2) are candidate conjuncts for a KB, B.
    When a KB is an NB, NBs after it are CBs; when a KB is a PB, PBs after it are CBs.
    To satisfy this condition, a path starts from a non-zero element that shows the correspondence of a KB to a CB (note the first process giving the similarity between two bunsetsus).
    We calculate a path score, which shows the similarity between two candidate conjuncts specified by the path, using the following five criteria: insertion in pre-conjunct and that in post-conjunct symmetrically, when a part of t
