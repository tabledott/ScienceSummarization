    The aim is to identify sentences that are representative of more than one article.
    Mani and Bloedorn (1997) link similar words and phrases from a pair of articles using WordNet (Miller et al. 1990) semantic relations.
    They show extracted sentences from the two articles side by side in the output.
    While useful in general, sentence extraction approaches cannot handle the task that we address, aggregate summarization across multiple documents, since this requires reasoning about similarities and differences across documents to produce generalizations or contradictions at a conceptual level.
    Work in summarization using symbolic techniques has tended to focus more on identifying information in text that can serve as a summary (Young and Hayes 1985; Rau 1988; Hahn 1990) than on generating the summary, and often relies heavily on domain-dependent scripts (DeJ
