    The two uses of segments in the first source document sentence do not refer to the same entity and thus, when the modifier is dropped, we get an anomaly.
    The second, more unusual problem is in the equation of Clinton/Dole, Dole/Clinton, and Clinton and Dole.
  
  
    Unlike traditional concept-to-text generation approaches, text-to-text generation methods take text as input and transform it into a new text satisfying some constraints (e.g., length or level of sophistication).
    In addition to sentence fusion, compression algorithms (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Bangalore 1996; Grefenstette 1998; Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999; Knight and Marcu 2002; Jing and McKeown 2000; Reizler et al. 2003) and methods for expansion of a multiparallel corpus (Pang, Knight, and Marcu 2003) are other instances of such methods.
    Compression methods have been developed for single-document summarization, and they aim to reduce a sentence by eliminating constituents which are not crucial for under
