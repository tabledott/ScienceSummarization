nslation models and ensembles of models willneed methods such as LOPs in order to balance sta tistical evidence from multiple sources.
			Model BLEU sw, tw 23.30 swc, tw 19.73 single 23.29 LOP 23.46 Table 6.
			German-English: CCG supertags are used as a factor on the source.
			The simple models are combined in two ways: either as a single log-linear model or as a LOP of log-linear models Table 6 shows that the simple, general model (model sw, tw) performs considerably better thanthe simple specific model, where there are multi ple dependencies on both words and CCG supertags (model swc, tw).
			This is because there are words in the test sentence that have been seen before but not with the CCG supertag.
			Statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined.
			The first wayto combine them is to join them in one single log linear model, which is trained over many features.This makes finding good weights difficult as the influence of the general model is greater, and its dif ficult for the more speci
