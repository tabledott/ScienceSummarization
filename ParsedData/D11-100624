 still only use English-target parallel data because that is the format of the readily available data in the Europarl corpus.
    Table 3 presents four sets of results.
    The first (best-source) is the direct transfer results for the oracle single-best source language per target language.
    The second (avg-source) is the mean UAS over all source languages per target language.
    The third (multi-dir.) is the multi-source direct transfer system.
    The fourth and final result set (multi-proj.) is the multi-source projected system.
    The resulting parsers are typically much more accurate than the English direct transfer system (Table 1).
    On average, the multi-source direct transfer system reduces errors by 10% relative over the English-only direct transfer system.
    These improvements are not consistent.
    For Greek and Dutch we see significant losses relative to the English-only system.
    An inspection of Table 2 shows that for these two languages English is a particularly good source trainin
