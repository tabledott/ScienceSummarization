	As in (Cherryand Lin, 2003), the above functions simplify the con ditioning portion, h by utilizing only the words andcontext involved in the link li.
			Training is done us ing the IIS technique (Della Pietra et al, 1995) and convergence often occurs in 3-10 iterations.
			The five types of features which are utilized in the system are described below.
			Phrase to phrase (for example, idiomatic phrases)alignments are intepreted as each English word com ing from each of the Arabic words.
			3.2.1 Lexical Features The lexical features are similar to the translationmatrix of the IBM Model 1.
			However, there is a sign ficant out of vocabulary (OOV) issue in the model since training data is limited.
			All words that have a corpus frequency of 1 are left out of the model and classed into an unknown word class in order to explicitly model connecting unknown words.
			From the training data we obtain 50K lexical features, and applying the Arabic segmenter obtain another 17K lexical features of the form ?(Englis
