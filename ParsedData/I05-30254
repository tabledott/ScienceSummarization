ry (OOV) words.
  Segmenting a text with many OOV words tends to result in lower accuracy.
  We ad- dress the problem of OOV words in two ways: using an external dictionary containing a list of predefined words, and using additional training corpora which are not segmented according to the same segmentation standard.
  1.2 External Dictionary If a sequence of characters in a sentence matches a word in an existing dictionary, it may be a clue that the sequence of characters should be segmented as one word.
  We used an online dictionary from Peking University downloadable from the Internet2, consisting of about 108,000 words of length one to four characters.
  If there is some sequence of neighboring characters around C0 in the sentence that matches a word in this dictionary, then we greedily choose the longest such matching word W in the dictionary.
  Let t0 be the boundary tag of C0 in W , L the number of characters in W , and C1(C?1) be the character 2http://ccl.pku.edu.cn/doubtfire/Course/ Chinese%20Inform
