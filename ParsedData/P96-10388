 phrasing, and melodic contours, was obtained by hand-labeling.
    We employed the ToBI standard for prosodic transcription (Pitrelli, Beckman, and Hirschberg, 1994), which is based upon Pierrehumbert's theory of American English intonation (Pierrehumbert, 1980).
    The ToBI transcription provided us with a breakdown of the speech sample into minor or INTERMEDIATE PHRASES (Pierrehumbert, 1980; Beckman and Pierrehumbert, 1986).
    This level of prosodic phrase served as our primary unit of analysis for measuring both speech and discourse properties.
    The portion of the corpus we report on consists of 494 and 552 intermediate phrases for read and spontaneous speech, respectively.
    In our research, the Grosz and Sidner (1986) theory of discourse structure, hereafter G&amp;S, provides a foundation for segmenting discourses into constituent parts.
    According to this model, at least three components of discourse structure must be distinguished.
    The utterances composing the discourse divide into segm
