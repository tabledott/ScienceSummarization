ncies, we introduce two nonmonotonicity features.
			To find the points of nonmonotonicity of a wordalignment, we arbitrarily designate one of the lan guages as the source and the other as the target.
			We sort the word pairs in the alignment, first by source word position, and then by target word position.
			We then iterate through the sorted alignment, looking only at the target word positions.
			The points of nonmonotonicity in the alignment will be the places where there are backward jumps in this sequence of target word positions.
			For example, suppose we have the sorted alignment ((1,1)(2,4)(2,5)(3,2)(5,6)).
			The sequence of target word positions in this sorted alignment is (1,4,5,2,6); hence, there is one point ofnonmonotonicity where target word position 2 fol lows target word position 5.
			We still need to decide how to measure the degreeof nonmonotonicity of an alignment.
			Two meth ods immediately suggest themselves.
			One is to sum the magnitudes of the backward jumps in the targetword s
