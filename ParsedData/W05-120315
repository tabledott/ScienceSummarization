ntailed).
    We evaluate the results in terms of accuracy, representing the number of correctly identified true or false classifications in the test data set.
    We also measure precision, recall and F-measure, calculated with respect to the true values in each of the test data sets.
    Tables 2 and 3 show the results obtained in the unsupervised setting, when a text semantic similarity larger than 0.5 was considered to be an indicator of paraphrasing (entailment).
    We also evaluate a metric that combines all the similarity measures using a simple average, with results indicated in the Combined row.
    The results obtained in the supervised setting are shown in Tables 4 and 5.
    The optimal combination of similarity metrics and optimal threshold are now determined in a learning process performed on the training set.
    Under this setting, we also compute an additional baseline, consisting of the most frequent label, as determined from the training data.
