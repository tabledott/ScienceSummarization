and will show how it can be calculated efficiently.
    The concept of worddependent substitution costs will be explained in Section 4.
    In Section 5, experimental results on the correlation of human judgment with the CDER and other well-known evaluation measures will be presented.
    Section 6 will conclude the paper and give an outlook on possible future work.
  
  
    In MT &#8211; as opposed to other natural language processing tasks like speech recognition &#8211; there is usually more than one correct outcome of a task.
    In many cases, alternative translations of a sentence differ from each other mostly by the ordering of blocks of words.
    Consequently, an evaluation measure for MT should be able to detect and allow for block reordering.
    Nevertheless, a higher &#8220;amount&#8221; of reordering between a candidate translation and a reference translation should still be reflected in a worse evaluation score.
    In other words, the more blocks there are to be reordered between reference an
