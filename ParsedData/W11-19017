    The OntoNotes project has created a corpus of largescale, accurate, and integrated annotation of multiple levels of the shallow semantic structure in text.
    The idea is that this rich, integrated annotation covering many layers will allow for richer, cross-layer models enabling significantly better automatic semantic analysis.
    In addition to coreference, this data is also tagged with syntactic trees, high coverage verb and some noun propositions, partial verb and noun word senses, and 18 named entity types.
    However, such multi-layer annotations, with complex, cross-layer dependencies, demands a robust, efficient, scalable mechanism for storing them while providing efficient, convenient, integrated access to the the underlying structure.
    To this effect, it uses a relational database representation that captures both the inter- and intra-layer dependencies and also provides an object-oriented API for efficient, multitiere
