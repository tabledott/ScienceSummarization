ole.
    The former is obtained through determining the position of the node with respect to the anchor of the tree using the usually positional rules for determining argument status in English.
    The latter is obtained from the former and also from knowledge of the syntactic transformations that have been applied to the tree.
    For example, we determine the deep syntactic role of a whmoved element by &#8220;undoing&#8221; the wh-movement by using the trace information in the PTB.
    The PropBank contains all of the notation of the Penn Treebank as well as semantic notation.
    For our current work, we extract two kinds of TAG from the PropBank.
    One grammar, SEM-TAG, has elementary trees annotated with the aforementioned syntactic information as well as semantic information.
    Semantic information includes semantic role as well as semantic subcategorization information.
    The other grammar, SYNT-TAG, differs from SEM-TAG only by the absence of any semantic role information.
