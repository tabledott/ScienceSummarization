tisfies the Case Filter is said to &amp;quot;get case&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;have case&amp;quot;, while one that violates it is said to &amp;quot;lack case&amp;quot;.
    The program judges an open-class word to be a main verb if it is adjacent to a pronoun or proper name that would otherwise lack case.
    Such a pronoun or proper name is either the subject or the direct object of the verb.
    Other noun phrases are not used because it is too difficult to determine their right boundaries accurately.
    The two criteria for evaluating the performance of the main-verb detection technique are efficiency and accuracy.
    Both were measured using a 2.6 million word corpus for which the Penn Treebank project provides hand-verified tags.
    Efficiency of verb detection was assessed by running the SF detection module in the normal mode, where verbs were detected using the Case Filter technique, and then running it again with the Penn Tags substituted for the verb detection module.
    The results are shown in Ta
