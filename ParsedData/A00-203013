gory is multiplied by the generative probability of that constituent (Goodman, 1997).
    We can think of this prior probability as an estimate of the probability of generating a subtree with the constituent category, starting at the topmost node.
    Thus, the scores used in pruning can be considered as the product of: 1.
    The probability of generating a constituent of the specified category, starting at the topmost node.
    2.
    The probability of generating the structure beneath that constituent, having already generated a constituent of that category.
    Given a new sentence, the outcome of this search process is a tree structure that encodes both the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentence.
    The semantics &#8212; that is, the entities and relations &#8212; can then be directly extracted from these sentential trees.
  
  
    Our system for MUC-7 consisted of the sentential model described in this paper, coupled with a simple probability model for cross-sentence merging.
