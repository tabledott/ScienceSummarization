proved with moderate settings of S, which sug gests that the data are still sparse for many of thewalks, although the improvement vanishes if S dom inates with much larger values.
			This makes sense, as each walk has over 100,000 parameters, there are fewer than 100,000 words in SEMCOR, and each 0.24 0.26 0.28 0.3 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 S=20 S=15 S=10 S=5 S=1 S=0.1 Accuracy Smoot hing F actor 64 top ics 32 top ics 16 top ics 8 topic s 4 topic s 2 topic s 1 topic Rando m Figure 4: Each line represents experiments with a setnumber of topics and variable amounts of smooth ing on the SEMCOR corpus.

			As smoothing increases, the prior(based on token frequency) becomes stronger.
