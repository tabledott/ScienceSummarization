 compatible head pairs, we utilize our BLIPP and WIKI data sets (see Section 2), and for each noun (proper or common) and pronoun, we assign a maximal NP mention node for each nominal head as in Section 3.1.1; we then annotate appositive and predicate-nominative NPs as in Section 3.1.3.
    For any NP which is annotated as an appositive or predicate-nominative, we extract the head pair of that node and its constrained antecedent.
    The resulting set of compatible head words, while large, covers a little more than half of the examples given in Table 1.
