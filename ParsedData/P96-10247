is Brill's Transformation-Based Error Driven system (Brill, 1993), which induces a set of transformations designed to maximize the Consistent Brackets Recall Rate.
    However, Brill's system is not probabilistic.
    Intuitively, if one were to match the parsing algorithm to the evaluation criterion, better performance should be achieved.
    Ideally, one might try to directly maximize the most commonly used evaluation criteria, such as Consistent Brackets Recall (Crossing Brackets) Rate.
    Unfortunately, this criterion is relatively difficult to maximize, since it is time-consuming to compute the probability that a particular constituent crosses some constituent in the correct parse.
    On the other hand, the Bracketed Recall and Bracketed Tree Rates are easier to handle, since computing the probability that a bracket matches one in the correct parse is inexpensive.
    It is plausible that algorithms which optimize these closely related criteria will do well on the analogous Consistent Brackets criteria
