cal and machine learning techniques were used to extract classifiers from hand-tagged corpus.
    Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1995) proposed an unsupervised method that used heuristics to obtain seed classifications and expanded the results to the other parts of the corpus, thus avoided the need to hand-annotate any examples.
    Most previous corpus-based WSD algorithms determine the meanings of polysemous words by exploiting their local contexts.
    A basic intuition that underlies those algorithms is the following: (1) Two occurrences of the same word have identical meanings if they have similar local contexts.
    In other words, most previous corpus-based WSD algorithms learn to disambiguate a polysemous word from previous usages of the same word.
    This has several undesirable consequences.
    Firstly, a word must occur thousands of times before a good classifier can be learned.
    In Yarowsky's experiment (Yarowsky, 1995), an average of 3936 examples were used to disambiguate between two senses.
