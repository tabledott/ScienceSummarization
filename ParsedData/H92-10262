  Mager- man and Marcus [10] propose a model of context that combines the n-gram model with information from dom- inating constituents.
  All of these aspects of context are necessary for disambiguation, yet none is sufficient.
  We propose a probabilistic model of context for disam- biguation in parsing, HBG, which incorporates the intu- itions of these previous works into one unified framework.
  Let p(T, w~) be the joint probabil ity of generating the word string w~ and the parse tree T. Given w~, our parser chooses as its parse tree that tree T* for which T* = argmaxp(T ,  w~) (1) TeP(w
