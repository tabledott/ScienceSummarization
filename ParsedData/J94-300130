    By an induction on the number of transitions patterned after the one above, it follows that for any strings x and y, The composite transducer enters a final state just in case both component machines do for some intermediate z.
    This establishes that the composite transducer does represent the composition of the relations R1 and R2, and that the composition of two regular relations is therefore regular.
    Composition of regular relations, like composition of relations in general, is associative: (R1 o R2) 0 R3 = R1 0 (R2 0 R3) = R1 0 R2 0 R3.
    For relations in general we also know that Range(Ri 0R2) = Range(Ri)/ R2.
    We can use this fact about the range of a composition to prove that the image of a regular language under a regular relation is a regula
