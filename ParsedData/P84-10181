    A classical translating machine stands with one foot on the input text and one on the output.
    The input text is analyzed by the components of the machine that make up the left leg, each one feeding information into the one above it.

    The components of each leg correspond to the chapters of an introductory textbook on linguistics with phonology or graphology at the bottom, then syntax, semantics, and so on.
    The legs join where languages ar
