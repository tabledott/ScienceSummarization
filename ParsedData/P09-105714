p with uniform weights also yields the same tagging improvements as shown in Figure 5.
    We find that the observed grammar also improves, growing from 459 entries to 603 entries, with precision increasing from 0.94 to 0.96, and recall increasing from 0.57 to 0.76.
    The figure also shows the model&#8217;s internal grammar and dictionary sizes.
    Figure 6 and 7 show how the precision/recall of the observed grammar and dictionary varies for different models from Figure 5.
    In the case of the observed grammar (Figure 6), precision increases at each step, whereas recall drops initially (owing to the grammar minimization) but then picks up again.
    The precision/recall of the observed dictionary on the other hand, is not affected by much.
  
  
    Multiple random restarts for EM, while not often emphasized in the literature, are key in this domain.
    Recall that our original EM tagging with a fully-connected 2-gram tag model was 81.7% accurate.
    When we execute 100 random restarts and select the m
