 the original dataset the pairs for which we did not have the correct word in the pronunciation dictionary.
    Both models LTR and PH were trained on the same training set.
    The interpolation weight that the combined model CMB uses is also set on the training set to maximize the classification accuracy.
    At test time we do not search through all possible words r in the dictionary to find the one maximizing SeoreCMB(wjr).
    Rather, we compute the combination score only for candidate words r that are in the top N according to the PLTR(wjr) or are in the top N according to PPH(pron wjpron r) for any of the pronunciations of r from the dictionary and any of the pronunciations for w that were proposed by the letter-to-phone model.
    The letter-to-phone model returned for each w the 3 most probable pronunciations only.
    Our performance was better when we considered the top 3 pronunciations of w rather than a single most likely hypothesis.
    That is probably due to the fact that the 3-best accuracy o
