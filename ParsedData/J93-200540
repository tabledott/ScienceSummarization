e nouns can therefore be used with some predictive certainty for inducing the semantic type in coercive environments such as &amp;quot;veto the expedition.&amp;quot; This work is still preliminary, however, and requires further examination (Pustejovsky and Rooth [unpublished]).
    In this section, we present another experiment indicating the feasibility of inducing semantic tags for lexical items from corpora.'
    Imagine being able to take the V-0 pairs Counts for objects of veto/V. such as those given in Section 4.1, and then applying semantic tags to the verbs that are appropriate to the role they play for that object (i.e., induction of the qualia roles for that noun).
    This is similar to the experiment reported on in Section 3.
    Here we apply a similar technique to a much larger corpus, in order to induce the agentive role for nouns; that is, the semantic predicate associated with bringing about the object.
    In this example we look at the behavior of noun phrases and the prepositional phrases
