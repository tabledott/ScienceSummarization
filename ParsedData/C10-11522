9).At sentence level, reading difficulty stems either from lexical or syntactic complexity.
			Sen tence simplification can therefore be classifiedinto two types: lexical simplification and syntac tic simplification (Carroll et al, 1999).
			These two types of simplification can be further implemented by a set of simplification operations.
			Splitting, dropping, reordering, and substitution are widely accepted as important simplification operations.
			The splitting operation splits a long sentence intoseveral shorter sentences to decrease the complex ity of the long sentence.
			The dropping operation further removes unimportant parts of a sentence to make it more concise.
			The reordering operationinterchanges the order of the split sentences (Sid dharthan, 2006) or parts in a sentence (Watanabeet al, 2009).
			Finally, the substitution operation re places difficult phrases or words with their simpler synonyms.In most cases, different simplification operations happen simultaneously.
			It is therefore nec
