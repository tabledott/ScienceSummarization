o produce a grammatical interpretation of a sentence which represents the syntactic and semantic intent of the sentence.
    To achieve this goal, the parser must have a mechanism for estimating the coherence of an interpretation, both in isolation and in context.
    Probabilistic language models provide such a mechanism.
    A probabilistic language model attempts to estimate the probability of a sequence of sentences and their respective interpretations (parse trees) occurring in the language, The difficulty in applying probabilistic models to natural language is deciding what aspects of the sentence and the discourse are relevant to the model.
    Most previous probabilistic models of parsing assume the probabilities of sentences in a discourse are independent of other sentences.
    In fact, previous works have made much stronger independence assumptions.
    The P-CFG model considers the probability of each constituent rule independent of all other constituents in the sentence.
