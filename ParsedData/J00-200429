ine in his use of the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) (Deming and Stephan 1940) for parameter estimation.
    The IPFP is quite sensitive to initial conditions, so Hiemstra investigated a number of initialization options.
    Choosing the most advantageous, Hiemstra has published parts of the translational distributions of certain words, induced using both his method and Brown et al. 's (1993b) Model 1 from the same training bitext.
    Subjective comparison of these examples suggests that Hiemstra's method is more accurate.
    Hiemstra (1998) has also evaluated the recall and precision of his method and of Model 1 on a small hand-constructed set of link tokens in a particular bitext.
    Model 1 fared worse, on average.
  
  
    This section describes my methods for estimating the parameters of a symmetric wordto-word translation model from a bitext.
    For most applications, we are interested in estimating the probability trans (u, v) of jointly generating the pair of words (u, v).
