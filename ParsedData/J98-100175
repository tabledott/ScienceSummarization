restoration of accents in text, while tasks such as machine translation require fine sense distinctions&#8212;in some cases finer than what monolingual dictionaries provide (see, for example, ten Hacken [1990]).
    For example, the English word river is translated as fleuve in French when the river flows into the ocean, and otherwise as riviere.
    There is not, however, a strict correspondence between a given task and the degree of granularity required.
    For example, as noted earlier, the word mouse, although it has two distinct senses (animal, device), translates into French in both cases to souris.
    On the other hand, for information retrieval the distinction between these two senses of mouse is important, whereas it is difficult to imagine a reason to distinguish river (sense fleuve) - river (sense riviere).
    Second, and more generally, it is unclear when senses should be combined or split.
    Even lexicographers do not agree: Fillmore and Atkins (1991) identify three senses of the word risk b
