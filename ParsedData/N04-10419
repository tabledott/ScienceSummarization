wave occurred in this context, then the context is a feature of wave.
    We first construct a frequency count vector C(e) = (ce1, ce2, &#65533;, cem), where m is the total number of features and cef is the frequency count of feature f occurring in word e. Here, cef is the number of times word e occurred in a grammatical context f. For example, if the word wave occurred 217 times as the object of the verb catch, then the feature vector for wave will have value 217 for its &amp;quot;object-of catch&amp;quot; feature.
    In Section 4.1, we describe how we obtain these features.
    We then construct a mutual information vector MI(e) = (mie1, mie2, ..., miem) for each word e, where mief is the pointwise mutual information between word e and feature f, which is defined as: Following (Pantel and Lin 2002), we construct a committee for each semantic class.
    A committee is a set of representative elements that unambiguously describe the members of a possible class.
    For each class c, we construct a matrix con
