    Usually, people write texts so that the most important ideas go first, both at the paragraph and at the text level.'

    Consider the following text from the November 1996 issue of Scientific American (3).
    The words in italics denote the discourse markers, the square brackets denote 'In fact, journalists are trained to employ this &amp;quot;pyramid&amp;quot; approach to writing c
