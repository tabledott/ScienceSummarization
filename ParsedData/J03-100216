n are removed from the association score matrix.
    This procedure is iteratively repeated until every source or target language word is aligned.
    The advantage of this approach is that indirect associations (i.e., words that co-occur often but are not translations of each other) occur less often.
    The resulting alignment contains only one-to-one alignments and typically has a higher precision than the heuristic model defined in equation (7). tage of the heuristic models is their simplicity.
    They are very easy to implement and understand.
    Therefore, variants of the heuristic models described above are widely used in the word alignment literature.
    One problem with heuristic models is that the use of a specific similarity function seems to be completely arbitrary.
    The literature contains a large variety of different scoring functions, some including empirically adjusted parameters.
    As we show in Section 6, the Dice coefficient results in a worse alignment quality than the statistical
