inese Treebank appears to be to put NP adjuncts into VP unless they are followed by an overt subject, or otherwise distinguished as IP-level (e.g., have scope over a clear IP coordination).
    This could be dealt with in PCFG annotation in two ways.
    One is to retain subject (and/or non-subject) functional marking from the CTB.
    The other is to mark VP adjuncts.
    In practice, we found that the former hurt performance whereas the latter helped somewhat.
    The strongest mistagging tendency was to tag verbs (VV) as common nouns (NN).
    Upon manual examination, the asymmetry of N-as-V and V-as-N mistagging frequency seems in line with the global prior over POS tags; the overall N:V ratio in the corpus is 2.5:1.
    We briefly explain here why N/V ambiguity is a hard problem in Chinese.
    All natural languages possess derivational means by which roots can switch between nominal and verbal categories.
    When there is overt morphological marking for these processes, as is always the case in Russian
