all these techniques.
    Bloom filters have been widely used in database applications for reducing communications overheads and were recently applied to encode word frequencies in information retrieval (Linari and Weikum, 2006) using a method that resembles the non-redundant scheme described above.
    Extensions of the BF to associate frequencies with items in the set have been proposed e.g., (Cormode and Muthukrishn, 2005); while these schemes are more general than ours, they incur greater space overheads for the distributions that we consider here.
  
  
    We have shown that Bloom Filters can form the basis for space-efficient language modelling in SMT.
    Extending the standard BF structure to encode corpus frequency information and developing a strategy for reducing the error rates of these models by sub-sequence filtering, our models enable higherorder n-grams and larger monolingual corpora to be used more easily for language modelling in SMT.
