e=&amp;quot;DATE&amp;quot; val=&amp;quot;2004-11-22&amp;quot; For TempEval-2, we distinguish four temporal types: TIME (at 2:45 p.m.), DATE (January 27, 1920, yesterday), DURATION (two weeks) and SET (every Monday morning).
    The VAL attribute assumes values according to an extension of the ISO 8601 standard, as enhanced by TIMEX2.
    Each document has one special TIMEX3 tag, the Document Creation Time (DCT), which is interpreted as an interval that spans a whole day.
    The EVENT tag is used to annotate those elements in a text that describe what is conventionally referred to as an eventuality.
    Syntactically, events are typically expressed as inflected verbs, although event nominals, such as &#8221;crash&#8221; in killed by the crash, should also be annotated as EVENTS.
    The most salient event attributes encode tense, aspect, modality and polarity information.
    Examples of some of these features are shown below: Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, ACL 2010, pag
