that was computed by summing over all uses of ins Wasser fallen with the literal and idiomatic vectors from above.
    Since idiomatic uses of ins Wasserfallen prevail in the corpus (2/3 vs. 1/3), it is not surprisingly that the similarity to the literal vector (0.0946) is much than similarity to the idiomatic vector (0.3712).
    To summarize Experiment I, which is a variant of a supervised phrase sense disambiguation task, demonstrates that we can use LSA to distinguish between literal and the idiomatic usage of an MWE by using local linguistic context.
    4This was a straightforward task; two annotators annotated independently, with very high agreement&#8212;kappa score of over 0.95 (Carletta, 1996).
    Occurrences on which the annotators disagreed were thrown out.
    Of the 64 occurrences we used, 37 were idiomatic and 27 were literal.
    In our second experiment we sought to make use of the fact that there are typically clear distributional difference between compositional and non-compositional uses
