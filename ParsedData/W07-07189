fy meaning, or how many grammatical errors (or what sort) separates the different levels of fluency.
    Because of this many judges either develop their own rules of thumb, or use the scales as relative rather than absolute.
    These are borne out in our analysis of inter-annotator agreement in Section 6.
    Because fluency and adequacy were seemingly difficult things for judges to agree on, and because many people from last year&#8217;s workshop seemed to be using them as a way of ranking translations, we decided to try a separate evaluation where people were simply asked to rank translations.

    These instructions were just as minimal as for fluency and adequacy, but the task was considerably simplified.
    Rather than having to assign each translation a value along an arbitrary scale, people simply had to compare different translations of a single sentence
