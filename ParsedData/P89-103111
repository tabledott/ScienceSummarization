ords and task structure.
    The rules are: BFP never state that cospecifiers for pronouns within the same segment are preferred over those in previous segments, but this is an implicit assumption, since this line of research is derived from Sidner's work on local focusing.
    Segment initial utterances therefore are the only situation where the BFP algorithm will prefer a within-sentence noun phrase as the cospecifier of a pronoun.
    The Hobbs algorithm is based on searching for a pronoun's co-specifier in the syntactic parse tree of input sentences [Hob76b].
    We reproduce this algorithm in full in the appendix along with an example.
    Hobbs algorithm operates on one sentence at a time, but the structure of previous sentences in the discourse is available.
    It is stated in terms of searches on parse trees.
    When looking for an intrasentential antecedent, these searches are conducted in a left-toright, breadth-first manner.
    However, when looking for a pronoun's antecedent within a sentence,
