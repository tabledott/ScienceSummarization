g level: it is tractable but not trivial.
    Our next steps include: standardized multiple-choice reading comprehension test.
    This will require some minor changes in strategy.
    For example, in preliminary experiments, our system chose the answer that had the highest sentence matching score when composed with the question.
    This gave us a score of 45% on a small multiplechoice test set.
    Such tests require us to deal with a wider variety of question types, e.g., What is this story about?
    This will also provide an opportunity to look at rejection measures, since many tests penalize for random guessing.
    &#8226; Moving from whole sentence retrieval towards answer phrase retrieval.
    This will allow us to improve answer word precision, which provides a good measure of how much extraneous material we are still returning.
    &#8226; Adding new linguistic knowledge sources.
    We need to perform further hand annotation experiments to determine the effectiveness of semantic class identificati
