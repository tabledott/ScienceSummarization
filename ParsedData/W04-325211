ertices that are added to the text graph.
    Any relation that can be defined between two lexical units is a potentially useful connection (edge) that can be added between two such vertices.
    We are using a co-occurrence relation, controlled by the distance between word occurrences: two vertices are connected if their corresponding lexical units co-occur within a window of maximum words, where can be set anywhere from 2 to 10 words.
    Co-occurrence links express relations between syntactic elements, and similar to the semantic links found useful for the task of word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea et al., 2004), they represent cohesion indicators for a given text.
    The vertices added to the graph can be restricted with syntactic filters, which select only lexical units of a certain part of speech.
    One can for instance consider only nouns and verbs for addition to the graph, and consequently draw potential edges based only on relations that can be established between nouns and verbs.
