    We used the same procedure that is used in Church (1988).

    Paragraph lengths are highly correlated.
    The horizontal axis shows the length of English paragraphs, while the vertical scale shows the lengths of the corresponding German paragraphs.

    Figure 1 shows that the lengths (in characters) of English and German paragraphs are highly correlated (.991).
    Dynamic programming is often used to align two sequences of symbols in a var
