rule-set, this algorithm runs in time linear to the length of the input sentence, since p and q are considered grammar constants, and n is proportional to the input length.
    The full pseudocode is worked out in Algorithm 1.
    A restricted version of this algorithm first appears in compiling for optimal code generation from expression-trees (Aho and Johnson, 1976).
    In computational linguistics, the bottom-up version of this algorithm resembles the tree parsing algorithm for TSG by Eisner (2003).
    Similar algorithms have also been proposed for dependency-based translation (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005).
    Under the log-linear model, one still prefers to search for the globally best derivation d*: However, integrating the n-gram model with the translation model in the search is computationally very expensive.
    As a standard alternative, rather than aiming at the exact best derivation, we search for top-k derivations under the direct model using Algorithm 1, and then rerank the k-best list wi
