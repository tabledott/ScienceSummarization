y of the model.
  We imple- mented an extended PCFG that conditions each node?s expansion on its parent in the phrase structure tree.
  The extended PCFG (henceforth PCFG-GP) has parameters P(Ak Ai ?
  The resulting grammar can be viewed as a PCFG whose nonterminals are pairs of the nonterminals of the original PCFG.
  The combined model scores possible parses using probabilities from the PCFG-GP model together with the probability of the preterminal sequence of the parse tree according to a trigram tag sequence model.
  More specif- ically, for a tree T , Score(t) = log(PPCFG-GP(T )) + ?
  log(PTRIG(tags(T )) where PTRIG(tags(T )) is the probability of the sequence of preterminals t1 ?
  tn in T according to a trigram tag model: PTRIG(t1 ?
  tn) = ?n i=1 P(ti |ti?1, ti?2) with appropriate treatment of boundaries.
  The trigram probabilities are smoothed as for the HMM tagger.
  The combined model is relatively insensitive to the relative weights of the two component models, as specified by ?
