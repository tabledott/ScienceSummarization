			Table 3 shows the unsupervised evaluation of the systems on the test corpus.
			We also include three baselines: the ?one cluster per word?
			baseline (1c1word), which groups all instances of a word intoa single cluster, the ?one cluster per instance?
			baseline (1c1inst), where each instance is a distinct clus ter, and a random baseline, where the induced wordsenses and their associated weights have been ran domly produced.
			The random baseline figures in this paper are averages over 10 runs.
			As shown in Table 3, no system outperforms the 1c1word baseline, which indicates that this baseline 10is quite strong, perhaps due the relatively small num ber of classes in the gold standard.
			However, all systems outperform by far the random and 1c1instbaselines, meaning that the systems are able to in duce correct senses.
