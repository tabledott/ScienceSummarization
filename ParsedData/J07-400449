del and the parser output.
  
  
    This section describes two parsing models for CCG.
    The first defines the probability of a dependency structure, and the second&#8212;the normal-form model&#8212;defines the probability of a single derivation.
    In many respects, modeling single derivations is simpler than modeling dependency structures, as the rest of the article will demonstrate.
    However, there are a number of reasons for modeling dependency structures.
    First, for many applications predicate&#8211;argument dependencies provide a more useful output than derivations, and the parser evaluation is over dependencies; hence it would seem reasonable to optimize over the dependencies rather than the derivation.
    Second, we want to investigate, for the purposes of parse selection, whether there is useful information in the nonstandard derivations.
    We can test this by defining the probability of a dependency structure in terms of all the derivations leading to that structure, rather than emphas
