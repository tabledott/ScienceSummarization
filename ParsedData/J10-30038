; Kauchak and Barzilay 2006).
    Methods at the other end of the spectrum that paraphrase supra-sentential units such as paragraphs and entire documents are also omitted from discussion (Hovy 1988; Inui and Nogami 2001; Hallett and Scott 2005; Power and Scott 2005).
    Finally, we also do not discuss the notion of near-synonymy (Hirst 1995; Edmonds and Hirst 2002).
    Before describing the techniques used for paraphrasing, it is essential to examine the broader context of the application of paraphrases.
    For some of the applications we discuss subsequently, the use of paraphrases in the manner described may not yet be the norm.
    However, wherever applicable, we cite recent research that promises gains in performance by using paraphrases for these applications.
    Also note that we only discuss those paraphrasing techniques that can generate the types of paraphrases under examination in this survey: phrasal and sentential.
