wing p(ni, n2) or p(ci, c2, ni, n2) as a function of 0 for fixed pLc(.).
    The re-estimation formulae resulting from this incomplete data estimation problem have the following simple form (f(ni, n2) is the frequency of (ni, n2) in the sample of noun argument pairs of the fixed verb): Note that the class distributions p(c) and p(ci, c2) for intransitive and transitive models can be computed also for verbs unseen in the LC model. blush 5 0.982975 snarl 5 0.962094 constance 3 mandeyille 2 christina 3 jinkwa 2 willie 2.99737 man 1.99859 ronni 2 scott 1.99761 claudia 2 omalley 1.99755 gabriel 2 shamlou 1 maggie 2 angalo 1 bathsheba 2 corbett 1 sarah 2 southgate 1 girl 1.9977 ace 1 Experiments used a model with 35 classes.
    From maximal probability parses for the British National Corpus derived with a statistical parser (Carroll and Rooth, 1998), we extracted frequency tables for intransitve verb/subject pairs and transitive verb/subject/object triples.
