ith monosemous relatives and testing on manually tagged examples.
    Performance is about the same as, or only slightly better than, the highest prior probability.
    In part, this is due to the rather high probability of the most frequent sense for this set.
    The values in the table are based on decisions made on all test examples.
    If a threshold is set for TLC (see Section 2.4), precision of the classifier can be increased substantially, at the expense of recall.
    Table 7 shows recall levels when TLC is trained on monosemous relatives and the value of e is set for 95% precision.
    Operating in this mode, the classifier can gather new training materials, automatically, and with high precision.
    This is a particularly good way to find clear cases of the most frequent sense.
    The results also show that not all words are well suited to this kind of operation.
    Little can be gained for a word like work, where the two senses, 'activity' and 'product,' are closely related and therefore diffi
