rather than all the children having to be chosen when the node is first introduced.
    We also extended the parsing strategy slightly to handle Chomsky adjunction structures (i.e. structures of the form [X [X ] [Y ]]) as a special case.
    The Chomsky adjunction is removed and replaced with a special &#8220;modifier&#8221; link in the tree (becoming [X [ Y ]]).
    We also compiled some frequent chains of nonbranching nodes (such as [S [VP ]]) into a single node with a new label (becoming [S-VP ]).
    All these grammar transforms are undone before any evaluation of the output trees is performed.
    An example of the ordering of the decisions in a derivation is shown by the numbering on the left in figure 1.
    To precisely specify this ordering, it is sufficient to characterize the state of the parser as a stack of nodes which are in the process of being parsed, as illustrated on the right in figure 1.
    The parsing strategy starts with a stack that contains a node labeled ROOT (step 0) and must end in
