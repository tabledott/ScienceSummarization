			Subsequence LCS has many nice properties as we have described in the previous sections.
			Unfortunately, the basic LCS also has a problem that it does not differentiate LCSes of different spatial relations within their embedding sequences.
			For example, given a reference sequence X and two candidate sequences Y1 and Y2 as follows: X: [A B C D E F G] Y1: [A B C D H I K] Y2: [A H B K C I D] Y1 and Y2 have the same ROUGE-L score.
			However, in this case, Y1 should be the better choice than Y2 because Y1 has consecutive matches.
			To improve the basic LCS method, we can simply remember the length of consecutive matches encountered so far to a regular two dimensional dynamic program table computing LCS.
			We call this weighted LCS (WLCS) and use k to indicate the length of the current consecutive matches ending at words xi and yj.
			Given two sentences X and Y, the recurrent relations can be written as follows: (1) If xi = yj Then // the length of consecutive matches at // position
