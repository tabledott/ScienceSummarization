    The central idea of transformation-based learning (TBL) is to learn an ordered list of rules which progressively improve upon the current state of the training set.
    An initial assignment is made based on simple statistics, and then rules are greedily learned to correct the mistakes, until no net improvement can be made.
    The following definitions and notations will be used throughout the paper: where Since we are not interested in rules that have a negative objective function value, only the rules that have a positive good (r) need be examined.
    This leads to the following approach: The system thus learns a list of rules in a greedy fashion, according to the objective function.
    When no rule that improves the current state of the training set beyond a pre-set threshold can be found, the training phase ends.
    During the application phase, the evaluation set is initialized with the initial class assignment.
    The rules are then applied sequentially to the
