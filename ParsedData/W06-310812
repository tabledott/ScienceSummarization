n and evaluate the reordering model, we use the word aligned bilingual training corpus.
    For evaluating the classification power of the reordering model, we partition the corpus into a training part and a test part.
    In our experiments, we use about 10% of the corpus for testing and the remaining part for training the feature weights of the reordering model with the GIS algorithm using YASMET (Och, 2001).
    The statistics of the training and test alignment links is shown in Table 2.
    The number of training events ranges from 119K for JapaneseEnglish to 144K for Arabic-English.
    The word classes for the class-based features are trained using the mkcls tool (Och, 1999).
    In the experiments, we use 50 word classes.
    Alternatively, one could use part-of-speech information for this purpose.
    Additional experiments were carried out on the large data track of the Chinese-English NIST task.
    The corpus statistics of the bilingual training corpus are shown in Table 3.
