f CEs unrealistically simplifies the coreference resolution task.
    Finally, several coreference systems have successfully incorporated anaphoricity determination modules (e.g.
    Ng and Cardie (2002a) and Bean and Riloff (2004)).
    The goal of the module is to determine whether or not an NP is anaphoric.
    For example, pleonastic pronouns (e.g. it is raining) are special cases that do not require coreference resolution.
    Unfortunately, neither the MUC nor the ACE data sets include anaphoricity information for all NPs.
    Rather, they encode anaphoricity information implicitly for annotated CEs: a CE is considered anaphoric if is not a singleton.6 To study the utility of anaphoricity information, we train and test only on the &#8220;anaphoric&#8221; extracted CEs, i.e. the extracted CEs that have an annotated twin that is not a singleton.
    Note that for the MUC datasets all extracted CEs that have twins are considered anaphoric.
    Results for this experiment (box 6 in Table 3) are similar to t
