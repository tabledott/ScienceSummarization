r et al. (1997) discuss some of the complexities in automatic detection of genre using a set of computationally efficient cues, such as punctuation, abbreviations, or presence of Latinate suffixes.
    The taxonomy of genres and facets developed in Kessler et al. is useful for a wide range of types, such as found in the Brown corpus.

    In our study, we explored the contribution of verbs as one factor
