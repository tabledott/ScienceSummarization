			The parameters of the function are the weight vectors ??w and ??v , the sentence xi, the gold dependency structure yi, the predicted dependency structure yp, and the update weight ?.
			The function ? calculates the number ofwrong labeled edges.
			The update function updates the weight vectors, if at least one edge is la beled wrong.
			It calculates the difference ??u of the feature vectors of the gold dependency structure ?(xi, yi) and the predicted dependency structure?(xi, yp).
			Each time, we use the feature represen tation ?, the hash function h maps the features to integer numbers between 1 and |??w |.
			After that the update function calculates the margin ? and updates ??w and ??v respectively.
			Algorithm 3 shows the training algorithm forthe Hash Kernel in pseudo code.
			A main dif ference to the baseline algorithm is that it does not store the features because of the required time which is ne
