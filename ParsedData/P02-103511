tructures.
    More complex property functions are designed to indicate, for example, the branching behaviour of c-structures and the (non)parallelism of coordinations on both c-structure and f-structure levels.
    Furthermore, properties refering to lexical elements based on an auxiliary distribution approach as presented in Riezler et al. (2000) are included in the model.
    Here tuples of head words, argument words, and grammatical relations are extracted from the training sections of the WSJ, and fed into a finite mixture model for clustering grammatical relations.
    The clustering model itself is then used to yield smoothed probabilities as values for property functions on head-argument-relation tuples of LFG parses.
    Discriminative estimation techniques have recently received great attention in the statistical machine learning community and have already been applied to statistical parsing (Johnson et al., 1999; Collins, 2000; Collins and Duffy, 2001).
    In discriminative estimation, only the co
