translation speed of more than 1000 words per second for the Verbmobil task and for the Xerox task.
    Even for the Canadian Hansards task the translation of sentences of length 30 takes only about 1.5 seconds.
    The described search is monotone at the phrase level.
    Within the phrases, there are no constraints on the reorderings.
    Therefore, this method is best suited for language pairs that have a similar order at the level of the phrases learned by the system.
    Thus, the translation process should require only local reorderings.
    As the experiments have shown, Spanish-English and French-English are examples of such language pairs.
    For these pairs, the monotone search was found to be sufficient.
    The phrase-based approach clearly outperformed the singleword based systems.
    It showed even better performance than the alignment template system.
    The experiments on the German-English Verbmobil task outlined the limitations of the monotone search.
    As the low degree of monotonicity
