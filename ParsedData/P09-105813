 of nodes in the correct path that cannot be recognized by the system.
    We define the loss function by: This loss function can reflect how bad the predicted path y&#65533; is compared to the correct path yt.
    A weighted loss function based on FP and FN can be found in (Ganchev et al., 2007).
    This section discusses the structure of f(x,y).
    We broadly classify features into two categories: unigram and bigram features.
    We design our feature templates to capture various levels of information about words and POS tags.
    Let us introduce some notation.
    We write w&#8722;1 and w0 for the surface forms of words, where subscripts &#8722;1 and 0 indicate the previous and current positions, respectively.
    POS tags p&#8722;1 and p0 can be interpreted in the same way.
    We denote the characters by cj.
    Unigram features: Table 2 shows our unigram features.
    Templates W0&#8211;W3 are basic word-level unigram features, where Length(w0) denotes the length of the word w0.
