ps NP[prd]\NP) to predicative NP arguments of verbs like makes, not only in these examples, but also in copular sentences and appositives.
    The other case where small clauses are used in the Treebank includes absolute with and though constructions (with the limit in effect).
    Here, we also assume that the subordinating conjunction takes the individual constituents in the small clause as complements, and with obtains therefore the category ((S/S)/PP)/NP.
    Again, a predicative analysis of the PP might be desirable in order to express the dependencies between limit and in effect.
    Eliminating small clauses affects 8.2% of sentences.
  
  
    The treatment of non-local dependencies is one of the most important points of difference between grammar formalisms.
    The Treebank uses a large inventory of null element types and traces, including coindexation to represent long-range dependencies.
