or which user satisfaction (US), is and the set of ci have been collected experimentally, the weights a and wi can be solved for using multiple linear regression.
    Multiple linear regression produces a set of coefficients (weights) describing the relative contribution of each predictor factor in accounting for the variance in a predicted factor.
    In this case, on the basis of the model in Figure 1, US is treated as the predicted factor.
    Normalization of the predictor factors (n and ci) to their Z scores guarantees that the relative magnitude of the coefficients directly indicates the relative contribution of each factor.
    Regression on the Table 5 data for both sets of users tests which factors K, kat, #rep most strongly predicts US.
    In this illustrative example, the results of the regression with all factors included shows that only K and #rep are significant (p &lt; .02).
    In order to develop a performance function estimate that includes only significant factors and eliminates redundanci
