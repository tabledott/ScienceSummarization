    In general, CW produces a large number of clusters on real-world graphs, of which the majority is very small.
    For most applications, it might be advisable to define a minimum cluster size or something alike.
    This section shortly reviews the results of (Biemann and Teresniak, 2005), where CW was first described.
    The task was to separate a multilingual corpus by languages, assuming its tokenization in sentences.
    The co-occurrence graph of a multilingual corpus resembles the synthetic SW-graphs: Every language forms a separate co-occurrence graph, some words that are used in more than one language are members of several graphs, connecting them.
    By CW-partitioning, the graph is split into its monolingual parts.
    These parts are used as word lists for word-based language identification.
    (Biemann and Teresniak, 2005) report almost perfect performance on getting 7lingual corpora with equisized parts sorted apart as well as highly skewed mixtures of two languages.
