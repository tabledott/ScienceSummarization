ts (the distractors) from which the target object needs to be distinguished (we use the terminology from Dale and Reiter [1995]).
    The task of the algorithm is to determine which set of properties is needed to single out the target object v from the distractors.
    This is known as the content determination problem for referring expressions.
    On the basis of this set of properties a distinguishing description for v can be generated.
    Most algorithms do not address the surface realization problem (how the selected properties should be realized in natural language) in much detail; it is usually assumed that once the content for a referring expression has been determined, a standard realizer such as KPML (Bateman 1997) or SURGE (Elhaded and Robin 1997) can convert the meaning representation to natural language.
    Consider the example scene in Figure 1.
    In this scene, as in any other scene, we see a finite domain of entities D with properties P. In this particular scene, D = {d1,d2,d3,d4} is the s
