nd Satta, 2006) and iterated fixpoint equations.
    We then parse with each refinement, in sequence, much along the lines of Charniak et al. (2006), except with much more complex and automatically derived intermediate grammars.
    Thresholds are automatically tuned on heldout data, and the final system parses up to 100 times faster than the baseline PCFG parser, with no loss in test set accuracy.
    In Sec.
    4, we consider the well-known issue of inference objectives in split PCFGs.
    As in many model families (Steedman, 2000; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985), split PCFGs have a derivation / parse distinction.
    The split PCFG directly describes a generative model over derivations, but evaluation is sensitive only to the coarser treebank symbols.
    While the most probable parse problem is NP-complete (Sima&#8217;an, 1992), several approximate methods exist, including n-best reranking by parse likelihood, the labeled bracket algorithm of Goodman (1996), and a variational approximation introduced in M
