ume will always be present in the lexicon.
    Thus after all these transformations we obtained a lexicon of 59,268 entries for training and the test lexicon of 17,868 entries.
    Our guessing-rule induction technique uses the training and test data prepared as described above and can be seen as a sampling for the best performing rule set from a collection of automatically produced rule sets.
    Here is a brief outline of its major phases: For the extraction of the initial sets of prefix and suffix morphological guessing rules (Prefix, Suffix&#176;, and Suffixl), we define the operator vn where the index n specifies the length of the mutative ending of the main word.
    Thus when the index n is set to 0 the result of the application of the vo operator will be a morphological rule with no mutative segment.
    The vi operator will extract the rules with the alterations in the last letter of the main word.
    When the v operator is applied to a pair of entries from the lexicon ([W C], and [W C]1), first, it
