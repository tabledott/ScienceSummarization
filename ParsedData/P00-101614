ss groups were kept as equal as possible, with any known potential biases favoring the rules-writing group.
    First, both groups began with the identical environments, while initially variable across methods, have already been borne and to the extent that both interface systems port to new languages and domains with relative ease, the incremental development costs for new trials are likely to be relatively low and comparable.
    Finally, this cost model takes into account the cost of developing or acquiring the So gold standard tagged data (e.g. from the Treebank) to provide initial and/or incremental training feedback to the annotator or rule writer to help force consistency with the gold standard.
    We have found that both learning modes can benefit from this high quality feedback, but the cost x of developing such a high-quality resource for new languages or domains is unknown, but likely to be higher than the non-expert labor costs employed here.
