y gaps in our current knowledge about how humans speak.
    Nevertheless, I argue that as far as such a comparison can be made, the specific design decisions embodied in the consensus architecture seem to often be more or less in accord with current knowledge of human language generation.
    This is again perhaps somewhat surprising, since psycholinguistic plausibility was not in general a goal of the developers of the examined systems.
    Perhaps (being very speculative) this indicates that there is some connection between the engineering considerations that underlie the design decisions made in the consensus architecture, and the maximizeperformance-in-the-real-world criteria that drove the evolutionary processes that created the human language processor.
    If (a big if!) there is some truth to this hypothesis, then studying the engineering issues involved in building applied systems may lead to insights about the way the human language system works.
