ech in the last class.
			However, theCzech training set is four times the size of the train ing set for Arabic, which is the language with the largest training set of the difficult languages.However, it would be wrong to assume that train ing set size alone is the deciding factor.
			A closer look at table 1 shows that while Basque and Greekin fact have small training data sets, so do Turkish and Italian.
			Another factor that may be associated with the above classification is the percent age of new words (PNW) in the test set.
			Thus, theexpectation would be that the highly inflecting lan guages have a high PNW while the languages with little morphology have a low PNW.
			But again, thereis no direct correspondence.
			Arabic, Basque, Cata lan, English, and Greek agree with this assumption: Catalan and English have the smallest PNW, and Arabic, Basque, and Greek have a high PNW.
			But the PNW for Italian is higher than for Arabic and Greek, and this is also true for the percentage of new lemmas.
