ctures by creating other actors and their relationships according to 0-assignment, predication, and functional-selection.
    Other principles are then used to filter out illicit structures, such as subjacency and case-filter.
    This generate-and-test nature of the algorithm makes it suscetible to the overgeneration problem.
  
  
    We have presented an efficient message passing algorithm for principle-based parsing, where ferent places so that stricter principles are applied earlier.
    We have also proposed simplifications of GB theory with regard to barrier and proper government, which have been found to be adequate in our experiments so far.
