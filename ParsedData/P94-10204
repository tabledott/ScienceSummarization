 probabilistic models that describe the relationships among all variables in terms of only the most important interdependencies, that is, models of a certain class that are good approximations to the joint distribution of contextual features and word meanings.
    This class is the set of decomposable models: models that can be expressed as a product of marginal distributions, where each marginal methodology used for formulating decomposable models and Section 3 describes the details of the case study performed to test the approach.
    The results of the disambiguation case study are discussed and contrasted with similar efforts in Sections 4 and 5.
    Section 6 is the conclusion.
    In this Section, we address the problem of finding the models that generate good approximations to a given discrete probability distribution, as selected from among the class of decomposable models.
    Decomposable models are a subclass of log-linear models and, as such, can be used to characterize and study the structure of
