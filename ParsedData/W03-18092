ositionality.
    Given this background, this paper has two aims.
    The first is to put the treatment of non-compositionality in corpus-based NLP on a firm empirical footing.
    As such it describes the development of a resource for implementing and evaluating statistical models of MWE meaning, based on nonexpert human judgements.
    The second is to demonstrate the usefulness of such approaches by implementing and evaluating a handful of approaches.
    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
    We outline the linguistic foundations of this research in Section 2 before describing the process of resource building in Section 3.
    Section 4 summarises previous work on the subject and Section 5 details our proposed models of compositionality.
    Section 6 lays out the evaluation of those models over the gold standard data, and we conclude the paper in Section 7.
  
  
    We selected the English verb-particle construction as our test case MWE in this paper.
