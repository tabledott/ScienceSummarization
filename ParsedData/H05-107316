portant, an automatic method using sequential target activation could be added next.
			4.5 Parameter tuning.
			The Winnow parameters that were tuned included promotional ?, demotional ?, activation threshold?, initial weights ?, and the regularization parame ter, S, which implements a margin between positive and negative examples.
			Given the currently fairlylimited data, results from 2 alternative tuning meth ods, applied to all features, are reported.
			For the condition called sep-tune-eval, 50% of the sentences were randomly selected and set aside to be used for the parameter tuningprocess only.
			Of this subset, 10% were subsequently randomly chosen as test set with the remaining 90% used for training during the automatic tuning process, which covered 4356 different parameter combinations.
			Resulting pa rameters were: ? = 1.1, ? = 0.5, ? = 5, ? = 1.0, S = 0.5.
			The remaining half of the data was used for training and testing in the 10-fold cross-validation evaluation.
