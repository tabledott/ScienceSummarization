o prove the logical form of &#8220;What is the age of our solar system?&#8221; from the logical form of the answer &#8220;The solar system is 4.6 billion years old.&#8221;, the LCC theorem prover shows that the atomic formula that corresponds to the question term &#8220;age&#8221; can be inferred from the atomic formula that corresponds to the answer term &#8220;old&#8221; using an axiom that connects &#8220;old&#8221; and &#8220;age&#8221;, because the WordNet gloss for &#8220;old&#8221; contains the word &#8220;age&#8221;.
    Similarly, the LCC system can prove that &#8220;Voting is mandatory for all Argentines aged over 18&#8221; provides a good justification for the question &#8220;What is the legal age to vote in Argentina?&#8221; because it can establish through logical deduction using axioms induced from WordNet glosses that &#8220;legal&#8221; is related to &#8220;rule&#8221;, which in turn is related to &#8220;mandatory&#8221;; that &#8220;age&#8221; is related to &#8220;aged&#8221;; and that &#8220
