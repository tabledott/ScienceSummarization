t; or &amp;quot;Boeing, a defense contractor&amp;quot;).
    The idea here is that nouns in conjunctions or appositives tend to be semantically related, as discussed in Riloff and Shepherd (1997) and Roark and Charniak (1998).
    Taking the head words of each NP and stemming them results in data for about 50,000 distinct nouns.
    A vector is created for each noun containing counts for how many times each other noun appears in a conjunction or appositive with it.
    We can then measure the similarity of the vectors for two nouns by computing the cosine of the angle between these vectors, as 11'1iWr To compare the similarity of two groups of nouns, we define similarity as the average of the cosines between each pair of nouns made up of one noun from each of the two groups.
    Ev cos (v, w) size(A)size(B) where v ranges over all vectors for nouns in group A, w ranges over the vectors for group B, and size(x) represents the number of nouns which are descendants of node x.
