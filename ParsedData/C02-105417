		However, simple re duction of infrequent features without consideringweights damages the system?s performance.
			For instance, when we removed 5,066 features that ap peared four times or less in the training data, themodified classifier for ORGANIZATION-END misclassified 103 training examples, whereas the origi nal classifier misclassified only 19 examples.
			On theother hand, XQK-FS removed 12,141 features with out an increase in misclassifications for the training data.
			XQK can be easily extended to a more generalquadratic kernel BG? ?*??vl??!?v  G ?
			and to nonbinary sparse vectors.
			XQK-FS can be used to se lect useful features before training by other kernels.
			As mentioned above, we conducted an experiment for the cubic kernel ( F *??
			) by using all features.When we trained the cubic kernel classifiers by us ing only features selected by XQK-FS, TinySVM?s classification time was reduced by 40% because  was reduced by 38%.
			GENERAL?s F-measure was slightly improved from 87.04% to 87.10%
