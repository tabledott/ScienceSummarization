stribution LN distribution only permits probabilities within a multinomial to covary.
    We will generalize the LN to permit covariance among any probabilities in &#952;, throughout the model.
    For example, the probability of a past-tense verb (VBD) having a noun as a right child might correlate with the probability that other kinds of verbs (VBZ, VBN, etc.) have a noun as a right child.
    The partitioned logistic normal distribution (PLN) is a generalization of the LN distribution that takes the first step towards our goal (Aitchison, 1986).
    Generating from PLN involves drawing a random vector from a multivariate normal distribution, but the logistic transformation is applied to different parts of the vector, leading to sampled multinomial distributions of the required lengths from different probability simplices.
    This is in principle what is required for arbitrary covariance between grammar probabilities, except that DMV has O(t2) weights for a part-of-speech vocabulary of size t, requiring a
