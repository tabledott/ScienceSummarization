   The parsers of Yamada and Matsumoto (Y&amp;M) and Nivre and Scholz (N&amp;S) do not produce constituent structures, only dependencies.

    It achieves about 81% precision and 82% recall with gold-standard tags (78% and 79% with automatically tagged text).
    Wong and Wu&#8217;s parser is further differentiated from the other parsers mentioned here in that it does not use lexical items, working only from part-of-speech tags.
  
  
    We conducted experiments with the parser described in section 2 using two different classifiers: TinySVM (a support vector machine implementation by Taku Kudo)2, and the memory-based learner TiMBL (Daelemans et al., 2004).
    We trained and tested the parser on the Wall Street Journal corpus of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) using the standard split: sections 2
