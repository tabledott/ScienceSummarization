 In the parsing experiments, we study the following thirteen languages:1 Danish (DA), German (DE), Greek (EL), English (EN), Spanish (ES), French (FR), Italian (IT), Korean (KO), Dutch (NL), Portugese (PT), Russian (RU), Swedish (SV) and Chinese (ZH) &#8211; representing the Chinese, Germanic, Hellenic, Romance, Slavic, Altaic and Korean genera.
    In the NER experiments, we study three Germanic languages: German (DE), English (EN) and Dutch (NL); and one Romance language: Spanish (ES).
    Details of the labeled and unlabeled data sets used are given in Appendix A.
    For all experiments we fixed the number of clusters to 256 as this performed well on held-out data.
    Furthermore, we only clustered the 1 million most frequent word types in each language for both efficiency and sparsity reasons.
    For languages in which our unlabeled data did not have at least 1 million types, we considered all types.
    All of the parsing experiments reported in this study are based on the transition-based dependency
