 Of these, 11 fit the Discourse Type A prosodic model and 127 fit the Discourse Type B model.
    Both judges found such items relatively difficult to distinguish between discourse and sentential use, as discussed above.
    Table 8 shows how judgments are distributed with respect to our prosodic model when coordinate conjunctions are removed from the sample.
    Our model thus predicts 422 (85.3%) of nonconjunction cue phrase distinctions, somewhat better than the 662 (75.4%) successful predictions for all classified cue phrases, as shown in Table 7.
    Our prosodic model itself can of course be decomposed to examine the contributions of individual features to discourse/sentential judgments.
    Table 9 shows the distribution of judgments by all possible feature complexes for all tokens.
    Note that four cells (ONFD, ONFH, ONFL, and ONFC) are empty, since all items alone in their intermediate phrase must perforce come first in it.
    This distribution reveals that there is considerable agreement when cue
