mber be desired as output, section 5 will outline how a linkage between Roget categories and dictionary definitions can be made.
  We will also focus on sense distinctions within a given part of speech.
  Distinctions between parts of speech, should be based on local syntactic evidence.
  We use a stochastic part-of-speech tagger (Church, 1989) for this purpose, run as a preprocessor.
  2, P roposed  Method The strategy proposed here is based on the following three observations: 1) Different conceptual classes of words, such as AmMALS or MACH~mS tend to appear in recognizably different contexts.
  2) Different word senses tend to belong to different conceptual c asses (crane can be an ANIMAL or a MACHINE).
  3) If one can build a context discriminator for the conceptual c asses, one has effectively built a context discriminator for the word senses that are members of those classes.
  Furthermore, the context indicators for a Roget category (e.g.
  gear, piston and engine for the category TOOLS/MACHINERY) will
