er of ways it could be improved: Feature representations: Multiple prototypes improve Spearman correlation on WordSim-353 compared to previous methods using the same underlying representation (Agirre et al., 2009).
    However we have not yet evaluated its performance when using more powerful feature representations such those based on Latent or Explicit Semantic Analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990; Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).
    Due to its modularity, the multiprototype approach can easily incorporate such advances in order to further improve its effectiveness. synonyms using the single- and multi-prototype approaches (with results merged).
    In general such clustering improves the precision and coverage of the inferred near-synonyms.
    Nonparametric clustering: The success of the combined approach indicates that the optimal number of clusters may vary per word.
    A more principled approach to selecting the number of prototypes per word is to employ a clustering model with infinite capacity, e.g.
