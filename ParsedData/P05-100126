in relation to the rowdimension ofO, which shows that the method is relatively insensitive to the change of this parameter, at least in the range which we consider.
  
  
    We presented a novel semi-supervised learning method that learns the most predictive lowdimensional feature projection from unlabeled data using the structural learning algorithm SVD-ASO.
    On CoNLL&#8217;00 syntactic chunking and CoNLL&#8217;03 named entity chunking (English and German), the method exceeds the previous best systems (including those which rely on hand-crafted resources) by using unlabeled data as the only additional resource.
    The key idea is to create auxiliary problems automatically from unlabeled data so that predictive structures can be learned from that data.
    In practice, it is desirable to create as many auxiliary problems as possible, as long as there is some reason to believe in their relevancy to the task.
    This is because the risk is relatively minor while the potential gain from relevant problems i
