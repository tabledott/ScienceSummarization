they also had a d~ 2 significantly greater than chance.
  Several of our tests acknowledge that any function, such as ~2, of noisy data, such as frequencies, is itself a noisy measure.
  Therefore our caution is to require not just that one measure be greater than another, but that it be significantly greater.
  This calculation is made using an estimate of the variance of ~ 2.
  We then used the selected word pairs to suggest word correspondences within a given aligned region.
  The alignment was done by a dynamic programming technique with a parameter that controlled how certain we should be before accepting a specific pair of words as corresponding.
  We set the parameter to give results that are quite likely to be correct.
  Currently we suggest correspondences forabout 60 percent of the words, and when we do suggest a correspondence w are correct in about 95 percent of cases.
  This is work in progress.
  We expect hat in the future the coverage can be increased substantially above 60% while errors can b
