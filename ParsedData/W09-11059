    We model the scope finding task as two consecutive classification tasks: a first one that consists of classifying the tokens of a sentence as being at the beginning of a negation signal, inside or outside.
    This allows the system to find multiword negation signals.
    The second classification task consists of classifying the tokens of a sentence as being the first element of the scope, the last, or neither.
    This happens as many times as there are negation signals in the sentence.
    We have chosen this classification model after experimenting with two additional models that produced worse results: in one case we classifed tokens as being inside or outside of the scope.
    In another case we classified chunks, instead of tokens, as being inside or outside of the scope.
  
  
    The two classification tasks (identifying negation signals and finding the scope) are implemented using supervised machine learning methods trained on part of the annotated corpus.
    In this phase, a classif
