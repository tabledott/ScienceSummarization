correct (100% accuracy), even in the case of phrasal verbs and longer idiomatic expressions (have to is a NEED ACTION; be inspired by is a CONTINUE ACTION).
    There were seven voice errors, two of which were due to POS-tagging errors (past participle misrecognized).
    The remaining five voice errors correspond to 98% accuracy.
    Correctness of Agent Type determination was tested on a random sample of 100 sentences containing at least one agent, resulting in 111 agents.
    No agent pattern that should have been identified was missed (100% recall).
    Of the 111 agents, 105 cases were correct (precision of 95%).
    Therefore, we consider the two features to be adequately robust to serve as sentential features in our system.
    Having detailed the features and classifiers of the machine learning system we use, we will now turn to an intrinsic evaluation of its performance.
  
  
    Our task is to perform content selection from scientific articles, which we do by classifying sentences into seven rhetor
