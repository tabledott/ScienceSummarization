 of techniques, including: Markov models, decision trees, connectionist machines, transformations, nearest-neighbor algorithms, and maximum entropy (Weischedel (1993), Black(1992), Schmid(1994), Brill(1995),Daelemans(1995),Ratnaparkhi(1996 )).
    All of these methods seem to achieve roughly comparable accuracy.
    The fact that most machine-learningbased taggers achieve comparable results could be attributed to a number of causes.
    It is possible that the 80/20 rule of engineering is applying: a certain number of tagging instances are relatively simple to disambiguate and are therefore being successfully tagged by all approaches, while another percentage is extremely difficult to disambiguate, requiring deep linguistic knowledge, thereby causing all taggers to err.
    Another possibility could be that all of the different machine learning techniques are essentially doing the same thing.
    We know that the features used by the different algorithms are very similar, typically the words and tags within a
