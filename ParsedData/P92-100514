will define [[..
    .]] for QLFs in terms of a relation W between formulas, models and truth values.
    Evaluation rules will be given for W(F,m,v), but since more than one rule may apply (or a rule may apply in more than one way), W will in general be a relation.
    The relationship between [[...]] and W for a formula F is as follows: Henceforth we will leave the model argument m implicit.
    The evaluation rules for W will generally take the form where F' contains one fewer unresolved expression than F (so that it is possible for the process of rule application to terminate).
    The use of if rather than Orin these rules means that it is possible for rules producing more than one value v to apply and hence for [[F]] to be partial.
    The model provides an interpretation function I mapping constants and predicates to individual and relations.
    We will also need to assume a relation S(C,H) (for 'salient') between QLF categories C and QLF expressions H standing for individuals, quantifiers, or predica
