  23-28, 1992 Relat ive  At t r ibute  Va lues As mentioned previously, the transcript analysis shows that human speakers and hearers often pre- fer relative instead of absolute attr ibute values, e.g., small instead of one inch.
  Knowledge bases some- times explicitly encode relative attribute values (e.g., (size.
  small)), but this can cause difficulties when re- ferring expressions need to he generated in different contexts; a one-inch screw, for example, might be considered to be small in a context where the other screws were all two-inch screws, but large in a context where the other screws were all half-inch screws.
  A better solution is for the knowledge base to record absolute attr ibute values, and then for the genera- tion algorithm to automatically convert absolute val- ues to relative values, depending on the values that other members of the context set pussc~ for this at- tribute.
  Thus, the knowledge b
