ruples (qt,ql,q~,P) and (P,Pl,Pl,q4") will be asao?inted with ?
  and Z (by the induction hypothesis).
  Let "h be derived from ~ by adjoining ~1 at X as in Fig.
  We have to chew the existence of ~t in G 1 such that the root of this auxiliar7 tree hu  saso?iatod with it the quadruple (q,qt,q4",r).
  The exmtence el the tree follows from induction hypothesis (k =ffi 0).
  We have also got to show that there exists "/t with the same structure us "f but one that allows ~1 to be adjoined at the required node.
  But this should be 8o, since from the way we obtained the tree, in G1, there will exist ~t" such that X I has the quadruple (q,q~,qa,r) and the constraint* at X l are dictated by the quadruple (q,qt,q4e,r), bat such that the two children.of Xt will have the same quadruple as in 7.
  We can now adjoin ~I in ~I" to obtain "h. It can be shown that ~t has the required property to establish our clam.
