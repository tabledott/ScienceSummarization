#8722;1, S) and P(ej|e1 ... ej&#8722;1, S).
    Figure 21 shows a case of PP attachment.
    The first thing to note is that the PP attachment decision is made before the PP is even built.
    The decision is linked to the NP preceding the preposition: whether the arc above the NP should go left or right.
    The next thing to note is that at least one important feature, the verb, falls outside of the conditioning context.
    (The model considers only information up to two constituents preceding or following the location of the decision.)
    This could be repaired by considering additional context, but there is no fixed bound on how far the verb can be from the decision point.
    Note also that in other cases the method fragments the data in unnecessary ways.
    Cases in which the verb directly precedes the NP, or is one place farther to the left, are treated separately.
    Figure 22 shows a similar example, NP coordination ambiguity.
    Again, the pivotal decision is made in a somewhat counterintuitive
