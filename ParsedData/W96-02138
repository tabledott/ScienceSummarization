nly tags given by the dictionary entry, while for unknown words, generates all tags in the tag set.
    Without the Tag Dictionary, the search procedure generates all tags in the tag set for every word.
    Let W = {wi ...wn} be a test sentence, and let sij be the jth highest probability tag sequence up to and including word wi.
    The search is described below:
  
  
    In order to conduct tagging experiments, the Wall St. Journal data has been split into three contiguous sections, as shown in Table 5.
    The feature set and search algorithm were tested and debugged only on the Training and Development sets, and the official test result on the unseen Test set is presented in the conclusion of the paper.
    The performances of the &amp;quot;baseline&amp;quot; model on the Development Set, both with and without the Tag Dictionary, are shown in Table 6.
    All experiments use a beam size of N = 5; further increasing the beam size does not significantly increase performance on the Development Set but advers
