35 newswire articles that are man ually annotated for opinion-related information.
			In particular, our gold standard opinion entitiescorrespond to direct subjective expression anno tations and subjective speech event annotations (i.e. speech events that introduce opinions) in theMPQA corpus (Wiebe et al, 2005).
			Gold standard source entities and link relations can be ex tracted from the agent attribute associated with each opinion entity.
			We use 135 documents as adevelopment set and report 10-fold cross valida tion results on the remaining 400 documents in all experiments below.
			We evaluate entity and link extraction usingboth an overlap and exact matching scheme.12 Because the exact start and endpoints of the manual annotations are somewhat arbitrary, the over lap scheme is more reasonable for our task (Wiebe et al, 2005).
			We report results according to bothmatching schemes, but focus our discussion on re sults obtained using overlap matching.13 We use the Mallet14 implementation of CRFs.
