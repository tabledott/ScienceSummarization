etaining their edges.
    A graph-clustering algorithm should split up the resulting graph in its previous parts, at least if not too many nodes were merged.
    We conducted experiments to measure CW's performance on SW-graph mixtures: We generated graphs of various sizes, merged them by twos to a various extent and measured the amount of cases where clustering with CW leads to the reconstruction of the original parts.
    When generating SW-graphs with the SteyversTenenbaum model, we fixed M to 10 and varied n and the merge rate r, which is the fraction of nodes of the smaller graph that is merged with nodes of the larger graph.
    Figure 8 summarizes the results for equisized mixtures of 300, 3,000 and 30,000 nodes and mixtures of 300 with 30,000 nodes.
    It is not surprising that separating the two parts is more difficult for higher r. Results are not very sensitive to size and size ratio, indicating that CW is able to identify clusters even if they differ considerably in size &#8211; it even performs
