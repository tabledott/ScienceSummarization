    To make the computation tractable, we implement a pruning scheme: hypotheses are extended by choosing assignments for one constituent at a time, and only the top m hypotheses are retained for extension by assignments to the next constituent.
    Here we set m = 10 after experimentation showed that increasing m yielded no significant improvement.
    Results for the integrated approach are shown in the last row of Table 15.
    Allowing role assignments to influence boundary identification improves results both on the unlabeled boundary identification task and on the combined identification and labeling task.
    The integrated approach puts us in a different portion of the precision/recall curve from the results in the first two rows, as it returns a higher number of frame elements (7,736 vs. 5,719).
