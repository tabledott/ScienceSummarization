riginal rule components, the cross-component correlation of symbol choices is properly represented.
    The behavior of the original rule is thus modeled by the relation that corresponds to the batch application of rules in this set, and we have already shown that such a relation is regular.
    5.7 Summary This completes our examination of individual context-sensitive rewriting rules.
    We have modeled the input-output behavior of these rules according to a variety of different application parameters.
    We have expressed the conditions and actions specified by a rule in terms of carefully constructed formal languages and string relations.
    Our constructions make judicious use of distinguished auxiliary symbols so that crucial informational dependencies can be string-encoded in unambiguous ways.
    We have also shown how these languages and relations can be combined by set-theoretic operations to produce a single string relation that simulates the rule's overall effect.
    Since our constructions and
