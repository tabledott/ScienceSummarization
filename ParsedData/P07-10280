  A Simple Similarity-based Model for Selectional Preferences
  
    We propose a new, simple model for the automatic induction of selectional preferences, using corpus-based semantic similarity metrics.
    Focusing on the task of semantic role labeling, we compute selectional preferences for semantic roles.
    In evaluations the similarity-based model shows lower error rates than both Resnik's WordNet-based model and the EM-based clustering model, but has coverage problems.
  
  
    Selectional preferences, which characterize typical arguments of predicates, are a very useful and versatile knowledge source.
    They have been used for example for syntactic disambiguation (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), word sense disambiguation (WSD) (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003) and semantic role labeling (SRL) (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
    The corpus-based induction of selectional preferences was first proposed by Resnik (1996).
    All later approaches have followed the same twostep procedure, first collecting argument he
