 and Levesque present a proof that the indirect speech act of requesting can be derived from the following basic modal operators 'This is not strictly true; a small number of relations, such as Sequence, relate more than two pieces of text.
    However, for ease of use, they have been implemented as binary relations in the structurer. as well as from a few other operators such as AND and OR.
    They then define summaries as, essentially, speech act operators with activating conditions (gates) and effects.
    These summaries closely resemble, in structure, the RST plans described here, with gates corresponding to satellite and nucleus constraints and effects to intended effects.
  
  
    The RST relation Purpose expresses the relation between an action and its intended result: Purpose For example, when used to produce the sentence The system scans the program in order to find opportunities to apply transformations to the program, this relation is instantiated as
  
  
    The system 'wants&amp;quot; to find
