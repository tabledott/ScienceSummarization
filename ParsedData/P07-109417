 corpus with full tag dictionary.
    Standard deviations in most cases are less than .5. ity of the transition distributions, are stronger than the effects of Q, which determines the probability of the output distributions.
    The optimal value of .003 for &#945; reflects the fact that the true transition probability matrix for this corpus is indeed sparse.
    As &#945; grows larger, the model prefers more uniform transition probabilities, which causes it to perform worse.
    Although the true output distributions tend to be sparse as well, the level of sparseness depends on the tag (consider function words vs. content words in particular).
    Therefore, a value of Q that accurately reflects the most probable output distributions for some tags may be a poor choice for other tags.
    This leads to the smaller effect of Q, and suggests that performance might be improved by selecting a different Q for each tag, as we do in the next section.
    A final point worth noting is that even when &#945; = Q = 1 (i
