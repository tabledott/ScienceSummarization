5 is P(L, T |5) = ization constant and fi are the feature functions with weights wi.
    Candidate lexical entries are generated by a domain-specific procedure based on the target logical forms.
    The major limitation of supervised approaches is that they require meaning annotations for example sentences.
    Even in a restricted domain, doing this consistently and with high quality requires nontrivial effort.
    For unrestricted text, the complexity and subjectivity of annotation render it essentially infeasible; even pre-specifying the target predicates and objects is very difficult.
    Therefore, to apply semantic parsing beyond limited domains, it is crucial to develop unsupervised methods that do not rely on labeled meanings.
    In the past, unsupervised approaches have been applied to some semantic tasks, but not to semantic parsing.
    For example, DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) learns paraphrases of binary relations based on distributional similarity of their arguments; TextRunner (Banko et al., 20
