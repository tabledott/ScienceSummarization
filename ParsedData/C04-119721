s R-A0.
			The linear inequalities that represent this constraint are: ?m ? {1, . . .
			,M} : M?
			i=1 ziA0 ? zmR-A0 If there are ? reference argument pairs, then the total number of inequalities needed is ?M .Constraint 9: C-XXX arguments This constraint is similar to the reference argument constraints.
			The difference is that the continued argu ment XXX has to occur before C-XXX.
			Assumethat the argument pair is A0 and C-A0, and argu ment Sji appears before Sjk if i ? k. The linear inequalities that represent this constraint are: ?m ? {2, . . .
			,M} : j?1?
			i=1 zjiA0 ? zmR-A0 Constraint 10: Illegal argument types Given aspecific verb, some argument types should never oc cur.
			For example, most verbs don?t have arguments A5.
			This constraint is represented by summing all the corresponding indicator variables to be 0.
			M? i=1 ziA5 = 0Using ILP to solve this inference problem en joys several advantages.
			Linear constraints are very general, and are able to represent many types of constraints.
