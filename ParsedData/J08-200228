to compute CORE ID, we compare the following sets of labeled spans: Classification Measures (CLS).
    These are performance on argument spans which were also guessed to be argument spans (but possibly the exact label was wrong).
    In other words, these measures ignore the ARG vs. NONE confusions.
    They ignore all spans, which were incorrectly labeled NONE, or incorrectly labeled with an argument label, when the correct label was NONE.
    This is different from &#8220;classification accuracy&#8221; used in previous work to mean the accuracy of the system in classifying spans when the correct set of argument spans is given.
    To compute CLS measures, we remove all spans from Sguessed and Scorrect that do not occur in both sets, and compare the resulting sets.
    For example, to compute the ALL CLS measures, we need to compare the following sets of labeled spans: The rest of the spans were removed from both sets because they were labeled NONE according to one of the labelings and non-NONE according to
