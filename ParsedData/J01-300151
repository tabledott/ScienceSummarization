of whether the sense is appropriate or not in the context (correct or incorrect).
    Figure 5 shows the feature vectors generated for the word influence in the context shown.
    The final value in the feature vector shows whether the sense is correct or not in the particular context.
    We can see that, in this case, there is one correct sense, influence_l_la, the definition of which is &amp;quot;power to gain an effect on the mind of Example feature-vector representation. or get results from, without asking or doing anything&amp;quot;.
    Features 10-19 are produced by the collocation extractor, and these are identical since each vector is taken from the same content.
    Features 7-9 show the results of the partial taggers.
    The first is the output from simulated annealing, the second the subj ect code, and the third the select ional restrictions.
    All noun senses of influence share the same pragmatic code (--), and consequently this partial tagger returns the same score for each sense.
