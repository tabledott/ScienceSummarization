  D-Theory: Talking About Talking About Trees
  
    Linguists, including computational linguists, have always been fond of talking about trees.
    In this paper, we outline a theory of linguistic structure which talks about talking about trees; we call theory theory While important issues must be resolved before a complete picture of D-theory emerges (and also before we can build programs which utilize it), we believe that this theory will ultimately provide a framework for explaining the syntax and semantics of natural in a manner which is This paper will focus primarily on one set of motivations for this theory, those engendered by attempts to handle certain syntactic phenomena within the framework of deterministic parsing.
