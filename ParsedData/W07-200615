			We report about the use of semantic resources as well as semantically annotated corpora (SC = SemCor, DSO = Defence Science Organ isation Corpus, SE = Senseval corpora, OMWE =Open Mind Word Expert, XWN = eXtended Word Net, WN = WordNet glosses and/or relations, WND = WordNet Domains), as well as information about the use of unannotated corpora (UC), training (TR), MFS (based on the SemCor sense frequencies), and the coarse senses provided by the organizers (CS).
			As expected, several systems used lexico-semantic information from the WordNet semantic networkand/or were trained on the SemCor semantically annotated corpus.Finally, we point out that all the systems perform ing better than the MFS baseline adopted it as
