in the Arabic script, their gold-standard transliterations, and the transliteration that we are evaluating.
    For our transliteration algorithm, the human subject was provided with the top 20 transliteration candidates as well.
    The accuracy of the human translator based on the human-subjective evaluation is shown in Table 10.
    The accuracy of our transliteration models based on the human-subjective evaluation is shown in Table 11.
    The human translator's accuracy based on the human-subjective evaluation was higher than the exact-matching accuracy by about 11%.
    Most of the increase came from the forward-transliteration of Arab names.
    This was expected because for Arab names, typically many variant transliterations are acceptable.
    This was also reflected on the humansubjective evaluation of our spelling-based model.
    However, the accuracy of our phonetic-based model remains almost the same as in the case of the exactmatching evaluation.
    This is because names that can be found in t
