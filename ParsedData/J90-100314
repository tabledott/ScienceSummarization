0.96 down to &#8212;1.04), and we need to estimate the standard deviation, using a method such as Good (1953).4

    In addition to identifying semantic relations of the doctor/nurse variety, we believe the association ratio can also be used to search for interesting lexicosyntactic relationships between verbs and typical arguments/adjuncts.
