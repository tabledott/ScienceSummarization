 in its position in semantic space.
    To quantify this shift, Kintsch proposes measuring similarity relative to other verbs acting as landmarks, for example gallop and dissolve.
    The idea here is that an appropriate composition model when applied to horse and ran will yield a vector closer to the landmark gallop than dissolve.
    Conversely, when color is combined with ran, the resulting vector will be closer to dissolve than gallop.
    Focusing on a single compositional structure, namely intransitive verbs and their subjects, is a good point of departure for studying vector combination.
    Any adequate model of composition must be able to represent argument-verb meaning.
    Moreover by using a minimal structure we factor out inessential degrees of freedom and are able to assess the merits of different models on an equal footing.
    Unfortunately, Kintsch (2001) demonstrates how his own composition algorithm works intuitively on a few hand selected examples but does not provide a comprehensive test
