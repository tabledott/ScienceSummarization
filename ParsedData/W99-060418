bil task (Table 1) the precision of the baseline Viterbi alignments is 83.3 percent with English as source language and 81.8 percent with German as source language.
    Using this heuristic we get an alignment matrix with a precision of 88.4 percent without loss in recall.
    3.
    We estimate a bilingual word lexicon p(f le) by the relative frequencies of the alignment determined in the previous step: Here nA(f,e) is the frequency that the word f is aligned to e and n(e) is the frequency of e in the training corpus.
    4.
    We determine word classes for source and target language.
    A naive approach for doing this would be the use of monolingually optimized word classes in source and target language.
    Unfortunately we can not expect that there is a direct correspondence between independently optimized classes.
    Therefore monolingually optimized word classes do not seem to be useful for machine translation.
    We determine correlated bilingual classes by using the method described in (Och, 1999)
