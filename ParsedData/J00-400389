), was used to train an implementation of Quinlan's learning algorithm ID3 (Quinlan 1993).
    We excluded the verification of restrictive premodification and copula constructions, since these parameters had given the poorest results before (see Section 6.2).
    An example of the samples used to train ID3 is shown in (58).

    The resulting decision tree is presented in Figure 8.
    The main difference between this algorithm and the algorithm we arrived at by hand is that the first feature checked by the decision tree generated by 1D3 is the presence of an antecedent with a same-head noun.
    The presence of special predicates, which we adopted as the first test in our decision tree, is only the fourth test in the tree in Figure 8.
