e number of elementary structures, composed using a finite number of composition operations.
    These operations, as we see below, are restricted to be size preserving (as in the case of concatenation in CFG) which implies that they will be linear and non-erasing.
    A second restriction on the formalisms is that choices during the derivation are independent of the context in the derivation.
    As will be obvious later, their derivation tree sets will be local sets as are those of CFG's.
    Each derivation of a grammar can be represented by a generalized context-free derivation tree.
    These derivation trees show how the composition operations were used to derive the final structures from elementary structures.
    Nodes are annotated by the name of the composition operation used at that step in the derivation.
    As in the case of the derivation trees of CFG's, nodes are labeled by a member of some finite set of symbols (perhaps only implicit in the grammar as in TAG's) used to denote derived structur
