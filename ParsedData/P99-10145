lete data related to the observation y, (iv) a complete-data specification po(x), corresponding to the joint probability p(c, v, n) over Cx V x N, with parametervector 0 = (Oc,Ov,OncIc E C, v E V, n E N), (v) an incomplete data specification P0(Y) which is related to the complete-data specification as the marginal probability P0 (Y) = Ex(y)po(x). '
    The EM algorithm is directed at finding a value a of 0 that maximizes the incompletedata log-likelihood function L as a function of 0 for a given sample )), i.e., a = arg max L(0) where L(0) = ln Fly po (y).
    0 As prescribed by the EM algorithm, the parameters of L(0) are estimated indirectly by proceeding iteratively in terms of complete-data estimation for the auxiliary function Q(0; 9(0), which is the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood lnpo(x) given the observed data y and the current fit of the parameter values 0(0 (E-step).
    This auxiliary function is iteratively maximized as a function of 0 (M-step), where each iteration is
