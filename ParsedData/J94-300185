tricted to their proper positions by the corresponding right-context language nRightcontext(pk, &lt;k , &gt;k),--k These intersection languages, which are both regular, will take the place of the simple context identifiers when we form the composition cascades to model batch-rule application.
    These generalized context identifiers are also appropriate for ordinary rules if we regard each of them as a batch containing only one subrule.
    A replacement operator for batch rules must also be constructed.
    This must map between input and output strings with context-brackets properly located, ensuring that any of the subrule rewrites are possible at each properly marked position but that the rewrite of the kth subrule occurs only between &lt;k and &gt;&amp;quot;.
    The complete set where the generic symbol &lt; now stands for { &lt;1 ... &lt;k}, the set of all left-center brackets, and the generic &gt; is assigned a corresponding meaning.
    We incorporate this relation as the rewrite part of a new defin
