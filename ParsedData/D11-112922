is tensor space, as the computations thereof reduce to point-wise multiplications and summations.
    Similar computations yield meanings of sentences with adjectives and adverbs.
    For instance the meaning of a transitive sentence with a modified subject and a modified verb we have &#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8594; adj sub verb obj adv = (adv O verb) O ( (adj O sub) &#174; o j) After building vectors for sentences, we can compare their meaning and measure their degree of synonymy by taking their cosine measure.
  
  
    Evaluating such a framework is no easy task.
    What to evaluate depends heavily on what sort of application a practical instantiation of the model is geared towards.
    In (Grefenstette et al., 2011), it is suggested that the simplified model we presented and expanded here could be evaluated in the same way as lexical semantic models, measuring compositionally built sentence vectors against a benchmark dataset such as that
