			Among them, feature-based methods (Kamb hatla 2004; Zhou et al, 2005) achieve certain success by employing a large amount of diverse linguistic features, varying from lexical knowledge, entityrelated information to syntactic parse trees, depend ency trees and semantic information.
			However, it is difficult for them to effectively capture structured parse tree information (Zhou et al2005), which is critical for further performance improvement in rela tion extraction.
			As an alternative to feature-based methods, tree kerne
