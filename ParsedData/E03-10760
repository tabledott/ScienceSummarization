  Empirical Methods For Compound Splitting
  
    Compounded words are a challenge for NLP applications such as machine translation (MT).
    We introduce methods to learn splitting rules from monolingual and parallel corpora.
    We evaluate them against a gold standard and measure their impact on performance of statistical MT systems.
    Results show accuracy of 99.1% and performance gains for MT of 0.039 BLEU on a German-English noun phrase translation task.

    Compounding of words is common in a number of languages (German, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, etc.).
    Since words may be joined freely, this vastly increases the vocabulary size, leading to sparse data problems.
    This poses challenges for a number of NLP applications such as machine translation, speech recognition, text classification, information extraction, or information retrieval.
    For machine translation, the s
