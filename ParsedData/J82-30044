into composite grammars.
    This linear systems view &amp;quot;bundles up&amp;quot; all the parse trees into a single concise description capable of telling us everything we might want to know about the parses (including how much it might cost to ask a particular question).
    This abstract view of ambiguity enables us to ask questions in the most convenient order, and to delay asking until it is clear that the pay-off will exceed the cost.
    This abstraction was strongly influenced by the notion of binding.
    We have presented combination rules in three different representation systems: power series, ATNs, and context-free grammars, each of which contributed its own insights.
    Power series are convenient for defining the algebraic operations, ATNs are most suited for discussing implementation issues, and context-free grammars enable the shortest derivations.
    Perhaps the following quotation best summarizes our motivation for alternating among these three representation systems: thing or idea seem
