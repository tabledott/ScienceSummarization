   In our experiments, we chose F1=3, F2=2, and P=0.1.
    We used fairly lenient criteria because (a) patterns can often extract several types of objects that belong to different semantic categories, and (b) many extractions contain unknown words.
    Also, remember that the semantic lexicon is reliable because it was reviewed by a person, so it is usually meaningful when a pattern extracts a semantic category even once.
    The thresholds are needed only to eliminate noise, which can be caused by misparsed sentences or polysemous words.
    The semantic preferences are used to assign conceptual roles to each extraction pattern.
    At this point, one additional piece of input is needed: a list of conceptual roles and associated semantic categories for the domain.
    The conceptual roles identify the types of information that need to be recognized.
    Figure 4 shows the conceptual roles used for the terrorism domain.
    Each extraction pattern is expanded to include a set of conceptual roles based on its
