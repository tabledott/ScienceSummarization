petition between sources words for a particular target alignment.
    This feature indicates whether a given alignment has the highest translation score of all the candidate alignments for a given target word.
    For the example in Figure 1, the words la, de and une all receive a high translation score when paired with the.
    To discourage all of these French words from aligning with the, the best of these (la) is flagged as the best candidate.
    This allows for competition between source words which would otherwise not occur.
    Orthographic features Features based on string overlap allow our model to recognise cognates and orthographically similar translation pairs, which are particularly common between European languages.
    Here we employ a number of string matching features inspired by similar features in Taskar et al. (2005).
    We use an indicator feature for every possible source-target word pair in the training data.
    In addition, we include indicator features for an exact string match, bo
