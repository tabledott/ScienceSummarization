xplicitly associated topics, then such a model should benefit from both higher quality topics and a direct assignment from topics to aspects.
    This is the basic idea behind the Multi-Aspect Sentiment model (MAS).
    In its simplest form, MAS introduces a classifier for each aspect, which is used to predict its rating.
    Each classifier is explicitly associated to a single topic in the model and only words assigned to that topic can participate in the prediction of the sentiment rating for the aspect.
    However, it has been observed that ratings for different aspects can be correlated (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007), e.g., very negative opinion about room cleanliness is likely to result not only in a low rating for the aspect rooms, but also is very predictive of low ratings for the aspects service and dining.
    This complicates discovery of the corresponding topics, as in many reviews the most predictive features for an aspect rating might correspond to another aspect.
