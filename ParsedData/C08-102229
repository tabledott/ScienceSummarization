n the two learners, human and machine, we may be able to derive useful insights into the way the learning processes operate, and what factors could be more or less important for them.

			This paper discussed a contextual feature based approach to the automatic acquisition of models of use for prepositions and determiners, whichachieve an accuracy of 70.06% and 92.15% re spectively, and showed how it can be applied to anerror correction task for L2 writing, with promis ing early results.
			There are several directions that can be pursued to improve accuracy on both types of data.
			The classifier can be further fine-tuned to acquire more reliable models of use for the two POS.
			We can also experiment with its confidencethresholds, for example allowing it to make an other suggestion when its confidence in its first choice is low.
			Furthermore, issues relating to the use of NLP tools with L2 data must be addressed, such as factoring out spelling or other errors in the data, and perhaps training
