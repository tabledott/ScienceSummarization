P stands for a temporal.
    In previous work using the PropBank corpus, (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) proposed a model predicting argument roles using the same statistical method as the one employed by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) for predicting semantic roles based on the FrameNet corpus (Baker et al., 1998).
    This statistical technique of labeling predicate argument operates on the output of the probabilistic parser reported in (Collins, 1997).
    It consists of two tasks: (1) identifying the parse tree constituents corresponding to arguments of each predicate encoded in PropBank; and (2) recognizing the role corresponding to each argument.
    Each task can be cast a separate classifier.
    For example, the result of the first classifier on the sentence illustrated in Figure 2 is the identification of the two NPs as arguments.
    The second classifier assigns the specific roles ARG1 and ARG0 given the predicate &#8220;assailed&#8221;.
