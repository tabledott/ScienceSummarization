    The arg relation is further divided into the subj (subject) relation and the comp (complement) relation, and so on.
    The backbone of this hierarchy is quite similar to that in GR, but there are some crucial differences.
    The SD scheme is not concerned with the argument/adjunct distinction which is largely useless in practice.
    In contrast, NP-internal relations are an inherent part of corpus texts and are critical in realworld applications.
    The SD scheme therefore includes many relations of this kind: appos (appositive modifier), nn (noun compound), num (numeric modifier), number (element of compound number) and abbrev (abbreviation), etc.
