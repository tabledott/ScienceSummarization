us.
			Participant systems In total there were 6 participant systems.
			One of them (UoFL) was not a sense induction system, but rather a knowledge-based WSD system.
			We include their data in the results section below for coherence with the official results submitted to participants, but we will not mention it here.
			I2R: This team used a cluster validation method to estimate the number of senses of a target word in untagged data, and then grouped the instances of thistarget word into the estimated number of clusters us ing the sequential Information Bottleneck algorithm.
			9 UBC-AS: A two stage graph-based clustering where a co-occurrence graph is used to compute similarities against contexts.
			The context similarity matrix is pruned and the resulting associated graphis clustered by means of a random-walk type al gorithm.
			The parameters of the system are tuned against the Senseval-3 lexical sample dataset, and some manual tuning is performed in order to reduce the overall number of induced senses.
