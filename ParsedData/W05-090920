only if their surface forms match* (This module does not match unigrams that belong to a list of &amp;quot;stop words&amp;quot; that consist mainly of function words)* In the second experiment we ran METEOR with two stages, the first using the &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; mapping module, and the second the &amp;quot;Porter&amp;quot; mapping mo dule* The Porter mapping module matches two unigrams to each other if they are identical after being passed through the Porter stemmer* In the third experiment we replaced the Porter mapping module with the WN-Stem mapping mo dule* This module maps two unigrams to each other if they share the same base form in WordNet* This can be thought of as a different kind of stemmer &#8212; the difference from the Porter stemmer is that the word stems are actual words when stemmed through WordNet in this manner* In the last experiment we ran METEOR with three stages, the first two using the exact and the Porter modules, and the third the WN-Synonymy mapping mo dule* This module maps
