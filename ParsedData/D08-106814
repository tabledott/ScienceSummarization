lience, it uses a more intuitive and simpler definition based on distance, and incorporated it as a prior.
    Another difference is in identifying heads.
    For the ACE datasets, Haghighi and Klein used the gold heads; for the MUC-6 dataset, where labels are not available, they crudely picked the rightmost token in a mention.
    We show that a better way is to determine the heads using head rules in a parser.
    This improves resolution accuracy and is always applicable.
    Crucially, our MLN leverages syntactic relations such as apposition and predicate nominals, which are not used by Haghighi and Klein.
    In our approach, what it takes is just adding two formulas to the MLN.
    As common in previous work, we assume that true mention boundaries are given.
    We do not assume any other labeled information.
    In particular, we do not assume gold name entity recognition (NER) labels, and unlike Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), we do not assume gold mention types (for ACE datasets, they also used gold hea
