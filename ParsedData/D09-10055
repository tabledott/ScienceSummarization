redges, with each hyperedge connecting a set of antecedent nodes to a single consequent node.1 In parsing parlance, a node corresponds to an item in the chart (which specifies aligned spans of input and output together with a nonterminal label).
    The root node corresponds to the goal item.
    A hyperedge represents an SCFG rule that has been &#8220;instantiated&#8221; at a particular position, so that the nonterminals on the right and left sides have been replaced by particular antecedent and consequent items; this corresponds to storage of backpointers in the chart.
    We write T(e) to denote the set of antecedent nodes of a hyperedge e. We write I(v) for the hypergraph, a trigram language model is integrated.
    Rectangles represent items, where each item is identified by the non-terminal symbol, source span, and left- and right-side language model states.
    An item has one or more incoming hyperedges.
    A hyperedge consists of a rule, and a pointer to an antecedent item for each non-terminal symb
