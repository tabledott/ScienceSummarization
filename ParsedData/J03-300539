un and verb-object bigrams.
    We used correlation analysis to compare corpus counts and Web counts with plausibility judgments.
    Table 11 (top half) lists the correlation coefficients that were obtained when correlating log-transformed Web counts (AltaVista and Google) and corpus counts (BNC and NANTC) with mean plausibility judgments for seen adjectivenoun, noun-noun, and verb-object bigrams.
    The results show that both AltaVista and Google counts correlate well with plausibility judgments for seen bigrams.
    The correlation coefficient for AltaVista ranges from .641 to .700; for Google, it ranges from .624 to .692.
    The correlations for the two search engines are very similar, which is also what we found in Section 3.1 for the correlations between Web counts and corpus counts.
    Note that the Web counts consistently achieve a higher correlation with the judgments than the BNC counts, which range from .488 to .569.
    We carried out a series of one-tailed t-tests to determine whether the diff
