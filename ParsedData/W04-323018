 Models (E-HMMs) (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2000) trained and tested with the same corpus is also shown.
    E-HMMs is applied to the current implementation of ChaSen.
    Details of E-HMMs are described in Section 4.3.2.
    We directly evaluated the difference of these systems using McNemar&#8217;s test.
    Since there are no standard methods to evaluate the significance of F scores, we convert the outputs into the characterbased B/I labels and then employ a McNemar&#8217;s paired test on the labeling disagreements.
    This evaluation was also used in (Sha and Pereira, 2003).
    The results of McNemar&#8217;s test suggest that L2-CRFs is significantly better than other systems including L1CRFs8.
    The overall results support our empirical success of morphological analysis based on CRFs.
    Uchimoto el al. proposed a variant of MEMMs trained with a number of features (Uchimoto et al., 2001).
    Although they improved the accuracy for unknown words, they fail to segment some sentences which are correctly
