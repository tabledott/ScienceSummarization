 approach taken in WordNet.
    Our approach avoids the rather fuzzy concept of indirect antonyms introduced by WordNet.
    Additionally we do not introduce artificial antonyms as WordNet does (pregnant, unpregnant).
    The taxonomical classes follow (Hundsnurscher and Splett, 1982) with an additional class for pertainym83.
