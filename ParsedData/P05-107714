ection) corpus using the dependency parser Minipar (Lin, 1994).
    We identify all nouns.
    For each noun we take the grammatical context of the noun as identified by Minipar5.
    We do not use grammatical features in the web corpus since parsing is generally not easily web scalable.
    This kind of feature set does not seem to affect our results.
    Curran and Moens (2002) also report comparable results for Minipar features and simple word based proximity features.
    Table 1 gives the characteristics of both corpora.
    Since we use grammatical context, the feature set is considerably larger than the simple word based proximity feature set for the newspaper corpus.
    Having collected all nouns and their features, we now proceed to construct feature vectors (and values) for nouns from both corpora using mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1989).
    We first construct a frequency count vector C(e) = (ce1, ce2, ..., cek), where k is the total number of features and cef is the frequency count of fe
