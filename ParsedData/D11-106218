    These HITs are combined in an iterative process that alternates text generation, grammaticality check, and entailment annotation steps.
    As a result, for each original ENG text we obtain multiple ENG1 variants of the three types (paraphrases, more general texts, and more specific texts) and, in turn, a set of annotated monolingual (ENG/ENG1) TE pairs.
    As described in Section 4.1, the resulting monolingual English TE corpus (ENG/ENG1) is used to create the following mono/cross-lingual TE corpora:
  
  
    This section provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results of our corpus creation methodology, focusing on the collected ENG-ENG1 monolingual dataset.
    It has to be remarked that, as an effect of the adopted methodology, all the observations and the conclusions drawn hold for the collected CLTE corpora as well.
    Table 1 provides some details about each step of the pipeline shown in Figure 2.
    For each HIT the table presents: i) the number of
