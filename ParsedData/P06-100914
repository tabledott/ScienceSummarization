    Markov features Features defined over adjacent aligment labels allow our model to reflect the tendency for monotonic alignments between European languages.
    We define a real-valued alignment index jump width feature: jump width(t &#8722; 1, t) = abs(at &#8722; at&#8722;1 &#8722; 1) this feature has a value of 0 if the alignment labels follow the downward sloping diagonal, and is positive otherwise.
    This differs from the GIZA++ hidden Markov model which has individual parameters for each different jump width (Och and Ney, 2003; Vogel et al., 1996): we found a single feature (and thus parameter) to be more effective.
    We also defined three indicator features over null transitions to allow the modelling of the probability of transition between, to and from null labels.
    Relative sentence postion A feature for the absolute difference in relative sentence position |&#65533;|)) allows the model to learn a preference for aligning words close to the alignment matrix d
