    Figure 1 pulls together the points of the preceding discussion into an outline of the method of context words.
    In the training phase, it identifies a list of context words that are useful for discriminating among the words in the confusion set.
    At run time, it estimates the probability of each word in the confusion set.
    It starts with the prior probabilities, and multiplies them by the likelihood of each context word from its list that appears in the &#177;k-word window of the target word.
    Finally, it selects the word in the confusion set with the greatest probability.
    The main parameter to tune for the method of context words is k, the half-width of the context window.
    Previous work [Yarowsky, 1994] shows that smaller values of k (3 or 4) work well for resolving local syntactic ambiguities, while larger values (20 to 50) are suitable for resolving semantic ambiguities.
    We tried the values 3, 6, 12, and 24 on some practice confusion sets (not shown here
