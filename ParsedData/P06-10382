er is a fully unsupervised discovery of categories from large unannotated text corpora.
    We aim for categories containing single words (multi-word lexical items will be dealt with in future papers.)
    Our approach is based on patterns, and utilizes the following stages: We performed a thorough evaluation on two English corpora (the BNC and a 68GB web corpus) and on a 33GB Russian corpus, and a sanity-check test on smaller Danish, Irish and Portuguese corpora.
    Evaluations were done using both human judgments and WordNet in a setting quite similar to that done (for the BNC) in previous work.
    Our unsupervised results are superior to previous work that used a POS tagged corpus, are less language dependent, and are very efficient computationally2.
    Patterns are a common approach in lexical acquisition.
    Our approach is novel in several aspects: (1) we discover patterns in a fully unsupervised manner, as opposed to using a manually prepared pattern set, pattern seed or words seeds; (2) our patter
