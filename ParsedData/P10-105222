m- setting is similar, but only includes the window of length n; in the n-grm+ setting, we add features for odd-size windows; in the ngrm++ setting, we add all sequences of letters up to size n occurring in current window.
    For instance, the active bigram features at position t = 2 in the sequence x=&#8217;lemma&#8217; are as follows: the 3grm feature set contains fy,y0, fy,y0,e and fy0,y,lem; only the latter appears in the 3-grm- setting.
    In the 3-grm+ feature set, we also have fy0,y,le and fy0,y,em.
    The 3-grm++ feature set additionally includes fy0,y,l and fy0,y,m.
    The number of features ranges from 360 thousands (1-grm setting) to 1.6 billion (7-grm).
    3Given the design of the Nettalk dictionary, this experiment required to modify the original database so as to reassign prosodic marks to phonemes, rather than to letters.
    Our second benchmark is a part-of-speech (POS) tagging task using the PennTreeBank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993), which provides us with a quite different condition.
