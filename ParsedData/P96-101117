e. bining subtrees 13, 7 via rule R.) The notion of scope is relevant because semantic If a = &lt;R,/3,7&gt;, then take NF(a) = interpretations for CCG constituents can be written &lt;R, NF(#),NF(-y)&gt;, which exists by inductive as restricted lambda terms, in such a way that conhypothesis, unless this is not an NF tree.
    In stituents having distinct terms must have different the latter case, WLOG, R is a forward rule and interpretations in the model (for suitable interpretaNF(#) = &lt;Q, 13i, /32&gt; for some forward com- tions of the words, as in &#167;4.1).
    Theorem 2 is proved position rule Q.
    Pure CCG turns out to pro- by showing that the terms for a and a' differ somevide forward rules S and T such that a' = where, so correspond to different semantic recipes.
    &lt;S, , NF(&lt;T, , 7&gt;)&gt; is a constituent and Similar theorems for the Lambek calculus were is semantically equivalent to a.
    Moreover, since previously shown by (Hepple, 1990; Hendriks, 1993).
