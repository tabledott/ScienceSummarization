 Model 4.
    We quantify the quality of the resulting hypothesized alignments with F-measure using the manually aligned sets.
    We present the results for three different conditions in Table 2.
    For the &#8220;F to E&#8221; direction the models assign non-zero probability to alignments consisting of links from one Foreign word to zero or more English words, while for &#8220;E to F&#8221; the models assign non-zero probability to alignments consisting of links from one English word to zero or more Foreign words.
    It is standard practice to improve the final alignments by combining the &#8220;F to E&#8221; and &#8220;E to F&#8221; directions using symmetrization heuristics.
    We use the &#8220;union&#8221;, &#8220;refined&#8221; and &#8220;intersection&#8221; heuristics defined in (Och and Ney, 2003) which are used in conjunction with IBM Model 4 as the baseline in virtually all recent work on word alignment.
    In Table 2, we report the best symmetrized results.
