 coherence5 at five different levels: all, most, some, hardly any, or none6.
    For example, as shown in Figure 1, an assessor marked system units 1.1 and 10.4 (red/dark underlines in the left pane) as sharing some content with the current model unit 2.2 (highlighted green/dark gray in the right).
    Recall at different compression ratios has been used in summarization research to measure how well an automatic system retains important content of original documents (Mani et al. 1998).
    However, the simple sentence recall measure cannot differentiate system performance appropriately, as is pointed out by Donaway et al. (2000).
    Therefore, instead of pure sentence recall score, we use coverage score C. We define it as follows7: Total number of MUs in the model summary E, the ratio of completeness, ranges from 1 to 0: 1 for all, 3/4 for most, 1/2 for some, 1/4 for hardly any, and 0 for none.
    If we ignore E (set it to 1), we obtain simple sentence recall score.
    We use average coverage scores derive
