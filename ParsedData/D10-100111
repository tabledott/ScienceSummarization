nder the extended representation; each y &#8712; Y is a binary vector of length |I0|.
    We similarly use Z to refer to the set of valid tag structures under the extended representation.
    We assume parameter vectors for the two problems, &#952;cfg &#8712; R|I'| and &#952;tag &#8712; R|I'tar|.
  
  
    This section describes the dual decomposition approach for two inference problems in NLP.
    We now describe the dual decomposition approach for integrated parsing and trigram tagging.
    First, define the set Q as follows: Hence Q is the set of all (y, z) pairs that agree on their part-of-speech assignments.
    The integrated parsing and trigram tagging problem is then to solve where g : Y &#8594; Z is a function that maps a parse tree y to its set of trigrams z = g(y).
    The benefit of the formulation in Eq.
    2 is that it makes explicit the idea of maximizing over all pairs (y, z) under a set of agreement constraints y(i, t) = z(i, t)&#8212;this concept will be central to the algorithms in this pa
