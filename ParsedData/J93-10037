    For a sample of 50,000 words from the Reuters' corpus mentioned previously, none of the words in the table above is common enough to expect such analyses to work well.
  
  
    In text analysis, the statistically based measures that have been used have usually been based on test statistics that are useful because, given certain assumptions, they have a known distribution.
    This distribution is most commonly either the normal or X2 distribution.
    These measures are very useful and can be used to accurately assess significance in a number of different settings.
    They are based, however, on several assumptions that do not hold for most textual analyses.
    The details of how and why the assumptions behind these measures do not hold is of interest primarily to the statistician, but the result is of interest to the statistical consumer (in our case, somebody interested in cou
