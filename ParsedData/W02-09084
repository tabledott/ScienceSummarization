le (r, w') as an attribute of w. For example, the tuple (dog, direct-obj, walk) indicates that the term dog was the direct object of the verb walk.
    Our relation extractor begins with a Naive Bayes POS tagger and chunker.
    After the raw text has been tagged and chunked, noun phrases separated by prepositions and conjunctions are concatenated, and the relation extracting algorithm is run over each sentence.
    This consists of four passes over the sentence, associating each noun with the modifiers and verbs from the syntactic contexts they appear in: The relation tuple is then converted to root form using the Sussex morphological analyser (Minnen et al., 2000) and the POS tags are removed.
    The relations for each term are collected together and counted, producing a context vector of attributes and (adjective, good) 2005 (adjective, faintest) 89 (direct-obj, have) 1836 (indirect-obj, toy) 74 (adjective, preconceived) 42 (adjective, foggiest) 15 their frequencies in the corpus.
