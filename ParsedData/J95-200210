from productions in the grammar.
    The above state is derived from a corresponding production with the following semantics: A state with the dot to the right of the entire RHS is called a complete state, since it indicates that the left-hand side (LHS) nonterminal has been fully expanded.
    Our description of Earley parsing omits an optional feature of Earley states, the lookahead string.
    Earley's algorithm allows for an adjustable amount of lookahead during parsing, in order to process LR(k) grammars deterministically (and obtain the same computational complexity as specialized LR(k) parsers where possible).
    The addition of lookahead is orthogonal to our extension to probabilistic grammars, so we will not include it here.
    The operation of the parser is defined in terms of three operations that consult the current set of states and the current input symbol, and add new states to the chart.
    This is strongly suggestive of state transitions in finite-state models of language, parsing, etc.
