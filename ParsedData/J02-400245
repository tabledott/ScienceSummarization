    What is more important is that humans can agree on the rhetorical status of the relevant sentences.
    Liddy observed that agreement on rhetorical status was easier for professional abstractors than sentence selection: Although they did not necessarily agree on which individual sentences should go into an abstract, they did agree on the rhetorical information types that make up a good abstract.
    We asked our trained annotators to classify a set of 200 sentences, randomly sampled from the 1,183 sentences selected by the first author, into the six rhetorical categories.
    The sentences were presented in order of occurrence in the document, but without any context in terms of surrounding sentences.
    We measured stability at K = .9, .86, .83 (N = 100, k = 2) and reproducibility at K = .84 (N = 200, k = 3).
    These results are reassuring: They show that the rhetorical status for important sentences can be particularly well determined, better than rhetorical status for all sentence
