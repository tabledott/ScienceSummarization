 knowledge, syntactic, semantic, or even pragmatic, can be applied in CDG parsing as long as it is expressed as a unary or binary constraint on word-to-word modifications.
    Each value or pair of values is tested against the newly added constraints.
    In the network in Figure 5, the value P3 (i.e.
    &lt;POSTMOD,3&gt;) of the node PP4 (i.e.. &amp;quot;on the table (PP4)&amp;quot; modifies &amp;quot;on the floor (PP3)&amp;quot;) violates the constraint (G2b-1), so we remove P3 from the domain of PRI.
    Accordingly, corresponding rows and columns in the four constraint matrices adjacent to the node PP4 are removed.
    The binary constraint (G2b-2) affects the elements of the constraint matrices.
    For the matrix between the nodes PP3 and PP4, the element in row 1,1 (&lt;1..0C ,1&gt;) and column Li (&lt;1,0C , 1&gt;) is set to zero, since both are modifications to VI with the label LOC.
    Similarly, the Li-Li elements of the matrices PP3-PP5 and PP4-PP5 are set to zero.
    The modified network is sh
