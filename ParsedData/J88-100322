 as shown in Table 1 (derived from Francis and Kucera (1982)).
    A search of the relevant literature has revealed only three previous efforts directed specifically to this problem.
    The first published effort is that of Klein and Simmons (1963), a simple system using suffix lists and limited frame rules.
    The second approach to lexical category disambiguation is TAGGIT (Greene and Rubin (1971)), a system of several thousand context-frame rules.
    This algorithm was used to assign initial tags to the Brown Corpus.
    Third is the CLAWS system developed to tag the Lancaster &#8212;Oslo/Bergen (or LOB) Corpus.
    This is a corpus of British written English, parallel to the Brown Corpus.
    Parsing systems always encounter the problem of category ambiguity; but usually the focus of such systems is at other levels, making their responses less relevant for our purposes here.
    Klein and Simmons (1963) describe a method directed primarily towards the task of initial categorial tagging rather than disa
