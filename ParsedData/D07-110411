.
			However, for real language data the per formance for sets of any significant size will be O( ?I i=1 [|wi|+ log|T |+ ni]), since most patterns will occur once in any given sentence.
			4.2 Analysis.
			It is instructive to compare this with the complex ity for contiguous phrases.
			In that case, total lookup time is O(|w| + log|T |) for a contiguous pattern w. 4Often known in the literature as a van Emde Boas tree or van Emde Boas priority queue.
			978 The crucial difference between the contiguous and discontiguous case is the added term ?I i=1 ni.
			Foreven moderately frequent subpatterns this term dom inates complexity.
			To make matters concrete, consider the training corpus used in our experiments (?6), which contains27M source words.
			The three most frequent uni grams occur 1.48M, 1.16M and 688K times ? thefirst two occur on average more than once per sen tence.
			In the worst case, looking up a contiguous phrase containing any number and combination ofthese unigrams requires no more than 25 c
