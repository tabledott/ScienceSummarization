ilure to find the best alignment according to the model, i.e. in our case a failure to maximize Equation 2.
    1986).
    The third improvement is important for restricting total time used when producing alignments for large training corpora.
    We performed two experiments.
    The first evaluates the number of search errors.
    For each corpus we sampled 1000 sentence pairs randomly, with no sentence length restriction.
    Model 4 parameters are estimated from the final HMM Viterbi alignment of these sentence pairs.
    We then search to try to find the Model 4 Viterbi alignment with both the new and old algorithms, allowing them both to process for the same amount of time.
    The percentage of known search errors is the percentage of sentences from our sample in which we were able to find a more probable candidate by applying our new algorithm using 24 hours of computation for just the 1000 sample sentences.
    Table 5 presents the results, showing that our new algorithm reduced search errors in all
