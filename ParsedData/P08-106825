d in dependency parsing.
    A natural avenue for further research would be the development of clustering algorithms that reflect the syntactic behavior of words; e.g., an algorithm that attempts to maximize the likelihood of a treebank, according to a probabilistic dependency model.
    Alternately, one could design clustering algorithms that cluster entire head-modifier arcs rather than individual words.
    Another idea would be to integrate the clustering algorithm into the training algorithm in a limited fashion.
    For example, after training an initial parser, one could parse a large amount of unlabeled text and use those parses to improve the quality of the clusters.
    These improved clusters can then be used to retrain an improved parser, resulting in an overall algorithm similar to that of McClosky et al. (2006).
    Setting aside the development of new clustering algorithms, a final area for future work is the extension of our method to new domains, such as conversational text or other languages
