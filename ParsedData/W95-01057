ject and the quantity (i.e., crateful, as in &amp;quot;a crateful of oranges&amp;quot;); my own intuition is that the first of these would more properly be included in HP than the second, and should therefore receive a higher value of cc, though of course neither I nor any other individual really constitutes an &amp;quot;ideal human judge.&amp;quot; The core of the disambiguation algorithm is a computation of semantic similarity using the WordNet taxonomy, a topic recently investigated by a number of people (Leacock and Chodorow, 1994; Resnik, 1995; Sussna, 1993).
    In this paper, I restrict my attention to WordNet's IS-A taxonomy for nouns, and take an approach in which semantic similarity is evaluated on the basis of the information content shared by the items being compared.
    The intuition behind the approach is simple: the more similar two words are, the more informative will be the most specific concept that subsumes them both.
    (That is, their least upper bound in the taxonomy; here a concept co
