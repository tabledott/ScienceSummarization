to one outcome of the coin flip, say heads; an occurrence without a cue for S corresponds to tails.'
    If the cues were perfect predictors of syntactic structure then a verb V that does not in fact occur in frame S would never appear with cues for S&#8212;the coin would never come up heads.
    Since the cues are not perfect, such verbs do occur with cues for S. The problem is to determine when a verb occurs with cues for S often enough that all those occurrences are unlikely to be errors.
    In the following discussion, a verb that in fact occurs in frame S in the input is described as a +S verb; one that does not is described as a -S verb.
    The statistical model is based on the following approximation: for fixed S, all -S verbs have equal probability of being followed by a cue for S. Let 7r, stand for that probability.
    7r-s may vary from frame to frame, but not from verb to verb.
    Thus, errors might be more common for tensed clauses than for NPs, but the working hypothesis is that all intransit
