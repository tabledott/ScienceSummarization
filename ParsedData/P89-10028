ave any length, and it is impossible to predict from a semantic structure the size of its corresponding subcategorization list merely by examining the lexicon.
    In summary, top-down generation algorithms, even if controlled by the instantiation status of goals, can fail to terminate on certain grammars.
    In the case given above the well-foundedness of the generation process resides in lexical information unavailable to top-down regimes.
    The bottom-up Earley-deduction generator does not fall prey to these problems of nontermination in the face of recursion, because lexical information is available immediately.
    However, several important frailties of the Earley generation method were noted, even in the earlier work.
    For efficiency, generation using this Earley deduction method requires an incomplete search strategy, filtering the search space using semantic information.
    The semantic filter makes generation from a logical form computationally feasible, but preserves completeness of the gene
