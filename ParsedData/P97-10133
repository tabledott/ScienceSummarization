ct structure of most texts is a binary, tree-like structure.
    5.
    If a relation holds between two textual spans of the tree structure of a text, that relation also holds between the most important units of the constituent subspans.
    The most important units of a textual span are determined recursively: they correspond to the most important units of the immediate subspans when the relation that holds between these subspans is paratactic, and to the most important units of the nucleus subspan when the relation that holds between the immediate subspans is hypotactic.
    In our previous work (Marcu, 1996), we presented a complete axiomatization of these principles in the context of Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) and we described an algorithm that, starting from the set of textual units that make up a text and the set of elementary rhetorical relations that hold between these units, can derive all the valid discourse trees of that text.
    Consequently, if one is to build discours
