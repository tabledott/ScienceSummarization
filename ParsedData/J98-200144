tive.
    This would also allow us to test how well subjects did with a linking type of classification like the one used in MUC-6.
    We also replaced the anaphoric (same head) class we had in the first experiment with a broader coreferent class including all cases in which a definite description is coreferential with its antecedent, whether or not the head noun was the same: e.g., we asked the subjects to classify as coreferent a definite like the house referring back to an antecedent introduced as a Victorian home, which would not have counted as anaphoric (same head) in our first experiment.
    This resulted in a taxonomy that was at the same time more semantically oriented and closer to Hawkins's and Prince's classification schemes: our broadened coreferent class coincides with Hawkins's anaphoric and Prince's textually evoked classes, whereas the resulting, narrower associative class (that we called bridging references) coincides with Hawkins's associative anaphoric and Prince's class of inferrables.
