of visualising them.
    In other words, GATE components are one of three types: These resources can be local to the user's machine or remote (available via HTTP), and all can be extended by users without modification to GATE itself.
    One of the main advantages of separating the algorithms from the data they require is that the two can be developed independently by language engineers with different types of expertise, e.g. programmers and linguists.
    Similarly, separating data from its visualisation allows users to develop alternative visual resources, while still using a language resource provided by GATE.
    Collectively, all resources are known as CREOLE (a Collection of REusable Objects for Language Engineering), and are declared in a repository XML file, which describes their name, implementing class, parameters, icons, etc.
    This repository is used by the framework to discover and load available resources.
    A parameters tag describes the parameters which each resource needs when created or
