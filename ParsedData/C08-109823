ging accuracy on development data depending on context size Figure 2 shows that the tagging accuracy tends to increase with the context size.
			The best results are obtained with a context size of 10.
			What type of information is relevant across a distance of ten words?
			A good example is the decision tree for the attribute first person of finite verbs, which looks for a first person pronoun at positions -1 through -10 (relative to the position of the current word) in this order.
			Since German is a verb-final language, these tests clearly make sense.
			Table 4 shows the performance on the test data.
			Our tagger was used with a context size of 10.
			The suffix length parameter of the TnT tagger was set to 6 without lexicon and to 3 with lexicon.
			These values were optimal on the development data.
			Theaccuracy of our tagger is lower than on the devel opment data.
			This could be due to the higher rate of unknown words (10.0% vs. 7.7%).
			Relative tothe TnT tagger, however, the accuracy is quite
