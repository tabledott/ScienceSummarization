hus, an item subderivation could occur multiple times in a given item derivation.
    This means that we can have a one-to-one correspondence between item derivations and grammar derivations; loops in the grammar lead to an infinite number of grammar derivations, and an infinite number of corresponding item derivations. would allow derivations such as S AAA = BAA AA = BA A = B &#8364;.
    We would include the exact same item derivation showing A z B E three times.
    Similarly, for a derivation such asA-B-i4-13-A-a, we would have a corresponding item derivation tree that included multiple uses of the A &#8212;&gt; B and B &#8212;&gt; A rules.
    2.4.3 Value of Item Derivation.
    The value of an item derivation D, V (D), is the product of the value of its rules, R(r), in the same order that they appear in the item derivation tree.
    Since rules occur only in the leaves of item derivation trees, the order is precisely determined.
    For an item derivation tree D with rule values d1, d2,.
    , d1 as its
