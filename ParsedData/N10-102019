t a uniform model would transition to each act with probability 0.10.
    In both Table 3 and Figure 4, we use intuitive names in place of cluster numbers.
    These are based on our interpretations of the clusters, and are provided only to benefit the reader when interpreting the transition diagram.8 From inspecting the transition diagram (Figure 4), one can see that the model employs three distinct acts to initiate Twitter conversations.
    These initial acts are quite different from one another, and lead to table 3 for word lists and example posts for each act different sets of possible responses.
    We discuss each of these in turn.
    The Status act appears to represent a post in which the user is broadcasting information about what they are currently doing.
    This can be seen by the high amount of probability mass given to words like I and my, in addition to verbs such as go and get, as well as temporal nouns such as today, tomorrow and tonight.
    The Reference Broadcast act consists mostly of us
