gt; &lt;LEX post=end&gt;officer&lt;/LEX &gt; We adopted this LEX-based phrase encoding so as to simplify (and speed up) the input scanner of the part- of-speech tagger.
  In addition, a phrases LEX tags can encode parts-of-speech to help guide the p-o-s tagger.
  THE PART-OF-SPEECH TAGGER Our part-of-speech tagger is closest among the components of our Muc-6 system to Brills original work o n rule sequences [S, 6, 7] .
  The tagger is in fact a re-implementation of Brills widely-disseminated system, wit h various speed and maintainability improvements.
  Most of the rule sequences that drive the tagger were automatically learned from hand-tagged corpora, rather than hand-crafted by human engineers .
  However, the rules are in a human-understandable form, and thus hand-crafted rules can easily be combined with automatically learned rules, a property which we exploited in the Muc-6 version of Alembic.
  The tagger operates on text that has been lexicalized through pre-processing .
  The following, for example
