reebank, we believe that CCGbank, the resulting corpus, will be of use to the computational linguistics community in the following ways.
    CCGbank has already enabled the creation of several robust and accurate wide-coverage CCG parsers, including Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002), Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman (2002), Hockenmaier (2003b), and Clark and Curran (2004, 2007).
    Although the construction of full logical forms was beyond the scope of this project, CCGbank can also be seen as a resource which may enable the automatic construction of full semantic interpretations by wide-coverage parsers.
    Unlike most Penn Treebank parsers, such as Collins (1999) or Charniak (2000), these CCGbank parsers return not only syntactic derivations, but also local and long-range dependencies, including those that arise under relativization and coordination.
    Although these dependencies are only an approximation of the full semantic interpretation that can in principle be obtained from a CCG, they may prove usef
