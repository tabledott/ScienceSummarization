ich the binding of two vectors results in a vector which has the same dimensionality as its components.
    Holographic reduced representations (Plate, 1991) are one implementation of this idea where the tensor product is projected back onto the space of its components.
    The projection is defined in terms of circular convolution a mathematical function that compresses the tensor product of two vectors.
    The compression is achieved by summing along the transdiagonal elements of the tensor product.
    Noisy versions of the original vectors can be recovered by means of circular correlation which is the approximate inverse of circular convolution.
    The success of circular correlation crucially depends on the components of the n-dimensional vectors u and v being randomly distributed with mean 0 and variance 1n.
    This poses problems for modeling linguistic data which is typically represented by vectors with non-random structure.
    Vector addition is by far the most common method for representing the
