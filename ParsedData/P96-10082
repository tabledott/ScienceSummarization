sociated probability scores.
    The meaning of a sentence is determined by taking the highest scoring theory from among the n-best possibilities produced by the final stage in the model.
    Some key advantages to statistical modeling techniques are: sufficient to provide the system with examples specifying the correct parses for a set of training examples.
    There is no need to specify an exact set of rules or a detailed procedure for producing such parses. are principled techniques for estimating the gradations.
    The system is thus free to pursue unusual theories, while remaining aware of the fact that they are unlikely.
    In the event that a more likely theory exists, then the more likely theory is selected, but if no more likely interpretation can be found, the unlikely interpretation is accepted.
