nglish&#8217;) sentence Among all possible target sentences, we will choose the sentence with the highest probability:1 The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.
    The decision in Eq.
    1 minimizes the number of decision errors.
    Hence, under a so-called zero-one loss function this decision rule is optimal (Duda and Hart, 1973).
    Note that using a different loss function&#8212;for example, one induced by the BLEU metric&#8212;a different decision rule would be optimal.
    'The notational convention will be as follows.
    We use the symbol Pr to denote general probability distributions with (nearly) no specific assumptions.
    In contrast, for model-based probability distributions, we use the generic symbol .
    As the true probability distribution Pr is unknown, we have to develop a model that approximates Pr .
    We directly model the posterior probability Pr by using a log-linear model.
    In this framework, we have a
