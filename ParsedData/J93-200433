Lancaster UCREL Treebank Project increases annotator productivity by approximately 100-200 words per hour.
  It proved to be very difficult for annotators to distinguish between a verbs arguments and adjuncts in all cases.
  Allowing annotators to ignore this distinction when it is unclear (attaching constituents high) increases productivity by approximately 150-200 words per hour.
  Informal examination of later annotation showed that forced distinctions cannot be made consistently.
  As a result of this experiment, the originally proposed skeletal representation was adopted, without a forced distinction between arguments and adjuncts.
  Even after extended training, performance varies markedly by annotator, with speeds on the task of correcting skeletal structure without requiring a distinction between arguments and adjuncts ranging from approximately 750 words per hour to well over 1,000 words per hour after three or four months experience.
  The fastest annotators work in bursts of well over 1,500 words p
