hora (87% versus 74% correct).'
    Because intersentential anaphora is relatively rare in our corpus of computer manual texts and because RAP's success rate for intrasentential anaphora is higher than Hobbs' (89% versus 81%), RAP's overall success rate on the blind test set is 4% higher than that of our version of Hobbs' algorithm.
    This indicates that RAP's salience metric provides a more reliable basis for antecedent selection than Hobbs' search procedure for the text domain on which we tested both algorithms.
    It is clear from the relatively high rate of agreement between RAP and Hobbs' algorithm on the test set (they agree in 83% of the cases) that there is a significant degree of convergence between salience as measured by RAP and the configurational prominence defined by Hobbs' search procedure.
    This is to be expected in English, in which grammatical roles are identified by means of phrase order.
    However, in languages in which grammatical roles are case marked and word order is relatively
