ion 5.1).
    The central experiment in this section tests the feasibility of learning case frame information for verbs from examples.
    In the method tested, we assume that a body of fully parsed sentences, such as those from TREEBANK, are available.
    We furthermore assume that every head noun and head verb has a lexical link to a unary predicate in a taxonomic domain model; that unary predicate is the most specific semantic class of entities denoted by the headword.
    From the parsed examples and the lexical links to the domain model, an algorithm identifies case frame relations for the verbs.
    If an algorithm is to learn case frame relations (or selection restrictions) from text, a basic concern is to reliably identify noun phrases and their semantic category, even if neither full syntactic nor full semantic analysis is possible.
    First, we discuss reliably finding them based on local syntactic information.
    In the next section, we describe finding their semantic category.
    Two of our ex
