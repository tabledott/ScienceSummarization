ically assigned POS tags.
    We show how to maintain some POS ambiguity through to the supertagging phase, using a multi-POS tagger, and also how POS tag probabilities can be encoded as real-valued features in the supertagger.
    The drop in supertagging accuracy when moving from gold to automatically assigned POS tags is reduced by roughly 50% across the various values of &#946;.
  
  
    The philosophy in earlier work which combined the supertagger and parser (Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman 2002; Clark and Curran 2003) was to use an unrestrictive setting of the supertagger, but still allow a reasonable compromise between speed and accuracy.
    The idea was to give the parser the greatest possibility of finding the correct parse, by initializing it with as many lexical categories as possible, but still retain reasonable efficiency.
    However, for some sentences, the number of categories in the chart gets extremely large with this approach, and parsing is unacceptably slow.
    Hence a limit was appli
