esentations and clustering algorithms.
    These were run on each of the 27 target words, and also on the five mixed words.
    What follows is a concise description of each configuration.
    All of the SC experiments use second order context vectors and hence follow the approach suggested by Sch&#168;utze.
    Experiment PB2 clusters the Pedersen and Bruce style (first order) context vectors using the Sch&#168;utze like clustering scheme, while SC2 tries to see the effect of using the Pedersen and Bruce style clustering method on Sch&#168;utze style (second order) context vectors.
    The motivation behind experiments PB3 and SC3 is to try bigram features in both PB and SC style context vectors.
    The F&#8211;measure associated with the discrimination of each word is shown in Table 1.
    Any score that is significantly greater than the majority sense (according to a paired t&#8211;test) is shown in bold face.
  
  
    We employ three different types of data in our experiments.
