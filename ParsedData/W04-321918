 we had two raters judge whether the output from each system was a paraphrase of the input sentence.
    The raters were presented with an input sentence and an output paraphrase from each system in random order to prevent bias toward any particular judgment.
    Since, on our first pass, we found inter-rater agreement to be somewhat low (84%), we asked the raters to make a second pass of judgments on those where they disagreed; this significantly improved agreement (96.9%).
    The results of this final evaluation are summarized in Table 2.
  
  
    Table 2 shows that PR can produce rewordings that are evaluated as plausible paraphrases more frequently than those generated by either baseline techniques or MSA.
    The WordNet baseline performs quite poorly, even in combination with a trigram language model: the language model does not contribute significantly to resolving lexical selection.
    The performance of CL is likewise abysmal&#8212;again a language model does nothing to help.
