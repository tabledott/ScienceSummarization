s only by having one of the syntactic operators =s!, or =sO (where s indicates that the constraint is a syntactic one).
  Their seman- tics is identical to that of the disambiguation con- straints: (@w =sO "@+FMAINV" (*-1 VFIN)) (@w =sO "@+FMAINV" (1 VFIN)) (@w =s!
  "@SUBJ" (0 NOMHEAD) (NOT "1 NOM- HEAD) (1 VFIN)(NOT *-1 NOMHEAD)) The first two constraints discard @+FMAINV as a syntactic alternative if there is a unique finite main verb either to the left or to the right in the same clause.
  The third constraint prescribes that @SUBJ is the correct label for a noun or pronoun (NOM- HEAD in target position, i.e.
  position 0), with a finite verb somewhere to the right in the same clause and no similar noun or pronoun either left or right (-- woman -- laughed --).
  Maximal profit is extracted from the Uniqueness Principle.
  At each syntactic step (before mapping, after mapping, and after the application of a syntactic constraint hat affects the labels obeying the Unique- hess Principle), each clause is chec
