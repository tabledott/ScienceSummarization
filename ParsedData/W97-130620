 quite naturally depends on the application coreference is being used in.
    Some examples follow.
    Information retrieval is characterized as a process by which a query is used to retrieve relevant documents from a text database.
    Queries are typically natural language based or Boolean expressions.
    Documents are retrieved and ranked for relevance using various string matching techniques with query terms in a document and the highest scoring documents are presented to the user first.
    The role that coreference resolution might play in information retrieval is that retrieval algorithms that a) count the number of matches to a query term in a document, or b) count the proximity of matches to query terms, would benefit by noticing alternative realizations of the terms like 'he' in place 'George Bush'.
    In such an application, high precision coreference would be more useful than high recall coreference if the information retrieval engine was returning too many irrelevant documents but getting a re
