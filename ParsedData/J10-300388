00 sentence pairs with paraphrase annotations that can be used for both development and evaluation of paraphrase systems.
    These paraphrase annotations take the form of alignments between the words and sequences of words in each sentence pair; these alignments are analogous to the word- and phrasal-alignments induced in SMT systems that were illustrated in Section 3.5.
    As is the case with SMT alignments, the paraphrase annotations can be of different forms: one-word-to-one-word, one-word-to-many-words, as well as fully phrasal alignments.15 The authors start from a sentence-aligned paraphrase corpus compiled from three corpora that we have already described elsewhere in this survey: (1) the sentence pairs judged equivalent from the MSRP Corpus: (2) the Multiple Translation Chinese (MTC) corpus of multiple human-written translations of Chinese news stories used by Pang, Knight, and Marcu (2003); and (3) two English translations of the French novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, a subset of the m
