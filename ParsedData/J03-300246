n Table 4.
    The decision trees learned were once again all quite similar, with eight of the nine rooted as follows (a few of the trees differed slightly in the numerical values used as thresholds): The remainder of each tree varied, and there was some evidence of overtraining.
    These results clearly demonstrate the benefit of combining structural and contentbased approaches.
    We next describe how we have adapted the STRAND architecture to the Internet Archive, in order to generate the candidate pairs on a scale that has previously been unattainable.
  
  
    One of the difficulties with doing research on Web mining is that large-scale crawling of the Web is a significant enterprise.
    Chen and Nie&#8217;s (2000) PTMiner represents one solution, a carefully thought-out architecture for mining on a large scale.
    Here we present a different solution, taking advantage of an existing large-scale repository of Web pages maintained on an ongoing basis by an organization known as the Internet Archive.
