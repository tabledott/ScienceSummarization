 surface position is a determinant of the Cb.
    In contrast, both grammatical role and surface position were shown to affect the Cf ordering.
    Although there are as yet no psycholinguistic results related to the effect of pronominalization on determining Cb(Un_i), cross-linguistic work (Kameyama 1985; Prince and Walker 1995; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994) argues that it plays such a role.
    Section 9 lists several papers appearing after Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) that investigate factors affecting the Cf ordering.
  
  
    The basic constraint on center realization is given by Rule 1, which is stated in terms of the definitions and schematic in Section 3.
    Rule 1 If any element of Cf(Un) is realized by a pronoun in Un+i, then the Cb(Un+i) must be realized by a pronoun also.
    In particular, this constraint stipulates that no element in an utterance can be realized as a pronoun unless the backward-looking center of the utterance is realized as a pronoun also.'
    Rule 1 represents one funct
