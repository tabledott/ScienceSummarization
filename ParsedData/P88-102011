elate the semantics of each part to a single overarching framework.
    In 1978, Hobbs ((Hobbs 78, 79, 82]) recognized that in coherent text successive pieces of text are related in a specified set of ways.
    He produced a set of relations organized into four categories, which he postulated as the four types of phenomena that occur during conversation.
    His argument, unfortunately, contains a number of shortcomings; not only is the categorization not well-motivated, but the list of relations is incomplete.
    In her thesis work, McKeown took a different approach ([McKeown 82]).
    She defined a set of relatively static schemas that represent the structure of stereotypical paragraphs for describing objects.
    In essence, these schemas are paragraph templates; coherence is enforced by the correct nesting and filling-in of templates.
    No explicit theory of coherence was offered.
    Mann and Thompson, alter a wide-ranging study involving hundreds of paragraphs, proposed that a set of 20 relations suf
