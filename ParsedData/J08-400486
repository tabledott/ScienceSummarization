 differences resulting from the choice of distance metrics, where values for the full-chain condition ranged from &#945; = 0.642 using Jaccard as distance metric, to &#945; = 0.654 using Passonneau&#8217;s metric, to the value for Dice reported in Figure 3, &#945; = 0.691.
    These differences raise an important issue concerning the application of &#945;-like measures for CL tasks: Using &#945; makes it difficult to compare the results of different annotation experiments, in that a &#8220;poor&#8221; value or a &#8220;high&#8221; value might result from &#8220;too strict&#8221; or &#8220;too generous&#8221; distance metrics, making it even more important to develop a methodology to identify appropriate values for these coefficients.
    This issue is further emphasized by the study reported next.

    A second annotation study we carried out (Artstein and Poesio 2006) shows even more clearly the possible side effects of using weighted coefficients.
