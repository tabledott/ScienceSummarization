   Summarization is often used for a long document that includes multiple topics.
    A summary of such a document can be composed of summaries of the component topics.
    Identification of topics is the task of text segmentation.
    A lot of research has been done on text segmentation (Kozima, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Okumura and Honda, 1994; Salton et al., 1996; Yaari, 1997; Kan et al., 1998; Choi, 2000; Nakao, 2000).
    A major characteristic of the methods used in this research is that they do not require training data to segment given texts.
    Hearst (1994), for example, used only the similarity of word distributions in a given text to segment the text.
    Consequently, these methods can be applied to any text in any domain, even if training data do not exist.
    This property is important when text segmentation is applied to information retrieval or summarization, because both tasks deal with domain-independent documents.
    Another application of text segmentation is the segmentation of a continuous
