y 8 times in the right context, whereas a minimum of 10 appearances is required to pass this step.
    Although the theoretical analysis and simulation experiments of Section 6.2 show that such cases of missing the correct translation are rare, more work needs to be done in quantifying this phenomenon.
    In particular, experiments with actual corpus data should supplement the theoretical results (based on uniform distributions).
    Furthermore, more experimentation with the values of the thresholds needs to be done, to locate the optimum trade-off point between efficiency and accuracy.
    An additional direction for future experiments is to vary the thresholds (and especially the frequency threshold Tf) according to the size of the database corpus and the frequency of the collocation being translated.
    Incorporating the length of the translation into the score.
    Currently our scoring method only uses the lengths of candidate translations to break a tie in the similarity measure.
    It seems, howeve
