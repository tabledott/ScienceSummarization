 following sentence, in the Peruvian town can be attached syntactically at three places: modifying dawn, modifying today, or modifying explode.
    A bomb exploded today at dawn in the Peruvian town of Yunguyo, near the lake, very near where the Presidential summit was to take place.
    Closest attachment, a purely syntactic constraint, worked quite effectively, having a 25% error rate.
    Using the semantic probabilities alone p' (X I P, 0) had poorer performance, a 34% error rate.
    However, the richer probability model pi (X I P, 0) * p(d) outperformed both the purely semantic model and the purely syntactic model (closest attachment), yielding an 18% error rate.
    However, the degree of reduction of error rate should not be taken as the final word, for the following reasons: import in the MUC-3 domain, their semantic type is vague, i.e., &lt;unknown event&gt;, &lt;unknown entity&gt;, etc.
    In addition to the work discussed earlier on tools to increase the portability of natural language systems, a
