ge acquisition &#8212; that will almost certainly involve some notion of syntactic category &#8212; requires an explanation of the acquisition of that set of syntactic categories.
    The amount of data used in this study is 12 million words, which is consistent with a pessimistic lower bound on the linguistic experience of the infant language learner in the period from 2 to 5 years of age, and has had capitalisation removed as being information not available in that circumstance.
  
  
    Previous work falls into two categories.
    A number of researchers have obtained good results using pattern recognition techniques.
    Finch and Chater (1992), (1995) and Schiitze (1993), (1997) use a set of features derived from the co-occurrence statistics of common words together with standard clustering and information extraction techniques.
    For sufficiently frequent words this method produces satisfactory results.
    Brown et al. (1992) use a very large amount of data, and a well-founded information theoretic
