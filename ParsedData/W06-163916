re essentially infinite.
    Although one can also implement this assumption via concatenation of same-speaker speech segments (see Section 4.3), we view the fact that our graph-based framework incorporates both hard and soft constraints in a principled fashion as an advantage of our approach.
    Different-speaker agreements In House discourse, it is common for one speaker to make reference to another in the context of an agreement or disagreement over the topic of discussion.
    The systematic identification of instances of agreement can, as we have discussed, be a powerful tool for the development of intelligently selected weights for links between speech segments.
    The problem of agreement identification can be decomposed into two sub-problems: identifying references and their targets, and deciding whether each reference represents an instance of agreement.
    In our case, the first task is straightforward because we focused solely on by-name references.7 Hence, we will now concentrate on the second,
