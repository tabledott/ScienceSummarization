tion 7, we show how LRA can recognize relations such as location and product (see Table 19).
    Hearst (1992) presents an algorithm for learning hyponym (type of) relations from a corpus and Berland and Charniak (1999) describe how to learn meronym (part of) relations from a corpus.
    These algorithms could be used to automatically generate a thesaurus or dictionary, but we would like to handle more relations than hyponymy and meronymy.
    WordNet distinguishes more than a dozen semantic relations between words (Fellbaum 1998) and Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) list 30 semantic relations for noun-modifier pairs.
    Hearst and Berland and Charniak (1999) use manually generated rules to mine text for semantic relations.
    Turney and Littman (2005) also use a manually generated set of 64 patterns.
    LRA does not use a predefined set of patterns; it learns patterns from a large corpus.
    Instead of manually generating new rules or patterns for each new semantic relation, it is possible to automatically
