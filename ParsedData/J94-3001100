 the cycle is that the ordered sequence of rules is applied to the innermost bracketed portion of a word first.
    Then the innermost set of brackets is removed and the procedure is repeated.
    The cycle continues in this way until no brackets remain.
    The cycle has been a major source of controversy ever since it was first proposed by Chomsky and Halle (1968), and many of the phenomena that motivated it can also be given noncyclic descriptions.
    Even for cases where a nonrecursive, iterative account has not yet emerged, there may be restrictions on the mode of reapplication that limit the formal power of the grammar without reducing its empirical or explanatory coverage.
    For example, the bracket erasure convention means that new string material becomes accessible to the rules on each cycle.
    If, either implicitly or explicitly, there is also a finite bound on the amount of old material to which rules in the new cycle can be sensitive, it may be possible to transform the recursive specificatio
