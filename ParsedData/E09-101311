ial distribution over words for sense j, and 0(c) as a shorthand for the distribution of senses in context c. Following Blei et al. (2003) we will assume that the mixing proportion over senses 0 is drawn from a Dirichlet prior with parameters a.
    The role of the hyperparameter a is to create a smoothed sense distribution.
    We also place a symmetric Dirichlet R on &#65533; (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2002).
    The hyperparmeter R can be interpreted as the prior observation count on the number of times context words are sampled from a sense before any word from the corpus is observed.
    Our model is represented in graphical notation in Figure 1.
    The model sketched above only takes word information into account.
    Methods developed for supervised WSD often use a variety of information sources based not only on words but also on lemmas, parts of speech, collocations and syntactic relationships (Lee and Ng, 2002).
    The first idea that comes to mind, is to use the same model while treating various fe
