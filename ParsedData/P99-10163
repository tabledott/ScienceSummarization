of the nouns in this data using standard bottom-up clustering techniques as follows: Put each noun into its own node.
    Compute the similarity between each pair of nodes using the cosine method.
    Find the two most similar nouns and combine them by giving them a common parent (and removing the child nodes from future consideration).
    We can then compute the new node's similarity to each other node by computing a weighted average of the similarities between each of its children and the other node.
    In other words, assuming nodes A and B have been combined under a new parent C, the similarity between C and any other node i can be computed as Once again, we combine the two most similar nodes under a common parent.
    Repeat until all nouns have been placed under a common ancestor.
    Nouns which have a cosine of 0 with every other noun are not included in the final tree.
    In practice, we cannot follow exactly that algorithm, because maintaining a list of the cosines between every pair of nodes req
