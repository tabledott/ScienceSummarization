    For English written text, both of these tasks are relatively easy although not trivial&#8212;see Palmer and Hearst (1997).
    The search subtask consists of finding the best match between the word set representing the question and the sets representing sentences in the document.
    Our system measures the match by size of the intersection of the two word sets.
    For example, the question in (2a) would receive an intersection score of 1 because of the mutual set element books.
    Because match size does not produce a complete ordering on the s
