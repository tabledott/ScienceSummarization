ignificance for 100 different test sets with 300 sentences each (the same broad samples used in previous experiments).
    For 65 samples we draw the conclusion the Spanish system is better than the Danish with at least 95% statistical significance.
    Recall that the BLEU score difference on the huge 30,000 sentence test set is 2.0% (refer to Table 1).
    In this particular case, a small 300 sentence test set is often sufficient to detect the superiority of one of the systems with statistical significance.
    If the true difference in translation performance is closer, we are less likely to draw conclusions from such a small test set.
    See Figure 8, which compares the Portuguese and the Danish system.
    Their BLEU score difference on the huge 30,000 sentence test set ples we make a 95% statistically significant conclusion that the Portuguese system is better than the Danish, and 1 conclusion to the opposite is only 0.5%.
    Using paired bootstrap resampling, we drawn 13 conclusions: 12 correct concl
