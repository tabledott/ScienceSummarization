luations (r = .41, p &lt; 0.01).
    Our model has two free parameters: the frequency threshold used to identify salient entities and the length of the transition sequence.
    These parameters were tuned separately for each data set on the corresponding held-out development set.
    For our ordering and summarization experiments, optimal saliencebased models were obtained for entities with frequency &gt; 2.
    The optimal transition length was &lt; 3 for ordering and &lt; 2 for summarization.
    We compare our algorithm against the coherence model proposed by Foltz et al. (1998) which measures coherence as a function of semantic relatedness between adjacent sentences.
    Semantic relatedness is computed automatically using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Landauer and Dumais 1997) from raw text without employing syntactic or other annotations.
    This model is a good point of comparison for several reasons: (a) it is fully automatic, (b) it is a not a straw-man baseline; it correlates reliably with human j
