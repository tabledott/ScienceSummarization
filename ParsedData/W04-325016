EU scores, we have the remaining 95% of BLEU scores in an interval .
    The law of large numbers dictates, that with an increasingly large number of BLEU scores, the interval approaches the 95% confidence interval for scores of test sets of size 300.
    Of course, having to translate and score sets of 300 sentences repeatedly, does not save anything in terms of computational translation cost and the need for a large set of potential sentences.
    We therefore, take the following leap: Instead of the selected the 300 sentences in each test set from an infinite set of test sentences, we draw them from the same set of 300 sentences with replacement.
    Let us clearly state this assumption: Assumption: Estimating the confidence interval from a large number of test sets with test sentences drawn from a set of test sentences with replacement is as good as estimating the confidence interval for test sets size from a large number of test sets with test sentences drawn from an infinite set of test sentences.
