 condition is weak; for instance, stopwords almost always have a translation on the other side, so if a few of the content For each candidate sentence pair, we need a reliable way of deciding whether the two sentences in the pair are mutual translations.
    This is achieved by a Maximum Entropy (ME) classifier (described at length in Section 3), which is the core component of our system.
    Those pairs that are classified as being translations of each other constitute the output of the system.
  
  
    In the Maximum Entropy (ME) statistical modeling framework, we impose constraints on the model of our data by defining a set of feature functions.
    These feature functions emphasize properties of the data that we believe to be useful for the modeling task.
    For example, for a sentence pair sp, the word overlap (the percentage of words in either sentence that have a translation in the other) might be a useful indicator of whether the sentences are parallel.
    We therefore define a feature function f (
