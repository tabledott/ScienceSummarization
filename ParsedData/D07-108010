			The reordering of hierarchical phrases is represented by using contextually dependent word pairs across their boundaries, as with the feature ((ei?1, f j?1), (ei, f j+1)) in Figure 1.
			3.2.2 Insertion Features The above features are insufficient to capture the translation because spurious words are sometimesinserted in the target side.
			Therefore, insertion fea tures are integrated in which no word alignment isassociated in the target.
			The inserted words are asso ciated with all the words in the source sentence, such as (ei+1, f1), ..., (ei+1, fJ) for the non-aligned word ei+1 with the source sentence f J1 in Figure 1.
			In the 1For simplicity, we show an example of phrase translation pairs, but it is trivial to define the features over hierarchical phrases.

			However, this would lead t
