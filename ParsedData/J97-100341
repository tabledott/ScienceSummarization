ithm is that it does not take advantage of, or discuss how to account for, the tendency for multiple simultaneous chains to occur over the same intention (each chain corresponds to one intention).
    Related to this is the fact that chains tend to overlap one another in long texts, as can be seen in Figure 2.
    These two types of difficulties can be circumvented by recasting the Morris algorithm to take advantage of the observations at the beginning of this section.
    Three changes are made to the algorithm: First, no thesaurus classes are used (only term repetition of morphological variants of the same word); second, multiple chains are allowed to span an intention; and third, chains at all levels of intentions are analyzed simultaneously.
    Instead of deciding which chain is the applicable one for a given intention, it measures how many chains at all levels are active at each sentence gap.
    This approach is illustrated in Figure 3(c).
    A lexical chain for term t is considered active across a se
