ndicate parts of the hierarchy that are not shown in the diagram).
    This is a possible cut for the object position of the verb eat, and the cut consists of the following classes: (life form), (solid), (fluid), (food), (artifact), (space), (time), (set).
    (The particular choice of classes for the cut in this example is not too important; the example is designed to show how probabilities of senses are estimated from class probabilities.)
    Since the class in the cut containing (pizza) is (food), the probability p((pizza)  |eat,obj) would be estimated as p((food)  |eat, obj)/|(food)|.
    Similarly, since the class in the cut containing (mushroom) is (life form), the probability p((mushroom)  |eat, obj) would be estimated as p((life form)  |eat, obj)/|(life form)|.
    The uniform-distribution assumption (20) means that cuts close to the root of the hierarchy result in a greater smoothing of the probability estimates than cuts near the leaves.
    Thus there is a trade-off between choosing a model that h
