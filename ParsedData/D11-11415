    The stateof-the-art Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) improves on the baseline, obtaining an accuracy of 0.8.

    First, due to unreliable capitalization, common nouns are often misclassified as proper nouns, and vice versa.
    Also, interjections and verbs are frequently misclassified as nouns.
