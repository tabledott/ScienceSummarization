probability is higher than the most probable correct derivation but which do not give the correct MR. Figure 5 shows an example of an in correct derivation.
			Here the function ?next to?is missing from the MR it produces.
			The following procedure is used to collect negative ex amples from incorrect derivations.
			The incorrectderivation and the most probable correct deriva tion are traversed simultaneously starting from the root using breadth-first traversal.
			The first nodes where their productions differ is detected, and all of the words covered by the these nodes (in bothderivations) are marked.
			In the correct and incorrect derivations shown in figures 3 and 5 respec tively, the first nodes where the productions differ are ?(STATE ? NEXT TO(STATE), [5..9])?
			and ?(STATE ? STATEID, [8..9])?.
			Hence, the union of words covered by them: 5 to 9 (?the states bordering Texas??), will be marked.
			For each of these marked words, the procedure considers all of the productions which cover it in the tw
