differences are statistically significant, we computed their differences in similarities to WordNet and Roget thesaurus for each individual entry.
    Table 2 shows the average and standard deviation of the average difference.
    Since the 95% confidence intervals of all the differences in Table 2 are on the positive side, one can draw the statistical conclusion that simis better than simHzndle, which is better than sinacosine.

    Reliable extraction of similar words from text corpus opens up many possibilities for future work.
    For example, one can go a step further by constructing a tree structure among the most similar words so that different senses of a given word can be identified with different subtrees.
    Let w1, , wr, be a list of words in descending o
