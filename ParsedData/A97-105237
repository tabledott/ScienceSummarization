but not agreement between the COMLEX and ANLT entries.
    Thus, both predict that seem will occur with a sentential complement and dummy subject, but only ANLT predicts the possibility of a `wh' complement and only COMLEX predicts the (optional) presence of a PP[to] argument with the sentential complement.
    One ANLT entry covers two COMLEX entries given the different treatment of the relevant complements but the classifier keeps them distinct.
    The corpus data for seem contains examples of further classes which we judge valid, in which seem can take a PP[tol and infinitive complement, as in he seems to me to be insane, and a passive participle, as in he seemed depressed.
    This comparison illustrates the problem of errors of omission common to computational lexicons constructed manually and also from machine-readable dictionaries.
    All classes for seem are exemplified in the corpus data, but for ask, for example, eight classes (out of a possible 27 in the merged entry) are not present, so comparis
