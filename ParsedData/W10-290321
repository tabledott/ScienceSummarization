ent in the domain to eliminate logical forms that are invalid in the Geoquery domain.
    For example, the function length only accepts river types as input.
    The set of constraints are: The flexibility of ILP has previously been advantageous in natural language processing tasks (Roth and Yih, 2007) as it allows us to easily incorporate such constraints.
    The inference problem defined in Equation (2) uses two feature functions: b1 and b2.
    First-order decision features b1 Determining if a logical symbol is aligned with a specific constituent depends mostly on lexical information.
    Following previous work (e.g., (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005)) we create a small lexicon, mapping logical symbols to surface forms.5 This lexicon is small and only used as a starting point.
    Existing approaches rely on annotated logical forms to extend the lexicon.
    However, in our setting we do not have access to annotated logical forms, instead we rely on external knowledge to supply further information.
    We
