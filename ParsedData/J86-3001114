vestigated are elaboration, summarization, enablement, justification, and challenge.
    Although the theories each identify different specific relations, they all use such relations as the basis for determining discourse structure.
    These rhetorical relations apply specifically to linguistic behavior and most of them implicitly incorporate intentions (e.g., the intention to summarize, the intention to justify).
    The intentions that typically serve as DP/DSPs in our theory are more basic than those that underlie such rhetorical relations in that they are not specialized for linguistic behavior; in many cases, their satisfaction can be realized by nonlinguistic actions as well as linguistic ones.
    The supports and generates relations that must sometimes be inferred to determine domination are also more basic than rhetorical relations; they are general relations that hold between propositions and actions.
    Hence, the inferring of relationships such as supports and generates is simpler than that of r
