    PropBank I (Palmer et al., 2005), developed at UPenn, captures predicate argument structure for verbs; NomBank provides predicate argument structure for nominalizations and other noun predicates (Meyers et al., 2004).
    PropBank II annotation (eventuality ID&#8217;s, coarse-grained sense tags, nominal coreference and selected discourse connectives) is being applied to a small (100K) parallel Chinese/English corpus (Babko-Malaya et al., 2004).
    The OntoNotes representation extends these annotations, and allows eventual inclusion of additional shallow semantic representations for other phenomena, including temporal and spatial relations, numerical expressions, deixis, etc.
    One of the principal aims of OntoNotes is to enable automated semantic analysis.
    The best current algorithm for semantic role labeling for PropBank style annotation (Pradhan et al., 2005) achieves an F-measure of 81.0 using an SVM.
    OntoNotes will provide a large amount of new train
