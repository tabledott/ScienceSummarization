rames, using glosses to name potential slots.
    We differ in that we attempt to learn frame-like narrative structure from untagged newspaper text.
    Most similar to us, Alishahi and Stevenson (2007) learn verb specific semantic profiles of arguments using WordNet classes to define the roles.
    We learn situation-specific classes of roles shared by multiple verbs.
    Thus, two open goals in role learning include (1) unsupervised learning and (2) learning the roles themselves rather than relying on pre-defined role classes.
    As just described, Chambers and Jurafsky (2008) offers an unsupervised approach to event learning (goal 1), but lacks semantic role knowledge (goal 2).
    The following sections describe a model that addresses both goals.
  
  
    The next sections introduce typed narrative chains and chain merging, extensions that allow us to jointly learn argument roles with event structure.
    The first step in describing a narrative schema is to extend the definition of a narrative chain to
