f the Algorithm As does the Earley-based generator, the new algorithm assumes that the grammar is a unificationbased or logic grammar with a phrase-structure backbone and complex nonterminals.
    Furthermore, and again consistent with previous work, we assume that the nonterminals associate to the phrases they describe logical expressions encoding their possible meanings.
    We will describe the algorithm in terms of an implementation of it for definite-clause grammars (DCG), although we beI Martin Kay (personal communication) has developed a parsing algorithm that seems to be the parsing correlate to the generation algorithm presented here.
    Its existence might point the way towards a uniform architecture. lieve the underlying method to be more broadly applicable.
    A variant of our method is used in Van Noord's BUG (Bottom-Up Generator) system, part of MiMo2, an experimental machine translation system for translating international news items of Teletext, which uses a Prolog version of PATR-II similar
