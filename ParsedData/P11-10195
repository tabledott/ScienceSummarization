ditional advantage that it may not require retraining for new prompts or tasks.
    As far as we know, this is the first application of a rank preference model to automated assessment (hereafter AA).
    In this paper, we report experiments on rank preference Support Vector Machines (SVMs) trained on a relatively small amount of data, on identification of appropriate feature types derived automatically from generic text processing tools, on comparison with a regression SVM model, and on the robustness of the best model to &#8216;outlier&#8217; texts.
    We report a consistent, comparable and replicable set of results based entirely on the new dataset and on public-domain tools and data, whilst also experimentally motivating some novel feature types for the AA task, thus extending the work described in (Briscoe et al., 2010).
    In the following sections we describe in more detail the dataset used for training and testing, the system developed, the evaluation methodology, as well as ablation experiments aime
