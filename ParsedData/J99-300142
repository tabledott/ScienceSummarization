et of discourse entities in the set of evoked discourse entities in 111 the set of unused discourse entities in Ul FAante the set of antecedents of functional anaphors in 1/1 FA the set of functional anaphors in LI, BNA the set of anchored brand-new discourse entities in LI, Extended functional ranking constraints on the Cf list.
    For any two discourse entities (x, posx) and (y, posy), with x and y denoting the linguistic surface expression of those entities as they occur in the discourse, and posx and posy indicating their respective text position, posx posy, in Table 11 we define the extended functional ordering constraints on elements in the forward-looking centers Cf(Llt).
    In the following, for any utterance 1.11, the ordering of discourse entities in the Cf(u) that can be derived from the above definitions and the ordering constraints (1) to (3) are denoted by the relation &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;.
    Ordering constraint (1) characterizes the basic relation for the overall ranking of the elements in
