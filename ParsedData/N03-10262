 In the approach of Witbrock and Mittal (1999), selection and ordering of summary terms is based on bagof-words models and n-grams.
    Such models may well produce summaries that are indicative of the original&#8217;s content; however, n-gram models seem to be insufficient to guarantee grammatical well-formedness of the system output.
    To overcome this problem, linguistic parsing and generation systems are used in the sentence condensation approaches of Knight and Marcu (2000) and Jing (2000).
    In these approaches, decisions about which material to include/delete in the sentence summaries do not rely on relative frequency information on words, but rather on probability models of subtree deletions that are learned from a corpus of parses for sentences and their summaries.
    A related area where linguistic parsing systems have been applied successfully is sentence simplification.
    Grefenstette (1998) presented a sentence reduction method that is based on finite-state technology for linguistic markup
