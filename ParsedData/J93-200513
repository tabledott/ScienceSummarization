This provides us with a semantic representation that can capture the multiple perspectives a single lexical item may assume in different contexts.
    Yet, the qualia for a lexical item such as tape are not isolated values for that one word, but are integrated into a global knowledge base indicating how these senses relate to other lexical items and their senses.
    This is the contribution of inheritance and the hierarchical structuring of knowledge (cf.
    Evans and Gazdar 1990; Copestake and Briscoe 1992; Russell et al. 1992).
    In Pustejovsky (1991) it is suggested that there are two types of relational structures for lexical knowledge; a fixed inheritance similar to that of an is-a hierarchy (cf.
    Touretzky 1986); and a dynamic structure that operates generatively from the qualia structure of a lexical item to create a relational structure for ad hoc categories.'
    Reviewing briefly, the basic idea is that semantics allows for the dynamic creation of arbitrary concepts through the application of
