theses that are inconsistent with given constraints.
    Any entries in the dynamic programming table corresponding to illegal subhypotheses&#8212;i.e., those that would violate the given bracket-nesting or word alignment conditions&#8212;are preassigned negative infinity values during initialization indicating impossibility.
    During the recursion phase, computation of these entries is skipped.
    Since their probabilities remain impossible throughout, the illegal subhypotheses will never participate in any ML bibracketing.
    The running time reduction in this case depends heavily on the domain constraints.
    We have found this strategy to be useful for incorporating punctuation constraints.
    Certain punctuation characters give constituency indications with high reliability; &amp;quot;perfect separators&amp;quot; include colons and Chinese full stops, while &amp;quot;perfect delimiters&amp;quot; include parentheses and quotation marks.
  
  
    It is possible to construct a parser that accepts unr
