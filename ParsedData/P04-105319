n in the COM-COM domain.
    However, the graphs in both domains were similar, in particular when the cosine similarity was under 0.2.
    We would like to discuss the differences between the two domains and the following aspects of our unsupervised method for discovering the relations: properties of relations appropriate context word length selecting best clustering method covering less frequent pairs We address each of these points in turn.
    We found that the COM-COM domain was more difficult to judge than the PER-GPE domain due to the similarities of relations.
    For example, the pair of companies in M&amp;A relation might also subsequently appear in the parent relation.
    Asymmetric properties caused additional difficulties in the COM-COM domain, because most relations have directions.
    We have to recognize the direction of relations, vs. , to distinguish, for example, &#8220;A is parent company of B&#8221; and &#8220;B is parent company of A&#8221;.
    In determining the similarities between t
