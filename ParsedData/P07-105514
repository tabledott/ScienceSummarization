re weights will be learned using large-margin techniques that are well known to be robust to large and sparse feature representations.
    Let Y = Y(d) x Y(s)n be the set of all valid sentence-document labelings for an input s. The weights, w, are set using the MIRA learning algorithm, which is an inference based online largemargin learning technique (Crammer and Singer, 2003; McDonald et al., 2005).
    An advantage of this algorithm is that it relies only on inference to learn the weight vector (see Section 2.1.1).
    MIRA has been shown to provide state-of-the-art accuracy for many language processing tasks including parsing, chunking and entity extraction (McDonald, 2006).
    The basic algorithm is outlined in Figure 3.
    The algorithm works by considering a single training instance during each iteration.
    The weight vector w is updated in line 4 through a quadratic programming problem.
    This update modifies the weight vector so a margin proportional to the loss.
    The constraint set C can be
