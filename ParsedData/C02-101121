vs. Non-web Data.
			To test the effectiveness of the use of web data, we conducted another experiment in which we performed translation by using non-web data.
			The data comprised of the Wall Street Journal corpus in English (1987-1992, 500MB) and the People?s Daily corpus in Chinese (1982-1998, 700MB).
			We followed the Back-off strategy as in Section 4.3 to translate the 1000 Base NPs.
			Table 5.

			For Nagata et al?s method, we found that it was almost impossible to find partial-parallel corpora in the non-web data.
