    Each of the samples was first compared to a translation lexicon extracted from a machine-readable bilingual dictionary (Cousin et al. 1991).
    All the entries in the sample that appeared in the dictionary were assumed to be correct.
    I checked the remaining entries in all the samples by hand.
    To account for context-dependent translational equivalence, I evaluated the accuracy of the translation lexicons in the context of the bitext whence they were extracted, using a simple bilingual concordancer.
    A lexicon entry (u,v) was considered correct if u and v ever appeared as direct translations of each other in an aligned segment pair.
    That is, a link type was considered correct if any of its tokens were correct.
    Direct translations come in different flavors.
    Most entries that I checked by hand were of the plain vanilla variety that you might find in a bilingual dictionary (entry type V).
    However, a significant number of words translated into a different part of speech (entry type
