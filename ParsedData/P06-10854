ncies, respectively.
    We use Gibbs sampling to sample from the posterior distribution of possible segmentations under these models.
    The plan of the paper is as follows.
    In the next section, we describe MBDP and NGS in detail.
    In Section 3 we present the unigram version of our own model, the Gibbs sampling procedure we use for inference, and experimental results.
    Section 4 extends that model to incorporate bigram dependencies, and Section 5 concludes the paper.
  
  
    The NGS and MBDP systems are similar in some ways: both are designed to find utterance boundaries in a corpus of phonemically transcribed utterances, with known utterance boundaries.
    Both also use approximate online search procedures, choosing and fixing a segmentation for each utterance before moving onto the next.
    In this section, we focus on the very different probabilistic models underlying the two systems.
    We show that the optimal solution under the NGS model is the unsegmented corpus, and suggest that this
