acy indicates how much of the meaning expressed in the reference translation is also expressed in a hypothesis translation: The second five point scale indicates how fluent the translation is.
    When translating into English the values correspond to: Separate scales for fluency and adequacy were developed under the assumption that a translation might be disfluent but contain all the information from the source.
    However, in principle it seems that people have a hard time separating these two aspects of translation.
    The high correlation between people&#8217;s fluency and adequacy scores (given in Tables 17 and 18) indicate that the distinction might be false.
    Figure 2: In constituent-based evaluation, the source sentence was parsed, and automatically aligned with the reference translation and systems&#8217; translations Another problem with the scores is that there are no clear guidelines on how to assign values to translations.
    No instructions are given to evaluators in terms of how to quanti
