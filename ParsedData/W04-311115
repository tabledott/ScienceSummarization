s One major area of concern is the possibility of entities that contain more than one syntactic constituent and do not match any node in the syntax tree.
    For example, as discussed in Section 2, a variation event includes material on a variation&#8217;s type, location, and state, and can cut not only across constituents, but even sentences and paragraphs.
    A simple example is point mutations at codon 12, containing both the nominal (the type of mutation) and following NP (the location).
    Note that while in isolation this could also be considered one syntactic constituent, the NP and PP together, the actual context is ...point mutations at codon 12 in duodenal lavage fluid....
    Since all PPs are attached at the same level, at codon 12 and in duodenal lavage fluid are sisters, and so there is no constituent consisting ofjust point mutations at codon 12.
    Casting the variation event as a relation between different component entities allows the component entities to correspond to tree constituents,
