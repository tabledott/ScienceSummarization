 our algorithm.
    The input consists of an MLN without weights and the QLFs for the training sentences.
    Two operators are used for updating semantic parses.
    The first is to merge two clusters, denoted by MERGE(C1, C2) for clusters C1, C2, which does the following: and there is the local normalization constraint Ef ewc,f = 1.
    The optimal weights wc,f are easily derived by solving this constrained optimization problem.
    Here, merging two argument types refers to pooling their argument forms to create a new argument type.
    Enumerating all possible ways of creating new argument types is intractable.
    USP approximates it by considering one type at a time and either creating a new type for it or merging it to types already considered, whichever maximizes the loglikelihood.
    The types are considered in decreasing order of their numbers of occurrences so that more information is available for each decision.
    MERGE clusters syntactically different expressions whose meanings appear to be th
