proximation algorithm that bounds the time complexity of pairwise thesaurus extraction.
    This results in a significant reduction in runtime with only a marginal performance penalty in our experiments.
  
  
    Vector-space thesaurus extraction systems can be separated into two components.
    The first component extracts the contexts from raw text and compiles them into a statistical description of the contexts each potential thesaurus term appears in.
    Some systems define the context as a window of words surrounding each thesaurus term (McDonald, 2000).
    Many systems extract grammatical relations using either a broad coverage parser (Lin, 1998a) or shallow statistical tools (Grefenstette, 1994; Curran and Moens, 2002).
    Our experiments use a shallow relation extractor based on (Grefenstette, 1994).
    We define a context relation instance as a tuple (w, r, w') where w is the thesaurus term, which occurs in some grammatical relation r with another word w' in the sentence.
    We refer to the tup
