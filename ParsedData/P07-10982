ation extraction (Zelenko et al., 2003; Moschitti, 2006).
    In more complex tasks such as computing the relatedness between questions and answers in answer re-ranking, to our knowledge no study uses kernel functions to encode syntactic information.
    Moreover, the study of shallow semantic information such as predicate argument structures annotated in the PropBank (PB) project (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) (www.cis.upenn.edu/&#8764;ace) is a promising research direction.
    We argue that semantic structures can be used to characterize the relation between a question and a candidate answer.
    In this paper, we extensively study new structural representations, encoding parse trees, bag-of-words, POS tags and predicate argument structures (PASs) for question classification and answer re-ranking.
    We define new tree representations for both simple and nested PASs, i.e.
    PASs whose arguments are other predicates (Section 2).
    Moreover, we define new kernel functions to exploit PASs, which we automat
