ion from the sentences.
    For the discriminative model this did not affect results significantly but improved them slightly in most cases.
    We found that the generative model gets confused by punctuation and tends to predict that periods at the end of sentences are the parents of words in the sentence.
    Our basic model uses constraints of the form: the expected proportion of conserved edges in a sentence pair is at least q = 90%.1 We call the generic model described above &#8220;norules&#8221; to distinguish it from the language-specific constraints we introduce in the sequel.
    The no rules columns of Table 2 summarize the performance in this basic setting.
    Discriminative models outperform the generative models in the majority of cases.
    The left panel of Table 3 shows the most common errors by child POS tag, as well as by true parent and guessed parent POS tag.
    Figure 2 shows that the discriminative model continues to improve with more transfer-type data 1We chose rl in the following wa
