anslation (Huang, Son-Bell, and Baggett 1994) and building pronunciation networks for speech recognition.
    Recently, a method has been proposed for using part-of-speech tagging techniques as a method for parsing with lexicalized grammars (Joshi and Srinivas 1994).
    When automated part-of-speech tagging was initially explored (Klein and Simmons 1963; Harris 1962), people manually engineered rules for tagging, sometimes with the aid of a corpus.
    As large corpora became available, it became clear that simple Markov-model based stochastic taggers that were automatically trained could achieve high rates of tagging accuracy (Jelinek 1985).
    Markov-model based taggers assign to a sentence the tag sequence that maximizes Prob(word J tag)*Prob(tag I previous n tags).
    These probabilities can be estimated directly from a manually tagged corpus.'
    These stochastic taggers have a number of advantages over the manually built taggers, including obviating the need for laborious manual rule construction, a
