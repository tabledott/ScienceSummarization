 s25(r) of the 25 most preferred potential headwords of roles r, showing the average size of the intersection s25(r) fl s25(r') between two roles (preferences computed with uniform weights).
    It indicates another possible reason for Cosine&#8217;s problem: Cosine seems to keep proposing the same words as similar for different roles.
    We will see this tendency also in the sample results we discuss next.
    Sample results.
    Table 6 shows samples of headwords induced by the similarity-based model for two FrameNet senses of the verb &#8220;take&#8221;: Ride vehicle (&#8220;take the bus&amp;quot;) and Ingest substance (&#8220;take drugs&#8221;), a semantic class that is exclusively about ingesting controlled substances.
    The semantic role Vehicle of the Ride vehicle frame and the role Substance of Ingest substance are both typically realized as the direct object of &#8220;take&#8221;.
    The table only shows new induced headwords; seen headwords were omitted from the list.
