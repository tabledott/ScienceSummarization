			A problem with our algorithm is how to determine whether an entity pair belongs to the ?predi cate-linked?
			category.
			In this paper, a simple method is applied by regarding the ?predicate linked?
			category as the default category.
			That is, those entity pairs, which do not belong to the four well defined and easily detected categories (i.e. embedded, PP-liked, semi-structured and descriptive), are classified into the ?predicate-linked?
			cate gory.
