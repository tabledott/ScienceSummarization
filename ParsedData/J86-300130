ate of focusing when discourse segment DS2 is being processed.
    Segment DS1 gave rise to FS1 and had as its discourse purpose DSPi.
    The properties, objects, relations, and purpose represented in FS1 are accessible but less salient than those in FS2.
    DS2 yields a focus space that is stacked relative to FS1 because DSP, of DS1 dominates DS2's DSP, DSP2.
    As a result of the relationship between FS1 and FS2, reduced noun phrases will be interpreted differently in DS2 than in DS1.
    For example, if some red balls exist in the world one of which is represented in DS2 and another in FS1, then the red ball used in DS2 will be understood to mean the particular red ball that is represented in DS2.
    If, however, there is also a green truck (in the world) and it is represented only in FS1, the green truck uttered in DS2 will be understood as referring to that green truck.
    Part two of Figure 1 shows the state of focusing when segment DS3 is being processed.
    FS2 has been popped from the stack and
