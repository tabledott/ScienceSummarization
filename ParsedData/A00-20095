 smoothed by assigning them a very small default probability.
    Once all the parameters have been estimated, the model has been trained and can be used as a classifier to perform disambiguation by determining the most probable sense for an ambiguous word, given the context in which it occurs.
    The contextual features used in this paper are binary and indicate if a given word occurs within some number of words to the left or right of the ambiguous word.
    No additional positional information is contained in these features; they simply indicate if the word occurs within some number of surrounding words.
    Punctuation and capitalization are removed from the windows of context.
    All other lexical items are included in their original form; no stemming is performed and non-content words remain.
    This representation of context is a variation on the bag-of-words feature set, where a single window of context includes words that occur to both the left and right of the ambiguous word.
