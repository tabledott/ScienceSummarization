 2003; Minton, Ticrea, and Beach 2003) for crawling.
    The tool can be programmed to automatically initiate searches with different parameters and to identify and extract the desired article URLs (as well as other information such as dates and titles) from the result pages.
    Table 5 shows the sources, time periods, and size of the datasets that we downloaded.
    For the extraction experiments, we used dictionaries of high coverage, learned from all our available parallel training data.
    The sizes of these training corpora, measured in number of English tokens, are as follows: We applied our extraction method on both the LDC-released Gigaword corpora and the Web-downloaded comparable corpora.
    For each language pair, we used the highest precision classifier from those presented in Section 3.4.
    In order to obtain data of higher quality, we didn&#8217;t use all the sentences classified as parallel, but only those for which the probability computed by our classifier was higher than 0.70.
