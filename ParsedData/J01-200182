ny stems must occur in order for the data to be strong enough to support the existence of a linguistically real signature.
    MDL provides a simple but not altogether satisfactory method of achieving this end.
    Using MDL for this task amounts to determining whether the total description length decreases when a signature is eliminated by taking all of its words and eliminating their morphological structure, and reanalyzing the words as morphologically simple (i.e., as having no morphological structure).
    This is how we have implemented it, in any event; one could well imagine a variant under which some or all subparts of the signature that comprised other signatures were made part of those other signatures.
    For example, the signature NULLinely is motivated just for the stem just.
    Under the former triage criterion, Justine and justly would be treated as unanalyzed words, whereas under the latter, just and justly would be made members of the (large) NULL.ly signature, and just and justine might ad
