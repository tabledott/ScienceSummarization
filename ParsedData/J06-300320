sun) and mass(planet), and various relations, such as revolve(planet, sun) and attracts(sun, planet).
    Likewise, the nucleus and the electrons have attributes, such as charge(electron) and charge(nucleus), and relations, such as revolve(electron, nucleus) and attracts(nucleus, electron).
    SME maps revolve(planet, sun) to revolve(electron, nucleus) and attracts(sun, planet) to attracts(nucleus, electron).
    Each individual connection (e.g., from revolve(planet, sun) to revolve(electron, nucleus)) in an analogical mapping implies that the connected relations are similar; thus, SMT requires a measure of relational similarity in order to form maps.
    Early versions of SME only mapped identical relations, but later versions of SME allowed similar, nonidentical relations to match (Falkenhainer 1990).
    However, the focus of research in analogy making has been on the mapping process as a whole, rather than measuring the similarity between any two particular relations; hence, the similarity measures used
