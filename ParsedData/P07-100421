e-aligned with each other and all translate into the same target language.
    One language pair creates data for another language pair and can be naturally used in a (Blum and Mitchell, 1998)-style co-training algorithm.
    Experiments on the EuroParl corpus show a decrease in WER.
    However, the selection algorithm applied there is actually supervised because it takes the reference translation into account.
    Moreover, when the algorithm is run long enough, large amounts of co-trained data injected too much noise and performance degraded.
    Self-training for SMT was proposed in (Ueffing, 2006).
    An existing SMT system is used to translate the development or test corpus.
    Among the generated machine translations, the reliable ones are automatically identified using thresholding on confidence scores.
    The work which we presented here differs from (Ueffing, 2006) as follows: fidence estimation used there, we applied importance sampling and combined it with confidence estimation for transductive
