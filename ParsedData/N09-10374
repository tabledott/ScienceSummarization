spans in the parse tree.
    For named entities, the joint model should help with boundaries.
    The internal structure of the named entity, and the structural context in which it appears, can also help with determining the type of entity.
    Finding the best parse for a sentence can be helped by the named entity information in similar ways.
    Because named entities should correspond to phrases, information about them should lead to better bracketing.
    Also, knowing that a phrase is a named entity, and the type of entity, may help in getting the structural context, and internal structure, of that entity correct.
    After modifying the OntoNotes dataset to ensure consistency, which we will discuss in Section 4, we augment the parse tree with named entity information, for input to our learning algorithm.
    In the cases where a named entity corresponds to multiple contiguous children of a subtree, we add a new NamedEntity node, which is the new parent to those children.
    Now, all named entities corr
