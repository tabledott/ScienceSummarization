Thus the algorithm appears to have discovered an analogical mapping between Buddhist schools and traditions and Christian schools and traditions.
    This is interesting work, but it is not directly applicable to SAT analogies, because it discovers analogies between clusters of words rather than individual words.

    Moldovan et al. (2004) argue that semantic roles are merely a special case of semantic relations (Section 3.4), since semantic roles always involve verbs or pr
