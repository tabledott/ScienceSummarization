  SAlthough the constnlction of the full size database is not feasible for us, it is clearly feasible for a large scale project.
  This is shown by a similar database that w~s implemented as part of the laslgllage model of the IBM speech recognition system.
  3?his database contalns counters for occurrences of sequences of three words in lmge corpora (trigrams), which arc much more numerous than our syntactic patterns.
  In a general perspective, this project promotes the use of a large corpus for linguistic research and ap- plications.
  Processing such large corpora is a non- trivial engineering problem, the solution of which enables research to focus on complicated real world sentences.
  Our research demonstrates how statisti- cal methods can be built on top of more traditional linguistic tools, achieving a better and more feasible environment for the resolution of ambiguities.
