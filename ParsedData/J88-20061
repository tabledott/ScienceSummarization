 the discourse that the listener is constructing; 2.
    The particular entity specified depends on another entity in that part of the evolving &amp;quot;discourse model&amp;quot; that the listener is currently attending to.
    Such expressions have been called anaphors.
    I show how tensed clauses share these characteristics, usually just attributed to anaphoric noun phrases.
    This not only allows us to capture in a simple way the oft-stated but difficult-to-prove intuition that tense is anaphoric, but also contributes to our knowledge of what is needed for understanding narrative text.
  
  
    In this paper, I consider a range of English expressions and show that their context-dependency can be characterized in terms of two properties: entity in that part of the evolving &amp;quot;discourse model&amp;quot; that the listener is currently attending to.
    Two types of expressions have previously been described in these terms: definite pronouns and certain definite noun phrases (NPs).
