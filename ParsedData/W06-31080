  Discriminative Reordering Models For Statistical Machine Translation
  
    We present discriminative reordering models for phrase-based statistical machine translation.
    The models are trained using the maximum entropy principle.
    We use several types of features: based on words, based on word classes, based on the local context.
    We evaluate the overall performance of the reordering models as well as the contribution of the individual feature types on a word-aligned corpus.
    Additionally, we show improved translation performance using these reordering models compared to a state-of-the-art baseline system.
  
  
    In recent evaluations, phrase-based statistical machine translation systems have achieved good performance.
    Still the fluency of the machine translation output leaves much to desire.
    One reason is that most phrase-based systems use a very simple reordering model.
    Usually, the costs for phrase movements are linear in the distance, e.g. see (Och et al., 1999; Koehn, 2004;
