t mentions of words in a subjectivity lexicon, seems to be more robust to translation, further resulting in better classification results.

    The English side was annotated using the Opinion Finder tool, and the subjectivity labels were projected on the Romanian text.
    A Naive Bayes classifier was then trained on t
