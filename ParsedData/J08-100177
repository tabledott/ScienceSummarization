 our goal was to replicate Schwarm and Ostendorf&#8217;s system as closely as possible, we followed their choice of support vector machines (SVMs) (Joachims 1998b) for our classification experiments.
    Our training sample therefore consisted of n documents such that (&#65533;x1,y1),---, (4,yn) xi E R',yi E {&#8722;1,+1} where xi is a feature vector for the ith document in the training sample and yi its (positive or negative) class label.
    In the basic SVM framework, we try to separate the positive and negative instances by a hyperplane.
    This means that there is a weight Also spelled Valletta, seaport and capital of Malta, on the northeast coast of the island.
    The nucleus of the city is built on the promontory of Mount Sceberras that runs like a tongue into the middle of a bay, which it thus divides into two harbours, Grand Harbour to the east and Marsamxett (Marsamuscetto) Harbour to the west.
