  The Generative Lexicon
  
    In this paper, I will discuss four major topics relating to current research in lexical semantics: methodology, descriptive coverage, adequacy of the representation, and the computational usefulness of representations.
    In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues.
    Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon.
    I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is perthan assuming a fixed set of primitives, I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions.
    I develop theory of Structure, representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the
