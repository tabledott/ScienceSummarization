ed arrays represent the subkinds of each kind of mapping.
    Five-column arrays are for the five network paths; seven-column arrays are for the seven types of cell match.
    Each column contains a positive number that shows the number of occurrences of a particular network path or cell match.
    The fourth component of CS is the process of screening.
    During analysis of a sentence constituent, a semantic vector is created for every pairwise combination of word senses.
    These word sense combinations are called semantic readings or simply &amp;quot;readings.&amp;quot; Each reading has an associated semantic vector.
    Screening chooses between two semantic vectors and hence their attached semantic readings.
    Rank orderings among semantic relations are applied.
    In the event of a tie, a measure of conceptual similarity is used.
    The ranking of semantic relations aims to achieve the most coherent possible interpretation of a reading.
    The class of preference-based semantic relations takes pr
