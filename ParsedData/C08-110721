			5.1 Results.
			In this section we focus on the best performing variations of each algorithm type: binary DIRT, unary DIRT, unary Weeds Harmonic, BInc and Derived-Avg.
			We omitted the results of methods that were clearly inferior to others: (a) WeedsA, WeedsD and Weeds-Precision did not increase 3 http://about.reuters.com/researchandstandards/corpus/ 853Recall over not using rules because rules with in frequent templates scored highest and arithmetic averaging could not balance well these high scores; (b) out of the methods for deriving unary rules from binary rule-bases, Derived-Avg performed best; (c) filtering with (the directional) LEDIR did not improve the performance of unary DIRT.
			Figure 1 presents Recall, Precision and F1 of themethods for different cutoff points.
			First, we observe that even when matching only the seed tem plates (K=0), unary seeds outperform the binary seeds in terms of both Precision and Recall.
			This surprising behavior is consistent
