nimum-weighted set of insertions, substitutions, and deletions required to transform one word into another.
    For example, only a single deletion is required to transform &#8220;rates&#8221; into &#8220;rate&#8221; whereas two substitutions and an insertion are required to transform it into &#8220;rating.&#8221; Effectively, if Cost(-) is transforming cost, Cost(rates&#8212;rate) = Cost(s&#8212;e) whereas Cost(rates&#8212;rating)=Cost(es&#8212;ing).
    More generally, suppose word X has circumfix C1=B1/E1 and pseudo-stem -S-, and word Y has circumfix C2 =B2/E2 also with pseudo-stem -S-.
    Then, Cost(X&#8212;Y)=Cost(B1SE1&#8212;B2SE2)=Cost(C 1 &#8212;C 2).
    Since we are free to choose whatever cost function we desire, we can equally choose one whose range lies in the interval of [0,1].
    Hence, we can assign Consider Table 2 which is a sample of PPMVs Prorth(X&lt;Y) = 1-Cost(X&lt;Y).
    This calculation implies from the ruleset for &#8220;-s&lt;L&#8221; along with their that the orthographic probabi
