that this combination is a way of making the best out of both algorithms.
    The addition of these modifications changes the quantitative results.
    See the Figure 5.
    However, the statistical analyses still show that there is no significant difference in the performance of the algorithms in general.
    It is also still the case that the performance of each algorithm significantly varies depending on the data.
    The only significant difference as a result of the modifications is that the BFP algorithm now performs significantly better on the pump dialogues alone (x2 = 4.31,p &lt; .05).
  
  
    We can benefit in two ways from performing such evaluations: (a) we get general results on a methodology for doing evaluation, (b) we discover ways we can improve current theories.
    A split of evaluation efforts into quantitative versus qualitative is incoherent.
    We cannot trust the results of a quantitative evaluation without doing a considerable amount of qualitative analyses and we should perform ou
