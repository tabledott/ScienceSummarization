el, and Warwick 1989; Gale and Church 1991; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Chen 1993), even for languages as disparate as Chinese and English (Wu 1994).
    Algorithms for subsentential alignment have been developed as well as granularities of the character (Church 1993), word (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and Church 1994; Fung and McKeown 1994), collocation (Smadja 1992), and specially segmented (Kupiec 1993) levels.
    However, the identification of subsentential, nested, phrasal translations within the parallel texts remains a nontrivial problem, due to the added complexity of dealing with constituent structure.
    Manual phrasal matching is feasible only for small corpora, either for toy-prototype testing or for narrowly restricted applications.
    Automatic approaches to identification of subsentential translation units have largely followed what we might call a &amp;quot;parse-parse-match&amp;quot; procedure.
    Each half of the parallel corpus is first parsed individually using a monolingual gr
