oduce local grammar transducers that can be used to disambiguate sentences.
    The number of local grammars for a given language and even for a specific domain can be large.
    The local grammar transducers are mostly p-subsequential.
    Determinization and minimization can then be used to make the use of local grammar transducers more time efficient and to reduce their size.
    Since p-subsequential transducers are closed under composition, the result of the composition of all local grammar transducers is a p-subsequential transducer.
    The equivalence of local grammars can also be tested using the equivalence algorithm for sequential transducers.
    For a more detailed overview of the applications of sequential string to string transducers to language processing, see Mohri (1996a).
    Because they are so time and space efficient, sequential transducers will likely be used increasingly often in natural language processing as well as in other connected fields.
    In the following, we consider the cas
