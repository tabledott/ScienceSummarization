    One of the authors then assessed each token's prosodic characteristics, as described in Section 4.
    In examining our classification judgments, we were interested in areas of disagreement as well as agreement.
    The set of tokens whose classification we both agreed upon and found unambiguous provided a testbed for our investigation of the intonational features marking discourse and sentential interpretation.
    We examined the set of tokens one or both of us found ambiguous to determine how intonation might in fact have contributed to that ambiguity.
    Table 6 presents the distribution of our judgments, where classifiable includes those tokens we both assigned either discourse or sentential, ambiguous identifies those we both were unable to classify, partial disagreement includes those only one of us was able to classify, and complete disagreement represents those tokens one
