l as the harmful ones (most everything else).
    Finally, we demonstrate that interpolation of the two estimates can provide a modest increase in BLEU score over the heuristic baseline.
  
  
    The generative model defined below is evaluated based on the BLEU score it produces in an endto-end machine translation system from English to French.
    The top-performing diag-and extraction heuristic (Zens et al., 2002) serves as the baseline for evaluation.1 Each approach &#8211; the generative model and heuristic baseline &#8211; produces an estimated conditional distribution of English phrases given French phrases.
    We will refer to the distribution derived from the baseline heuristic as &#966;H.
    The distribution learned via the generative model, denoted &#966;EM, is described in detail below.
    While our model for computing &#966;EM is novel, it is meant to exemplify a class of models that are not only clear extensions to generative word alignment models, but also compatible with the statistical fra
