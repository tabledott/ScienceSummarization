is to integrate boundary identification with role labeling, allowing the FEG priors and the role-labeling decisions to affect which constituents are frame elements.
    This was accomplished by extending the formulation where fei is a binary variable indicating that a constituent is a frame element and P(fei  |fi) is calculated as above.
    When fei is true, role probabilities are calculated as before; when fei is false, ri assumes an empty role with probability one and is not included in the FEG represented by fr1...nj.
    One caveat in using this integrated approach is its exponential complexity: each combination of role assignments to constituents is considered, and the number of combinations is exponential in the number of constituents.
    Although this did not pose a problem when only the annotated frame elements were under consideration, now we Two subcategorizations for the target word open.
