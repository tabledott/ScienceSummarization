 method, factors that influence the choice of a debate side are learned by mining a web corpus for opinions.
    This knowledge is exploited in an unsupervised method for classifying the side taken by a post, which also accounts for concessionary opinions.
    Our results corroborate our hypothesis that finding relations between aspects associated with a topic, but particularized to polarity, is more effective than finding relations between topics and aspects alone.
    The system that implements this information, mined from the web, outperforms the web PMI-based baseline.
    Our hypothesis that addressing concessionary opinions is useful is also corroborated by improved performance.
