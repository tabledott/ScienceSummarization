 semantic similarity of words, to our knowledge the application of these word-oriented methods to text similarity has not been yet explored.
    We introduce an algorithm that combines the word-to-word similarity metrics into a text-to-text semantic similarity metric, and we show that this method outperforms the simpler lexical matching similarity approach, as measured in a paraphrase identification application.
  
  
    Given two input text segments, we want to automatically derive a score that indicates their similarity at semantic level, thus going beyond the simple lexical matching methods traditionally used for this task.
    Although we acknowledge the fact that a comprehensive metric of text semantic similarity should take into account the relations between words, as well as the role played by the various entities involved in the interactions described by each of the two texts, we take a first rough cut at this problem and attempt to model the semantic similarity of texts as a function of the semantic
