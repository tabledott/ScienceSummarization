ting used in our experiments (&#945; = 10&#8722;6), only 0.34% of possible dependencies are considered by the TAG-based model, but 99% of all correct dependencies are included.
    At this beam size the best possible F1 constituent score is 98.5.
    Tighter beams lead to faster parsing times, with slight drops in accuracy.
  
  
    We have described an efficient and accurate parser for constituent parsing.
    A key to the approach has been to use a splittable grammar that allows efficient dynamic programming algorithms, in combination with pruning using a lower-order model.
    The method allows relatively easy incorporation of features; future work should leverage this in producing more accurate parsers, and in applying the parser to different languages or domains.
