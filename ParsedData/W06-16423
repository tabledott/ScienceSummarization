e polar atom (5) specified the positive polarity of the verb kukkiri-suru.
    This atom can be generally used for this verb regardless of its arguments.
    In the polar atom (6), on the other hand, the nominative case of the verb tsuku (&#8216;have&#8217;) is limited to a specific noun zuumu (&#8216;zoom lens&#8217;), since the verb tsuku does not hold the polarity in itself.
    The automatic decision for the scopes of the atoms is one of the major issues.
    For lexical learning from unannotated corpora, our method uses context coherency in terms of polarity, an assumption that polar clauses with the same polarity appear successively unless the context is changed with adversative expressions.
    Exploiting this tendency, we can collect candidate polar atoms with their tentative polarities as those adjacent to the polar clauses which have been identified by their domain-independent polar atoms in the initial lexicon.
    We use both intrasentential and inter-sentential contexts to obtain more candidate p
