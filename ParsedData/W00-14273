than one possible surface word form given a particular inflectional type and PoS label.
    The generator is packaged up as a Unix 'filter', making it easy to integrate into applications.
    It is based on efficient finite-state techniques, and is implemented using the widely available Unix Flex utility (a reimplementation of the AT&amp;T Unix Lex tool) (Levine et al., 1992).
    The generator is freely available to the NLG research community (see Section 5 below).
    The paper is structured as follows.
    Section 2 describes the morphological generator and evaluates its accuracy.
    Section 3 outlines how the generator is put to .use in a prototype system for automatic simplification of text, and discusses a number of practical morphological and orthographic issues that we have encountered.
    Section 4 relates our work to that of others, and we conclude (Section 5) with directions for future work.
  
  
    The morphological generator covers the productive English affixes s for the plural form of nouns
