    We use the term cooccurrence pair, written as (x, y), to denote a cooccurrence of two words in a sentence within a distance of no more than d words.
    When computing the distance d, we ignore function words such as prepositions and determiners.
    In the experiments reported here d = 3.
    A cooccurrence pair can be viewed as a generalization of a bigram, where a bigram is a cooccurrence pair with d = 1 (without ignoring function words).
    As with bigrams, a cooccurrence pair is directional, i.e.
    (x, y) (y, x).
    This captures some information about the asymmetry in the linear order of linguistic relations, such as the fact that verbs tend to precede their objects and follow their subjects.
    The mutual information of a cooccurrence pair, which measures the degree of association between the two words (Church and Hanks, 1990), is defined as (Fano, 1961): where P(z) and P(y) are the probabilities of the events x and y (occurrences of words, in our case) and P (x , y
