also did the same using the majority scores but rejecting those items on which there was less than 60% agreement.
    In addition to performing a regression for all items (All), we also performed a regression for only those items which have only one meaning according to WordNet (Monosemous).
    The results for all of these are shown in Table 3.
    The figures shown are chi-squared scores, with their associated significance values.
    We observed significant correlations for a number of the regressions (notably all items vs. the centroid annotator, and monosemous items vs. 60% agreement).
    While the results are far from stable, such variation is perhaps to be expected on a test like this since the nature of context space models means that rogue items sometimes get extremely high similarity scores, and we are performing the regression over only 40 VPCs (80 VPCcomponent pairs).
    In order to build a classifier for making compositionality decisions, we again used a neighbour-based approach with a cut-off.
