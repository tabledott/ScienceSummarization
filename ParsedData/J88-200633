ame structure vis-a-vis sequence of tenses.
    The first two clauses (a) and (b) are the same as in Example 15 and lead to the same configuration of event entities in E/S structure (as shown in Figure 10).
    But the most plausible interpretation of (16c) is where the &amp;quot;saying&amp;quot; event is interpreted anaphorically with respect to the &amp;quot;promising&amp;quot; event&#8212;that is, where (16b&#8211;c) are taken together as (the start of) an embedded discourse, describing an event prior to John's going to the florist's.
    To handle this, I assume, following Grosz and Sidner 1986, that when the listener recognizes an embedded discourse segment, s/he stores the current TF for possible resumption later.17 However, I also assume the listener recognizes the embedding not when s/he first encounters a perfect-tensed clause Cb, since it needn't signal an embedded discourse, but later, when an immediately following simple past tense clause Cc is most sensibly interpreted with respect to the event e
