 that the consensus translation based on the MT systems developed in 2004 is still superior to this 2005 single system translation in terms of all error measures.
    We also checked how many sentences in the consensus translation of the test corpus are different from the 5 original translations.
    185 out of 500 sentences (37%) had new translations.
    Computing the error measures on these sentences only, we observed significant improvements in WER and PER and a small improvement in BLEU with respect to the original translations.
    Thus, the quality of previously unseen consensus translations as generated from the original translations is acceptable.
    In this experiment, the global system probabilities for scoring the confusion networks were tuned manually on a development set.
    The distribution was 0.35, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, with 0.35 for the words of the best single system and 0.1 for the words of the worst single system.
    We observed that the consensus translation did not change significantl
