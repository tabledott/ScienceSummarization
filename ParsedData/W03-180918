 a fully productive lexical rule, then word-substituted variants should be distributed similarly.
    This seems a reasonable basis for modelling productivity but not compositionality, as Lin claims.
    There are many examples in natural language of phrases that are not at all productive but are still compositional (e.g. frying pan); we term the process by which these expressions arise institutionalisation .
    Similar work to Lin&#8217;s has been done in the area of collocation extraction (e.g.
    Pearce (2002)), to pick up on this alternate concept of institutionalisation.
    Schone and Jurafsky (2001) employed Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Deerwester et al. (1990)) in an effort to improve on existing techniques for extracting MWEs from corpora.
    One property they try and pick up on in doing so is non-compositionality.
    They measure the cosine between the vector representation for the candidate MWE and a weighted vector sum of its component words, suggesting that a small cosine would indicate com
