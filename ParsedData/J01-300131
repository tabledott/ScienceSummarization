 modular architecture, one where each module is a filter, partial tagger, or feature extractor.
    The architecture of the system is represented in Figure 2.
    This system currently incorporates a single filter (part-of-speech filter), three partial taggers (simulated annealing, subject codes, selectional restrictions) and a single feature extractor (collocation extractor).
    Sense tagger architecture.
    Before the filters or partial taggers are applied, the text is tokenized, lemmatized, split into sentences, and part-of-speech tagged, again using Brill's tagger.
    A named entity identifier is then run over the text to mark and categorize proper names, which will provide information for the selectional restrictions partial tagger (see Section 4.4).
    These preprocessing stages are carried out by modules from Sheffield University's Information Extraction system, LaSIE, and are described in more detail by Gaizauskas et al. (1996).
    Our system disambiguates only the content words in the text, and
