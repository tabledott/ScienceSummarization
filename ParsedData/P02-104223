of in which almost 98% of unseen sentences from the CCGbank can be parsed.
    The parser is able to capture a number of longrange dependencies that are not dealt with by existing treebank parsers.
    Capturing such dependencies is necessary for any parser that aims to support wide-coverage semantic analysis&#8212;say to support question-answering in any domain in which the difference between questions like Which company did Marks sue? and Which company sued Marks? matters.
    An advantage of our approach is that the recovery of long-range dependencies is fully integrated with the grammar and parser, rather than being relegated to a post-processing phase.
    Because of the extreme naivety of the statistical model, these results represent no more than a first attempt at combining wide-coverage CCG parsing with recovery of deep dependencies.
    However, we believe that the results are promising.
    In future work we will present an evaluation which teases out the differences in extracted and insitu argumen
