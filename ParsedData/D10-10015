r solving optimization problems that can be decomposed into efficiently solvable sub-problems.
    Our work is inspired by dual decomposition methods for inference in Markov random fields (MRFs) (Wainwright et al., 2005a; Komodakis et al., 2007; Globerson and Jaakkola, 2007).
    In this approach, the MRF is decomposed into sub-problems corresponding to treestructured subgraphs that together cover all edges of the original graph.
    The resulting inference algorithms provably solve an LP relaxation of the MRF inference problem, often significantly faster than commercial LP solvers (Yanover et al., 2006).
    Our work is also related to methods that incorporate combinatorial solvers within loopy belief propagation (LBP), either for MAP inference (Duchi et al., 2007) or for computing marginals (Smith and Eisner, 2008).
    Our approach similarly makes use of combinatorial algorithms to efficiently solve subproblems of the global inference problem.
    However, unlike LBP, our algorithms have strong theoretical
