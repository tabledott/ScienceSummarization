aurus such as WordNet (Voorhees, 1994).
    Significant improvements in retrieval performance could be achieved by global expansion techniques that compute corpus-wide statistics and take the entire query, or query concept (Qiu and Frei, 1993), into account, or by local expansion techniques that select expansion terms from the top ranked documents retrieved by the original query (Xu and Croft, 1996).
    A similar picture emerges for query expansion in QA: Mixed results have been reported for wordby-word expansion based on WordNet (Burke et al., 1997; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001).
    Considerable improvements have been reported for the use of the local context analysis model of Xu and Croft (1996) in the QA system of Ittycheriah et al. (2001), or for the systems of Agichtein et al.
    (2004) or Harabagiu and Lacatusu (2004) that use FAQ data to learn how to expand query terms by answer terms.
    The SMT-based approaches presented in this paper can be seen as global query
