ure, then the engineeringoriented NL worker must ask him- or herself if the benefits of the proposed architecture truly outweigh its costs.
    For instance, one cannot simply argue that an integrated architecture is superior to a pipeline because it is better suited to handling certain kinds of pronominalization; it is also necessary to evaluate the engineering cost of shifting to an integrated architecture, and determine if, for example, better overall performance for the amount of engineering resources available could be obtained by keeping the general pipeline architecture, and instead investing some of the engineering resources 'saved' by this decision into building more sophisticated heuristics into the pronominalization module.
    In doing so, I believe (and again this is a personal belief that probably cannot be substantiated by the existing evidence) that the NL engineer is coming close to the 'reasoning' of the evolutionary process that created the human language system.
    Evolution does not care
