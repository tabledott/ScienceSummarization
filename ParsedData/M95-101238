tical?amount of processing is required t o perform the Muc-6 named entities and template generation tasks .
  150 For NE, little is actually required beyond careful document management and printing routines .
  TIMEX forms, introduced by the preprocessing date-tagger, must be preserved through the rest of the processing pipe .
  Named entity phrases that encode an intermediate stage of NE processing must be suppressed at printout .
  Examples such as these abound, but by and large, Alembics NE output is simply a direct readout of the resul t of running the named entity phraser rules .
  Name coreference in TE Of all three tasks, TE is actually the one that explicitly requires most idiosyncratic processing beyon d phrasing and inference .
  Specifically, this task is the crucible for name coreference, i .e., the process by which short name forms are reconciled with their originating long forms .
  This merging process takes place by iterating over the semantic individuals in the inferential database tha t are
