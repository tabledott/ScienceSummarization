  Cues And Control In Expert-Client Dialogues
  
    We conducted an empirical analysis into the relation between control and discourse structure.
    We applied control criteria to four dialogues and identified 3 levels of discourse structure.
    We investigated the mechanism for changing control between these structures and found that utterance type and not cue words predicted shifts of control.
    Participants used certain types of signals when discourse goals were proceeding successfully but resorted to interruptions when they were not.
  
  
    A number of researchers have shown that there is organisation in discourse above the level of the individual utterance (5, 8, 9, 10), The current exploratory study uses control as a parameter for identifying these higher level structures.
    We then go on to address how conversational participants co-ordinate moves between these higher level units, in particular looking at the ways they use to signal the beginning and end of such high level units.
