    We will not discuss in detail the characteristics of the model or the parameter estimation procedure used &#8212; Improved Iterative Scaling.
    For a more extensive discussion of maximum entropy methods, see Berger et al. (1996) and Jelinek (1997).
    However, we note that our parameter estimation algorithm directly uses equation (1).
    Ratnaparkhi (1996: 134) suggests use of an approximation summing over the training data, which does not sum over possible tags: However, we believe this passage is in error: such an estimate is ineffective in the iterative scaling algorithm.
    Further, we note that expectations of the form (1) appear in Ratnaparkhi (1998: 12).
    In our baseline model, the context available when predicting the part of speech tag of a word wi in a sentence of words {w1... wn} with tags {t1... t&#8222;) is { wi.,11.
    The features that define the constraints on the model are obtained by instantiation of feature templates as in Ratnaparkhi (1996).
