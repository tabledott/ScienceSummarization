em can be roughly classified into two main categories: those relying on pre-existing knowledge resources (thesauri, semantic networks, taxonomies or encyclopedias) (Alvarez and Lim, 2007; Yang and Powers, 2005; Hughes and Ramage, 2007) and those inducing distributional properties of words from corpora (Sahami and Heilman, 2006; Chen et al., 2006; Bollegala et al., 2007).
    In this paper, we explore both families.
    For the first one we apply graph based algorithms to WordNet, and for the second we induce distributional similarities collected from a 1.6 Terabyte Web corpus.
    Previous work suggests that distributional similarities suffer from certain limitations, which make them less useful than knowledge resources for semantic similarity.
    For example, Lin (1998b) finds similar phrases like captive-westerner which made sense only in the context of the corpus used, and Budanitsky and Hirst (2006) highlight other problems that stem from the imbalance and sparseness of the corpora.
    Comparatively, th
