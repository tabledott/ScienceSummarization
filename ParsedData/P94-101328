 Using only one log-likelihood ratio without combination frees the algorithm to include a wide spectrum of highly non-independent information without additional algorithmic complexity or performance loss.
  
  
    Because we have only stripped accents artificially for testing purposes, and the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; patterns exist online in the original corpus, we can evaluate performance objectively and automatically.
    This contrasts with other classification tasks such as word-sense disambiguation and part-of-speech tagging, where at some point human judgements are required.
    Regrettably, however, there are errors in the original corpus, which can be quite substantial depending on the type of accent.
    For example, in the Spanish data, accents over the i (i) are frequently omitted; in a sample test 3.7% of the appropriate i accents were missing.
    Thus the following results must be interpreted as agreement rates with the corpus accent pattern; the true percent correct may be several percenta
