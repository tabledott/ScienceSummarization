sly showed that such bilingual constraints can be leveraged to transfer parse quality from a resource-rich language to a resourceimpoverished one.
    In this paper, we show that bilingual constraints and reinforcement can be leveraged to substantially improve parses on both sides of a bitext, even for two resource-rich languages.
    Formally, we present a log-linear model over triples of source trees, target trees, and node-tonode tree alignments between them.
    We consider a set of core features which capture the scores of monolingual parsers as well as measures of syntactic alignment.
    Our model conditions on the input sentence pair and so features can and do reference input characteristics such as posterior distributions from a word-level aligner (Liang et al., 2006; DeNero and Klein, 2007).
    Our training data is the translated section of the Chinese treebank (Xue et al., 2002; Bies et al., 2007), so at training time correct trees are observed on both the source and target side.
