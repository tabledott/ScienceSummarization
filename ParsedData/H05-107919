anisers because of agreement-related problems.
			Therefore we expect that human agreement on textual en tailment in general is rather lower.
			632 4.3 Decision trees for entailment recognition.
			We expressed each example pair as a feature vector, using different subsets of the features described in Section 2 and Section 3 for each experiment.
			We then trained a decision tree for classification into TRUE and FALSE entailment on the development set, using the Weka machine learning tool (Witten and Frank, 2000), and tested on the test set.
			Apartfrom a classification, Weka also computes a confi dence value for each decision, dependent on the leaf in the tree that the classified example falls into: if the leaf covers x examples in the training set, of which y examples are classified wrongly, then the error rate is y/x and the confidence value is 1?
			y/x. Our evaluation measures are accuracy (acc) as the percentage of correct judgements as well asconfidence-weighted average score (cws), which rewards the
