 index of R. Given a subsequential power series S, we define a power series f by: We then define a subsequential transducer T = (Q, i, F, E, 6,a, A, p) by:12 Since the index of Rs is finite, Q and F are well-defined.
    The definition of 6 does not depend on the choice of the element u in U, since for any a E E, u Rs v implies (ua) Rs (va).
    The definition of a is also independent of this choice, since by definition of Rs, if uRsv, then (ua) Rs (va) and there exists k E R. such that Vw E E*, (S, uaw) (S. yaw) = (S, uw) - (S, vw) = k. Notice that the definition of a implies that: T realizes S. This ends the proof of the theorem.
    0 Given a subsequential transducer T = (Q, i,F , E, 6, a, A, p), we can define for each state q E Q, d(q) by: We define a new operation of pushing, which applies to any transducer T. In particular, if T is subsequential the result of the application of pushing to T is a new subsequential transducer T' = (Q, i,F , E, 6, , A', p') that only differs from T by its output weights in
