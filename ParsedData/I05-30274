aining affixes of unknown words, rather than using threshold-filtered affix tables in a separate un known word model as was done in Gao et al (2004), we first extracted rare words from a corpus and then collected the first and last charac ters to construct the prefix and suffix tables.
			For the table of individual character words, we col lected an individual character word table for each corpus of the characters that always occurred alone as a separate word in the given cor pus.
			We also collected a list of bi-grams from each training corpus to distinguish known strings from unknown.
			Adopting all the features together in a model and using the automatically generated morphological tables prevented our system from manually overfitting the Mandarin varieties we are most familiar with.
			The tables are used in the following ways: 1) C-1+C0 unknown word feature functions were created for each specific pair of characters in the bi-gram tables.
			Such feature functions are active if the characters in the re
