 store the training data itself inmemory, and use a suffix array as an efficient in dex to look up, extract, and score phrase pairs on the fly.
			We believe that the latter approach has several important applications (?7).So far, these techniques have focused on phrase based models using contiguous phrases (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004).
			Some recent models permit discontiguous phrases (Chiang, 2007; Quirket al, 2005; Simard et al, 2005).
			Of particular in terest to us is the hierarchical phrase-based model ofChiang (2007), which has been shown to be supe rior to phrase-based models.
			The ruleset extractedby this model is a superset of the ruleset in an equivalent phrase-based model, and it is an order of magnitude larger.
			This makes efficient rule representa tion even more critical.
			We tackle the problem using the online rule extraction method of Callison-Burch et al (2005) and Zhang and Vogel (2005).
			The problem statement for our work is: Given an input sentence, efficiently find al
