rticular derivation, equal to the product of the rule probabilities used in the derivation, or to associate a probability with a set of derivations, A w,. equal to the sum of the probabilities of the individual derivations.
    We call this latter probability the inside probability of i,A,j.
    We can rewrite the CKY algorithm to compute the inside probabilities, as shown in Figure 2 (Baker 1979; Lan i and Young 1990).
    Notice how similar the inside algorithm is to the recognition algorithm: essentially, all that has been done is to substitute + for V, x for A, and P(A w5) and P(A &#8212;&gt; BC) for TRUE.
    For many parsing algorithms, this, or a similarly simple modification, is all that is needed to create a probabilistic version of the algorithm.
    On the other hand, a simple substitution is not always sufficient.
    To give a trivial example, if in the CKY recognition algorithm we had written chart[s, A, s+1] := chart[s, A, s+1] v chart[s, B, s+t] A chart[s+t, C, s+1]; instead of the less natura
