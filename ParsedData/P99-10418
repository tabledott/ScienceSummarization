 the above derivation is due to the fact that is very small.
    Table 3 shows the zN values for a sample set of confidence intervals.
    &amp;quot;economic impact&amp;quot;.
    In fact, the difference of mutual information values appear to be more important to the phrasal similarity than the similarity of individual words.
    For example, the phrases &amp;quot;economic fallout&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;economic repercussion&amp;quot; are intuitively more similar to &amp;quot;economic impact&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;economic implication&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;economic significance&amp;quot;, even though &amp;quot;implication&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;significance&amp;quot; have higher similarity values to &amp;quot;impact&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;fallout&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;repercussion&amp;quot; do.
    These examples suggest that one possible way to separate compositional phrases and noncompositional ones is to check the existence and mutual information values of phrases obtained by substituting one of t
