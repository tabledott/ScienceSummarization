nding of alignment and entailment determination.
    We have described a system which extends alignment-based systems while attempting to address these limitations.
    After finding the best alignment between text and hypothesis, we extract highlevel semantic features of the entailment problem, and input these features to a statistical classifier to make an entailment decision.
    Using this multi-stage architecture, we report results on the PASCAL RTE data which surpass previously-reported results for alignment-based systems.
    We see the present work as a first step in a promising direction.
    Much work remains in improving the entailment features, many of which may be seen as rough approximations to a formal monotonicity calculus.
    In future, we aim to combine more precise modeling of monotonicity effects with better modeling of paraphrase equivalence.
