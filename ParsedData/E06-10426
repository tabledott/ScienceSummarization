atistical means.
    It then finds metaphorical mappings between domains based on these selectional preferences.
    By finding semantic differences between the selectional preferences, it can &#8220;articulate the higher-order structure of conceptual metaphors&#8221; ((Mason, 2004), p. 24), finding mappings like LIQUID&#8594;MONEY.
    Like CorMet, TroFi uses contextual evidence taken from a large corpus and also uses WordNet as a primary knowledge source, but unlike CorMet, TroFi does not use selectional preferences.
    Metaphor processing has even been approached with connectionist systems storing world-knowledge as probabilistic dependencies (Narayanan, 1999).
  
  
    TroFi is not a metaphor processing system.
    It does not claim to interpret metonymy and it will not tell you what a given idiom means.
    Rather, TroFi attempts to separate literal usages of verbs from nonliteral ones.
    For the purposes of this paper we will take the simplified view that literal is anything that falls within accept
