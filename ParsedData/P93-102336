; consequently, the models with high recall/low precision are the ones with a small number of clusters, while the opposite pattern of scores characterizes the models with a large number of clusters. though the observed pairs represent only 19.52% of the possible pairs, their importance is considerable.
    Note that the sparsity of the adjective-adjective pairs does not allow us to perform a comparable study for the partition produced using the adjectiveadjective module alone, since such a partition would be largely determined by chance.
  
  
    We have described a system for extracting groups of semantically related adjectives from large text corpora, with a flexible architecture which allows for multiple knowledge sources influencing similarity to be easily incorporated into the system.
    Our evaluation reveals that it has significantly high performance levels, comparable to humans, using only a relatively small amount of input data; in addition, it shows the usefulness of negative knowledge, an origina
