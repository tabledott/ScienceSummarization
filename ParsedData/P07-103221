e we have made is to turn all ncmod GRs with of as the modifier into iobj GRs (unless the ncmod is a partitive predeterminer).
    This was found to have high precision and applies to a large number of cases.
    There are some dependencies in CCGbank which do not appear in DepBank.
    Examples include any dependencies in which a punctuation mark is one of the arguments; these were removed from the output.
    We attempt to fill the subtype slot for some GRs.
    The subtype slot specifies additional information about the GR; examples include the value obj in a passive ncsubj, indicating that the subject is an underlying object; the value num in ncmod, indicating a numerical quantity; and prt in ncmod to indicate a verb particle.
    The passive case is identified as follows: any lexical category which starts S[pss]\NP indicates a passive verb, and we also mark any verbs POS tagged VBN and assigned the lexical category N/N as passive.
    Both these rules have high precision, but still leave many of the case
