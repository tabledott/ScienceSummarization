et of coding data, A&#960;e &#8805; ASe and therefore &#960; &#8804; S, with the limiting case (equality) obtaining when the observed distribution of items among categories is uniform.
    2.4.3 Individual Coder Distributions: &#954;.
    The method proposed by Cohen (1960) to calculate expected agreement Ae in his &#954; coefficient assumes that random assignment of categories to items is governed by prior distributions that are unique to each coder, and which reflect individual annotator bias.
    An individual coder&#8217;s prior distribution is estimated by looking at her actual distribution: P(k|ci), the probability that coder ci will classify an arbitrary item into category k, is estimated by using &#710;P(k|ci), the proportion of items actually assigned by coder ci to category k; this is the number of assignments to k by ci, ncik, divided by the number of items i.
    As in the case of S and &#960;, the probability that the two coders c1 and c2 assign an item to a particular category k &#8712; K is the
