and recall measures (Van Rijsbergen, 1979), and their harmonic mean, F-score.
    We report micro F1.
    In the hedge finding task, a hedge token is correctly classified if it has been classified as being at the beginning or inside the hedge signal.
    We also evaluate the percentage of hedge cues that have been correctly identified.
    In the scope finding task, a token is correctly classified if it has been correctly classified as being inside or outside of the scope of all the hedge cues that there are in the sentence.
    This means that when there is more than one hedge cue in the sentence, the token has to be correctly assigned a class for as many hedge signals as there are.
    Additionally, we evaluate the percentage of correct scopes (PCS).
    A scope is correct if all the tokens in the sentence have been assigned the correct scope class for a specific hedge signal.
    The evaluation in terms of precision and recall measures takes as unit a token, whereas the evaluation in terms of PCS takes as
