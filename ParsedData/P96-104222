tructed by selective training than in a fully trained model, suggesting that the selection method avoids using examples which increase the counts for already known parameters.
  
  
    Why does committee-based sample selection work?
    Consider the properties of those examples that are selected for training.
    In general, a selected training example will contribute data to several statistics, which in turn will improve the estimates of several parameter values.
    An informative example is therefore one whose contribution to the statistics leads to a significantly useful improvement of model parameter estimates.
    Model parameters for which acquiring additional statistics is most beneficial can be characterized by the following three properties: ters that affect only few examples have low overall utility.
    The committee-based selection algorithms work because they tend to select examples that affect parameters with the above three properties.
    Property 1 is addressed by randomly drawing the param
