pho-syntactic features.
    This sieve marks two nominal mentions as coreferent if they are linked by a WordNet lexical chain that traverses hypernymy or synonymy relations.
    We use all synsets for each mention, but restrict it to mentions that are at most three sentences apart, and lexical chains of length at most four.
    This sieve correctly links Britain with country, and plane with aircraft.
    To increase the precision of the above two sieves, we use additional constraints before two mentions can match: attribute agreement (number, gender, animacy, named entity labels), no i-within-i, no location or numeric mismatches (as in Section 2.3.1), and we do not use the abstract entity synset in WordNet, except in chains that include &#8216;organization&#8217;.
    This sieve matches speakers to compatible pronouns, using shallow discourse understanding to handle quotations and conversation transcripts.
    Although more complex discourse constraints have been proposed, it has been difficult to show improv
