d of 6 consistently produced optimal or near optimal results for pre-pruning.
			Thus, pre-pruning with a threshold of 6 was used in the experiments.
	
	
			The tagger treats dots in POS tag labels as attribute separators.
			The first attribute of a POS tag is the main category.
			The number of additional attributes is fixed for each main category.
			The additionalattributes are category-specific.
			The singular at tribute of a noun and an adjective POS tag are therefore two different attributes.
			4Each position in the POS tags of a given category corresponds to a feature.
			The attributes oc curring at a certain position constitute the value set of the feature.
	
	
			Our tagger is a HMM tagger which decomposes the context probabilities into a product of attribute probabilities.
			The probability of an attribute given the attributes of the preceding POS tags as well as the preceding attributes of the predicted POS tagis estimated with a decision tree as described be fore.
			The probabilities at the
