t set consisting of 506 sentence pairs as development set.
    We obtained high-precision word alignments using the way described in Section 3.1.
    Then we ran our reordering example extraction algorithm to output blocks of length at most 7 words on the Chinese side together with their internal alignments.
    We also limited the length ratio between the target and source language (max(|s|, |t|)/min(|s|, |t|)) to 3.
    After extracting phrases, we calculated the phrase translation probabilities and lexical translation probabilities in both directions for each bilingual phrase.
    For the minimum-error-rate training, we reimplemented Venugopal&#8217;s trainer 3 (Venugopal et al., 2005) in C++.
    For all experiments, we ran this trainer with the decoder iteratively to tune the weights As to maximize the BLEU score on the development set.
    We shared the same phrase translation tables between Pharaoh and our system since the two systems use the same features of phrases.
    In fact, we extracted more phr
