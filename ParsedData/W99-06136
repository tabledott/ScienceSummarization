(Berland and Charniak 99) describe a method for extracting parts of objects from wholes (e.g., &amp;quot;speedometer&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;car&amp;quot;) from a large corpus using hand-crafted patterns.
    (Hearst 92) describes a method for extracting hyponyms from a corpus (pairs of words in &amp;quot;isa&amp;quot; relations).
    (Riloff and Shepherd 97) describe a bootstrapping approach for acquiring nouns in particular categories (such as &amp;quot;vehicle&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;weapon&amp;quot; categories).
    The approach builds from an initial seed set for a category, and is quite similar to the decision list approach described in (Yarowsky 95).
    More recently, (Riloff and Jones 99) describe a method they term &amp;quot;mutual bootstrapping&amp;quot; for simultaneously constructing a lexicon and contextual extraction patterns.
    The method shares some characteristics of the decision list algorithm presented in this paper.
