ze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression.
  
  
    At least three learning paradigms have been applied to the task of extracting relational facts from text (for example, learning that a person is employed by a particular organization, or that a geographic entity is located in a particular region).
    In supervised approaches, sentences in a corpus are first hand-labeled for the presence of entities and the relations between them.
    The NIST Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) RDC 2003 and 2004 corpora, for example, include over 1,000 documents in which pairs of entities have been labeled with 5 to 7 major relation types and 23 to 24 subrelations, totaling 16,771 relation instances.
    ACE systems then extract a wide variety of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features, and use supervised classifiers to label the relation mention holding between a given pair of entities in a test set sent
