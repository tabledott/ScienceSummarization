hreshold, Q, is used to determine the maximum number of documents in which a pattern can occur since these very frequent patterns are often too general to be useful for IE.
    Patterns which occur in more than Q x C, where C is the number of documents in the collection, are not learned.
    For the experiments in this paper we set &#945; to 2 and Q to 0.3.
  
  
    A number of pre-processing stages have to be applied to documents in order for the set of patterns to be extracted before learning can take place.
    Firstly, items belonging to semantic categories are identified by running the text through the named entity identifier in the GATE system (Cunningham et al., 2002).
    The corpus is then parsed, using a version of MINIPAR (Lin, 1999) adapted to process text marked with named entities, to produce dependency trees from which SVO-patterns are extracted.
    Active and passive voice is taken into account in MINIPAR&#8217;s output so the sentences &#8220;COMPANY fired their C.E.O.&#8221; and &#8220;The
