resent word senses.
    The matrix is divided into (k 1) x (k + 1) blocks.
    The blocks on the diagonal are all Os.
    The elements in block Sii are the similarity measures between the senses of Wi and the senses of It:).
    Similarity measures lower than a threshold 0 are considered to be noise and are ignored.
    In our experiments, 9 = 0.2 was used.
    Step C.5: Modify the similarity matrix to remove the similarity values between other senses of W.i&#8222; and senses of other words.
    For all 1, j, m, such that 1 E [1,ni,..] and 1 0 Imax and j imax and m E [1, nil' Let's consider again the word &amp;quot;facility&amp;quot; in (3).
    It has two local contexts: subject of &amp;quot;employ&amp;quot; (subj employ head) and modifiee of &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; (adjn new mod).
    Table 1 lists words that appeared in the first local context.
    Table 2 lists words that appeared in the second local context.
    Only words with top-20 likelihood ratio were used in our experiments.
    The two groups of w
