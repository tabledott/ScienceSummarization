 surface derivations.
    This impacts on how best to define a probability model for CCG, since the &#8220;spurious ambiguity&#8221; of CCG derivations may lead to an exponential number of derivations for a given constituent.
    In addition, some of the spurious derivations may not be present in the training data.
    One solution is to consider only the normal-form (Eisner, 1996a) derivation, which is the route taken in Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002b).1 Another problem with the non-standard surface derivations is that the standard PARSEVAL performance measures over such derivations are uninformative (Clark and Hockenmaier, 2002).
    Such measures have been criticised by Lin (1995) and Carroll et al. (1998), who propose recovery of headdependencies characterising predicate-argument relations as a more meaningful measure.
    If the end-result of parsing is interpretable predicate-argument structure or the related dependency structure, then the question arises: why build derivation structure at all?
