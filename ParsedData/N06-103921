 tables were a mixture of multiple relations and some of their rows still looked consistent.
    We have a couple of open questions.
    First, the overall recall of our system might be lower than existing IE systems, as we are relying on a cluster of comparable articles rather than a single document to discover an event.
    We might be able to improve this in the future by adjusting the basic clustering algorithm or weighting schema of basic patterns.
