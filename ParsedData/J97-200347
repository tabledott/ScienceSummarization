determinization algorithm.
    A subset 62(i2, uv&amp;quot;) contains the pairs (q, c(q, uvk)) and (q', c(q', uvk)).
    We will show that these subsets are all distinct.
    This will prove that the determinization algorithm does not terminate if Ti does not have the twins property.
    Since ri is a trim unambiguous transducer, there exits only one path in Ti from I to q or to q' with input string u.
    Similarly, the cycles at q and q' labeled with v are unique.
    Thus, there exist i E I and i' E I such that: Since 0 0 0, equation 20 shows that the subsets 62(i2, uv') are all distinct.
    0 The characterization of determinizable transducers provided by theorem 12 leads to the definition of an algorithm for testing the determinizability of trim unambiguous transducers.
    Before describing the algorithm, we introduce a lemma that shows that it suffices to examine a finite number of paths to test the twins property.
    Lemma 2 Let Ti = (Qi, E, Ii, Fi, Ei, Ai, Pi) be a trim unambiguous string-to-weight
