necessary but depends on: i) the availability of parallel sentences to start the process, and ii) the actual objectives in terms of language combinations to be covered10.
    As regards the first stage, in this work we started from a set of 467 English/Italian/German aligned sentences extracted from parallel documents downloaded from the Cafebabel European Magazine11.
    Concerning the second multilingual stage, we performed only one round of translations from English to Italian to extend the 3 combinations obtained without translations (ENG/ENG, ENG/ITA, and ENG/GER) with the new language combinations ITA/ITA, ITA/ENG, and ITA/GER.
  
  
    Our approach builds on a pipeline of HITs routed to MTurk&#8217;s workforce through the CrowdFlower interface.
    The objective is to collect aligned T-H pairs for different language combinations, reproducing an RTE-like annotation style.
    However, our annotation is not limited to the standard RTE framework, where only unidirectional entailment from T to H is consid
