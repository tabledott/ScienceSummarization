S information for word segmentation, segmentation and POS tagging can be viewed as a single task: given a raw Chinese input sentence, the joint POS tagger considers all possible segmented and tagged sequences, and chooses the overall best output.
    A major challenge for such a joint system is the large search space faced by the decoder.
    For a sentence with n characters, the number of possible output sequences is O(2n&#8722;1 &#183; Tn), where T is the size of the tag set.
    Due to the nature of the combined candidate items, decoding can be inefficient even with dynamic programming.
    Recent research on Chinese POS tagging has started to investigate joint segmentation and tagging, reporting accuracy improvements over the pipeline approach.
    Various decoding approaches have been used to reduce the combined search space.
    Ng and Low (2004) mapped the joint segmentation and POS tagging task into a single character sequence tagging problem.
    Two types of tags are assigned to each character to re
