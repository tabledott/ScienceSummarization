temming slightly improved both accuracy and performance.
    Only CPOSTAG were used.
    PHEAD/PDEPREL were not used.
    FEATS were used to extract a single token combining gender, number, person and case, through a language specific algorithm.
    The selection of features to be used in the parser is controlled by a number of parameters.
    For example, the parameter PosFeatures determines for which tokens the POS tag will be included in the context, PosLeftChi7dren determines how many left outermost children of a token to consider, PastActions tells how many previous actions to include as features.
    The settings used in the submitted runs are listed below and configure the parser for not using any word forms.
    Positive numbers refer to input tokens, negative ones to token on the stack.
    The context for POS tags consisted of 1 token left and 3 tokens to the right of the focus words, except for Czech and Chinese were 2 tokens to the left and 4 tokens to the right were used.
    These values were ch
