    Consider a comparison of two train timetable information agents (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995), where Agent A in Dialogue 1 uses an explicit confirmation strategy, while Agent B in Dialogue 2 uses an implicit confirmation strategy: Danieli and Gerbino found that Agent A had a higher transaction success rate and produced less inappropriate and repair utterances than Agent B, and thus concluded that Agent A was more robust than Agent B.
    However, one limitation of both this approach and the reference answer approach is the inability to generalize results to other tasks and environments (Fraser, 1995).
    Such generalization requires the identification of factors that affect performance (Cohen, 1995; Sparck-Jones and Galliers, 1996).
    For example, while Danieli and Gerbino found that Agent A's dialogue strategy produced dialogu
