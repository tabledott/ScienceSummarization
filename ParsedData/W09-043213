 of features.
    Furthermore, the first approach of Moses for model combination shrinks the size of the phrase table, while the second one enlarges it.
    The set of features of the new TM is the union of the features of all single TMs.
    Straightforwardly, all feature values are well-defined.
    The second method corresponds to building one new TM SU, whose set is the union of all given sets: SU = {( &#65533;f, &#65533;e)  |&#65533;j ( f, E) E Sj} Again, the set of features of the new TM is the union of the features of all single TMs; but for a phrase pair (&#65533;f, E) belonging to SU \Sj, the feature values h(&#65533;f, E; Sj) are undefined.
    In these undefined situations, Moses provides a default value of 0, which is the highest available score, as the feature values come from probabilistic distributions and are expressed as logarithms.
    Henceforth, a phrase pair belonging to all original sets is penalized with respect to phrase pairs belonging to few of them only.
    To address this drawback
