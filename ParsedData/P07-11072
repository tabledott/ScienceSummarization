thods can and do fail to produce coherent partitions.
    One classic solution is to make greedy left-to-right linkage decisions.
    Recent work has addressed this issue in more global ways.
    McCallum and Wellner (2004) use graph partioning in order to reconcile pairwise scores into a final coherent clustering.
    Nonetheless, all these systems crucially rely on pairwise models because clusterlevel models are much harder to work with, combinatorially, in discriminative approaches.
    Another thread of coreference work has focused on the problem of identifying matches between documents (Milch et al., 2005; Bhattacharya and Getoor, 2006; Daume and Marcu, 2005).
    These methods ignore the sequential anaphoric structure inside documents, but construct models of how and when entities are shared between them.1 These models, as ours, are generative ones, since the focus is on cluster discovery and the data is generally unlabeled.
    In this paper, we present a novel, fully generative, nonparametric Bayesian
