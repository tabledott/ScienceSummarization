  Japanese Dependency Analysis Using Cascaded Chunking
  
    In this paper, we propose a new statistical Japanese dependency parser using a cascaded chunking model.
    Conventional Japanese statistical dependency parsers are mainly based on a probabilistic model, which is not always efficient or scalable.
    We propose a new method that is simple and efficient, since it parses a sentence deterministically only deciding whether the current segment modifies the segment on its immediate right hand side.
    Experiments using the Kyoto University Corpus show that the method outperforms previous systems as well as improves the parsing and training efficiency.
  
  
    Dependency analysis has been recognized as a basic process in Japanese sentence analysis, and a number of studies have been proposed.
    Japanese dependency structure is usually defined in terms of the relationship between phrasal units called bunsetsu segments (hereafter &#8220;segments&#8221;).
    Most of the previous statistical approaches
