word c, then word a is related to word c. In the second way, if word a is related to word b, and word a is related to word c, then word b is related to word c. But lexical chains are calculated only with respect to the text read so far.
    For example, if word c is related to word a and to word b, then word a and word b are not related, since at the time of processing, they were not relatable.
    Symmetry was not found to be necessary for computing the lexical chains.
    We now consider how many sentences can separate two words in a lexical chain before the words should be considered unrelated.
    Now, sometimes, several sentences after a chain has clearly stopped, it is returned to.
    Such chain returns link together larger expanses of text than are contained in single chains or chain segments.
    Returns to existing chains often correspond to intentional boundaries, as they occur after digressions or subintentions, thereby signalling a resumption of some structural text entity.
    Intuitively, the d
