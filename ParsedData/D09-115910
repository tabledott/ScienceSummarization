own in Fig.2(b).
    Chunk phrases &#8220;NP(We)&#8221;, &#8220;VP(really enjoyed using)&#8221; and &#8220;NP(the Canon PowerShot SD500)&#8221; are nodes in the output phrase dependency tree.
    When visiting node &#8220;enjoyed&#8221; in Fig.2(a), the shallow parser tells that &#8220;really&#8221; and &#8220;using&#8221; which are children of &#8220;enjoy&#8221; are in the same phrase with their parent, then the three nodes are packed.
    The final phrase dependency parsing tree is shown in the Fig.

    In this work, we define that product features are products, product parts, properties of products, properties of parts, company names and related objects.
    For example,in consumer electronic domain, &#8220;Canon PowerShot&#8221;, &#8220;image quality&#8221;,&#8220;camera&#8221;, &#8220;laptop&#8221; are all product features.
    From analyzing the labeled corpus, we observe that more than 98% of product features are in a single phrase, which is either noun phrase (NP) or verb phrase (VP).
