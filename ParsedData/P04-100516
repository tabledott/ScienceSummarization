    The distributions we estimate from the aligned repair data are the following.
    Pr(Ti|M&#57739;i&#8722;1, R&#57739;i&#8722;1) is the probability of seeing repair type Ti following the reparandum word M&#57739;i&#8722;1 and repair word R&#57739;i&#8722;1; e.g., Pr(nonrep|Boston, Denver) is the probability of the repair ending when Boston is the last reparandum word and Denver is the last repair word.
    Pr(Mi|Ti = ins,M&#57739;i&#8722;1,R&#57739;i) is the probability that Mi is the word that is inserted into the reparandum (i.e., Ri = &#57738;) given that some word is substituted, and that the preceding reparandum and repair words are M&#57739; i&#8722;1 and R&#57739; i.
    For example Pr(tomorrow|ins, Boston, Denver) is the probability that the word tomorrow is inserted into the reparandum after the words Boston and Denver, given that some word is inserted.
    Pr(Mi|Ti = subst, M&#57739;i&#8722;1, R&#57739;i) is the probability that Mi is the word that is substituted in the reparandu
