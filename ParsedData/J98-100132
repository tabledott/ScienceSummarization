ng of up to eight increasingly refined levels.8 Typically, each occurrence of the same word under different categories of the thesaurus represents different senses of that word; i.e., the categories correspond roughly to word senses (Yarowsky 1992).
    A set of words in the same category are semantically related.
    The earliest known use of Roget's for WSD is the work of Masterman (1957), described above in Section 2.1.
    Several years later, Patrick (1985) used Roget's to discriminate among verb senses, by examining semantic clusters formed by &amp;quot;e-chains&amp;quot; derived from the thesaurus (Bryan [1973, 1974]; see also Sedelow and Sedelow [1986]).
    He uses &amp;quot;word-strong neighborhoods,&amp;quot; comprising word groups in low-level semicolon groups, which are the most closely related semantically in the thesaurus, and words connected to the group via chains.
    He is able, he claims, to discriminate the correct sense of verbs such as inspire (to raise the spirits vs. to inhale, breath
