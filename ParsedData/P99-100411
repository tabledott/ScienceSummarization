r the language model under evaluation was to reconstruct which of (n, vi) and (n, v2) was the original cooccurrence.
    Note that by construction, (n, vi) was always the correct answer, and furthermore, methods relying solely on unigram frequencies would perform no better than chance.
    Test-set performance was measured by the error rate, defined as &#8212;1(# of incorrect choices + (# of ties)/2) , where T is the number of test triple tokens in the set, and a tie results when both alternatives are deemed equally likely by the language model in question.
    To perform the evaluation, we incorporated each similarity function into a decision rule as follows.
    For a given similarity measure f and neighborhood size k, let Sf,k(n) denote the k most similar words to n according to f. We define the evidence according to f for the cooccurrence (n, vi) as Then, the decision rule was to choose the alternative with the greatest evidence.
    The reason we used a restricted version of the distance-weighted averagi
