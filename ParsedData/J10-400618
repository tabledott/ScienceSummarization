e context for red and would distinguish the object relation connecting eat and apple as a different type of co-occurrence from the modifier relation linking red and apple.
    On the other hand, structured models require more preliminary corpus processing (parsing or extraction of lexico-syntactic patterns), and tend to be more sparse (because there are more triples than pairs).
    What little systematic comparison of the two approaches has been carried out (Pad&#180;o and Lapata 2007; Rothenh&#168;ausler and Sch&#168;utze 2009) suggests that structured models have a slight edge.
    In our experiments in Section 6.1 herein, the performance of unstructured and structured models trained on the same corpus is in general comparable.
    It seems safe to conclude that structured models are at least not worse than unstructured models&#8212;an important conclusion for us, as DM is built upon the structured DSM idea.
    Structured DSMs extract a much richer array of distributional information from linguistic input
