    The method described here is effective in removing incorrect senses from consideration, thereby reducing the search space if combined with other WSD methods.
    In the experiments reported in this section we made use of the particular structure of LDOCE, which assigns each sense to a homograph from which its part of speech information is inherited.
    However, there is no reason to believe that the method reported here is limited to lexicons with this structure.
    In fact this approach can be applied to any lexicon which assigns part-of-speech information to senses, although it would not always be possible to evaluate at the homograph level as we do here.
    In the remainder of this paper we go on to describe a sense tagger that assigns senses from LDOCE using a combination of classifiers.
    The set of senses considered by the classifiers is first filtered using part-of-speech tags.
  
  
    We adopt a framework in which different knowledge sources are applied as separate modul
