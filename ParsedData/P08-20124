  (2006) who use a probabilistic first-order logic model.
  
  
    For this task we are given a document which is annotated with a set of mentions, and the goal is to cluster the mentions which refer to the same entity.
    When describing our model, we build upon the notation used by Denis and Baldridge (2007).
    Our baseline systems are based on a logistic classifier over pairs of mentions.
    The probability of a pair of mentions takes the standard logistic form: where mi and mj correspond to mentions i and 3 respectively; f(mi, mj) is a feature function over a pair of mentions; 0 are the feature weights we wish to learn; and x(i j) is a boolean variable which takes value 1 if mi and mj are coreferent, and 0 if they are not.
    The log likelihood of a document is the sum of the log likelihoods of all pairs of mentions: (2) where m is the set of mentions in the document, and x is the set of variables representing each pairwise coreference decision x(i,j).
    Note that this model is degenerate, because
