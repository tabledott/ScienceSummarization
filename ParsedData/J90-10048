ight by applying rules of the grammar nondeterministically to the fringe of the expanding tree.
    This control regime is realized, for instance, when running a DCG &amp;quot;backwards&amp;quot; as a generator.
    Concretely, the following DCG interpreter&#8212;written in Prolog and taking as its data the grammar in encoded form&#8212;implements such a generation method.
    Clearly, such a generator may not terminate.
    For example, consider a grammar that includes the rules Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 1, March 1990 31 Shieber et at.
    Semantic Head-Driven Grammar This grammar admits sentences like &amp;quot;John left&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;John's father left&amp;quot; with logical form encodings left(john) and left(mod(father, john)), respectively.
    The technique used here to build the logical forms is well-known in logic grammars.'
    Generation with the goal gen(left(john), Sent) using the generator above will result in application of the first rule to the node node(s/left(john)
