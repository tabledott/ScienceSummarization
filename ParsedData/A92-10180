  A Practical Part-Of-Speech Tagger
  
    We present an implementation of a part-of-speech tagger based on a hidden Markov model.
    The methodology enables robust and accurate tagging with few resource requirements.
    Only a lexicon and some unlabeled training text are required.
    Accuracy exceeds 96%.
    We describe implementation strategies and optimizations which result in high-speed operation.
    Three applications for tagging are described: phrase recognition; word sense disambiguation; and grammatical function assignment.
    1 Desiderata Many words are ambiguous in their part of speech.
    For example, &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; can be a noun or a verb.
    However, when a word appears in the context of other words, the ambiguity is often reduced: in &amp;quot;a tag is a part-of-speech label,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; can only be a noun.
    A tagger is a system that uses context to assign parts of speech to words.
    Automatic text tagging is an important first step in discovering
