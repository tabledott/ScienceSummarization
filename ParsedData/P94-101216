ence lengths has a far greater variance for our English-Chinese materials than with the Indo-European materials used by Gale &amp; Church (1991).
    Despite this, the pure lengthbased method performs surprisingly well, except for its weakness in handling long stretches of sentences with close lengths.
  
  
    To obtain further improvement in alignment accuracy requires matching the passages' lexical content, rather than using pure length criteria.
    This is particularly relevant for the type of long mismatched stretches described above.
    Previous work on alignment has employed either solely lexical or solely statistical length criteria.
    In contrast, we wish to incorporate lexical criteria without giving up the statistical approach, which provides a high baseline performance.
    Our method replaces equation (3) with the following approximation: where vi = #occurrences(English cue, L1) and wi = #occurrences(Chinese cue, L2).
    Again, the dependence is encapsulated within difference parameters Si
