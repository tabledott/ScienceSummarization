			Therefore, here, too, it is very hard tocome up with clear-cut rules predicting every pos sible kind of occurrence.

			Although in the past there has been some research on determiner choice in L1 for applications such as generation and machine translation output, work to date on automatic error detection in L2 writing hasbeen fairly limited.
			Izumi et al (2004) train a maximum entropy classifier to recognise various er rors using contextual features.
			They report results for different error types (e.g. omission - precision 75.7%, recall 45.67%; replacement - P 31.17%, R 8%), but there is no break-down of results byindividual POS.
			Han et al (2006) use a maxi mum entropy classifier to detect determiner errors, achieving 83% accuracy.
			Chodorow et al (2007) present an approach to preposition error detectionwhich also uses a model based on a maximum entropy classifier trained on a set of contextual fea tures, together with a rule-based filter.
			They report 80% precision
