 decoder can consider, to certain extent, the interaction between reordering and other factors of translation.
    The entire process can be depicted by formula 2, recapitulated as follows: Apart from their deterministic nature, the two previous preprocessing approaches have their own weaknesses.
    (Collins et al., 2005) count on manual rules and it is suspicious if reordering rules for other language pairs can be easily made.
    (Xia and McCord, 2004) propose a way to learn rewriting patterns, nevertheless the units of such patterns are words and their POSs.
    Although there is no limit to the length of rewriting patterns, due to data sparseness most patterns being applied would be short ones.
    Many instances of global reordering are therefore left unhandled.
  
  
    To avoid this problem, we give up using rewriting patterns and design a form of reordering knowledge which can be directly applied to parse tree nodes.
    Given a node N on the parse tree of an SL sentence, the required reordering kno
