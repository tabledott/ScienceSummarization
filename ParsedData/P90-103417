    However, it is worth noting that the particular information about, for example, which nouns may be objects of a given verb, should not be discarded, and is in itself useful for analysis of text.
    In this study, we have looked only at the lexical relationship between a verb and the head nouns of its subject and object.
    Obviously, there are many other relationships among words -- for example, adjectival modification or the possibility of particular prepositional adjuncts -that can be extracted from a corpus and that contribute to our lexical knowledge.
    It will be useful to extend the analysis presented here to other kinds of relationships, including more complex kinds of verb complementation, noun complementation. and modification both preceding and following the head noun.
    But in expanding the number of different structural relations noted, it may become less useful to compute a single-dimensional similarity score of the sort proposed in Section 4.
    Rather, the various lexical relations r
