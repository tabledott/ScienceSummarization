he target language.
    Figure 2 illustrates this experiment.
    In order to generate automatic subjectivity annotations, we use the OpinionFinder tool developed by (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005).
    OpinionFinder includes two classifiers.
    The first one is a rule-based highprecision classifier that labels sentences based on the presence of subjective clues obtained from a large lexicon.
    The second one is a high-coverage classifier that starts with an initial corpus annotated using the high-precision classifier, followed by several bootstrapping steps that increase the size of the lexicon and the coverage of the classifier.
    For most of our experiments we use the high-coverage classifier.
    Table 1 shows the performance of the two OpinionFinder classifiers as measured on the MPQA corpus (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005).
    As a raw corpus, we use a subset of the SemCor corpus (Miller et al., 1993), consisting of 107 documents with roughly 11,000 sentences.
    This is a balanced corpus covering a number of t
