 Natural Language Tools' and by ESPRIT BRA 3030 'Acquisition of Lexical Information from Machine-Readable Dictionaries.'
    We would like to thank Longman Group Ltd. for allowing us access to the LDOCE MRD and Ann Copestake and Antonio Sanfilippo for considerable help in the analysis of the LDOCE noun definition corpus.
    Richard Sharman kindly calculated the perplexity measures for this corpus.
    In addition, Hiyan Alshawi, David Weir, and Steve Young have helped clarify our thinking and made several suggestions that have influenced the way this research has developed.
    Alex Lascarides and four anonymous reviewers' comments on earlier drafts were very helpful to us in preparing the final version.
    All errors and mistakes remain our responsibility.
