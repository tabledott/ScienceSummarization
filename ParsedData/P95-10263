in a given collocation was observed and quantified in (Yarowsky, 1993).
    This effect varies depending on the type of collocation.
    It is strongest for immediately adjacent collocations, and weakens with distance.
    It is much stronger for words in a predicate-argument relationship than for arbitrary associations at equivalent distance.
    It is very much stronger for collocations with content words than those with function words.'
    In general, the high reliability of this behavior (in excess of 97% for adjacent content words, for example) makes it an extremely useful property for sense disambiguation.
    A supervised algorithm based on this property is given in (Yarowsky, 1994).
    Using a decision list control structure based on (Rivest, 1987), this algorithm integrates a wide diversity of potential evidence sources (lemmas, inflected forms, parts of speech and arbitrary word classes) in a wide diversity of positional relationships (including local and distant collocations, trigram sequences, a
