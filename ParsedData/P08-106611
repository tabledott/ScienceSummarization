of the combinatory category operations.
    We first introduce three meta category operations.
    Two of them are unary operations, left raising (LR) and right raising (RR), and one is the binary operation unification (UF).
    First, the raising operations are used to turn a completed fixed structure into a floating structure.
    It is easy to verify the following theorem according to the definitions.
    Therefore we can always raise a fixed structure if we assume it is complete, i.e.
    (1) holds.
    Unification is well-defined if and only if we can unify all three elements and the result is a valid fixed or floating category.
    For example, we can unify a fixed structure with a floating structure or two floating structures in the same direction, but we cannot unify two fixed structures.
    Next we introduce the four tree operations on dependency structures.
    Instead of providing the formal definition, we use figures to illustrate these operations to make it easy to understand.
