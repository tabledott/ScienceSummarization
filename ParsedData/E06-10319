vements, we drop this constraint for the candidate translation.
    That is, only the words in the reference sentence have to be covered exactly once, whereas those in the candidate sentence can be covered zero, one, or multiple times.
    Dropping the constraints makes an efficient computation of the distance possible.
    We drop the constraints for the candidate sentence and not for the reference sentence because we do not want any information contained in the reference to be omitted.
    Moreover, the reference translation will not contain unnecessary repetitions of blocks.
    The new measure &#8211; which will be called CDER in the following &#8211; can thus be seen as a measure oriented towards recall, while measures like BLEU are guided by precision.
    The CDER is based on the CDCD distance2 introduced in (Lopresti and Tomkins, 1997).
    The authors show there that the problem of finding the optimal solution can be solved in O(I2 &#183; L) time, where I is the length of the candidate sentence and L
