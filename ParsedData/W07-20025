 evaluate the systems ac cording to some performance in an application, e.g. information retrieval (Schu?tze, 1998).
			This is a veryattractive idea, but requires expensive system devel opment and it is sometimes difficult to separate the reasons for the good (or bad) performance.In this task we decided to adopt the first two alternatives, since they allow for comparison over pub licly available systems of any kind.
			With this goal onmind we gave all the participants an unlabeled cor pus, and asked them to induce the senses and create a clustering solution on it.
			We evaluate the results according to the following types of evaluation: 1.
			Evaluate the induced senses as clusters of ex-.
			amples.
			The induced clusters are compared to the sets of examples tagged with the given gold standard word senses (classes), and evaluated using the FScore measure for clusters.
			We will call this evaluation unsupervised.
			2.
			Map the induced senses to gold standard.
