as blue-green are usually hyphenated and thus better considered as a compound. addition to statistical measures, is a unique property of our work and significantly improves the accuracy of our results.
    One other published model for grouping semantically related words (Brown et al., 1992), is based on a statistical model of bigrams and trigrams and produces word groups using no linguistic knowledge, but no evaluation of the results is reported.
    During the first stage, the system extracts adjective-noun and adjective-adjective pairs from the corpus.
    To determine the syntactic category of each word, and identify the NP boundaries and the syntactic relations among the words, we used the Fidditch parser (Hindle, 1989).
    For each NP, we then determine its minimal NP, that part of an NP consisting of the head noun and its adjectival pre-modifiers2.
    We match a set of regular expressions, consisting of syntactic categories and representing the different forms a minimal NP can take, against the NPs.
