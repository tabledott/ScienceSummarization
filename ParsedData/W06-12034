 attempt to determine whether the difference between the contexts in which an MWE appears and the contexts in which its component words appear can indeed serve to tell us whether the MWE has an idiomatic use.
    In our experiments we make use of lexical semantic analysis (LSA) as a model of contextsimilarity (Deerwester et al., 1990).
    Since this technique is often used to model meaning, we will speak in terms of &#8220;meaning&#8221; similiarity.
    It should be clear, however, that we are only using the LSA vectors&#8212;derived from context of occurrence in a corpus&#8212;to model meaning and meaning composition in a very rough way.
    Our hope is simply that this rough model is sufficient to the task of identifying non-compositional MWEs.
  
  
    Recent work which attempts to discriminate between compositional and non-compositional MWEs include Lin (1999), who used mutualinformation measures identify such phrases, Baldwin et al. (2003), who compare the distribution of the head of the MWE with the
