y definition this will not correspond to a simplex sense of the word.
    We deal with polysemy of the constituent words and/or MWE by simply looking for the existence of a sense of the constituent words which subsumes a sense of the MWE.
    The function hyponym(wordi, mwe) thus returns a value of 1 if some sense of wordz subsumes a sense of mwe, and a value of 0 otherwise.
    A more proactive means of utilising the WordNet hierarchy is to derive a semantic distance based on analysis of the relative location of senses in WordNet.
    Budanitsky and Hirst (2001) evaluated the performance of five different methods that measure the semantic distance between words in the WordNet Hierarchy, which Patwardhan et al. (2003) have then implemented and made available for general use as the Perl package distance-0.11.2 We focused in particular on the following three measures, the first two of which are based on information theoretic principles, and the third on sense topology: &#8226; Resnik (1995) combined WordNet wit
