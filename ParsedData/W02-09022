than producing parallel texts.
    To illustrate this point: The world wide web alone contains currently over two billion pages, a number that is still growing exponentially.
    According to Google,2 the word directory occurs 61 million times, empathy 383,000 times, and reflex 787,000 times.
    In the Hansard, each of these words occurs only once.

    Specifically, we want to automatically generate a one-to-one mapping of German and English nouns.
    We are testing our mappings against a bilingual lexicon of 9,206 German and 10,645 English nouns.
