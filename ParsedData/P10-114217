8212; classification and clustering &#8212; is undesirable.
    Since the classification model is trained independently of the clustering algorithm, improvements in classification accuracy do not guarantee corresponding improvements in clustering-level accuracy.
    That is, overall performance on the coreference task might not improve.
    To address this problem, McCallum and Wellner (2004) and Finley and Joachims (2005) eliminate the classification step entirely, treating coreference as a supervised clustering task where a similarity metric is learned to directly maximize clustering accuracy.
    Klenner (2007) and Finkel and Manning (2008) use ILP to ensure that the pairwise classification decisions satisfy transitivity.6 While many of the aforementioned algorithms for clustering and anaphoricity determination have been shown to improve coreference performance, the underlying model with which they are used in combination &#8212; the mention-pair model &#8212; remains fundamentally weak.
    The model has
