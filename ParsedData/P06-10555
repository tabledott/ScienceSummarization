, for scoring.
    All reported development set results are averages over four runs.
    For the final test we selected the grammar that performed best on the development set.
    Our experiments are based on a completely unannotated X-bar style grammar, obtained directly from the Penn Treebank by the binarization procedure shown in Figure 1.
    For each local tree rooted at an evaluation nonterminal X, we introduce a cascade of new nodes labeled X so that each has two children.
    Rather than experiment with head-outward binarization as in Klein and Manning (2003), we simply used a left branching binarization; Matsuzaki et al. (2005) contains a comparison showing that the differences between binarizations are small.
  
  
    To obtain a grammar from the training trees, we want to learn a set of rule probabilities &#946; on latent annotations that maximize the likelihood of the training trees, despite the fact that the original trees lack the latent annotations.
