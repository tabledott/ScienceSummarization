    The Internet Archive (http://www.archive.org/web/researcher/) is a nonprofit organization attempting to archive the entire publicly available Web, preserving the content and providing free access to researchers, historians, scholars, and the general public.
    Data come from crawls done by Alexa Internet, and hence they represent an industry-level resource of the sort not easily constructed within academia.
    At present, the Archive contains 120TB (terabytes) of data, by a conservative estimate, and it is growing at approximately 8TB per month.
    Text on the archive comprises over 10 billion Web pages, and the estimated duplicate rate is a factor of two (i.e., two copies of everything).12 The Internet Archive provides public access to the data via the Wayback Machine Web interface.
