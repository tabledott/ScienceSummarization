atures for classifying the current node.
    This is similar to the Conditional Markov Models (CMM) often used in information extraction (McCallum, Freitag, and Pereira 2000).
    Notice that here the previous two nodes classified are not in general the previous two nodes assigned non-NONE labels.
    If a linear order on all nodes is imposed, then the previous two nodes classified most likely bear the label NONE.
    Language model lattice re-scoring: Re-scoring of an N-best lattice with a trigram language model over semantic role label sequences.
    The target predicate is also part of the sequence.
    These ways of incorporating joint information resulted in small gains over a baseline system using only the features of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).
    The performance gain due to joint information over a system using all features was not reported.
    The joint information captured by this model is limited by the n-gram Markov assumption of the language model over labels.
    In our work, we improve the mo
