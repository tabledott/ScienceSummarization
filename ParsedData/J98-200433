    As an additional verification of our results, we gathered data on speed versus accuracy.
    For this experiment, we used the probabilistic context-free grammar learned from the Brown corpus and the average-length test sentences described in Section 5.4.
    For each figure of merit, we computed the average precision and recall of the best parse found as compared to the number of edges created.
    We computed unlabeled precision and recall only, since our grammar uses a different set of nonterminals from those used in the test data.
    Precision is defined as the percentage of the constituents proposed by our parser that are actually correct according to the treebank.
    For each edge count, we measured the precision of the best parse of each sentence found within that number of edges.
    Figure 15 is a graph of the average precision for the 0 figures of merit from Section 3, plotted against edge counts.
    The fluctuations at the low edge counts are due to the small amount o
