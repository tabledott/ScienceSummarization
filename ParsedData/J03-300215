ty of the alignment.
    The dynamic programming algorithm tries to optimize the correspondence of identical tokens, which represent markup.2 As a side effect, the nonmarkup text chunks are placed in correspondence with one another (e.g., the &#8220;Emergency Exit&#8221; and &#8220;Sortie de Secours&#8221; chunks in the above example).
    The more such pairings are found, the more likely the candidate documents are to represent a valid translation pair.
    The remaining two parameters (r and p) quantify the extent to which the corresponding nonmarkup chunks are correlated in length.
    When two documents are aligned with one another and are valid translations, there is a reliably linear relationship in the length of translated chunks of text: short pieces correspond with short pieces, medium with medium, and long with long.
    The Pearson correlation coefficient r for the lengths will be closer to one when the alignment has succeeded in lining up translated pieces of text, and the p value quantifies the r
