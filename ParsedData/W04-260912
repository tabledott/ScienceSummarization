aphrased by all types ofNP constructions?, (4) How many NPs are lexicalized?
    We have assembled a corpus from two sources: Wall Street Journal articles from TREC-9, and eXtended WordNet glosses (XWN) (http://xwn.hlt.utdallas.edu).
    We used XWN 2.0 since all its glosses are syntactically parsed and their words semantically disambiguated which saved us considerable amount of time.
    Table 2 shows for each syntactic category the number of randomly selected sentences from each corpus, the number of instances found in these sentences, and finally the number of instances that our group managed to annotate by hand.
    The annotation of each example consisted of specifying its feature vector and the most appropriate semantic relation from those listed in Table 1.
  
  
    The annotators, four PhD students in Computational Semantics worked in groups of two, each group focusing on one half of the corpora to annotate.
    Noun - noun (adjective - noun, respectively) sequences of words were extracted using the
