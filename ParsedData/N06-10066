, num(x3, x4), 46(x4).
    There is a term corresponding to each node and arc, and the resolution steps at the core of weighted abduction theorem proving consider matching an individual node of the hypothesis (e.g. rose(e1)) with something from the text (e.g. fell(e1)), just as in the graph-matching approach.
    The two models become distinct when there is a good supply of additional linguistic and world knowledge axioms&#8212;as in Moldovan et al. (2003) but not Raina et al.
    (2005).
    Then the theorem prover may generate intermediate forms in the proof, but, nevertheless, individual terms are resolved locally without reference to global context.
    Finally, a few efforts (Akhmatova, 2005; Fowler et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005) have tried to translate sentences into formulas of first-order logic, in order to test logical entailment with a theorem prover.
    While in principle this approach does not suffer from the limitations we describe below, in practice it has not borne much fruit.
