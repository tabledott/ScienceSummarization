 log linear framework and the estimation procedures are extremely general, and they apply directly to stochastic versions of HPSG and other theories of grammar.
  
  
    We follow the statistical literature in using the term feature to refer to the properties that parameters are associated with (we use the word &amp;quot;attribute&amp;quot; to refer to the attributes or features of a UBG's feature structure).
    Let SZ be the set of all possible grammatical or well-formed analyses.
    Each feature f maps a syntactic analysis to E S/ to a real value f (w).
    The form of a syntactic analysis depends on the underlying linguistic theory.
    For example, for a PCFG co would be parse tree, for a LFG co would be a tuple consisting of (at least) a c-structure, an fstructure and a mapping from c-structure nodes to f-structure elements, and for a Chomskyian transformational grammar co would be a derivation.
    Log-linear models are models in which the log probability is a linear combination of feature values (pl
