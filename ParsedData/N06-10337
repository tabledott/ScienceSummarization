al. (2004): where the reorderings of nonterminals are denoted by variables xi.
    Notice that the first rule has a multi-level lefthand side subtree.
    This system can model nonisomorphic transformations on English parse trees to &#8220;fit&#8221; another language, for example, learning that the (S (V O)) structure in English should be transformed into a (V S O) structure in Arabic, by looking at two-level tree fragments (Knight and Graehl, 2005).
    From a synchronous rewriting point of view, this is more akin to synchronous tree substitution grammar (STSG) (Eisner, 2003).
    This larger locality is linguistically motivated and leads to a better parameter estimation.
    By imagining the left-hand-side trees as special nonterminals, we can virtually create an SCFG with the same generative capacity.
    The technical details will be explained in Section 3.2.
    In general, if we are given an arbitrary synchronous rule with many nonterminals, what are the good decompositions that lead to a binary grammar
