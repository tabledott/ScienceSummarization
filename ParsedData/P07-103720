pendency and the syntax information from the context, whereas a normal POS tag just describes the general syntactic category of the word without further constraints.
    In this experiment we compared the effect of using supertags and POS tags on translation quality.
    As can be seen in Table 3, while the POS tags help (0.65 BLEU points, or 1.7% relative increase over the baseline), they clearly underperform compared to the supertag model (by 3.2%).
    The Usefulness of a Supertagged LM In these experiments we study the effect of the two added feature (cost) functions: supertagged translation and language models.
    We compare the baseline system to the supertags system with the supertag phrasetable probability but without the supertag LM.
    Table 4 lists the baseline system (Base-SMALL), the LTAG system without supertagged language model (LTAG-TM-ONLY) and the LTAG-SMALL system with both supertagged translation and language models.
    The results presented in Table 4 indicate that the improvement is a
