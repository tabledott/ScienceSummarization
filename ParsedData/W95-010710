 1994).
    While this automatic derivation process introduced a small percentage of errors of its own, it was the only practical way both to provide the amount of training data required and to allow for fully-automatic testing.
    The goal of the &amp;quot;baseNP&amp;quot; chunks was to identify essentially the initial portions of nonrecursive noun phrases up to the head, including determiners but not including postmodifying prepositional phrases or clauses.
    These chunks were extracted from the Treebank parses, basically by selecting NPs that contained no nested NPs1.
    The handling of conjunction followed that of the Treebank annotators as to whether to show separate baseNPs or a single baseNP spanning the conjunction2.
    Possessives were treated as a special case, viewing the possessive marker as the first word of a new baseNP, thus flattening the recursive structure in a useful way.
    The following sentences give examples of this baseNP chunk structure: During [N the third quarter N] , [N Compa
