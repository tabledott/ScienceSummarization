ual.
    Ideally, of course, one would like to annotate many other semantic relations that hold between parts of a text, because they are also relevant for text interpretation.
    One candidate is the relation of anaphora.
    Loosely speaking&#8212;and glossing over some difficulties regarding the precise delimitation of anaphora (Sidner 1979; Partee 1989; van Deemter 1992)&#8212;an NP al is said to take an NP a2 as its anaphoric antecedent if and only if al depends on az for its interpretation (e.g., Kamp and Reyle 1993).
    It follows that anaphora and coreference are different things.
    Coreference, for example, is an equivalence relation; anaphora, by contrast, is irreflexive, nonsymmetrical, and nontransitive.
    Secondly, anaphora, as it has just been defined, implies context-sensitivity of interpretation, and this is not true for coreference.
    For example, a name (President W. J. Clinton) and a description (Hillary Rodham's husband) can corefer without either of the two depending on the other
