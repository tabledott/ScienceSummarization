22;; PRO&#8222; is the subset of CD&#8222; where NP is a third person definite pronoun; CDn-i is the contextual domain for the previous FIC, and CDs is the contextual domain for the current segment.
    FIC n continues the current segment if it is anaphorically linked to the preceding clause 1) by a coreferential NP, or 2) by an inferential relation, or 3) if a third person definite pronoun in FIC&#8222; refers to an entity in the current segment.
    If no boundary is added, CDs is updated with CD.
    If all 3 tests fail, FIC, is determined to begin a new segment, and (FICn_i ,FIC&#8222;) is added to B.
    Table 3 shows the average performance of the referring expression algorithm (row labelled NP) on the 4 measures we use here.
    Recall is .66 (a=.068; max=1; min=.25), precision is .25 (a=.013; max=.44; min=.09), fallout is .16 (a=.004) and error rate is 0.17 (o-=.005).
    Note that the error rate and fallout, which in a sense are more sensitive measures of inaccuracy, are both much lower than the prec
