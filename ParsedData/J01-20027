plied to other NLP tasks with good results (see Section 6).
    In the remaining sections, we first introduce classifier combination on the basis of previous work in the machine learning literature and present the combination methods we use in our experiments (Section 2).
    Then we explain our experimental setup (Section 3), also describing the corpora (3.1) and tagger generators (3.2) used in the experiments.
    In Section 4, we go on to report the overall results of the experiments, starting with a comparison between the component taggers (and hence between the underlying tagger generators) and continuing with a comparison of the combination methods.
    The results are examined in more detail in Section 5, where we discuss such aspects as accuracy on specific words or tags, the influence of inconsistent training data, training set size, the contribution of individual component taggers, and tagset granularity.
    In Section 6, we discuss the results in the light of related work, after which we conclude
