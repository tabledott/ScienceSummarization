 underlying features themselves, in terms of both better understanding of how speakers use them, and ways to reliably extract them from data.
    Regarding the data itself, we saw that the distribution of DAs in our corpus limits the benefit of DA modeling for lower-level processing, in particular speech recognition.
    The reason for the skewed distribution was in the nature of the task (or lack thereof) in Switchboard.
    It remains to be seen if more fine-grained DA distinctions can be made reliably in this corpus.
    However, it should be noted that the DA definitions are really arbitrary as far as tasks other than DA labeling are concerned.
    This suggests using unsupervised, self-organizing learning schemes that choose their own DA definitions in the process of optimizing the primary task, whatever it may be.
    Hand-labeled DA categories may still serve an important role in initializing such an algorithm.
    We believe that dialogue-related tasks have much to benefit from corpus-driven, automati
