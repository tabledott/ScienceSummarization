TOPIC but gives no further information about what those semantic structures actually contain.
    Our general correspondence architecture thus applies naturally to the problem of translation.
    But there are constraints on correspondences specific to translation that this general architecture does not address.
    For instance, the description of the target-language structures derived from the source-language is incomplete.
    The target structures may and usually will have grammatical and semantic features that are not determined by the source.
    It makes little sense, for example, to include information about grammatical gender in the transfer process if this feature is exhaustively determined by the grammar of the target language.
    We can formalize the relation between the information contained in the transfer component and an adequate translation of the source sentence into a target sentence as follows: for a target sentence to be an adequate translation of a given source sentence, it must be the
