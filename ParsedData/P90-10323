[Boguraev &amp; Briscoe 89], [Church 89], none of these systems retrieves the entire range of collocations that we identify and no real effort has been made to use this information for language generation [Boguraev &amp; Briscoe 89].
    In the following sections, we describe the range of collocations that we can handle, the fully implemented acquisition method, results obtained, and the representation of collocations in Functional Unification Grammars (FUGs) [Kay 79].
    Our application domain is the domain of stock market reports and the corpus on which our expertise is based consists of more than 10 million words taken from the Associated Press news wire.
  
  
    Collocational knowledge indicates which members of a set of roughly synonymous words co-occur with other words and how they combine syntactically.
    These affinities can not be predicted on the basis of semantic or syntactic rules, but can be observed with some regularity in text [Cruse 86].
