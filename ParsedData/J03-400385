 location: at the NP preceding the coordinator.
    At this point the NP following the coordinator has not been built, and its head noun is not in the contextual window.
    Figure 23 shows an appositive example in which the head noun of the appositive NP is not in the contextual window when the decision is made.
    These last two examples can be extended to illustrate another problem.
    The NP after the conjunct or comma could be the subject of a following clause.
    For example, (a) and (b) are two candidate structures for the same sequence of words.
    (c) shows the first decision (labeled &#8220;?&#8221;) in which the two structures differ.
    The arc above the NP can go either left (for high attachment (a) of the appositive phrase) or right (for noun attachment (b) of the appositive phrase). in John likes Mary and Bill loves Jill, the decision not to coordinate Mary and Bill is made just after the NP Mary is built.
    At this point, the verb loves is outside the contextual window, and the model ha
