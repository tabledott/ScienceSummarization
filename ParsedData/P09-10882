o learn a phrase-based string transducer directly from aligned sentence pairs, doing away with the separate word alignment step (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Cherry and Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2008b; Blunsom et al., 2008).
    Unfortunately none of these approaches resulted in an unqualified success, due largely to intractable estimation.
    Large training sets with hundreds of thousands of sentence pairs are common in machine translation, leading to a parameter space of billions or even trillions of possible bilingual phrase-pairs.
    Moreover, the inference procedure for each sentence pair is non-trivial, proving NP-complete for learning phrase based models (DeNero and Klein, 2008) or a high order polynomial (O(|f|3|e|3))1 for a sub-class of weighted synchronous context free grammars (Wu, 1997).
    Consequently, for such models both the parameterisation and approximate inference techniques are fundamental to their success.
    In this paper we present a novel SCFG translation model using a non-parametric Bayes
