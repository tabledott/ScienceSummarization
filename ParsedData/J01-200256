 is again performing excellently, in all cases improving on the best base tagger for the pair.
    For an additional point of view, we show the precision and recall values of the systems on the same tags in Table 9, as well as the percentage of the test set that should be tagged with each specific tag.
    The differences between the taggers are again present, and in all but two cases the combiner produces the best score for both precision and recall.
    Furthermore, as precision and recall form yet another balanced pair, that is, as improvements in recall tend to decrease precision and vice versa, the remaining two cases (NN and VBD), can be considered to be handled quite adequately as well.
    Seeing the rather bad overall performance of the combiners on WSJ, we feel the need to identify a property of the WSJ material that can explain this relative lack of success.
    A prime candidate for this property is the allegedly very low degree of consistency of the WSJ material.
    We can investigate the effect
