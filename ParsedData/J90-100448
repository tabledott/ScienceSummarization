once there is some node X (the first argument of head_gap), then there could just as well have been the empty node Y (the second argument of head_gap).
    Note that a lot of information is shared between the two nodes, thereby making the relation between anaphor and antecedent explicit.
    Such rules can be incorporated in the generator by adding the following clause for connect: connect(Pivot,Root) head_ gap(Pivot,Gap), connect(Gap,Root).
    Note that the problem is now solved because the gap will only be selected after its antecedent has been built.
    Some parts of this antecedent are then unified with some parts of the gap.
    The subcategorization list, for example, will thus be instantiated in time.
  
  
    We mentioned earlier that, although the algorithm as stated is applicable specifically to generation, we expect that it could be thought of as an instance of a uniform architecture for parsing and generation, as the Earley generation algorithm was.
    Two pieces of evidence point this way.
