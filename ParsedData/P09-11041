l constraints on the relationship between a sentence and its translation.
    ITG has been extensively explored in unsupervised statistical word alignment (Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Cherry and Lin, 2007a; Zhang et al., 2008) and machine translation decoding (Cherry and Lin, 2007b; Petrov et al., 2008).
    In this work, we investigate large-scale, discriminative ITG word alignment.
    Past work on discriminative word alignment has focused on the family of at-most-one-to-one matchings (Melamed, 2000; Taskar et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2006).
    An exception to this is the work of Cherry and Lin (2006), who discriminatively trained one-to-one ITG models, albeit with limited feature sets.
    As they found, ITG approaches offer several advantages over general matchings.
    First, the additional structural constraint can result in superior alignments.
    We confirm and extend this result, showing that one-toone ITG models can perform as well as, or better than, general one-to-one matching models, either using h
