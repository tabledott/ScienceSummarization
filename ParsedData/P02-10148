    Both sets of results are at least as strong as the original Soon results (row one of Table 2), indicating indirectly that our Baseline system is a reasonable duplication of that system.4 In addition, the trees produced by Soon and by our Duplicated Soon Baseline are essentially the same, differing only in two places where the Baseline system imposes additional conditions on coreference.
    The primary reason for improvements over the original Soon system for the MUC-6 data set appears to be our higher upper bound on recall (93.8% vs. 89.9%), due to better identification of NPs.
    For MUC-7, our improvement stems from increases in precision, presumably due to more accurate feature value computation.
  
  
    This section studies the effect of three changes to the general machine learning framework employed by Soon et al. with the goal of improving precision in the resulting coreference resolution systems.
