 preserving the values of p(t).
    We do not have sufficient space to describe this procedure here.
    Because of its greater computational complexity, we have only applied it to a biclass model, i.e. a model where The initial model is estimated by relative frequency on the whole training data and Viterbi tagging is used.
    As in the previous experiment, the results in Table 5 show the number of tagging errors when the model is trained with the standard or t-constrained ML training.
    They show that the t-constrained ML training still degrades the RF training, but not as quickly as the standard ML.
    Again, we have not tested what happens when smaller training data is used to build the initial model.

    Conclusion The results presented in this paper show that estimating the parameters of the model by counting relative frequencies over a very large amount of hand-tagged text lead to the best tagging accuracy.
    Maximum Likelihood training is guaranteed to improve perplexity, but will not nece
