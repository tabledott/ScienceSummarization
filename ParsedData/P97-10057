hat we are presented with the unfamiliar category FINANCIAL ANALYSTS.
    REPORT.
    By analyzing genres as bundles of facets, we can categorize this genre as INSTITUTIONAL (because of the use of we as in editorials and annual reports) and as NON-SUASIVE or non-argumentative (because of the low incidence of question marks. among other things), whereas a system trained on genres as atomic entities would not be able to make sense of an unfamiliar category.
    The first linguistic research on genre that uses quantitative methods is that of Biber (1986; 1988; 1992; 1995), which draws on work on stylistic analysis, readability indexing, and differences between spoken and written language.
    Biber ranks genres along several textual &amp;quot;dimensions&amp;quot;, which are constructed by applying factor analysis to a set of linguistic syntactic and lexical features.
    Those dimensions are then characterized in terms such as &amp;quot;informative vs. involved&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;narrative vs. non-narrative.
