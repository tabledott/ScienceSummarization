ng track (NIST, 2008).
    To our knowledge, this is the best result reported on this task.
    In this section, we evaluate the effect of the semantic similarity model and the surface similarity model by varying the interpolation weight &#945; of (2).
    The results on both the dev and test sets are reported in Table 4.
    In one extreme case, &#945; = 1, the overall similarity model is based only on semantic similarity.
    This gives a case insensitive BLEU score of 41.70% and a case sensitive BLEU score of 28.92% on the dev and test set, respectively.
    The accuracy is significantly improved to 43.62% on the dev set and 30.89% on test set when &#945; = 0.3.
    In another extreme case, &#945; = 0, in which only the surface similarity model is used for the overall similarity model, the performance degrades by about 0.2 point.
    Therefore, the surface similarity information seems more important for monolingual hypothesis alignment, but both sub-models are useful.
    We investigate the effect of the d
