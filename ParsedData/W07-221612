(i, j)k* in place of (i, j)k and obtain a higher weighted tree.
    Therefore, without effecting the solution to the argmax problem, we can delete all edges in Gx that do not satisfy this property.
    The resulting digraph is no longer a multi-digraph and the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm can be applied directly.
    The new runtime is O(|L|n2).
    As a side note, the k-best argmax problem for digraphs can be solved in O(kn2) (Camerini et al., 1980).
    This can also be easily extended to the multidigraph case for labeled parsing.
    A common step in many learning algorithms is to compute the sum over the weight of all the possible outputs for a given input x.
    This value is often referred to as the partition function due to its similarity with a value by the same name in statistical mechanics.
    We denote this value as Zx, To compute this sum it is possible to use the Matrix Tree Theorem for multi-digraphs, Matrix Tree Theorem (Tutte, 1984): Let G be a multi-digraph with nodes V = 10, 1, ... , n} and ed
