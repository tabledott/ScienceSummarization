k and applied to the sentences in the blind test set.
    The authors' algorithm achieves a higher rate of success (4%) than Hobbs' algorithm.
    The relation of the algorithm to the centering approach is discussed, as well as to models of anaphora resolution that invoke a variety of informational factors in ranking antecedent candidates.
  
  
    We present an algorithm for identifying both intrasentential and intersentential antecedents of pronouns in text.
    We refer to this algorithm as RAP (Resolution of Anaphora Procedure).
    RAP applies to the syntactic structures of McCord's (1990, 1993, in press) Slot Grammar parser, and like the parser, it is implemented in Prolog.
    It relies on measures of salience derived from syntactic structure and a simple dynamic model of attentional state to select the antecedent noun phrase (NP) of a pronoun from a list of candidates.
    It does not employ semantic conditions (beyond those implicit in grammatical number and gender agreement) or real-world knowledge
