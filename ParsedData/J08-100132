 limited number of alternatives.
    In practice, the space of candidates can be vast, and finding the optimal candidate may require pairing our ranking algorithm with a decoder similar to the ones used in machine translation (Germann et al. 2004).
    Although the majority of our experiments fall within the generate-and-rank framework previously sketched, nothing prevents the use of our feature vector representation for conventional classification tasks.
    We offer an illustration in Experiment 3, where features extracted from entity grids are used to enhance the performance of a readability assessment system.
    Here, the learner takes as input a set of documents labeled with discrete classes (e.g., denoting whether a text is difficult or easy to read) and learns to make predictions for unseen instances (see Section 6 for details on the machine learning paradigm we employ).
  
  
    Text structuring algorithms (Lapata 2003; Barzilay and Lee 2004; Karamanis et al. 2004) are commonly evaluated by their pe
