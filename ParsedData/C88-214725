ch can be obtained by representing T by 718 (...t,~ A Z(b,~) A...) where I is the identity function.
  Similarly, we inay have to attempt ad- junction at ~ by any auxiliary tree (SA constraints are handled by success or failure of unification).
  Thus, if/31,...,/3, form the set of auxiliary tree, we have a function, F, given by V = AL( Im( I )  v .
  ( / )  V I ( I ) )  = ~f .
  V l~( I )  v f ) and represent 7 by (.. .t,  A F(b,) A. .
  Ill this way, we can represent tile elementary trees (and hence tile gram- mar) in an extended version of rt-K logic (to which we add A-abstraction and application).
  3,1  Representing Tree Adjoining Grammars We will now turn our attention to the actual representation f an FTAG grammar, having considered how the individual elementary trees are rep- resented.
  According to our discussion i  the previous ection, the auxiliary trees are represented as functions of the form Az.e where e is a term in FSTR which involves the variable ~.
  If/31,..., #n are the auxiliary trees of
