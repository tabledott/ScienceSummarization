 drive, the words of interest are separated by a fixed number of words and there is very little variance.
    In the 1988 AP, it was found that the two words are always exactly two words apart whenever they are found near each other (within five words).
    That is, the mean separation is two, and the variance is zero.
    Compounds also have very fixed word order (little variance), but the average separation is closer to one word rather than two.
    In contrast, relations such as man/woman are less fixed, as indicated by a larger variance in their separation.
    (The nearly zero value for the mean separation for man/women indicates the words appear about equally often in either order.)
    Lexical relations come in several varieties.
    There are some like refraining from that are fairly fixed, others such as coming from that may be separated by an argument, and still others like keeping from that are almost certain to be separated by an argument.
    The ideal window size is different in each case.
