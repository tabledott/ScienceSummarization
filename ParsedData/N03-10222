ntactic subjects, prepositional attachments, complex nominals, and adverbial/adjectival adjuncts provided by the logic representation of text.
    In addition to the logic representations of questions and candidate answers, the QA Logic Prover needs world knowledge axioms to link question concepts to answer concepts.
    These axioms are provided by the WordNet glosses represented in logic forms.
    Additionally, the prover needs rewriting procedures for semantically equivalent lexical patterns.
    With this deep and intelligent representation, COGEX effectively and efficiently re-ranks candidate answers by their correctness, extracts the exact answer, and ultimately eliminates incorrect answers.
    In this way, the Logic Prover is a powerful tool in boosting the accuracy of the QA system.
    Moreover, the trace of a proof constitutes a justification for that answer.
    The challenges one faces when using automated reasoning in the context of NLP include: logic representation of open text, need of world
