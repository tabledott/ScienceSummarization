ly, the method stores the feature vectors on the hard disc.
			The next two loops build the main part of the training algorithm.
			The outer loop iterates over the number of training epochs, while the innerloop iterates over all training examples.
			The on line training algorithm considers a single training example in each iteration.
			The first function in the loop reads the features and computes the weights A for the factors in the sentence xi.
			A is a set of weight arrays.
			A = {??w ? ??f h,d,??w ? ??f h,d,s,??w ? ??f h,d,g} The parsing algorithm uses the weight arrays to predict a projective dependency structure yp.
			The non-projective approximation algorithm has as input the dependency structure and the weightarrays.
			It rearranges the edges and tries to in crease the total score of the dependency structure.
			This algorithm builds a dependency structure ya,which might be non-projective.
			The training al gorithm updates ??w according to the difference between the predicted dependency struct
