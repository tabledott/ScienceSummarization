same function.
    Pushing introduces an equivalence relation on minimal transducers: T Rp T' if p(T) -= p(T'), where p(T) (resp. p(T')) denotes the transducer obtained from T (resp.
    T') by pushing.
    Indeed, if T and T' are minimal transducers realizing the same function, then p(T) and p(T') are both equal to the unique minimal transducer equivalent to T and T' as defined in theorem 14.
    So, two equivalent minimal transducers only differ by their output labels, they have the same topology.
    They only differ by the way the output weights are spread along the paths.
    Notice that if we introduce a new super final state 43 to which each final state q is connected by a transition of weight p(q), then d(q) in the definition of T' is exactly the length of a shortest path from .11 to q.
    Thus, T' can be obtained from T using the classical single-source shortest paths algorithms such as that of Dijkstra (Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest 1992).13 lit case the transducer is acyclic, a classical linear ti
