We feel that well-defined tasks allow us to structure the workflow, allowing us to create taskspecific guidelines and using task-specific annotation tools to speed up annotation.
    More importantly, each task can be evaluated in a fairly straightforward way, contrary to for example the problems that pop up when evaluating two complex temporal graphs for the same document.
    In addition, tasks can be ranked, allowing systems to feed the results of one (more precise) task as a feature into another task.
    Splitting the task into substask reduces the error rate in the manual annotation, and that merging the different sub-task into a unique layer as a postprocessing operation (see figure 1) provides better and more reliable results (annotated data) than doing a complex task all at once.
  
  
    The data for the five languages were prepared independently of each other and do not comprise a parallel corpus.
    However, annotation specifications and guidelines for the five languages were developed in conjun
