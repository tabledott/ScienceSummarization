ries for k=3.
    In this revised version we have repeated the best experiment of the third series with the results for k=1 replaced by the k=3 results whenever the latter outperformed the first in the revised first experiment series.
    The results can be found in table 5.
    All formats benefited from this step.
    In this final experiment series the best results were obtained with IOB1 but the differences with the results of the other formats are not significant.
    We have used the optimal experiment configurations that we had obtained from the fourth experiment series for processing the complete (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) data set.
    The results can be found in table 6.
    They are better than the results for section 15 because more training data was used in these experiments.
    Again the best result was obtained with IOB1 (F0=1=92.37) which is an improvement of the best reported Fi3=1 rate for this data set ((Rainshaw and Marcus, 1995): 92.03).
    We would like to apply our learning approach t
