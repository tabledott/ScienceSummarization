n a maximum-likelihood framework.
    For example, Merialdo (1991) presents experiments learning HMMs using EM.
    Merialdo&#8217;s results most famously show that re-estimation degrades accuracy unless almost no examples are labeled.
    Less famously, his results also demonstrate that reestimation can improve tagging accuracies to some degree in the fully unsupervised case.
    One recent and much more successful approach to part-of-speech learning is contrastive estimation, presented in Smith and Eisner (2005).
    They utilize task-specific comparison neighborhoods for part-ofspeech tagging to alter their objective function.
    Both of these works require specification of the legal tags for each word.
    Such dictionaries are large and embody a great deal of lexical knowledge.
    A prototype list, in contrast, is extremely compact.
  
  
    Grenager et al. (2005) presents an unsupervised approach to an information extraction task, called CLASSIFIEDS here, which involves segmenting classified advertis
