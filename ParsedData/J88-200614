eflect the effect of discourse structure on TF.
  
  
    Tense may not seem prima facie anaphoric: an isolated sentence like John went to bed or I met a man who looked like a basset hound appears to make sense in a way that a stand-alone He went to bed or The man went to bed does not.
    On the other hand, if some time or event is established by the context (i.e., either by an event or situation described in the previous discourse or by a temporal adverbial in the current sentence&#8212;cf.
    Passonneau, and Moens and Steedman, this volume), tense will invariably be interpreted with respect to it, as in: In each case, the interpretation of John's going to bed is linked to an explicitly mentioned time or event.
    This is what underlies all discussion of the anaphoric quality of tense.
    The assumption that tense is anaphoric (i.e., that its interpretation is linked to some time or event derived from context) goes back many years, although it is not a universally held belief (cf.
    Comrie 1985).
