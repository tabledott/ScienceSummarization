    All translation lexicons discussed in this paper were created and evaluated using the procedure in Figure 1.
    First, candidate translations were generated for each pair of aligned training sentences, by taking a simple cross-product of the words.
    Next, the candidate translations from each pair of training sentences were passed through a cascade of filters.
    The remaining candidate translations from all training sentence pairs were pooled together and fed into a fixed decision procedure.
    The output of the decision procedure was a model of word correspondences between the two halves of the training corpus &#8212; a translation lexicon.
    Each filter combination resulted in a different model.
    All the models were compared in terms of how well they represented a held-out test set.
    The evaluation was performed objectively and automatically using Bitext-Based
