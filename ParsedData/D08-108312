ng procedure (&#167;3.2).
    To assess the effect of compositional semantics in the learning-based methods, we also experiment with a simple classification approach that does not incorporate compositional semantics (&#167;3.1).
    The details of these two approaches are elaborated in the following subsections.
    Given an expression x consisting of n words xi, ..., xn, the task is to determine the polarity y E {positive, negative} of x.
    In our simple binary classification approach, x is represented as a vector of features f(x), and the prediction y is given by argmaxyw&#183;f(x, y), where w is a vector of parameters learned from training data.
    In our experiment, we use an online SVM algorithm called MIRA (Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm) (Crammer and Singer, 2003)7 for training.
    For each x, we encode the following features: a feature that indicates the dominant polarity of words in the given expression, without considering the effect of negators.
    For SC-NEGEX, we count the number of conten
