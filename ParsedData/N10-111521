ng each component the same weight, yield an accuracy of 90.8 on the CoNLL 2007 English dataset, making it the highest scoring system among the participants.
    When we investigate the POS category of mistaken instances, we see that for all parsers, nodes with structures of depth 2 and more which are assigned an incorrect head are predominantly PPs (headed by &#8217;IN&#8217;), followed by NPs (headed by &#8217;NN&#8217;).
    All parsers have a hard time dealing with PP attachment, but MST parser is better at it than NONDIR, and both are better than MALT.
    Looking further at the mistaken instances, we notice a tendency of the PP mistakes of the NONDIR parser to involve, before the PP, an NP embedded in a relative clause.
    This reveals a limitation of our parser: recall that for an edge to be built, the child must first acquire all its own children.
    This means that in case of relative clauses such as &#8220;I saw the boy [who ate the pizza] with my eyes&#8221;, the parser must decide if the PP &#822
