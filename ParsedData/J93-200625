s into, such as a parser that can efficiently follow many parses, but cannot recover easily from errors versus one capable of returning a partial parse, and on the application, such as an application requiring high accuracy (database query) versus one requiring high speed (processing newswire text as it comes in).
    In all of the tests discussed so far, we both trained and tested on sets of articles in the same domain, the Wall Street Journal subset of the Penn TREEBANK Project.
    However, an important measure of the usefulness of the system is how well it performs in other domains.
    While we would not expect high performance in radically different kinds of text, such as transcriptions of conversations or technical manuals, we would hope for similar performance on newspaper articles from different sources and on other topics.
    We tested this hypothesis using data from the Third Message Understanding Conference (MUC-3).
    The goal of MUC-3 was to extract data from texts on terrorism in Latin Americ
