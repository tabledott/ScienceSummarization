    Learned decision tree for segmentation. the test.'
    A branch can either lead to the assignment of a class, or to another test.
    For example, the tree initially branches based on the value of the feature before.
    If the value is -sentence.final.contour then the first branch is taken and the potential boundary site is assigned the class nonboundary.
    If the value of before is +sentence.final.contour then the second branch is taken and the feature coref is tested.
    Figure 10 illustrates sample output of this algorithm (ML).
    The performance of this learned decision tree averaged over the 10 training narratives is shown in Table 8, on the line labeled &amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot;.
    The line labeled &amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot; shows the results from another machine learning experiment, in which one of the default C4.5 options used in &amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot; is overridden.
    The default C4.5 approach creates a separate subtree for each po
