NP (noun phrases) only.
    ASO-semi produces higher NP chunking performance than the others.
  
  
    Figure 9 shows F-measure obtained by computing O from individual types of auxiliary problems on named entity chunking.
    Both types &#8211; &#8220;Predict words&#8221; and &#8220;Predict top-2 choices of the classifier&#8221; &#8211; are useful, producing significant performance improvements over the supervised baseline.
    The best performance is achieved when O is produced from all of the auxiliary problems.
    To gain insights into the information obtained from unlabeled data, we examine the O entries associated with the feature &#8216;current words&#8217;, computed for the English named entity task.
    Figure 10 shows the features associated with the entries ofOwith the largest values, computed from the 2000 unsupervised auxiliary problems: &#8220;Predict previous words&#8221; and &#8220;Predict next words&#8221;.
    For clarity, the figure only shows words beginning with upper-case letters (i.e.,
