ndancy allows us to perform an in-depth study of how data quality improves with the number of independent annotations.
  
  
    We analyze the quality of non-expert annotations on five tasks: affect recognition, word similarity, recognizing textual entailment, temporal event recognition, and word sense disambiguation.
    In this section we define each annotation task and the parameters of the annotations we request using AMT.
    Additionally we give an initial analysis of the task results, and summarize the cost of the experiments.
    This experiment is based on the affective text annotation task proposed in Strapparava and Mihalcea (2007), wherein each annotator is presented with a list of short headlines, and is asked to give numeric judgments in the interval [0,100] rating the headline for six emotions: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise, and a single numeric rating in the interval [-100,100] to denote the overall positive or negative valence of the emotional content of the headline, as i
