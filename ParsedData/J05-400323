Since we are dealing with few parameters and have sufficiently many training instances, using more advanced training algorithms is unlikely to bring significant improvements.
    We test the performance of the classifier by generating test instances from a different parallel corpus (also around 5,000 sentence pairs) and checking how many of these instances are correctly classified.
    We prepare the test set by creating the Cartesian product of the sentences in the test parallel corpus and applying the word-overlap filter (we do not perform any balancing).
    Although we apply the filter, we still conceptually classify all pairs from the Cartesian product in a two-stage classification process: all pairs discarded by the filter are classified as &#8221;non-parallel,&#8221; and for the rest, we obtain predictions from the classifier.
    Since this is how we apply the system on truly unseen data, this is the process in whose performance we are interested.
    We measure the performance of the classification p
