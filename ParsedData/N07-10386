ceptron Ranking algorithm (or &#8220;PRank algorithm&#8221;), which reacts to incorrect predictions on the training set by updating the weight and boundary vectors.
    The PRanking model and algorithm were tested on the EachMovie dataset with a separate ranking model learned for each user in the database.
    An extension of this model is provided by Basilico and Hofmann (2004) in the context of collaborative filtering.
    Instead of training a separate model for each user, Basilico and Hofmann train a joint ranking model which shares a set of boundaries across all users.
    In addition to these shared boundaries, userspecific weight vectors are stored.
    To compute the score for input x and user i, the weight vectors for all users are employed: where 0 &lt; sim(i, j) &lt; 1 is the cosine similarity between users i and j, computed on the entire training set.
    Once the score has been computed, the prediction rule follows that of the PRanking model.
    The model is trained using the PRank algorithm, wi
