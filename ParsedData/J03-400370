e  |VP, told) + (1 &#8722; &#955;)Pml(Rule  |VP) Estimation interpolates between the specific, lexically sensitive distribution in Table 13 and the nonlexical estimate based on just the parent nonterminal, VP.
    There are many different rules in the more specific distribution (26 different rule types, out of 147 tokens in which told was a VP head), and there are several one-count rules (11 cases).
    From these statistics &#955; would have to be relatively low.
    There is a high chance that a new rule for told will be required in test data; therefore a reasonable amount of probability mass must be left to the backed-off estimate Pml(Rule  |VP).
    This estimation method is missing a crucial generalization: In spite of there being many different rules, the distribution over subcategorization frames is much sharper.
    Told is seen with only five subcategorization frames in training data: The large number of rules is almost entirely due to adjuncts or punctuation appearing after or between complements.
