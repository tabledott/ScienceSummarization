ntain newswire material, and so the two sources differ from each other in terms of vocabulary and syntactic constructs.
    1,000 annotated sentences from the Brown section of the Penn Treebank were used as the seed data.
    Co-training then proceeds using the WSJ.3 Note that no manually created parses in the WSJ domain are used by the parser, even though it is evaluated using WSJ material.
    In Figure 8, the lower curve shows performance for the CollinsCFG parser (again evaluated on section 0).
    The difference in corpus domain does not hinder cotraining.
    The parser performance is boosted from 75% to 77.3%.
    Note that most of the improvement is within the first 5 iterations.
    This suggests that the parsing model may be adapting to the vocabulary of the new domain.
    We also conducted an experiment in which the initial seed data was supplemented with a tiny amount of annotated data (100 manually annotated WSJ sentences) from the domain of the unlabelled data.
    This experiment simulates the
