			We define the tendency of Class i to be confused with Class j as follows: D ij = Err ij  2=(N i + N j ); (3) where (when using P 1 ), Err ij is the number ofquestions in Class i that are misclassified as belong P 1 Word Pos Chunk NE Head RelWord h 77.60 78.20 77.40 78.80 78.80 84.20 f 52.40 77.20 77.00 78.40 76.80 84.00 P =5 Word Pos Chunk NE Head RelWord h 86.00 86.60 87.60 88.60 89.40 95.00 f 83.20 86.80 86.60 88.40 89.80 95.60 Table 5: Comparing accuracy of the hierarchical (h) and flat (f) classifiers on 500 TREC 10 question; training is done on 5,500 questions.
