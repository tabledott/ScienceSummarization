			We do not assume a full parse as input.
			SRL is a difficult task, and one cannot expecthigh levels of performance from either purely man ual classifiers or purely learned classifiers.
			Rather, supplemental linguistic information must be used to support and correct a learning system.
			So far,machine learning approaches to SRL have incorpo rated linguistic information only implicitly, via theclassifiers?

			The key innovation in our ap proach is the development of a principled method tocombine machine learning techniques with linguistic and structural constraints by explicitly incorpo rating inference into the decision process.
			In the machine learning part, the system we present here is composed of two phases.
			First, a set of argument candidates is produced using twolearned classifiers?one to discover beginning po sitions and one to discover end positions of each argument type.
