 at least 20 ranks in between.
    Figures 2-9 show the results of using Algorithm 1 and 2 with the four feature sets.
    The -axis represents the number of iterations in the training.
    The left -axis stands for the BLEU% score on the test data, and the right -axis stands for log of the loss function on the development data.
    Algorithm 1, the splitting algorithm, converges on the first three feature sets.
    The smaller the feature set is, the faster the algorithm converges.
    It achieves a BLEU score of 31.7% on the Baseline, 32.8% on the Best Feature, but only 32.6% on the Top Twenty features.
    However it is within the range of 95% confidence.
    Unfortunately on the Large Set, Algorithm 1 converges very slowly.
    In the Top Twenty set there are a fewer number of individually non-discriminative feature making the pool of features &#8220;better&#8221;.
    In addition, generalization performance in the Top Twenty set is better than the Large Set due to the smaller set of &#8220;better&#8221;
