u is associated with an 'updater', a Prolog term (not shown to the author) that specifies how the knowledge base should be updated if the option is selected.
    In this case the updater is insert(procl, goal, schedule) meaning that an instance of type schedule should become the value of the goal attribute on prod.
    Running the updater yields an extended knowledge base, including a new instance schedl with an undefined attribute actee.
    (Assertions describing attribute values are indented to make the knowledge base easier to read.) procedure (prod). goal (procl, sched1) . schedule (schedl) . actee ( schedl , C) . method (proc1 , B) .
    From the updated knowledge base, the generator produces a new feedback text.
    Schedule this event by applying this method.
    Note that this text has been completely regenerated.
    It was not produced from the previous text merely by replacing the anchor this goal by a longer string.
    Continuing to specify the goal, the author now clicks on this event. appointm
