ithm with no threshold changes. accurate by the human judges).
    Second, it speeds up the execution of the algorithm, as all fractions r!
    's decrease and the overall number of candidate translations is reduced.
    However, as Figure 3 shows, high values of the threshold parameter cause the algorithm to miss a significant percentage of valid translations.
    Intuitively, we expect this problem to be alleviated if a higher threshold value is used for the final admittance of a translation, but a lower threshold is used internally when the subparts of the translation are considered.
    Our second simulation experiment tested this expectation for various values of the final threshold using a lower initial threshold equal to a constant a &lt; 1 times the final threshold.
    The results are represented by the remaining curves of Figure 3.
    Surprisingly, we found that with moderate values of a (close to 1) this method gives a very low failure rate even for high final threshold values, and is preferable t
