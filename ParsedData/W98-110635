ate slots sometimes end up in the case frames.
    For example, Figure 9 shows a case frame that is activated by passive forms of the verb &amp;quot;killed&amp;quot;.
    Some of the slots are correct: the subject is assigned to the victim slot and objects of the preposition &amp;quot;by&amp;quot; are assigned to the perpetrator and instrument slots.
    However, the remaining slots do not make sense.
    The location slot is the result of polysemy; many person names are also location names, such as &amp;quot;Flores&amp;quot;.
    The date slot was produced by incorrect parses of date expressions.
    The perpetrator (subject) and victim (pp (by)) slots were caused by incorrect role assignments.
    The list of domain roles assumes that terrorists are always perpetrators and civilians are always victims, but of course this is not true.
    Terrorists can be killed and civilians can be killers.
    The previous example illustrates some of the problems that can occur when generating case frames automatically.
