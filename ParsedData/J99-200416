 sequence using statistical information (described in Section 6) about individual supertags and their dependencies on other supertags.
    The chosen supertags are combined to derive a parse.
    Without the supertagger, the parser would have to process combinations of the entire set of trees (at least the 17 trees shown); with it the parser need only process combinations of 7 trees.
  
  
    The structure of the supertag can be best seen as providing admissibility constraints on syntactic environments in which it may be used.
    Some of these constraints can be checked locally.
    The following are a few constraints that can be used to determine the admissibility of a syntactic environment for a supertag:4 A selection of the supertags associated with each word of the sentence: the purchase price includes two ancillary companies.
    Supertags with the built-in lexical item by, that represent passive constructions are typically eliminated from being considered during the parse of an active sentence.
