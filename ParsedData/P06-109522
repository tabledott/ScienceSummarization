emporal relations in Chinese texts.
    (Mani et al. 2003) obtained 80.2 F-measure training a decision tree on 2069 clauses in anchoring events to reference times that were inferred for each clause.
    (Berglund et al. 2006) use a document-level evaluation approach pioneered by (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2000), which uses a distinct evaluation metric.
    Finally, (Lapata and Lascarides 2004) use found data to successfully learn which (possibly ambiguous) temporal markers connect a main and subordinate clause, without inferring underlying temporal relations.
    In terms of hand-coded approaches, (Mani and Wilson 2000) used a baseline method of blindly propagating TempEx time values to events based on proximity, obtaining 59.4% on a small sample of 8,505 words of text.
    (Filatova and Hovy 2001) obtained 82% accuracy on &#8216;timestamping&#8217; clauses for a single type of event/topic on a data set of 172 clauses.
    (Schilder and Habel 2001) report 84% accuracy inferring temporal relations in German data,
