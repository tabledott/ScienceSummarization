    Table 9 reports performance of models from our experiments and from the literature on the three supervised relation classification tasks.
    Following the relevant earlier studies, for SEMEVAL we report macro-averaged accuracy, whereas for the other two data sets we report global accuracy (with binomial confidence intervals).
    All other measures are macro-averaged.
    Majority is the performance of a classifier that always guesses the majority class in the test set (in SEMEVAL, for each class, it guesses that all or no items belong to it depending on whether there are more positive or negative examples in the test data; in the other tasks, it labels all items with the majority class).
    AllTrue always assigns an item to the target class (being inherently binary, it does not provide a welldefined multi-class global accuracy).
    ProbMatch randomly guesses classes matching their distribution in the test data (in SEMEVAL, it matches the proportion of positive and negative examples within each class).
