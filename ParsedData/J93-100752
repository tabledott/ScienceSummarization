yzing corpora.
    Without making any effort to make Xtract efficient in terms of computing resources, the first stage as well as the second stage of Xtract only takes a few minutes to run on a ten-megabyte (pre-tagged) corpus.
    Xtract is currently being used at Columbia University for various lexical tasks.
    And it has been tested on many corpora, among them: several ten-megabyte corpora of news stories, a corpus, consisting of some twenty megabytes of New York Times articles, which has already been used by Choueka (1988), the Brown corpus (Francis and Ktfaera 1982), a corpus of the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament, also called the Hansards corpus, which amounts to several hundred megabytes.
    We are currently working on packaging Xtract to make it available to the research community.
    The packaged version will be portable, reusable, and faster than the one we used to write this paper.'
    We evaluate the filtering power of stage 3 in the evaluation section, Section 10.
