parkhi and colleagues (Ratnaparkhi, Roukos, and Ward 1994; Ratnaparkhi 1996, 1999).
    Similar to Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1997), Ratnaparkhi motivates log-linear models from the perspective of maximizing entropy, subject to certain constraints.
    Ratnaparkhi models the various decisions made by a shift-reduce parser, using log-linear distributions defined over features of the local context in which a decision is made.
    The probabilities of each decision are multiplied together to give a score for the complete sequence of decisions, and beam search is used to find the most probable sequence, which corresponds to the most probable derivation.
    A different approach is proposed by Abney (1997), who develops log-linear models for attribute-value grammars, such as Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).
    Rather than define a model in terms of parser moves, Abney defines a model directly over the syntactic structures licensed by the grammar.
    Another difference is that Abney use
