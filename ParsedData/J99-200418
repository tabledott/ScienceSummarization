 that given a sentence, close to 50% of the supertags can be eliminated even before parsing begins by just using structural constraints of the supertags.
    This reduction in supertag ambiguity speeds up the parser significantly.
    In fact, the supertag Comparison of number of supertags with and without filtering for sentences of length 2 to 50 words. ambiguity in XTAG system is so large that the parser is prohibitively slow without the use of these filters.
    Table 3 tabulates the reduction of supertag ambiguity due to the filters against various parts of speech.6 Verbs in all their forms contribute most to the problem of supertag ambiguity and most of the supertag ambiguity for verbs is due to light verbs and verb particles.
    The filters are very effective in eliminating over 50% of the verb anchored supertags.
    Even though structural constraints are effective in reducing supertag ambiguity, the search space for the parser is still sufficiently large.
