    The last two counts (cA.us and Amm) were performed on a parsed version of the 1988 year of the Wall Street Journal, so that we could extract subjects and objects of the verbs more accurately.
    This corpus of 29 million words was provided to us by Michael Collins, and was automatically parsed with the parser described in Collins (1997).5 The counts, and their justification, are described here: causative feature was approximated by the following steps, intended to capture the degree to which the subject of a verb can also occur as its object.
    Specifically, for each verb occurrence, the subject and object (if there was one) were extracted from the parsed corpus.
    The observed subjects across all occurrences of the verb were placed into one multiset of nouns, and the observed objects into a second multiset of nouns.
    (A multiset, or bag, was used so that our representation indicated the number of times each noun was used as either subject or object.)
    Then, the proportion of overlap
