 actual linguistic behaviour of the verbs.
    That is, we must be assured that the patterns we note in the data in Table 6 are accurate reflections of the differential behaviour of the verb classes, and not an artifact of the way in which we estimate the features, or a result of inaccuracies in the counts.
    In order to evaluate the accuracy of our feature counts, we selected two verbs from each class, and determined the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; value of each feature for each of those six verbs through manual counting.
    The six verbs were randomly selected from the group 2 subset of the verbs, since counts for group 2 verbs (as explained above) had not undergone manual correction.
    This allows us to determine the accuracy of the fully automatic counting procedures.
    The selected verbs (and their frequencies) are: hopped (29), scurried (21), folded (189), stabilized (286), inherited (357), swallowed (152).
    For verbs that had a frequency of over 100 in the &amp;quot;-ed&amp;quot; form, we perfor
