as an objective function for word clustering (Dagan et at., 1993; Brown et at., 1992; Pereira et at., 1993; Wang et at., 1996), for automatic determination of phonemic baseforms (Lucassen &amp; Mercer, 1984), and for language modeling for speech recognition (Ries et at., 1996).
    Although the applications considered in this paper are different, the strategy is similar: search a space of data models for the one with maximum predictive power.
    Wang et at.
    (1996) also employ parallel texts and independence assumptions that are similar to those described in Section 6.
    Like Brown et at.
    (1992), they report a modest improvement in model perplexity and encouraging qualitative results.
    Unfortunately, their estimation method cannot propose more than ten or so word-pair clusters before the translation model must be re-estimated.
    Also, the particular clustering method that they hoped to improve using parallel data is not very robust for low frequencies.
    So, like Smadja et at., they were forc
