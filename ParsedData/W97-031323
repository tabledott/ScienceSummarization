ry for these experiments, statistical and corpusbased taggers are readily available (e.g., (Brill, 1994; Church, 1989; Weischedel et al., 1993)).
    Our corpus-based approach is designed to support fast semantic lexicon construction.
    A user only needs to supply a representative text corpus and a small set of seed words for each target category.
    Our experiments suggest that a core semantic lexicon can be built for each category with only 10-15 minutes of human interaction.
    While more work needs to be done to refine this procedure and characterize the types of categories it can handle, we believe that this is a promising approach for corpus-based semantic knowledge acquisition.
