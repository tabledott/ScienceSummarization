o extend the suggested method to hypergraphs and forests as they are used, e.g., in hierarchical and syntax-augmented systems (Chiang, 2005; Zollmann and Venugopal, 2006).
    Our future work will therefore focus on how much system combination and syntax-augmented machine translation can benefit from lattice MERT and to what extent feature function weights can robustly be estimated using the suggested method.
