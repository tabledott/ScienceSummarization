nables us to find linguistically meaningful analyses.
			This ability to find linguistically meaningful structure is relatively rare in our experience with unsupervised PCFG induction.We also experimented with a version of IO modi fied to perform Bayesian MAP estimation, where the Maximization step of the IO procedure is replaced with Bayesian inference using a Dirichlet prior, i.e.,where the rule probabilities ?(k) at iteration k are es timated using: ?(k)r ? max(0,E[fr|w, ?(k?1)] + ??
