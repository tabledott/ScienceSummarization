 where a commonsense notion of speaker intention is the segmentation criterion.
    In the second part of our study, data abstracted from the subjects' segmentations serve as a target for evaluating two sets of algorithms that use utterance features to perform segmentation.
    On the first algorithm set, we evaluate and compare the correlation of discourse segmentation with three types of linguistic cues (referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses).
    We then develop a second set using two methods: error analysis and machine learning.
    Testing the new algorithms on a new data set shows that when multiple sources of linguistic knowledge are used concurrently, algorithm performance improves.
  
  
    Each utterance of a discourse contributes to the communicative import of preceding utterances, or constitutes the onset of a new unit of meaning or action that subsequent utterances may add to.
    The need to model the relation between the structure of such units (referred to here as discourse segment
