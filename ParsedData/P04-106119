    In German, the largest source of errors is also the systematic postulation of determiner-headed nounphrases.
    In Chinese, the primary mismatch is that subjects are considered to be the heads of sentences rather than verbs.
    This dependency induction model is reasonably successful.
    However, our intuition is still that the model can be improved by paying more attention to syntactic constituency.
    To this end, after briefly recapping the model of Klein and Manning (2002), we present a combined model that exploits dependencies and constituencies.
    As we will see, this combined model finds correct dependencies more successfully than the model above, and finds constituents more successfully than the model of Klein and Manning (2002).
  
  
    In linear distributional clustering, items (e.g., words or word sequences) are represented by characteristic distributions over their linear contexts (e.g., multinomial models over the preceding and following words, see figure 5).
