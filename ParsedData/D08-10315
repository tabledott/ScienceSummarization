the equivalence classes.
    We also require that no non-pronoun can refer back to a pronoun: If m is not a pronoun, we do not consider pronouns as candidate antecedents.
  
  
    For pairwise models, it is common to choose the best antecedent for a given mention (thereby imposing the constraint that each mention has at most one antecedent); however, the method of deciding which is the best antecedent varies.
    Soon et al. (2001) use the Closest-Link method: They select as an antecedent the closest preceding mention that is predicted coreferential by a pairwise coreference module; this is equivalent to choosing the closest mention whose pc value is above a threshold.
    Best-Link was shown to outperform Closest-Link in an experiment by Ng and Cardie (2002b).
    Our model differs from that of Ng and Cardie in that we impose the constraint that non-pronouns cannot refer back to pronouns, and in that we use as training examples all ordered pairs of mentions, subject to the constraint above.
