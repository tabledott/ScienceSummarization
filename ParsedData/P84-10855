    In the description of discourse semantics, the level of the dcu's (including the adjacency structures) plays the most central role: at this level the system defines how the semantic representation of a complex discourse constituent is constructed out of the semantic representations of its parts.
    The other levels of structure are also of some relevance, however: - The Discourse Unit establishes higher level semantic coherence.
