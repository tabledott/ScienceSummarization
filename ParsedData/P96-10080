  A Fully Statistical Approach To Natural Language Interfaces
  
    We present a natural language interface system which is based entirely on trained statistical models.
    The system consists of three stages of processing: parsing, semantic interpretation, and discourse.
    Each of these stages is modeled as a statistical process.
    The models are fully integrated, resulting in an end-to-end system that maps input utterances into meaning representation frames.
  
  
    A recent trend in natural language processing has been toward a greater emphasis on statistical approaches, beginning with the success of statistical part-of-speech tagging programs (Church 1988), and continuing with other work using statistical part-of-speech tagging programs, such as BBN PLUM (Weischedel et al. 1993) and NYU Proteus (Grishman and Sterling 1993).
    More recently, statistical methods have been applied to domain-specific semantic parsing (Miller et al. 1994), and to the more difficult problem of wide-coverage syntactic
