om their overall ranking?.
			This year,for all of the ten best performing systems with re spect to LAS, there is at least one language for which their rank is at least 5 places different from theiroverall rank.
			The most extreme case is the top per forming Nilsson system (Hall et al, 2007a), which reached rank 1 for five languages and rank 2 fortwo more languages.
			Their only outlier is for Chi nese, where the system occupies rank 14, with a LAS approximately 9 percentage points below the top scoring system for Chinese (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007).
			However, Hall et al (2007a) point out that the official results for Chinese contained a bug, and the true performance of their system was actuallymuch higher.
			The greatest improvement of a system with respect to its average rank occurs for En glish, for which the system by Nguyen et al (2007) improved from the average rank 15 to rank 6.
			Twomore outliers can be observed in the system of Jo hansson and Nugues (2007b), which improves from its average rank 12
