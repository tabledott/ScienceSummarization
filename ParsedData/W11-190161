    Participants may have chosen not to focus on events because they pose unique challenges while making up only a small portion of the data.
    Roughly 91% of mentions in the data are NPs and pronouns.
    In the systems that used trained models, many systems used the approach described in Soon et al. (2001) for selecting the positive and negative training examples, while others used some of the alternative approaches that have been introduced in the research literature more recently.
    Many of the trained systems also were able to improve their performance by using feature selection, though things varied some depending on the example selection strategy and the classifier used.
    Almost half of the trained systems used the feature selection strategy from Soon et al. (2001) and found it beneficial.
    It is not clear whether the other systems did not explore this path, or whether it just did not prove as useful in their case.
