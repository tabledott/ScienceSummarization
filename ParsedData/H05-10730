	Emotions From Text: Machine Learning For Text-Based Emotion Prediction
		In addition to information, text con tains attitudinal, and more specifically, emotional content.
		This paper exploresthe text-based emotion prediction prob lem empirically, using supervised machinelearning with the SNoW learning architecture.
		The goal is to classify the emotional affinity of sentences in the narra tive domain of children?s fairy tales, forsubsequent usage in appropriate expressive rendering of text-to-speech synthe sis.
		Initial experiments on a preliminarydata set of 22 fairy tales show encourag ing results over a na??ve baseline and BOW approach for classification of emotional versus non-emotional contents, with some dependency on parameter tuning.
		We also discuss results for a tripartite model which covers emotional valence, as well as feature set alernations.
		In addition, we present plans for a more cognitively soundsequential model, taking into considera tion a larger set of basic emotions.
