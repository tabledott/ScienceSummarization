ries randomly (but with no repetition).
    In the random distribution, there are few bars of width 3, and none of any greater width.
    We show below that, given the loosely structured task, the probability of the observed distribution depicted in Figure 3 is extremely low, hence highly significant.
    The statistical test we use identifies x &gt; 3 as the threshold separating insignificant boundaries from significant ones.
    The large scattering of narrow bars (1 &lt; x &lt; 2) illustrates the inherent noisiness of the data arising from the fact that subjects assign boundaries at varying rates.
    The histogram in Figure 4 gives a different view of the same point, showing the relative frequency of cases where N subjects place a boundary at a given location, for N from 0 to 7.
    The y-axis is normalized to represent the average narrative length of 100 phrases, thus the bar at N = 0 indicates that on average, 47.8 of the 100 phrases were not classified as boundaries.'
