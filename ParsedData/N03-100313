joint paths) between them as (probably) corresponding to the arguments of the propositions that the sentences represent.
    For example, in the top of Figure 3, the words &#8220;southern city, &#8220;settlement of NAME&#8221;,&#8220;coastal resort of NAME&#8221;, etc. all correspond to the location of an event and could be replaced by a single slot.
    Figure 3 shows an example of a lattice and the derived slotted lattice; we give the details of the slot-induction process in the Appendix.
    Now, if we were using a parallel corpus, we could employ sentence-alignment information to determine which lattices correspond to paraphrases.
    Since we do not have this information, we essentially approximate the parallelcorpus situation by correlating information from descriptions of (what we hope are) the same event occurring in the two different corpora.
    Our method works as follows.
    Once lattices for each corpus in our comparable-corpus pair are computed, we identify lattice paraphrase pairs, using the i
