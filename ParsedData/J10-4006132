umber of non-zero entries and density as the tensor.
    The possible combinations of target lower n-ranks constitute a large tridimensional parameter space, and we leave its systematic exploration to further work.
    Instead, we pick 300, 50, and 500 as (intuitively reasonable) initial target n-ranks for the three modes, and we explore their neighborhood in parameter space by changing one target n-rank at a time, by a relatively small value (300 1 50, 50 1 10, and 500 1 50, respectively).
    For the parameters concerning the reduced tensor fitting process, we accept the default values of the Tensor Toolbox.
    For comparison purposes, we also apply SVD to the W1xLW2 matrix derived from APTypeDM.
    We systematically explore the SVD target lower rank parameter from 50 to 350 in increments of 50 units.
    The results are reported in Table 16.
    The rank column reports the n-ranks when reduction is performed on the tensor, and matrix ranks in the other cases.
