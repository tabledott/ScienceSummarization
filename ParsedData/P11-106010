th predicate p, then the denotation of z has one column with the tuples w(p) and an empty store.
    The other six cases handle different edge relations.
    These definitions depend on several operations (mj,j0, E, Xi, M) which we will define shortly, but let us first get some intuition.
    Let z be a DCS tree.
    If the last child c of z&#8217;s root is a join (jj0), aggregate (E), or execute (Xi) relation ((4)&#8211;(6)), then we simply recurse on z with c removed and join it with some transformation (identity, E, or Xi) of c&#8217;s denotation.
    If the last (or first) child is connected via a mark relation E, C (or Q), then we strip off that child and put the appropriate information in the store by invoking M. We now define the operations mj,j0, E, Xi, M. Some helpful notation: For a sequence v = (v1,... , vn) and indices i = (i1, ... , ik), let vi = (vi1, ... , vik) be the projection of v onto i; we write v&#8722;i to mean v&#65533;1 i.
    Extending this notation to denotations, let (hA; &#945;ii[i
