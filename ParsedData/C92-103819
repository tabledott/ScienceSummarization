 order of preference, with the most preferable attr ibute flint.
  The elements of this list and their order will vary with the domain, a~ld should be determined by em- pirical inv~tigation.
  Inputs  to  the  A lgor i thm In order to construct a reference to a particular em tity, tile host system must provide: - a symbol corresponding to the intended referent; and ?
  a list of symbols correspondiug to the members of the contrast set (i.e., the other entities in focus, besides the intended referent).
  The algorithm returus a list of attr ibute-value pairs that  correspond to tim romantic ontent of the refer- ring expression to be realized.
  This list can then be converted into an SPL [K&amp;~9] term, as is done in the II)AS implementation; it can also be converted into a recoverab le  semant ic  s t ructure  of the kind used in Daies EPICOltE system [Da188,Dai89].
  The  A lgor i thm In general terms, the algorithm iterates through the attributes in *preferred-attributes*.
  For each at- tribute, it checks
