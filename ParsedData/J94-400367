    Co-occurrence in the global context provides information about typical topics associated with each sense, in which a topic is represented by words that commonly occur in it.
    Schiitze (1992, 1993) uses a variant of this type of information, in which context vectors are maintained for character four-grams, instead of words.
    In addition, the context of an occurrence of an ambiguous word is represented by co-occurrence information of a second order, as a set of context vectors (instead of a set of context words).
    Compared with co-occurrence within syntactic relations, information about the global context is less sensitive to fine semantic and lexical distinctions and is less useful when different senses of a word appear in similar contexts.
    On the other hand, the global context contains more words and is therefore more likely to provide enough disambiguating information, in cases in which this distinction can be based 'on the topic of discourse.
    From a general perspective, these tw
