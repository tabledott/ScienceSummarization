f the top k = 10 assignments according to a local model, which does not include dependencies among arguments.
    Using this model improves the performance of the system in F-measure from 59.2 to 62.85.
    This shows that adding global information improves the performance of a role labeling system considerably.
    However, the type of global information in this model is limited to label multi-sets.
    We will show that much larger gains are possible from joint modeling, adding richer sources of joint information using a more flexible statistical model.
    The model of Pradhan, Hacioglu, et al. (2004, 2005) is a state-of-the-art model, based on Support Vector Machines, and incorporating a large set of structural and lexical features.
    At the heart of the model lies a local classifier, which labels each parse tree node with one of the possible argument labels or NONE.
    Joint information is integrated into the model in two ways: Dynamic class context: Using the labels of the two nodes to the left as fe
