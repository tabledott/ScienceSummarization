there is a notable gap in the research literature for induction of analyzers for irregular morphological processes, including significant stem changing.
    The algorithm described below directly addresses this gap, while successfully inducing more regular analyses without supervision as well.
  
  
    The motivating dilemma behind our approach to morphological alignment is the question of how one determines that the past tense of sing is sang and not singed.
    The pairing sing&#8212;x singed requires only simple concatenation with the canonical suffix, +ed, and singed is indeed a legal word in our vocabulary (the past tense of singe).
    And while few irregular verbs have a true word occupying the slot that would be generated by a regular morphological rule, a large corpus is filled with many spelling mistakes or dysfluencies such as taked (observed with a frequency of 1), and such errors can wreak havoc in na&#239;ve alignment-based methods.
    How can we overcome this problem?
