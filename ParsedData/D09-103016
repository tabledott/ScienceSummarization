    We simplified the official GALE post-editing guidelines (NIST and LDC, 2007).
    We provided these instructions: Edit Machine Translation Your task is to edit the machine translation making as few changes as possible so that it matches the meaning of the human translation and is good English.
    Please follow these guidelines: edit rate decreases as the number of editors increases from zero (where HTER is simply the TER score between the MT output and the reference translation) and five.
    We displayed 10 sentences from a news article.
    In one column was the reference English translation, in the other column were text boxes containing the MT output to be edited.
    To minimize the edit rate, we collected edits from five different Turkers for every machine translated segment.
    We verified these with a second HIT were we prompted Turkers to: For the final score, we choose the edited segment which passed the criteria and which minimized the edit distance to the unedited machine translation outpu
