    However, it turns out that the JIG restriction of allowing only matchings with straight or inverted orientation effectively cuts the combinatorial growth, while still maintaining flexibility where needed.
    To see how ITGs maintain needed flexibility, consider Figure 5, which shows all 24 possible complete matchings between two constituents of length four each.
    Nearly all of these-22 out of 24&#8212;can be generated by an ITG, as shown by the parse trees (whose nonterminal labels are omitted).3 The 22 permitted matchings are representative of real transpositions in word order between the English-Chinese sentences in our data.
    The only two matchings that cannot be generated are very distorted transpositions that we might call &amp;quot;inside-out&amp;quot; matchings.
    We have been unable to find real examples in our data of constituent arguments undergoing &amp;quot;inside-out&amp;quot; transposition.
    Note that this hypothesis is for fixed-word-order languages that are lightly infl
