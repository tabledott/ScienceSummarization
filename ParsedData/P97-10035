 does the string contain a verb?
    (Allowing the model to learn a preference for modification of the most recent verb).
    (3) Does the string contain 0, 1, 2 or &gt; 2 commas?
    (where a comma is anything tagged as &amp;quot;,&amp;quot; or probability P(R3(r3) I P, H, h, distance, (2)).
    The distance is a function of the surface string from the word after h to the last word of R2, inclusive.
    In principle the model could condition on any structure dominated by H, R1 or R2. distinction and subcategorisation The tree in figure 1 is an example of the importance of the complement/adjunct distinction.
    It would be useful to identify &amp;quot;Marks&amp;quot; as a subject, and &amp;quot;Last week&amp;quot; as an adjunct (temporal modifier), but this distinction is not made in the tree, as both NPs are in the same position' (sisters to a VP under an S node).
    From here on we will identify complements by attaching a &amp;quot;-C&amp;quot; suffix to non-terminals &#8212; figure 3 gives an example tre
