dants of r in the MR parse are linked to any words.
    Second is when there is a link from a word w, covered by the pattern for r, to a production r&#8242; outside the sub-parse rooted at r. Rule extraction is forbidden in this case because it would destroy the link between w and r&#8242;.
    The first case arises when a component of an MR is not realized, e.g. assumed in context.
    The second case arises when a predicate and its arguments are not realized close enough.
    Figure 5 shows an example of this, where no rules can be extracted for the penalty-area predicate.
    Both cases can be solved by merging nodes in the MR parse tree, combining several productions into one.
    For example, since no rules can be extracted for penalty-area, it is combined with its parent to form REGION &#8594; (left (penalty-area TEAM)), for which the pattern TEAM left penalty area is extracted.
    The above algorithm is effective only when words linked to an MR predicate and its arguments stay close to each other, a p
