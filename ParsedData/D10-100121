 all such solutions will be fractional, making them easy to distinguish from Q.
    In many applications of LP relaxations&#8212;including the examples discussed in this paper&#8212;the relaxation in Eq.
    10 turns out to be tight, in that the solution is often integral (i.e., it is in Q).
    In these cases, solving the LP relaxation exactly solves the original problem of interest.
    In the next section we prove that the algorithm in Figure 1 solves the problem in Eq 10.
    A similar result holds for the algorithm in section 4.2: it solves a relaxation of Eq.
    3, where R is replaced by
  
  
    We now show that the example algorithms solve their respective LP relaxations given in the previous section.
    We do this by first introducing a general class of linear programs, together with an optimization method, Lagrangian relaxation, for solving these LPs.
    We then show that the algorithms in section 4 are special cases of the general algorithm.
    The linear programs we consider take the form The
