g resources for common NLP tasks.
    (None of them are definitive, and the user can replace and/or extend them as necessary.)
    These are packaged together to form ANNIE, A Nearly- New IE system, but can also be used individually or coupled together with new modules in order to create new applications.
    For example, many other NLP tasks might require a sentence splitter and POS tagger, but would not necessarily require resources more specific to IE tasks such as a named entity transducer.
    The system is in use for a variety of IE and other tasks, sometimes in combination with other sets of application-specific modules.
    ANNIE consists of the following main processing resources: tokeniser, sentence splitter, POS tagger, gazetteer, finite state transducer (based on GATE's built-in regular expressions over annotations language (Cunningham et al., 2002)), orthomatcher and coreference resolver.
    The resources communicate via GATE's annotation API, which is a directed graph of arcs bearing arbitrary
