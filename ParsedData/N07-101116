ge propagation, (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004; Sutton and McCallum, 2004), and integer linear programming (Roth and Yih, 2004).
    The main distinctions of our approach are that it is simple to implement, not computationally intensive, and adaptable to arbitrary loss functions.
    There have been a number of machine learning approaches to coreference resolution, traditionally factored into classification decisions over pairs of nouns (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002).
    Nicolae and Nicolae (2006) combine pairwise classification with graph-cut algorithms.
    Luo et al. (2004) do enable features between mention-cluster pairs, but do not perform the error-driven and ranking enhancements proposed in our work.
    Denis and Baldridge (2007) use a ranking loss function for pronoun coreference; however the examples are still pairs of pronouns, and the example generation is not error driven.
    Ng (2005) learns a meta-classifier to choose the best prediction from the output of several coreference systems.
