 (in)equalities over u and use them in this ILP setting.
  For a more complete example of this ILP formulation, please see Appendix A. Constraint 4: No overlapping or embedding.
  If arguments Sj1 , .
  ,Sjk cover the same word in a sentence, then this constraint ensures that at most one of the arguments is assigned to an argument type.
  In other words, at least k?
  1 arguments will be the special class null.
  If the special class null is represented by the symbol ?, then for every set of such arguments, the following linear equality represents this constraint.
  1 Constraint 5: No duplicate argument classes.
  Within the same clause, several types of arguments cannot appear more than once.
  For example, a predicate can only take one A0.
  This constraint can be represented using the following inequality.
  1 Constraint 6: R-arg arguments.
  Suppose the referenced argument type is A0 and the referential type is R-A0.
  The linear inequalities that represent this constraint are: ?m ?
  umR-A0 If there are
