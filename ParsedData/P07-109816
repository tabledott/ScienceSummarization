o be&#8221;, for which a PAS cannot be derived by a PB-based shallow semantic parser.
    (iii) The 10-fold cross-validation experiments confirm the trends observed in the UIUC split.
    The best model (according to statistical significance) is PT+BOW, achieving an 86.1% average accuracy4.
    Question classification does not allow to fully exploit the PAS potential since questions tend to be short and with few verbal predicates (i.e. the only ones that our SRL system can extract).
    A different scenario is answer classification, i.e. deciding if a passage/sentence correctly answers a question.
    Here, the semantics to be generated by the classifier are not constrained to a small taxonomy and answer length may make the PT-based representation too sparse.
    We learn answer classification with abinary SVM which determines if an answer is correct for the target question: here, the classification instances are (question, answer) pairs.
    Each pair component can be encoded with PT, BOW, PAS and PASN repre
