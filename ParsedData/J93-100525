attachment procedure.
    First, we note that the task of judging attachment on the basis of verb, noun, and preposition alone is not easy.
    The figures in the entry labeled &amp;quot;combined precision&amp;quot; indicate that the human judges had overall error rates of 12-15%.6 The lexical association procedure is somewhat worse than the human judges, with an error rate of 20%, but this is an improvement over the structural strategies.
    The table also gives results broken down according to N vs. V attachment.
    The precision figures indicate the proportion of test items assigned to a given category that actually belong to the category.
    For instance, N precision is the fraction of cases that the procedure identified as N attachments that actually were N attachments.
