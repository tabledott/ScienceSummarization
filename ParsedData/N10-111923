ted classification &#8211; we can see that at almost all recall levels the web-derived lexicon has superior precision to the other lexicons (Figure 4).
    Thus, even though the web-derived lexicon is constructed from a lexical graph that contains noise, the graph propagation algorithms appear to be fairly robust to this noise and are capable of producing large and accurate polarity lexicons.
    The second six columns of Table 4 shows the performance of each lexicon as the core of a contextual classifier (Wilson et al., 2005).
    A contextual classifier is a machine learned classifier that predicts the polarity of a sentence using features of that sentence and its context.
    For our experiments, this was a maximum entropy classifier trained and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation on the evaluation data.
    The features included in the classifier were the purity score, the number of positive and negative lexicon matches, and the number of negations in the sentence, as well as concatenations of these
