ntion-pair model (Versley, 2006; Denis and Baldridge, 2007b), they are not more expressive than the mention-pair model, as they are unable to exploit cluster-level features, unlike the entitymention model.
    To enable rankers to employ cluster-level features, Rahman and Ng (2009) propose the cluster-ranking model, which ranks preceding clusters, rather than candidate antecedents, for an NP to be resolved.
    Cluster rankers therefore address both weaknesses of the mention-pair model, and have been shown to improve mention rankers.
    Cluster rankers are conceptually similar to Lappin and Leass&#8217;s (1994) heuristic pronoun resolver, which resolves an anaphoric pronoun to the most salient preceding cluster.
    An important issue with ranking models that we have eluded so far concerns the identification of non-anaphoric NPs.
    As a ranker simply imposes a ranking on candidate antecedents or preceding clusters, it cannot determine whether an NP is anaphoric (and hence should be resolved).
