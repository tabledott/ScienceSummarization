s needed to encode s. Since log bx =12412 , Assumption 4 means that the function f must satisfy the following condition: Vc &gt; 0, f(x, y) f (cx, Assumption 5: Similarity is additive with respect to commonality.
    If cornman(A, B) consists of two independent parts, then the sim(A, B) is the sum of the similarities computed when each part of the commonality is considered.
    In other words: f (xi + x2, y) = f(xi,y)+ f(x2,y).
    A corollary of Assumption 5 is that Vy, f(0, y) = f (x + 0, y) &#8212; f (x,y) = 0, which means that when there is no commonality between A and B, their similarity is 0, no matter how different they are.
    For example, the similarity between &amp;quot;depth-first search&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;leather sofa&amp;quot; is neither higher nor lower than the similarity between &amp;quot;rectangle&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;interest rate&amp;quot;.
    Assumption 6: The similarity between a pair of identical objects is 1.
    When A and B are identical. knowning their commonalities means k
