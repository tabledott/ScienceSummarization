&#8220;verb&#8221; as a single part-of-speech type.
    NN compounds were extracted from the WSJ by first tagging the data with fnTBL 1.0 (Ngai and Florian, 2001) and then simply taking noun bigrams (adjoined on both sides by non-nouns to assure the bigram is not part of a larger compound nominal).
    Out of these, we selected those compounds that are listed in WordNet, resulting in 5,405 NN compound types (208,000 tokens).
    Extraction of the verb-particles was considerably more involved, and drew on the method of Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002).
    Essentially, we used a POS tagger and chunker (both built using fnTBL 1.0 (Ngai and Florian, 2001)) to first (re)tag the BNC.
    This allowed us to extract verb-particle tokens through use of the particle POS and chunk tags returned by the two systems.
    This produces highprecision, but relatively low-recall results, so we performed the additional step of running a chunkbased grammar over the chunker output to detect candidate mistagged particles.
