e fact that REVERB only models binary relations.
    Table 6 summarizes the correct extractions that were extracted by other systems and were not extracted by REVERB.
    As with the false positive extractions, the majority of false negatives (52%) were due to the argument-finding heuristics choosing the wrong arguments, or failing to extract all possible arguments (in the case of coordinating conjunctions).
    Other sources of failure were due to the lexical constraint either failing to filter out an overspecified relation phrase or filtering out a valid relation phrase.
    These errors hurt both precision and recall, since each case results in the extractor overlooking a correct relation phrase and choosing another.
    5.3 Evaluation At Scale Section 5.1 shows that REVERB outperforms existing Open IE systems when evaluated on a sample of sentences.
    Previous work has shown that the frequency of an extraction in a large corpus is useful for assessing the correctness of extractions (Downey et al., 2005)
