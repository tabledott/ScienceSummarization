ed to decrease capturing wrong parts of speech or incorrect semantic relations.
    We used 50 verb pairs and the overall process took about 25 hours.
    We use a total of 35 patterns, which are listed in Table 2 along with the estimated frequency of hits.
    Y or at least X 1,016,905 Yed or at least Xed not only Xed but Yed not just Xed but Yed The probabilities in the denominator are difficult to calculate directly from search engine results.
    For a given lexico-syntactic pattern, we need to estimate the frequency of the pattern instantiated with appropriately conjugated verbs.
    For verbs, we need to estimate the frequency of the verbs, but avoid counting other parts-of-speech (e.g. chair as a noun or painted as an adjective).
    Another issue is that some relations are symmetric (similarity and antonymy), while others are not (strength, enablement, happens-before).
    For symmetric relations only, the verbs can fill the lexico-syntactic pattern in either order.
    To address these issues, we est
