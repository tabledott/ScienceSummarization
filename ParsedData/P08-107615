r the best performance with the development set2.
    However, it may be computationally unrealistic to retrain the entire procedure several times using 1G-words of unlabeled data.
    Therefore, these tunable parameter values are selected using a relatively small amount of unlabeled data (17M-words), and we used the selected values in all our experiments.
    The left graph in Figure 2 shows typical q behavior.
    The left end is equivalent to optimizing G2 without a prior, and the right end is almost equivalent to considering pj(xj, y) for all j to be a uniform distribution.
    This is why it appears to be bounded by the performance obtained from supervised CRF.
    We omitted the influence of Q2 because of space constraints, but its behavior is nearly the same as that of supervised CRF.
    Unfortunately, G2(O|A0) may have two or more local maxima.
    Our parameter estimation procedure does not guarantee to provide either the global optimum or a convergence solution in O and A0 space.
