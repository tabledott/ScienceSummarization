e two dialogue acts Open-option (used to mark suggestions) and Directive, both of which bring into consideration a future action to be performed by the addressee.
    At least in principle, an organization of this type opens up the possibility for coders to mark an utterance with the superclass (IAFA) in case they do not feel confident that the utterance satisfies the additional requirements for Open-option or Directive.
    This, in turn, would do away with the need to make a choice between these two options.
    This possibility wasn&#8217;t pursued in the studies using the original DAMSL that we are aware of (Core and Allen 1997; Di Eugenio 2000; Stent 2001), but was tested by Shriberg et al. (2004) and subsequent work, in particular Geertzen and Bunt (2006), who were specifically interested in the idea of using hierarchical schemes to measure partial agreement, and in addition experimented with weighted coefficients of agreement for their hierarchical tagging scheme, specifically &#954;w.
