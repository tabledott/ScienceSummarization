at have been shown to be optimal for word sense disambiguation.
    Shallow lexical features such as co&#8212;occurrences and collocations are recognized as potent sources of disambiguation information.
    While many other contextual features are often employed, it isn't clear that they offer substantial advantages.
    For example, (Ng and Lee, 1996) report that local collocations alone achieve 80% accuracy disambiguating interest, while their full set of features result in 87%.
    Preliminary experiments for this paper used feature sets that included collocates, co&#8212;occurrences, part&#8212;of&#8212; speech and grammatical information for surrounding words.
    However, it was clear that no combination of features resulted in disambiguation accuracy significantly higher than that achieved with co&#8212;occurrence features.
    The most accurate classifier from each of nine possible category ranges is selected as a member of the ensemble.
    This is based on preliminary experiments that showed that me
