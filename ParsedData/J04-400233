stical MT even using only Model 1 of Brown et al. (1993) is NP-complete (Knight 1999).
    Therefore, we cannot expect to develop efficient search algorithms that are guaranteed to solve the problem without search errors.
    Yet for practical applications it is acceptable to commit some search errors (Section 6.1.2).
    Hence, the art of developing a search algorithm lies in finding suitable approximations and heuristics that allow an efficient search without committing too many search errors.
    In the development of the search algorithm described in this section, our main aim is that the search algorithm should be efficient.
    It should be possible to translate a sentence of reasonable length within a few seconds of computing time.
    We accept that the search algorithm sometimes results in search errors, as long as the impact on translation quality is minor.
    Yet it should be possible to reduce the number of search errors by increasing computing time.
    In the limit, it should be possible to sea
