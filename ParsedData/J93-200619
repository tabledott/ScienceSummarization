 values, in our system (+ initial + capitalized, &#8212; initial + capitalized, etc.) in order to take into account the first word of a sentence.
    We can incorporate these features of the word into the probability that this particular word will occur given a particular tag using the following: We estimate the probability of each ending for each tag directly from supervised training data.
    While these probabilities are not strictly independent, the approximation is good enough to make a marked difference in classification of unknown words.
    As the results in Figure 2 show, the use of orthographic endings of words reduces the error rate on the unknown words by a factor of three.
    We tested capitalization separately, since some data, such as that in the Third Message Understanding Conference (Sundheim 1991) is uppercase only.
    Titles and bibliographies will cause similar distortions in a system trained on mixed case and using capitalization as a feature.
    Furthermore, some languages, such as Ja
