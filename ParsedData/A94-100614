    Most alignment work was concerned with alignment at the sentence level.
    Algorithms for the more difficult task of word alignment were proposed in (Gale and Church, 1991a; Brown et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993) and were applied for parameter estimation in the IBM statistical machine translation system (Brown et al., 1993).
    Previously translated texts provide a major source of information about technical terms.
    As Isabelle (1992) argues, &amp;quot;Existing translations contain more solutions to more translation problems than any oth
