pes of alignments, S and P, we examined three different conditions: S alignments only, P alignments only, or S alignments where present falling back to P alignments (S P).
    For each of these conditions, we counted crossings both with and without using the phrasal translation filter.
    For a given alignment type S,S P,P, let if phrases and cross each other and otherwise.
    Let if the phrasal translation filter is turned off.
    If the filter is on, , modifier constituents , and child constituents and for a particular alignment type , the number of head crossings and modifier crossings can be calculated recursively:
  
  
    Table 1 shows the average number of crossings per sentence.
    The table is split into two sections, one for results when the phrasal filter was used and one for when it was not.
    &#8220;Alignment Type&#8221; refers to whether we used S, P or S P as the alignment data.
    The &#8220;Head Crossings&#8221; line shows the results when comparing the span of the head constituent of
