ion coefficient and is statistically indistinguishable from the best metrics in both adequacy and fluency correlation with human judgment according to Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient.
    In this paper we presented two new objective automatic evaluation methods for machine translation, ROUGE-L based on longest common subsequence (LCS) statistics between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations.
    Longest common subsequence takes into account sentence level structure similarity naturally and identifies longest co-occurring in-sequence ngrams automatically while this is a free parameter To give proper credit to shorter common sequences that are ignored by LCS but still retain the flexibility of non-consecutive matches, we proposed counting skip bigram co-occurrence.
    The skip-bigram-based ROUGE-S* (without skip disrestriction) had the best Pearson's correlation of 0.95 in adequacy when all words were lower case and stemmed.
