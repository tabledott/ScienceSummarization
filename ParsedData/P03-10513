    Although their algorithm captures prefix-suffix combinations or circumfixes, it does not handle the multiple affixes per word we observe in Arabic.
  
  
    Given an Arabic sentence, we use a trigram language model on morphemes to segment it into a sequence of morphemes {m1, m2, ...,mn}.
    The input to the morpheme segmenter is a sequence of Arabic tokens &#8211; we use a tokenizer that looks only at white space and other punctuation, e.g. quotation marks, parentheses, period, comma, etc.
    A sample of a manually segmented corpus is given below2.
    Here multiple occurrences of prefixes and suffixes per word are marked with an underline.
    Many instances of prefixes and suffixes in Arabic are meaning bearing and correspond to a word in English such as pronouns and prepositions.
    Therefore, we choose a segmentation into multiple prefixes and suffixes.
    Segmentation into one prefix and one suffix per word, cf.
    (Darwish 2002), is not very useful for applications like statistical m
