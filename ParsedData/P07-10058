    Hiero extracts the synchronous CFG rules automatically from a word-aligned parallel corpus.
    To translate a source sentence, the goal is to find its most probable derivation using the extracted grammar rules.
    Hiero uses a general log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002) where the weight of a derivation D for a particular source sentence and its translation is where Oi is a feature function and Ai is the weight for feature Oi.
    To ensure efficient decoding, the Oi are subject to certain locality restrictions.
    Essentially, they should be defined as products of functions defined on isolated synchronous CGF rules; however, it is possible to extend the domain of locality of the features somewhat.
    A n-gram language model adds a dependence on (n&#8722;1) neighboring target-side words (Wu, 1996; Chiang, 2007), making decoding much more difficult but still polynomial; in this paper, we add features that depend on the neighboring source-side words, which does not affect decod
