enormous amounts of text.
    The future of ontology growing lies in leveraging this data by harvesting it for concepts and semantic relationships.
    Moreover, once such knowledge is discovered, mechanisms must be in place to enrich current ontologies with this new knowledge.
    To address some of the coverage and specificity problems in WordNet and Cyc, Pantel and Lin (2002) proposed and algorithm, called CBC, for automatically extracting semantic classes.
    Their classes consist of clustered instances like the three shown below: A limitation of these concepts is that CBC does not discover their actual names.
    That is, CBC discovers a semantic class of Canadian provinces such as Manitoba, Alberta, and Ontario, but stops short of labeling the concept as Canadian Provinces.
    Some applications such as question answering would benefit from class labels.
    For example, given the concept list (B) and a label goalie/goaltender, a QA system could look for answers to the question &amp;quot;Which goaltend
