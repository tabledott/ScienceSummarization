    Given the bitext slope for that bitext and a conservative estimate of 6 characters per word (including the space between words), each horizontal word of error corresponds to just over 4 characters of error perpendicular to the main diagonal.
    Thus, Dagan, Church, and Gale's &amp;quot;no error&amp;quot; is the same as Comparison of error distributions for SIMR and word_align on the parliamentary debates bitext.
    Error of at Most Error of at Most Error of at Most Algorithm 2 Characters 6 Characters 14 Characters word_align 55% 73% 84% SIMR 93% 97% 98% 2 characters of error or less, i.e., less than half a word.
    One word of error is the same as an error of up to 6 characters and 3 words are equivalent to 4 &#8226; 31- = 14 characters.
    On this basis, Table 5 compares the accuracy of SIMR and word_align.5 Another interesting comparison is in terms of maximum error.
    Certain applications of bitext maps, such as the one described by Melamed (1996a), can tolerate many small errors but no large one
