			4.1 Probabilistic Model.
			The Jeopardy model is a QG designed for QA.
			Let q = ?q1, ..., qn?
			be a question sentence (each qi is aword), and let a = ?a1, ..., am?
			be a candidate an swer sentence.
			(We will use w to denote an abstract sequence that could be a question or an answer.)
			Inpractice, these sequences may include other infor mation, such as POS, but for clarity we assume justwords in the exposition.
			Let A be the set of can didate answers under consideration.
			Our aim is to choose: a?
			= argmax a?A p(a | q) (1) At a high level, we make three adjustments.
			The first is to apply Bayes?
			rule, p(a | q) ? p(q | a) ? p(a).
			Because A is known and is assumed to be generated by an external extraction system, we could use that extraction system to assign scores(and hence, probabilities p(a)) to the candidate an swers.
			Other scores could
