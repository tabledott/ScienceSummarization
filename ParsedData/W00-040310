tire 0-1 segment; therefore the difference between two systems, performing at e.g., 0.785 and 0.812 can be significant!
    Example: the normalized system performance for the {14) system then becomes (0.833 - 0.732) / (0.841 &#8212; 0.732) or 0.927.
    Since the score is close to 1, the {14) system is almost as good as the interjudge agreement.
    The normalized system performance for the {24} system is similarly (0.837 &#8212; 0.732) / (0.841 7 The formula is valid when J &gt; R (that is, the judges agree among each other better than randomly).
    &#8212; 0.732) or 0.963.
    Of the two systems, {24} outperforms {14).
    To use CSIS in the evaluation, we introduce a new parameter, E, which tells us how much to penalize a system that includes redundant information.
    In the example from Table 7 (arrows indicate subsumption), a summarizer with r = 20% needs to pick 2 out of 12 sentences.
    Suppose that it picks 1/1 and 2/1 (in bold).
    If E = 1, it should get full credit of 20 utility points.
