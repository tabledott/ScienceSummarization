in a tree representation can be studied theoretically and investigated empirically by means of a tree transformation / detransformation process.
  
  
    Probabalistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) provide simple statistical models of natural languages.
    The relative frequency estimator provides a straightforward way of inducing these grammars from treebank corpora, and a broad-coverage parsing system can be obtained by using a parser to find a maximum-likelihood parse tree for the input string with respect to such a treebank grammar.
    PCFG parsing systems often perform as well as other simple broad-coverage parsing system for predicting tree structure from part-of-speech (POS) tag sequences (Chamiak 1996).
    While PCFG models do not perform as well as models that are sensitive to a wider range of dependencies (Collins 1996), their simplicity makes them straightforward to analyze both theoretically and empirically.
    Moreover, since more sophisticated systems can be viewed as refinements of the bas
