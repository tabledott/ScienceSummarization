he extent of agreement between coders than the values of unweighted &#954;.
    This discussion of coding schemes for dialogue acts introduced issues to which we will return for other CL annotation tasks as well.
    There are a number of wellestablished schemes for large-scale dialogue act annotation based on the assumption of mutual exclusivity between dialogue act tags, whose reliability is also well known; if one of these schemes is appropriate for modeling the communicative intentions found in a task, we recommend to our readers to use it.
    They should also realize, however, that the mutual exclusivity assumption is somewhat dubious.
    If a multi-dimensional or hierarchical tagset is used, readers should also be aware that weighted coefficients do capture partial agreement, and need not automatically result in lower reliability or in an explosion in the number of labels.
    However, a hierarchical scheme may not reflect genuine annotation difficulties: For example, in the case of DIT++, one might a
