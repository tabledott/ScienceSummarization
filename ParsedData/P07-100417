 Note that the single improvements achieved here are slightly below the 95%-significance level.
    However, we observe them consistently in all settings.
  
  
    Table 4 presents translation results on NIST with different versions of the scoring and selection methods introduced in Section 3.
    In these experiments, the unlabeled data U for Algorithm 1 is the development or test corpus.
    For this corpus U, 5,000-best lists were generated using the baseline SMT system.
    Since re-training the full phrase tables is not feasible here, a (small) additional phrase table, specific to U, was trained and plugged into the SMT system as an additional model.
    The decoder weights thus had to be optimized again to determine the appropriate weight for this new phrase table.
    This was done on the dev1 corpus, using the phrase table specific to dev1.
    Every time a new corpus is to be translated, an adapted phrase table is created using transductive learning and used with the weight which has been learned on
