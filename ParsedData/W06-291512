nt perspective d and sentence perspective intensity s. If we do not impose any constraints, s1 and s0 are exchangeable, and we can no longer strictly interpret s1 as indicating a strong sentence-level perspective and s0 as indicating that a sentence carries little or no perspective information.
    The other problem of this parameterization is that any improvement from LSPM over the naive Bayes model is not necessarily due to the explicit modeling of sentence-level perspective.
    5 may capture aspects of the document collection that we never intended to model.
    For example, s0 may capture the editors&#8217; writing styles and s1 the guests&#8217; writing styles in the bitterlemons corpus.
    We solve the identifiability problem by forcing Bd1,s0 and Bd0,s0 to be identical and reducing the number of B parameters to three.
    As shown in Figure 3b, there are separate B parameters conditioned on the document perspective (left branch of the tree, d0 is Israeli and d1 is Palestinian), but there is single B
