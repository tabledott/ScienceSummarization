			EvaluationThe evaluation approach of TempEval avoids the in terdependencies that are inherent to a network of temporal relations, where relations in one part of the network may constrain relations in any other part ofthe network.
			To accomplish that, TempEval delib erately focused on subtasks of the larger problem of automatic temporal annotation.
			One thing we may want to change to the present TempEval is the definition of task A. Currently, it instructs to temporally link all events in a sentence to all time expressions in the same sentence.
			In the future we may consider splitting this into two tasks, where one subtask focuses on those anchorings thatare very local, like ?...White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater [said] [late yesterday] that...?.
