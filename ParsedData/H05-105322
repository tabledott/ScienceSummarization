			While it is trivial to findthe words which are absent or infrequent in train ing data, such as SemCor, it is less obvious how to find words where the training data is not appropriate.
			One way of finding these words would be to look for differences in the automatic sense rankings of words in domain specific corpora compared to those of the same words in balanced corpora, such as the BNC.
			We assume that the sense rankings from a balancedtext will more or less correlate with a balanced resource such as SemCor.
			Of course there will be dif ferences in the corpus data, but these will be less radical than those between SemCor and a domain specific corpus.
			Then the automatic ranking methodshould be applied in cases where there is a clear deviation in the ranking induced from the domain specific corpus compared to that from the balanced cor pus.
			Otherwise, SemCor is probably more reliable if data for the given word is available.
			There are several possibilities for the definition of?clear deviatio
