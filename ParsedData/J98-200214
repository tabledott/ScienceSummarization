    The former is the model description length and the latter the data description length.
    In our current problem, it tends to be the case, in general, that a model nearer the root of the thesaurus tree, such as that in Figure 6, is simpler (in terms of the number of parameters), but tends to have a poorer fit to the data.
    In contrast, a model nearer the leaves of the thesaurus tree, such as that in Figure 4, is more complex, but tends to have a
