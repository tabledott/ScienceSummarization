ngths to find the links that are most typical of the positive subspace corresponding to each qualia role.
    PMI, with respect to other association measures, finds more specific links, which is good for our purposes.
    However, it is also notoriously prone to over-estimating the importance of rare items (Manning and Sch&#168;utze 1999, Chapter 5).
    Thus, before selecting the top 20 links ranked by PMI, we filter out those links that do not have at least 10 non-zero dimensions in the positive subspace.
    Many parameters here should be tuned more systematically (top n links, association measure, minimum non-zero dimensions), but the current results will nevertheless illustrate our methodology.
    Table 14 reports, for each quale, the TypeDM links that were selected in each of the 30 leave-one-concept-out folds.
    The links n is q, n in q, and q such as n are a good sketch of the Formal relation, which essentially subsumes various taxonomic relations.
    The other Formal links are less conspicuous.
