  On this basis we have constructed morphological nalyzers for English and French (with Carol Neidle) at Xerox PARC.

  0 serves here as the epsilon symbol.
  Because there is no need to have other annotations on the lexicon trees, problems I and II in Section 1 have been eliminated.
  Lexical forms are always sequences ofmorphemes in their canonical representation.
  The only obstacle to this approach is that the rules that constrain the surface realization of lexical forms become more difficult o write when there is little or no similarity between the two levels of repre- sentation.
  Designing such rules and under- standing their interactions i  a hard task even with the computational ssistance provided by a complete compiler for the tw
