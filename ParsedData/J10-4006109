to extract properties of certain kinds (corresponding to the qualia roles).
    The property-based description task is less constrained, because the most salient relations of a nominal concept might be in all sorts of relations with it (parts, typical behaviors, location, etc.).
    Still, we couch the task of unconstrained property extraction as a challenge in the W1W2xL space.
    The approach is similar to the method adopted for qualia roles, but now the whole W1W2xL space is used, instead of selected subspaces.
    Given all the (n, w2) pairs that have the target nominal concept as first element, we rank them by length in the W1W2xL space.
    The longest (n, w2) vectors in this space should correspond to salient properties of the target concept, as we expect a concept to often co-occur in texts with its important properties (because in the current DM implementations links are disjoint across POS, we map properties with different POS onto the same scale by dividing the length of the vector representing a
