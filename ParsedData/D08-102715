    We gather 10 annotations each for all 800 sentence pairs in the PASCAL RTE-1 dataset.
    For this dataset expert interannotator agreement studies have been reported as achieving 91% and 96% agreement over various subsections of the corpus.
    When considering multiple non-expert annotations for a sentence pair we use simple majority voting, breaking ties randomly and averaging performance over all possible ways to break ties.
    We collect 10 annotations for each of 100 RTE sentence pairs; as displayed in Figure 3, we achieve a maximum accuracy of 89.7%, averaging over the annotations of 10 workers5.

    We implement temporal ordering as a simplified version of the TimeBank event temp
