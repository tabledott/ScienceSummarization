 to form a tag distribution for each unknown word, according to its context and its form.
    Finally, the tag for each unknown word were selected according to its tag distribution.
    This strategy accounts for about half of the 7.5% unknown words.
    Table 6 shows the confusion matrix for known words (5% and up).
    The key confusions can be attributed to linguistic properties of Modern Hebrew: most Hebrew proper names are also nouns (and they are not marked by capitalization) &#8211; which explains the PN/N confusion.
    The verb/noun and verb/adjective confusions are explained by the nature of the participle form in Hebrew (beinoni) &#8211; participles behave syntactically almost in an identical manner as nouns.
  
  
    In this work, we have introduced a new text encoding method that captures rules of word formation in a language with affixational morphology such as Hebrew.
    This text encoding method allows us to learn in parallel segmentation and tagging rules in an unsupervised manner, despite
