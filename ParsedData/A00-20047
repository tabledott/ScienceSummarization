ment with b potential boundaries, b steps of divisive clustering generates {D(1), ...,D(b+1)} and {bD(2), oD(b+1)} (see figure 6 and 7).
    An unusually large reduction in 6D suggests the optiinal clustering has been obtained3 (see n = 10 in the threshold, p+c x to dD (c= 1.2 works well in practice) The running time of each step is dominated by the computation of sk.
    Given si,j is constant, our algorithm pre-computes all the values to improve speed performance.
    The procedure computes the values along diagonals, starting from the main diagonal and works towards the corner.
    The method has a complexity of order 171-5.n2.
    Let ri,j refer to the rank value in the rank matrix R and S to the sum of rank matrix.
    Given R of size n X 77,, S is computed in three steps (see equation 5).
    Figure 8 shows the result of applying this procedure to the rank matrix in figure 5.
