  Improved Alignment Models For Statistical Machine Translation
  
    PP &#8212; 31.5 In all experiments, we use the following three error criteria: &#8226; WER (word error rate): The WER is computed as the minimum number of substitution, insertion and deletion operations that have to be performed to convert the generated string into the target string.
    This performance criterion is widely used in speech recognition.
    &#8226; PER (position-independent word error rate): A shortcoming of the WER is the fact that it requires a perfect word order.
    This is 26 2: for Text and Speech Input: error rate (WER), positionindependent word error rate (PER) and subjective sentence error rate (SSER) with/without preprocessing (147 sentences = 1 968 words of the Verbmobil task).
