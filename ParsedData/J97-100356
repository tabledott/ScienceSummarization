ry short stretch of text, the algorithm is forced to make a somewhat arbitrary choice.
    Choices like these are cases in which the algorithm should probably make use of additional information, such as more localized lexical distribution information, or perhaps more conventional discourse cues.
    Note that the depth scores are based only on relative score information, ignoring absolute values.
    The justification for this is twofold.
    First, it helps make decisions in the cases in which a gap's lexical score falls into the middle of the lexical score range, but is flanked by tall peaks on either side, and this situation happens commonly enough to be important.
    Second, using relative rather than absolute scores helps avoid problems associated with situations like that of Figure 4(c), in which all gaps between c2 and c3 would be considered boundaries if only absolute scores were taken into account.
    The depth scores are sorted and used to determine segment boundaries.
    The larger the score, th
