n of D-Tree Grammars d-tree is a tree with two types of domination edges (d-edges) and immediate domination edges (i-edges).
    D-edges and i-edges express domination and immediate domination relations between nodes.
    These relations are never rescinded when dtrees are composed.
    Thus, nodes separated by an i-edge will remain in a mother-daughter relationship throughout the derivation, whereas nodes separated by an d-edge can be equated or have a path of any length inserted between them during a derivation.
    D-edges and i-edges are not distributed arbitrarily in d-trees.
    For each internal node, either all of its daughters are linked by i-edges or it has a single daughter that is linked to it by a d-edge.
    Each node is labelled with a terminal symbol, a nonterminal or the empty string. containing n can be decomposed into n + 1 containing only i-edges.
    D-trees can be composed using two operations: subsertion and sister-adjunction.
