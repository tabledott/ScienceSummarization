CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a), a treebank of CCG derivations obtained from the Penn Treebank, from which we also obtain our training data.
  
  
    Our aim is to use CCG derivations as input to a system for automatically producing the argument labels of PropBank.
    In order to do this, we wish to correlate the CCG relations above with PropBank arguments.
    PropBank argument labels are assigned to nodes in the syntactic trees from the Penn Treebank.
    While the CCGbank is derived from the Penn Treebank, in many cases the constituent structures do not correspond.
    That is, there may be no constituent in the CCG derivation corresponding to the same sequence of words as a particular constituent in the Treebank tree.
    For this reason, we compute the correspondence between the CCG derivation and the PropBank labels at the level of head words.
    For each role label for a verb&#8217;s argument in PropBank, we first find the head word for its constituent according to the the head rules of (C
