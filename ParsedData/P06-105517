urprisingly unimportant.
    Because smoothing is most necessary when production statistics are least reliable, we expect smoothing to help more with larger numbers of subsymbols.
    This is exactly what we observe in Figure 3, where smoothing initially hurts (subsymbols are quite distinct and do not need their estimates pooled) but eventually helps (as symbols have finer distinctions in behavior and smaller data support).
    When parsing new sentences with an annotated grammar, returning the most likely (unannotated) tree is intractable: to obtain the probability of an unannotated tree, one must sum over combinatorially many annotation trees (derivations) for each tree (Sima&#8217;an, 1992).
    Matsuzaki et al. (2005) discuss two approximations.
    The first is settling for the most probable derivation rather than most probable parse, i.e. returning the single most likely (Viterbi) annotated tree (derivation).
    This approximation is justified if the sum is dominated by one particular annotated tree.
