    First, the noun phrase that realizes the backward-looking center of an utterance in a discourse cannot be determined from the syntax of the utterance alone.
    Second, the relation N realizes c between noun phrases N and centers c is neither solely a semantic nor solely a pragmatic relation.
    This discussion has proceeded at a rather intuitive level, without explicit elaboration of the framework we regard as appropriate for dealing with centering and its role in explaining discourse phenomena.
    Before going on to describe constraints on the realization relation that explain certain phenomena in discourse, we should be somewhat more explicit about the notions of center and realization.
    We have said that each utterance S in a discourse has associated with it a backward-looking center, Cb(S), and a set of forward-looking centers, Cf(S).
    What manner of objects are these centers?
