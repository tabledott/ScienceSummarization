encies that were re-created through classbased smoothing, using the BNC as a training corpus (after removing the seen bigrams).
    This will be discussed in more detail in Section 3.3.
    Previous work has demonstrated that corpus counts correlate with human plausibility judgments for adjective-noun bigrams.
    This result holds both for seen bigrams (Lapata, McDonald, and Keller 1999) and for unseen bigrams whose counts have been re-created using smoothing techniques (Lapata, Keller, and McDonald 2001).
    Based on these findings, we decided to evaluate our Web counts on the task of predicting plausibility ratings.
    If the Web counts for bigrams correlate with plausibility judgments, then this indicates that the counts are valid, in the sense of being useful for predicting the intuitive plausibility of predicate-argument pairs.
    The degree of correlation between Web counts and plausibility judgments is an indicator of the quality of the Web counts (compared to corpus counts or counts re-created usi
