    In section 2.1 we introduce our definitions for taxonomies, relations, and the taxonomic constraints that enforce dependencies between relations; in section 2.2 we give a probabilistic model for defining the conditional probability of a set of relational evidence given a taxonomy; in section 2.3 we formulate a local search algorithm to find the taxonomy maximizing this conditional probability; and in section 2.4 we extend our framework to deal with lexical ambiguity.
    We define a taxonomy T as a set of pairwise relations R over some domain of objects DT.
    For example, the relations in W
