ults for this system on test data, held out during development of the system, are shown in Table correct, without use of any of the syntactic features.
  
  
    It is interesting to note that looking at a constituent's position relative to the target word along with active/passive information performed as well as reading grammatical function off the parse tree.
    A system using grammatical function, along with the head word, phrase type, and target word, but no passive information, scored 79.2%.
    A similar system using position rather than grammatical function scored 78.8% &#8212; nearly identical performance.
    However, using head word, phrase type, and target word without either position or grammatical function yielded only 76.3%, indicating that while the two features accomplish a similar goal, it is important to include some measure of the constituent's syntactic relationship to the target word.
    Our final system incorporated both features, giving a further, though not significant, improvement.
