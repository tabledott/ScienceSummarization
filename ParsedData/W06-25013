s (Sch&#168;utze, 1998) in combination with the structure and content of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), a semantic network of concepts.
    This measure captures semantic information for concepts from contextual information drawn from corpora of text.
    We show that this measure compares favorably to other measures with respect to human judgments of semantic relatedness, and that it performs well when used in a word sense disambiguation algorithm that relies on semantic relatedness.
    This measure is flexible in that it can make comparisons between any two concepts without regard to their part of speech.
    In addition, it is adaptable since any corpora can be used to derive the word vectors.
    This paper is organized as follows.
    We start with a description of second order context vectors in general, and then define the Gloss Vector measure in particular.
    We present an extensive evaluation of the measure, both with respect to human relatedness judgments and also relative to its performance when used
