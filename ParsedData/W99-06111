efer to the same real-world entity.
    The vast majority of algorithms for noun phrase coreference combine syntactic and, less often, semantic cues via a set of hand-crafted heuristics and filters.
    All but one system in the MUC-6 coreference performance evaluation (MUC, 1995), for example, handled coreference resolution in this manner.
    This same reliance on complicated hand-crafted algorithms is true even for the narrower task of pronoun resolution.
    Some exceptions exist, however.
    Ge et al. (1998) present a probabilistic model for pronoun resolution trained on a small subset of the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).
    Dagan and Itai (1991) develop a statistical filter for resolution of the pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; that selects among syntactically viable antecedents based on relevant subject-verb-object cooccurrences.
    Aone and Bennett (1995) and McCarthy and Lehnert (1995) employ decision tree algorithms to handle a broader subset of general noun phrase
