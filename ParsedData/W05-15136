 reduction, the item on top of S is popped, and a new item is pushed onto S. The new item consists of a tree formed by a non-terminal node with the popped item as its single child.
    The lexical head of the new item is the same as the lexical head of the popped item.
    In a binary reduction, two items are popped from S in sequence, and a new item is pushed onto S. The new item consists of a tree formed by a non-terminal node with two children: the first item popped from S is the right child, and the second item is the left child.
    The lexical head of the new item is either the lexical head of its left child, or the lexical head of its right child.
    If S is empty, only a shift action is allowed.
    If W is empty, only a reduce action is allowed.
    If both S and W are non-empty, either shift or reduce actions are possible.
    Parsing terminates when W is empty and S contains only one item, and the single item in S is the parse tree for the input string.
    Because the parse tree is lexicalized, w
