infinite) set of possible trees, and the denominator cannot be calculated explicitly.
    This is a problem for parameter estimation, in which an estimate of the denominator is required, and Monte Carlo methods have been proposed (Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty 1997; Abney 1997; Rosenfeld 1997) as a technique for estimation of this value.
    Our sense is that these methods can be computationally expensive.
    Notice that the joint likelihood in equation (27) is not a direct function of the margins on training examples, and its relation to error rate is therefore not so clear as in the discriminative approaches described in this article.
    Ratnaparkhi, Roukos, and Ward (1994), Johnson et al. (1999), and Riezler et al.
    (2002) suggest training log-linear models (i.e., the LogLoss function in equation (9)) for parsing problems.
    Ratnaparkhi, Roukos, and Ward (1994) use feature selection techniques for the task.
