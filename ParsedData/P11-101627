    Clearly, being published by the same person is the most useful relation for sentiment classification, which is consistent with the percentage distribution of the tweets over relation types; using retweet only does not help.
    One possible reason for this is that the retweets and their original tweets are nearly the same, so it is very likely that they have already got the same labels in previous classifications.
  
  
    Twitter sentiment analysis has attracted much attention recently.
    In this paper, we address targetdependent sentiment classification of tweets.
    Different from previous work using targetindependent classification, we propose to incorporate syntactic features to distinguish texts used for expressing sentiments towards different targets in a tweet.
    According to the experimental results, the classifiers incorporating target-dependent features significantly outperform the previous targetindependent classifiers.
    In addition, different from previous work using
