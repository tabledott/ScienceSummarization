 the results simply as &amp;quot;percent correct.&amp;quot; The accuracy of each model was averaged over the two directions of translation: English to French and French to English.
    The five-fold replication of annotations in the test data enabled computation of the statistical significance of the differences in model accuracy.
    The statistical significance of all results in this section was measured at the a = .05 level, using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test.
    Although the models were evaluated on part of the same bitext on which they were trained, the evaluations were with respect to the translational equivalence relation hidden in this bitext, not with respect to any of the bitext's visible features.
    Such testing on training data is standard practice for unsupervised learning algorithms, where the objective is to compare several methods.
    Of course, performance would degrade on previously unseen data.
    In addition to the different translation models, there were two other independent varia
