numbers in Table 7, t=l , which is not significant.
			(A t of 1.65 or more would be significant at the p &gt; 0.95 confidence level.)
			Similarly, if e and f appeared in just two pieces 1 each, then there is approximately a ~ chance that they would both appear in the same two pieces, and then the mutual information score would be quite log, , ~--, but we probably wouldn't believe it high, Z. because the t-score would be only "~-.
			By this definition of significance, we need to see the two words in at least 3 different pieces before the result would be considered significant.
			This means, unfortunately, that we would reject fisheries --+ p~ches because we found them in only two pieces.
			The problem, of course, is that we don't have enough pieces.
			When K=10, there simply isn't enough resolution to see what's going on.
			At K=100, we obtain the contingency matrix shown in Table 8, and the t-score is significant (t=2.1).

			As we have seen
