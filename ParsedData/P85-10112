  TREE ADJO IN ING GRAMMARS- -TAGs We now introduce tree adjoining grammars (TAGs).
  TAGs are more powerful than CFGs, botb weakly and strongly, l TAGs were first introduced in [Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi,1975J and [Joehi,1983 I.
  We include their description in this ~*ction to make the paper ~lf-contalned.
  We can define a tree adjoining grammar as follows.
  A tree adjoining grammar G is a paw (i,A) where i is a set of initial trees, and A is a set of auxiliary trees.
  A tree a ls an initial tree if it is of the form GI I S I I  eE .
  r~ l I l That m, the root node of a is labelled S and the frontier nodes are all terminal symbob.
  The internal nodes are ~11 non-terminals.
  A tree ~ is an acxiliar?
