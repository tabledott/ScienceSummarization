    The flow of subtopic structure as determined by lexical co-occurrence is illustrated graphically in Figure 2.
    This figure shows the distribution, by sentence number, of selected terms from the Stargazers text.
    The number of times a given word occurs in a given sentence is shown, with blank spaces indicating zero occurrences.
