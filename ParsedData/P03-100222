ons, e.g. determined by the active or passive form of the verb, relative subjects or objects etc.
    Predicate argument structures offer the great advantage that syntactic variations do not need to be accounted by IE systems anymore.
    Because entity and event coreference, as well as templette merging will attempt to recover from partial patterns or predicate argument recognitions, and our goal is to compare the usage of FSA patterns versus predicate argument structures, we decided to disable the coreference and merging modules.
    This explains why in Figure 7 these modules are repre
  
  
    To evaluate the proposed IE paradigm we selected two Event99 domains: &#8220;market change&#8221;, which tracks changes in stock indexes, and &#8220;death&#8221;, which extracts all manners of human deaths.
    These domains were selected because most of the domain information can be processed without needing entity or event coreference.
    Moreover, one of the domains (market change) uses verbs commonly used in P
