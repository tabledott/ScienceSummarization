ught of as the negative logarithm of a conditional probability P(L|M).
    This indicates the probability that a morph M is a realisation of a morpheme represented by the label L. Put another way, if the unsupervised segmentation algorithm discovers morphs that are allomorphs of real morphemes, a particular allomorph will ideally always be aligned with the same (correct) morphemic label, which leads to a high probability P(L|M), and a short distance d(M, L)4.
    In contrast, if the segmentation algorithm does not discover meaningful morphs, each of the segments will be aligned with a number of different morphemic labels throughout the corpus, and as a consequence, the probabilities will be low and the distances high.
    We then utilize the EM algorithm for iteratively improving the alignment.
    The initial alignment that is used for computing initial distance values is obtained through a string matching procedure: String matching is efficient for aligning the stem of the word with the base form (e.g., the
