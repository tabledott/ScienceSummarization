945;.
    Note that this is a heuristic, in that there is no guarantee that this procedure will find the highest scoring parse, arg maxhEHn &#934;(h) &#183; &#175;&#945;.
    Search errors, where arg maxhEyn &#934;(h) &#183; &#945;&#175; =&#65533; arg maxhEHn &#934;(h) &#183; &#175;&#945;, will create errors in decoding test sentences, and also errors in implementing the perceptron training algorithm in Figure 1.
    In this paper we give empirical results that suggest that FILTER can be chosen in such a way as to give efficient parsing performance together with high parsing accuracy.
    The exact implementation of the parser will depend on the definition of partial analyses, of ADV and FILTER, and of the representation &#934;.
    The next section describes our instantiation of these choices.
  
  
    The parser is an incremental beam-search parser very similar to the sort described in Roark (2001a; 2004), with some changes in the search strategy to accommodate the perceptron feature weights.
