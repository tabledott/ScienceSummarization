g that all the documents retrieved by the IR system are relevant to the scenario and the pattern set that performs well on the text classification task also works well on the entity extraction task.
    The unsupervised text classification task is to measure how close a pattern matching system, given a set of extraction patterns, simulates the document retrieval of the same IR system as in the previous sub-section.
    The value is optimized so that the cumulative performance of the precision-recall curve over the entire range of recall for the text classification task is maximized.
    The document set for text classification is composed of the documents retrieved by the same IR system as in Section 3.2 plus the same number of documents picked up randomly, where all the documents are taken from a different document set from the one used for pattern learning.
    The pattern matching system, given a set of extraction patterns, classifies a document as retrieved if any of the patterns match any portion of the
