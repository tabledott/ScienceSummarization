ll patterns that extract &#8220;Peru&#8221; and computes the average number of known locations extracted by those patterns.
    Let&#8217;s assume that the three patterns shown below extract &#8220;Peru&#8221; and that the underlined words are known locations.
    &#8220;Peru&#8221; would receive a score of (2+3+2)/3 = 2.3.
    Intuitively, this means that patterns that extract &#8220;Peru&#8221; also extract, on average, 2.3 known location words.
    Unfortunately, this scoring function has a problem.
    The average can be heavily skewed by one pattern that extracts a large number of category members.
    For example, suppose word w is extracted by 10 patterns, 9 which do not extract any category members but the tenth extracts 50 category members.
    The average number of category members extracted by these patterns will be 5.
    This is misleading because the only evidence linking word w with the semantic category is a single, high-frequency extraction pattern (which may extract words that belong to othe
