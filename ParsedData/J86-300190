    More typically, ICPs employ indirect means of indicating that a change is coming and what kind of change it is.
    Cue phrases provide abbreviated, indirect means of indicating these changes.
    In all discourse changes, the ICP must provide information that allows the OCP to determine all of the following: Cue phrases can pack in all of this information, except for (5).
    In this section, we explore the predictions of our discourse structure theory about different uses of these phrases and the explanations the theory offers for their various roles.
    We use the configuration of attentional state and intentional structure illustrated in Figure 10 as the starting point of our analysis.
    In the initial configuration, the focus space stack has a space with DSP X at the bottom and another space with DSP A at the top.
    The intentional structure i
