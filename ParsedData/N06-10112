s, our algorithm identifies the corresponding NEs in the second language text, and annotates them with the appropriate type, as in the source text.
    The first observation is that NEs in one language in such corpora tend to co-occur with their counterparts in the other.
    E.g., Figure 1 shows a histogram of the number of occurrences of the word Hussein and its Russian transliteration in our bilingual news corpus spanning years 2001 through late 2005.
    One can see several common peaks in the two histograms, largest one being around the time of the beginning of the war in Iraq.
    The word Russia, on the other hand, has a distinctly different temporal signature.
    We can exploit such weak synchronicity of NEs across languages as a way to associate them.
    In order to score a pair of entities across languages, we compute the similarity of their time distributions.
    The second observation is that NEs are often transliterated or have a common etymological origin across languages, and thus are phonet
