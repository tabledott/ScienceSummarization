ence degradation deactivated IX all &amp;quot;structural&amp;quot; salience weighting deactivated (II + III + V + VI) X all salience weighting and degradation deactivated The single most important element of the salience weighting mechanism is the recency preference (sentence recency factor and salience degradation; see VIII).
    This is not surprising, given the relative scarcity of intersentential anaphora in our test corpus (less than 20% of the pronoun occurrences had antecedents in the preceding sentence).
    Deactivating the equivalence class mechanism also led to a significant deterioration in RAP's performance; in this variant (VII), only the salience factors applying to a particular NP contribute to its salience weight, without any contribution from other anaphorically linked NPs.
    The performance of the syntactic filter is degraded somewhat in this variant as well, since NPs that are anaphorically linked to an NP fulfilling the criteria for disjoint reference will no longer be rejected as antec
