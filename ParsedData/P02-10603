s in much the same way as a general regular expression matcher.
    Typical systems are Univ. of Sheffield's LaSIE-II [Humphreys+98], ISOQuest's NetOwl [Aone+98] [Krupha+98] and Univ. of Edinburgh's LTG [Mikheev+98] [Mikheev+99] for English NER.
    These systems are mainly rule-based.
    However, rule-based approaches lack the ability of coping with the problems of robustness and portability.
    Each new source of text requires significant tweaking of rules to maintain optimal performance and the maintenance costs could be quite steep.
    The current trend in NER is to use the machine-learning approach, which is more attractive in that it is trainable and adaptable and the maintenance of a machine-learning system is much cheaper than that of a rule-based one.
    The representative machine-learning approaches used in NER are HMM (BBN's IdentiFinder in [Miller+98] [Bikel+99] and KRDL's system [Yu+98] for Chinese NER.
