 19,962 subjective expressions in the 535 documents (11,112 sentences) of the MPQA corpus were annotated with their contextual polarity as just described.5 Three annotators carried out the task: the two who participated in the annotation study and a third who was trained later.6 Table 5 gives the distribution of the contextual polarity tags.
    Looking at this table, we see that a small majority of subjective expressions (54.6%) are expressing a positive, negative, or both (positive and negative) sentiment.
    We refer to these expressions as polar in context.
    Many of the subjective expressions are neutral and do not express a sentiment.
    This suggests that, although sentiment is a major type of subjectivity, distinguishing other prominent types of subjectivity will be important for future work in subjectivity analysis.
    As many NLP applications operate at the sentence level, one important issue to consider is the distribution of sentences with respect to the subjective expressions they contain.
