n predicted by the system without the preprocessing step presented in Subsection 6.1.
    In terms of PCS, which is a scope based measure, results are considerably higher than baseline results, whereas in terms of precision, recall and F1, which are token based measures, results are lower.
    Evaluating the system in terms of a more relaxed measure (PCS-2) does not reflect a significant increase in its performance.
    This suggests that when a scope is incorrectly predicted, main content tokens are also incorrectly left out of the scope or added.
    Results also show that the system based on predicted hedge cues performs lower for all corpora, which is also a trend observed for the negation scope finding system.
    The difference in performance for abstracts and papers follows the same trends as in the negation system, whereas the drop in performance for the clinical subcorpus is bigger.
    This can be explained by the results obtained in the cues finding phase, where the clinical subcorpus obtained only
