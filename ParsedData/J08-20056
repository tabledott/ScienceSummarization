ystem that achieves very competitive results and was one of the top systems in the CoNLL-2004 shared task competition (Carreras and Ma`rquez 2004).
  This comparison brings forward a care- ful analysis of the significance of full parsing information in the SRL task, and provides an understanding of the stages in the process in which this information makes the most difference.
  Finally, to relieve the dependency of the SRL system on the quality of 258 Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih Importance of Parsing and Inference in SRL automatic parsers, we suggest a way to improve semantic role labeling significantly by developing a global inference algorithm, which is used to combine several SRL systems based on different state-of-the-art full parsers.
  The combination process is done through a joint inference stage, which takes the output of each individual system as input and generates the best predictions, subject to various structural and linguistic constraints.
  The underlying system architecture can largely affect t
