TAG, the importance of the dependency structure means that not only the derived phrase-structure tree is of interest, but also the operations by which we obtained it from elementary structures.
    This information is encoded in the derivation tree (Vijay-Shanker, 1987).
    However, as Vijay-Shanker (1992) observes, the operations are not used uniformly: while substitution is used only to add a (nominal) complement, adjunction is used both for modification and (clausal) complementation.
    Clausal complementation could not be handled uniformly by substitution because of the existence of syntactic such as in English.
    Furthermore, there is an inconsistency in 151 the directionality of the operations used for complementation in TAG@: nominal complements are substituted into their governing verb's tree, while the governing verb's tree is adjoined into its own clausal complement.
    The fact that adjunction and substitution are used in a linguistically heterogeneous manner means that (standard) TAG derivati
