e antecedent for each referring expression in a document.
    In coreference resolution, it is common that two or more candidates compete to be the antecedent of an anaphor (Mitkov, 1999).
    Whether a candidate is coreferential to an anaphor is often determined by the competition among all the candidates.
    So far, various algorithms have been proposed to determine the preference relationship between two candidates.
    Mitkov&#8217;s knowledge-poor pronoun resolution method (Mitkov, 1998), for example, uses the scores from a set of antecedent indicators to rank the candidates.
    And centering algorithms (Brennan et al., 1987; Strube, 1998; Tetreault, 2001), sort the antecedent candidates based on the ranking of the forward-looking or backwardlooking centers.
    In recent years, supervised machine learning approaches have been widely used in coreference resolution (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy, 1996; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002a), and have achieved significant success.
