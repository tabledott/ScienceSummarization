	Top Accuracy and Fast Dependency Parsing is not a Contradiction
		In addition to a high accuracy, short parsing and training times are the most important properties of a parser.
		However, pars ing and training times are still relatively long.
		To determine why, we analyzed thetime usage of a dependency parser.
		We il lustrate that the mapping of the features onto their weights in the support vectormachine is the major factor in time complexity.
		To resolve this problem, we implemented the passive-aggressive percep tron algorithm as a Hash Kernel.
		The Hash Kernel substantially improves the parsing times and takes into account thefeatures of negative examples built dur ing the training.
		This has lead to a higher accuracy.
		We could further increase theparsing and training speed with a paral lel feature extraction and a parallel parsing algorithm.
		We are convinced that the HashKernel and the parallelization can be ap plied successful to other NLP applicationsas well such as transition based depen de
