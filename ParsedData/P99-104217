rom improved name tagging However, some modules that seemed to have little effect with automatic name tagging provided small gains with perfect name tagging, specifically WordNet common noun semantics and automatic pronoun resolution.
    When used in combination with the filtering module, these also seemed to help.
    Similarly, the hand-tagged reference resolution data allowed us to evaluate automatic coreference resolution.
    The latter was a combination of name coreference, as determined by Alembic, and a heuristic resolution of personal pronouns to the most recent prior named person.
    Using the MUC coreference scoring algorithm (see Vilain et al. 1995), this had a precision of 77% and a recall of 18%.3 The use of full, handtagged reference resolution caused a substantial increase of the AnsWdRecall metric.
    This was because the system substitutes the antecedent for all referring expressions, improving the wordbased measure.
    This did not, however, provide an increase in the sentence-based mea
