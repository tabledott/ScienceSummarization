 extremely important for assessing the quality of MT output, as it reflects to what degree the translation covers the entire content of the translated sentence* BLEU does not use recall because the notion of recall is unclear when matching simultaneously against a set of reference translations (rather than a single reference)* To compensate for recall, BLEU uses a Brevity Penalty, which penalizes translations for being &amp;quot;too short&amp;quot;* The NIST metric is conceptually similar to BLEU in most aspects, including the weaknesses discussed below* BLEU and NIST suffer from several weaknesses, which we attempt to address explicitly in our proposed METEOR metric: The Lack of Recall: We believe that the fixed brevity penalty in BLEU does not adequately compensate for the lack of recall* Our experimental results strongly support this claim* Use of Higher Order N-grams: Higher order N-grams are used in BLEU as an indirect measure of a translation's level of grammatical wellformedness* We believe an explicit
