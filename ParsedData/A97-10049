 is the entire Brown corpus.
    We present the Brown corpus performance to show the importance of training on the genre of text. on which testing will be performed.
    Table 1 also shows the number of sentences in each corpus, the number of candidate punctuation marks, the accuracy over potential sentence boundaries, the number of false positives and the number of false negatives.
    Performance on the WSJ corpus was, as we expected, higher than performance on the Brown corpus since we trained the model on financial newspaper text.
    Possibly more significant. than the system's performance is its portability to new domains and languages.
    A trimmed down system which used no information except that derived from the training corpus performs nearly as well, and requires no resources other than a training corpus.
    Its performance on the same two corpora is shown in Table 2.
    Since 39441 training sentences is considerably more than might exist in a new domain or a language other than English, we expe
