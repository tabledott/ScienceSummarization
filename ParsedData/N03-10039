ubstitution) from a cluster of 49, similarities emphasized. multiple-sequence alignment to clusters of sentences describing approximately similar events; these patterns are represented compactly by lattices (see Figure 3).
    We then check for lattices from the two different corpora that tend to take the same arguments; these lattice pairs are taken to be paraphrase patterns.
    Once training is done, we can generate paraphrases as follows: given the sentence &#8220;The surprise bombing injured twenty people, five of them seriously&#8221;, we match it to the lattice X (injured/wounded) Y people, Z of them seriously which can be rewritten as Y were (wounded/hurt) by X, among them Z were in serious condition, and so by substituting arguments we can generate &#8220;Twenty were wounded by the surprise bombing, among them five were in serious condition&#8221; or &#8220;Twenty were hurt by the surprise bombing, among them five were in serious condition&#8221;.
    Our first step is to cluster sentences into group
