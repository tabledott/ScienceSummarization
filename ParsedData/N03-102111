n, we say that a d-span is in normal form all the inequalities between and are strict, i.e. there is a gap between each pair of consecutive Now, a hedge item Parser A is d-link with a vector of d-spans normal form.
    The cardinality of an item is the total number of intervals in its d-span vector.
    Binarized MTG productions can be inferred under generalizations of the ID and LP constraints described in Section 3.
    We use two helper functions to express these constraints.
    + is the concatenation operator for d-spans: Given two d-spans, it outthe union of their intervals in normal The 0 function computes the role template that describes the relative positions of the intervals in two E.g., if v = (1, 3; 8, 9) and = then + = (1, 3; 7, 9) and v 0 = [1], [2, 1].
    Both operators apply componentwise to vectors of d-spans.
    With their help, we state the composition inference rule of Parser A: Y(v),X =N (Y,Z) + The space complexity of Parser A is a function of the maximum number of boundaries stored in
