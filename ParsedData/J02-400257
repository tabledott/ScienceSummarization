ith data sparseness.
    In fact, our experiments in section 5.1.2 will show the usefulness of our (manual) semantic clusters: The clustered list performs much better than the unclustered list (i.e., when the string itself is used as a value instead of its semantic class).
    Agent.
    Agents and actions are more challenging to recognize.
    We use a mechanism that, dependent on the voice of a sentence, recognizes agents (subjects or prepositional phrases headed by by) and their predicates (&#8220;actions&#8221;).
    Classification of agents and actions relies on a manually created lexicon of manual classes.
    As in the Formulaic feature, similar agents and actions are generalized and clustered together to avoid data sparseness.
    The lexicon for agent patterns (cf.
    Table 6) contains 13 types of agents and a total of 167 patterns.
    These 167 patterns expand to many more strings as we use a replace mechanism (e.g., the placeholder WORK NOUN in the sixth row of Table 6 can be replaced by a set of
