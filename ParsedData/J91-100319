    Orientational metaphors are mainly to do with kinds of spatial orientation like up-down, in-out, and deep-shallow.
    Example metaphors include MORE IS UP and HAPPY IS UP.
    They arise from human experience of spatial orientation and thus develop from the sort of bodies we have and the way they function in our physical environment.
    Ontological metaphors arise from our basic human experiences with substances and physical objects (especially our own bodies).
    Some examples are TIME IS A SUBSTANCE, THE MIND IS AN ENTITY, and THE VISUAL FIELD IS A CONTAINER.
    Structural metaphors are elaborated orientational and ontological metaphors (cf.
    Lakoff and Johnson 1980) in which concepts that correspond to natural kinds of experience, e.g., PHYSICAL ORIENTATIONS, SUBSTANCES, WAR, JOURNEYS, and BUILDINGS, are used to define other concepts, also natural kinds of experience, e.g., LOVE, TIME, IDEAS, UNDERSTANDING, and ARGUMENTS.
    Some examples of structural metaphors are ARGUMENT IS WAR and TIME IS
