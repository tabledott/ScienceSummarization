r qualitative analyses on those components that make a significant contribution to the quantitative results; we need to be able to measure the effect of various factors.
    These measurements must be made by doing comparisons at the data level.
    In terms of general results, we have identified some factors that make evaluations of this type more complicated and which might lead us to evaluate solely quantitative results with care.
    These are: (a) To decide how to evaluate UNDERSPECIFICATIONS and the contribution of ASSUMPTIONS, and (b) To determine the effects of FALSE POSITIVES and ERROR CHAINING.
    We advocate an approach in which the contribution of each underspecification and assumption is tabulated as well as the effect of error chains.
    If a principled way could be found to identify false positives, their effect should be reported as well as part of any quantitative evaluation.
    In addition, we have taken a few steps towards determining the relative importance of different factors to the s
