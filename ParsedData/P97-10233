Our method achieves high precision (more than 90%), and, while our focus to date has been on adjectives, it can be directly applied to other word classes.
    Ultimately, our goal is to use this method in a larger system to automatically identify antonyms and distinguish near synonyms.
  
  
    Our approach relies on an analysis of textual corpora that correlates linguistic features, or indicators, with I Exceptions include a small number of terms that are both negative from a pragmatic viewpoint and yet stand in an antonyrnic relationship; such terms frequently lexicalize two unwanted extremes, e.g., verbose&#8212;terse. semantic orientation.
    While no direct indicators of positive or negative semantic orientation have been proposed3, we demonstrate that conjunctions between adjectives provide indirect information about orientation.
    For most connectives, the conjoined adjectives usually are of the same orientation: compare fair and legitimate and corrupt and brutal which actually occur in our corpus,
