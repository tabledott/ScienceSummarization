x workstation, LEXAS can process about 15 examples per second when tested on the &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; data set.
    Previous research on WSD tend to be tested only on a dozen number of words, where each word frequently has either two or a few senses.
    To test the scalability of LEXAS, we have gathered a corpus in which 192,800 word occurrences have been manually tagged with senses from WORD NET 1.5.
    This data set is almost two orders of magnitude larger in size than the above &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; data set.
    Manual tagging was done by university undergraduates majoring in Linguistics, and approximately one man-year of efforts were expended in tagging our data set.
    These 192,800 word occurrences consist of 121 nouns and 70 verbs which are the most frequently occurring and most ambiguous words of English.
    The 121 nouns are: action activity age air area art board body book business car case center century change child church city class college community company condition cost cou
