l allows us to output precise semantic representations as well as to use syntactic, semantic and lexical information to reduce ambiguity and rank parses.
  
  
    The fundamental notion of an BPSG is the sign.
    A sign is a complex feature structure representing information of different linguistic levels of a phrase or lexical item.
    The attributevalue matrix of a sign in the Japanese BPSG is quite similar to a sign in the LinGO English Resource Grammar (henceforth ERG) (Flickinger 2000), with information about the orthographical realization of the lexical sign in PHON, syntactic and semantic information in SYNSEM, information about the lexical status in LEX, nonlocal information in NONLOC, head information that goes up the tree in HEAD and information about subcategorization in SUBCAT.
    The grammar implementation is based on a system of types.
    There are 900 lexical types that define the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties of the Japanese words, and 188 types that define the properties o
