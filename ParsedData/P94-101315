ted forms not observed in the training data.
    Also, a basic lexicon with possible parts of speech (augmented by the morphological analyzer) allowed adjacent part-of-speech sequences to be used as disambiguating evidence.
    A relatively coarse level of analysis (e.g.
    NOUN, ADJECTIVE, SUBJECT-PRONOUN, ARTICLE, etc.
    ), augmented with independently modeled features representing gender, person, and number, was found to be most effective.
    However, when a word was listed with multiple parts-of-speech, no relative frequency distribution was available.
    Such words were given a part-of-speech tag consisting of the union of the possibilities (eg ADJECTIVE-NOUN), as in Kupiec (1989).
    Thus sequences of pure part-of-speech tags were highly reliable, while the potential sources of noise were isolated and modeled separately.
    In addition, several word classes such as WEEKDAY and MONTH were defined, primarily focusing on time words because so many accent ambiguities involve tense distinctions.
