 two criteria: By this classification, beam-search can be applied to both graph-based and transition-based parsers.
    Representative of each method, MSTParser and MaltParser gave comparable accuracies in the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).
    However, they make different types of errors, which can be seen as a reflection of their theoretical differences (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).
    MSTParser has the strength of exact inference, but its choice of features is constrained by the requirement of efficient dynamic programming.
    MaltParser is deterministic, yet its comparatively larger feature range is an advantage.
    By comparing the two, three interesting research questions arise: (1) how to increase the flexibility in defining features for graph-based parsing; (2) how to add search to transition-based parsing; and (3) how to combine the two parsing approaches so that the strengths of each are utilized.
    In this paper, we study these questions under one framework: beam-search.
