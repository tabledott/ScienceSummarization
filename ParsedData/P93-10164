 enough information such that the internal nodes of the structure are irrelevant.
    The message passing process is initiated by sending initial items externally to lexical nodes (e.g., N, P, ...).
    The initial items represent the words in the sentence.
    The attribute values of these items are obtained from the lexicon.
    In case of lexical ambiguity, each possibility is represented by an item.
    For example, suppose the input sentence is &amp;quot;I saw a man,&amp;quot; then the word &amp;quot;saw&amp;quot; is represented by the following two items sent to nodes N and V:NP2 respectively: &lt; [1 , 1.]
    , ( (cat n) -plu (nform norm)), 0&gt; &lt;[1,1], ((cat v) (cform fin) -pas (tense past)), {}&gt; When a node receives an item, it attempts to combine the item with items from other nodes to form new items.
    Two items The result of the combination is a new item: &lt;[i1j2], unify(Ai, A2), Si U S2&gt;&#8226; The new items represent larger parse trees resulted from combining smaller ones.
    The
