a reply followed by an EXPLAIN, but in many cases, the actual change in meaning is so small that coders are reluctant to mark the addition as truly informative.
    Route givers tend to make CLARIFY moves when the route follower seems unsure of what to do, but there isn't a specific problem on the agenda (such as a landmark now known not to be shared).
    Example 35 goal or because the responder does not share the same goals as the initiator.
    Often refusal takes the form of ignoring the initiation and simply initiating some other move.
    However, it is also possible to make such refusals explicit; for instance, a participant could rebuff a question with &amp;quot;No, let's talk about ... ,&amp;quot; an initiation with &amp;quot;What do you mean&#8212;that won't work!&amp;quot;, or an explanation about the location of a landmark with &amp;quot;Is it?&amp;quot; said with an appropriately unbelieving intonation.
    One might consider these cases akin to ACKNOWLEDGE moves, but with a negative slant.
