jective, we do not necessarily expect phrases or sentences containing objective senses to be objective.
    Consider the following examples: Will someone shut that damn alarm off?
    Can&#8217;t you even boil water?
    While these sentences contain objective senses of alarm and boil, the sentences are subjective nonetheless.
    But they are not subjective due to alarm and boil, but rather to punctuation, sentence forms, and other words in the sentence.
    Thus, classifying a sense as O means that, when the sense is used in a text or conversation, we do not expect it to express subjectivity and, if the phrase or sentence containing it is subjective, the subjectivity is due to something else.
    Finally, classifying a sense as B means it covers both subjective and objective usages, e.g.
    : absorb, suck, imbibe, soak up, sop up, suck up, draw, take in, take up &#8211; (take in, also metaphorically; &#8220;The sponge absorbs water well&#8221;; &#8220;She drew strength from the minister&#8217;s words&#8221
