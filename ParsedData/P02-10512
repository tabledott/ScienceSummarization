amed entity translation, though the technique is applicable to any language pair and does not require especially difficult-to-obtain resources.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    In Section 2, we give an overview of our approach.
    In Section 3, we describe how translation candidates are generated.
    In Section 4, we show how monolingual clues are used to help re-rank the translation candidates list.
    In Section 5, we describe how the candidates list can be extended using contextual information.
    We conclude this paper with the evaluation results of our translation algorithm on a test set.
    We also compare our system with human translators and a commercial system.
