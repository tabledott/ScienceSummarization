    If we ignore the tag marking rising intonation (rt), since this is not a DA tag, we find 180,218 total tags.
    Table 3 shows the distribution of the tags in more detail.
    If instead we look at only the 11 obligatory general tags, for which there is one per DA, and if we split labels at the pipe bar, the total is 113,560 (excluding tags that only include a disruption label).
    The distribution of general tags is shown in Table 4.

    Word-level time information is available, based on alignments from an automatic speech recognizer.
    Annotator comments are also provided.
    We suggest various ways to group the large set of labels into a smaller set of classes, depending on the research focus.
    Finally, the corpus contains information that may be useful in for developing automatic modeling of prosody, such as hand-marked annotation of risi
