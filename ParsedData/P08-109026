e ordering within, not a closed list.
    However, it is worthwhile to construct discrete narrative chains, if only to see whether the combination of event learning and ordering produce scriptlike structures.
    This is easily achievable by using the PMI scores from section 4 in an agglomerative clustering algorithm, and then applying the ordering relations from section 5 to produce a directed graph.
    Figures 6 and 7 show two learned chains after clustering and ordering.
    Each arrow indicates a before relation.
    Duplicate arrows implied by rules of transitivity are removed.
    Figure 6 is remarkably accurate, and figure 7 addresses one of the chains from our introduction, the employment narrative.
    The core employment events are accurate, but clustering included life events (born, died, graduated) from obituaries of which some temporal information is incorrect.
    The Timebank corpus does not include obituaries, thus we suffer from sparsity in training data.
