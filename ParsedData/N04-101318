    In this format each triple specifies that a particular relation holds between a head and either another head or a feature value, for example, that the SUBJ relation holds between the heads run and dog in the sentence The dog ran.
    Average sentence length of sentences in DEPBANK is 19.8 words, and the average number of dependencies per sentence is 65.4.
    The corpus is freely available for research and evaluation, as are documentation and tools for displaying and pruning structures.3 In our experiments we used a Reduced version of the DEPBANK, including just the minimum set of dependencies necessary for reading out the central semantic relations and properties of a sentence.
    We tested against this Reduced gold standard to establish accuracy on a lower bound of the information that a meaning-sensitive application would require.
    The Reduced version contained all the argument and adjunct dependencies shown in Fig.
