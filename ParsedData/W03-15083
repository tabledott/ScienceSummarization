 is to recognize words in Japanese or Arabic text which happen to be transliterations of English names.
    If the orthography of a language is strongly phonetic, as is the case for Korean, then one may use relatively simple hidden Markov models to transform English pronunciations, as shown by Jung et al (2000).
    The work closest to our application scenario, and the one with which we will be making several direct comparisons, is that of Meng et al (2001).
    In their work, a set of hand-crafted transformations for locally editing the phonemic spelling of an English word to conform to rules of Mandarin syllabification are used to seed a transformation-based learning algorithm.
    The algorithm examines some data and learns the proper sequence of application of the transformations to convert an English phoneme sequence to a Mandarin syllable sequence.
    Our paper describes a data driven counterpart to this technique, in which a cascade of two source-channel translation models is used to go from English n
