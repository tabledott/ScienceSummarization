ntic roles, such as SPEAKER, MESSAGE, and TOPIC.
    The system is based on statistical classifiers trained on roughly 50,000 sentences that were hand-annotated with semantic roles by the FrameNet semantic labeling project.
    We then parsed each training sentence into a syntactic tree and extracted various lexical and syntactic features, including the phrase type of each constituent, its grammatical function, and its position in the sentence.
    These features were combined with knowledge of the predicate verb, noun, or adjective, as well as information such as the prior probabilities of various combinations of semantic roles.
    We used various lexical clustering algorithms to generalize across possible fillers of roles.
    Test sentences were parsed, were annotated with these features, and were then passed through the classifiers.
    Our system achieves 82% accuracy in identifying the semantic role of presegmented constituents.
    At the more difficult task of simultaneously segmenting constituents a
