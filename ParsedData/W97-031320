    If a category is not well-represented in the corpus then it is doomed because inappropriate words become seed words in the early iterations and quickly derail the feedback loop.
    The Person category produced mixed results.
    Some good category words were found, such as rebel, advisers, criminal, and citizen.
    But many of the words referred to organizations (e.g., FMLN), groups (e.g., forces), and actions (e.g., attacks).
    Some of these words seemed reasonable, but it was hard to draw a line between specific references to people and concepts like organizations and groups that may or may not consist entirely of people.
    The large proportion of action words also diluted the list.
    More experiments are needed to better understand whether this category is inherently difficult or whether a more carefully chosen set of seed words would improve performance.
    More experiments are also needed to evaluate different seed word lists.
    The algorithm is clearly sensitive to the initial seed wor
