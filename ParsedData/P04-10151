ich might be useful in discriminating good from bad structures, without concerns about how the features interact with the problems of training (parameter estimation) or decoding (search for the most plausible candidate under the model).
    To this end, a number of recently proposed methods allow a model to incorporate &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; global features of candidate analyses or parses.
    Examples of such techniques are Markov Random Fields (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Abney, 1997; Della Pietra et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 1999), and boosting or perceptron approaches to reranking (Freund et al., 1998; Collins, 2000; Collins and Duffy, 2002).
    A drawback of these approaches is that in the general case, they can require exhaustive enumeration of the set of candidates for each input sentence in both the training and decoding phases'.
    For example, Johnson et al. (1999) and Riezler et al.
    (2002) use all parses generated by an LFG parser as input to an MRF approach &#8211; given the level of ambigui
