ion: At this step, the statistical distribution of the collocates of w is analyzed, and the interesting word pairs are automatically selected.
    If part of speech information is available, a separate analysis is made depending on the part of speech of the collocates.
    This balances the fact that verbs, adjectives, and nouns are simply not equally frequent.
    For each word w, we first analyze the distribution of the frequencies freq, of its collocates wi, and then compute its average frequency f and standard deviation a around f. We then replace freq, by its associated z-score k,. k, is called the strength of the word pair in Figure 4; it represents the number of standard deviation above the The collocates of &amp;quot;takeover&amp;quot; as retrieved from sentence (9). w w, distance PP takeover pill 4 N takeover make 2 V takeover attempt -1 N takeover expensive -3 J takeover allowing -5 V average of the frequency of the word pair w and w, and is defined as: k frech f a (la) Then, we analyze the distribu
