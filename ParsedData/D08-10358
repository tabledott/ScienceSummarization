topic segmentation in the supervised setting.
    In a supervised system that is distinct from the unsupervised model described above, Galley et al. (2003) automatically identify candidate cue phrases by mining labeled data for words that are especially likely to appear at segment boundaries; the presence of cue phrases is then used as a feature in a rule-based classifier for linear topic segmentation.
    Elsner and Charniak (2008) specify a list of cue phrases by hand; the cue phrases are used as a feature in a maximum-entropy classifier for conversation disentanglement.
    Unlike these approaches, we identify candidate cue phrases automatically from unlabeled data and incorporate them in the topic segmentation task without supervision.
  
  
    The core idea of lexical cohesion is that topicallycoherent segments demonstrate compact and consistent lexical distributions (Halliday and Hasan, 1976).
    Lexical cohesion can be placed in a probabilistic context by modeling the words in each topic segment as d
