tree structures.
    The draw.plot graph module can be used to graph mathematical functions.
    The draw.fsa module provides a graphical tool for displaying and simulating finite state automata.
    The draw.chart module provides an interactive graphical tool for experimenting with chart parsers.
    The visualization modules provide interfaces for interaction and experimentation; they do not directly implement NLP data structures or tasks.
    Simplicity of implementation is therefore less of an issue for the visualization modules than it is for the rest of the toolkit.
    The classifier module defines a standard interface for classifying texts into categories.
    This interface is currently implemented by two modules.
    The classifier.naivebayes module defines a text classifier based on the Naive Bayes assumption.
    The classifier.maxent module defines the maximum entropy model for text classification, and implements two algorithms for training the model: Generalized Iterative Scaling and Improved It
