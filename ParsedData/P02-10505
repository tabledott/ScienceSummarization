 literal translations.
    For example, in sentence pair (1), the indirect object of the verb is expressed in English using a prepositional phrase (headed by the word for) that attaches to the verb, but it is expressed with the dative case marking ort anaiari (BROTHER-DAT) it Basque.
    If we aligned both for and brother to anaiari, then a many-to-one mapping would be formed, and the DCA would be violated: R(f or, brother) holds in the English tree but R(analari,analari) does not hold in the Basque tree.
    Similarly, a one-to-many mapping (e.g., aligning got with erosi (Buy) and nion (PAST) in this example) can also be problematic for the DCA.
    The inadequacy of the DCA should come as no surprise.
    The syntax literature dating back to Cltomsky (1981), together with a rich computational literature on translation divergences (e.g.
    (Abeille et al., 1990; Dorr, 1994; Han et al., 2000)), is concerned with characterizing in a systematic way the apparent diversity of mechanisms used by languages to expr
