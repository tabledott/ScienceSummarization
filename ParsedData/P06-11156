ng subsections, we define the semantic derivation of an NL sentence and its probabil ity.
			The task of semantic parsing then is to find the most probable semantic derivation of an NL sentence.
			In section 3, we describe how KRISP learns the string classifiers that are used to obtainthe probabilities needed in finding the most prob able semantic derivation.
			2.1 Semantic Derivation.
			We define a semantic derivation, D, of an NL sen tence, s, as a parse tree of an MR (not necessarily the correct MR) such that each node of the parse tree also contains a substring of the sentence in addition to a production.
			We denote nodes of the derivation tree by tuples (pi, [i..j]), where pi is its production and [i..j] stands for the substring s[i..j] of s (i.e. the substring from the ith word to the jth word), and we say that the node or its productioncovers the substring s[i..j].
			The substrings cov ered by the children of a node are not allowed to overlap, and the substring covered by the parentmust be the co
