(e.g. look up, look out, look over, look for, etc.
    ), which are a major source of verbal ambiguity in English.
    Whereas primitive features viewed independently might not have a directly visible effect on identifying similarity, when used in composite features they lead to some novel results.
    The pronounced case of this is for the composite feature Distance &lt; can help identify similarity effectively, as seen in Table 2.
    This composite feature approximates verb-argument and verb-collocation relations, which are strong indicators of similarity.
    At the same time, the more restrictive a feature is, the fewer occurrences of that feature appear in the training set.
    This suggests that we could consider adding additional features suggested by current results in order to further refine and improve our similarity identification algorithm.
    7 Conclusion and Future Work We have presented a new method to detect similarity between small textual units, which combines primitive and composite featu
