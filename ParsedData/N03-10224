Answer Logic Form (ALF) refers to the candidate answers in logic form.
    Candidate answers returned by the Answer Extraction module are classified as open text due to the unpredictable nature of their grammatical structure.
    The term Question Logic Form (QLF) refers to the questions posed to the Question Answering system represented in logic form.
    The prover also needs world knowledge axioms supplied by the WordNet glosses transformed into logic representations.
    Additionally there are many other axioms representing equivalence classes of linguistic patterns, called NLP axioms.
    All these are described below.
    The Axiom Builder converts the Logic Forms for the question, the glosses, and its candidate answers into axioms.
    Based on the parse tree patterns in the question and answers, other NLP axioms are built to supplement the existing general NLP axioms.
    Once the axioms are complete and loaded, justification of the answer begins.
    If a proof fails, the relaxation module is invoked
