 annotations were available, and the effect of better, or even perfect, parses could not be measured.
  In our first set of experiments, the features and probability model of the Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) system were applied to the PropBank corpus.
  The existence of the hand-annotated treebank parses for the corpus allowed us to measure the improvement in performance offered by gold-standard parses.
  7.1 System Description Probabilities of a parse constituent belonging to a given semantic role are calculated from the following features: The phrase type feature indicates the syntactic type of the phrase expressing the semantic roles: Examples include noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), and clause (S).
  The parse tree path feature is designed to capture the syntactic relation of a constituent to the predicate.11 It is defined as the path from the predicate through the parse tree to the constituent in question, represented as a string of parse tree nonterminals linked by symbols indicating upward or downward
