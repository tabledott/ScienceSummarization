to explain the success of open relation extraction, which learns a relation-independent extraction model as described in Section 3.1.
    Previous work has noted that distinguished relations, such as hypernymy (is-a) and meronymy (part-whole), are often expressed using a small number of lexico-syntactic patterns (Hearst, 1992).
    The manual identification of these patterns inspired a body of work in which this initial set of extraction patterns is used to seed a bootstrapping process that automatically acquires additional patterns for is-a or part-whole relations (Etzioni et al., 2005; Snow et al., 2005; Girju et al., 2006), It is quite natural then to consider whether the same can be done for all binary relationships.
    To characterize how binary relationships are expressed, one of the authors of this paper carefully studied the labeled relation instances and produced a lexico-syntactic pattern that captured the relation for each instance.
    Interestingly, we found that 95% of the patterns could be gro
