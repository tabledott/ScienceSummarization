    We also tried different k for KNN and k=3 seems to be the best choice in either case.
    For the four major types of relations SVM does better than KNN, probably due to SVM&#8217;s generalization ability in the presence of large numbers of features.
    For the last three types with many fewer examples, performance of SVM is not as good as KNN.
    The reason we think is that training of SVM on these types is not sufficient.
    We tried different training parameters for the types with fewer examples, but no dramatic improvement obtained.
    We also evaluated our approach on the official ACE RDR test data and obtained very competitive scores.3 The primary scoring metric4 for the ACE evaluation is a 'value' score, which is computed by deducting from 100 a penalty for each missing and spurious relation; the penalty depends on the types of the arguments to the relation.
    The value scores produced by the ACE scorer for nwire and bnews test data are 71.7 and 68.0 repectively.
