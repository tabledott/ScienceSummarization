sociated with components using the hasprop relationship, are are inherited by anything of the same type.
    The main components of the system: cpu, power_supply, disk, printer, peripherals, etc., are indicated by haspart relations, such as haspart(b4700,cpu), ha.spart(b4700,power_supply), haspart(b4700,disk),,etc.
    These parts are themselves divided into subparts which are also indicated by haspart relations, such as haspart(power_supply, converter).
    This method of representation results in a general description of a computer system.
    Specific machines represent INSTANCES of this general representation.
    When a particular report is being processed, id relations are created by noun phrase semantics to associate the specific computer parts being mentioned with the part descriptions from the general machine representation.
    So a particular B4700 would be indicated by predicates such as these: id(b4700,systeml), id(cpu,cpul), id(power_supply,power_supply1), etc.
    Noun phrase semantics is calle
