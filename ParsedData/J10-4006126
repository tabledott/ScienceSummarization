e very poor results for the Agentive role, as shown by the fact that Table 10 reports just one link for such a role.
    This suggests that the problems with this qualia role might be due to the number and type of lexicalized links used to build the DM tensors, rather than to the selection algorithm presented here.
    Coming now to the quantitative evaluation of the harvested patterns, the results in Table 15 (to be compared to Table 11 in Section 6.2.3) are based on W1W2&#215;L subspaces where the non-zero dimensions correspond to the links that we picked automatically with the method we just described (different links for each concept, because of the leave-one-concept-out procedure).
    TypeDM is the best model in this setting as well.
    Its performance is even better than the one (reported in Table 11) obtained with the manually picked patterns (although the difference is not statistically significant; paired t-test, t = 0.75, df = 29, p = 0.46), and the automated approach has more room for improvement
