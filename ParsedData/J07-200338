&#8722;LM model, but rescoring used the same weights as the other experiments.
    We tested the rescoring method (k = 103 and 104), the intersection method, and the cube-pruning method (e = 0, 0.1, and 0.2).
    The LM rescoring decoder (k = 104) is the fastest but has the poorest BLEU score.
    Identifying and rescoring the k-best derivations is very quick; the execution time is dominated by reconstructing the output strings for the k-best derivations, so it is possible that further optimization could reduce these times.
    The intersecting decoder has the best score but runs very slowly.
    Finally, the cubepruning decoder runs almost as fast as the rescoring decoder and translates almost as well as the intersecting decoder.
    Among these tests, e = 0.1 gives the best results, but in general the optimal setting will depend on the other beam settings and the scale of the feature weights.
    We compared Hiero against two baselines: the state-of-the-art phrase-based system ATS (Och et al. 2004; Thayer e
