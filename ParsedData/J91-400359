is now clear why these two sentences differ in their prototypicality (or the relevance conditions on their predication).
    The predicate eat is not within the space of related concepts generated from the semantics of the NP the prisoner; escape, however, did fall within the projective conclusion space for the Telic role of prisoner, as shown in Example 63.
    We can therefore use such a procedure as one metric for evaluating the &amp;quot;proximity&amp;quot; of a predication (Quillian 1968; Hobbs 1982).
    In the examples above, the difference in semanticality can now be seen as a structural distinction between the semantic representations for the elements in the sentence.
    In this section, I have shown how the lexical inheritance structure of an item relates, in a generative fashion, the decompositional structure of a word to a much larger set of concepts that are related in obvious ways.
    What we have not addressed, however, is how the fixed inheritance information of a lexical item is formally de
