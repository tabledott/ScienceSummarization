ch, we make our best DM model (TypeDM) publicly available from http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/dm.
    The site also contains a set of Perl scripts that perform the basic operations on the tensor and its derived vectors we are about to describe.
    The DM framework provides, via matricization, a set of matrices with associated labeled row and column vectors.
    These labeled matrices can simply be derived from the tuple tensor by concatenating two elements in the original triples.
    Any operation that can be performed on the resulting matrices and that might help in tackling a semantic task is fair game.
    However, in the experiments reported in this article we will work with a limited number of simple operations that are well-motivated in terms of the geometric framework we adopt, and suffice to face all the tasks we will deal with (the decomposition techniques explored in Section 6.5 are briefly introduced there).
    Vector length and normalization.
    The length of a vector v with dimensions v1, v2,.
