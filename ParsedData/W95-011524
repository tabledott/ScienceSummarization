ate Filter should be used.
  
  
    A machine translation system should not only translate with high precision, but it should also have good coverage of the source language.
    So, the product of recall and precision, percent correct, is a good indication of a lexicon's suitability for use with such a system.
    This statistic actually represents the percentage of words in the target test corpus that would be correctly translated from the source, if the lexicon were used as a simple map, Therefore, if the lexicon is to be used as part of a machine-assisted translation system, then the percent correct score will be inversely proportional to the required post-editing time.
    A simple strategy was adopted to demonstrate the practical utility of filters presented in this paper.
    First, the most precise filter cascade was selected by looking at Figure 5.
    Translations were found for all words in the test source text that had entries in the lexicon induced using that cascade.
    Then the second most pre
