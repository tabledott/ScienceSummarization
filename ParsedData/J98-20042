    A constituent is removed from the agenda and added to the chart, and the system considers how this constituent can be used to extend its current structural hypothesis by combining with other constituents in the chart according to the grammar rules.
    (We will often refer to these expansions of rules as &amp;quot;edges&amp;quot;) In general this can lead to the creation of new, more encompassing constituents, which themselves are then added to the agenda.
    When one constituent has been processed, a new one is chosen to be removed from the agenda, and so on.
    Traditionally, the agenda is represented as a stack, so that the last item added to the agenda is the next one removed.
    Chart parsing is described extensively in the literature; for one such discussion see 'Section 1.4 of Charniak (1993).
    Best-first probabilistic chart parsing is a variation of chart parsing that attempts to find the most likely parses first, by adding constituents to the chart in order of the likelihood that the
