egments using much stronger criteria for connectedness only two chains are merged across a segment boundary only if they contain a common word with the same sense Our mira-segment relatedness criterion.is less strict members of the same synsets are related, a node and its offspnng m the hyperonym graph are related, mbhngs m the hyperonym graph are related only ffthe length of the path m less thana threshold The relation between text segmentation a d lex- lcal chain is dehcate, since they are both derived from partially common source of knowledge lexlcal &amp;stnbutlon and repetitions In fact, lexlcal chains could serve as a barns for an algorithm for segmen- tation We have found empmcally, however, that Hearsts algorithm behaves well on the type of texts ?
  we checked and that it prowdes effectively a sohd basLS for lexlcal chains construction Building Summaries Using Lexical Chains We now investigate how lexlcal chains can serve as a source representation f the original text to budd a summary The next quest
