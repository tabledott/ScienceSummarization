			Current state of the art machine translation systems (Och, 2003) use phrasal (n-gram) features extracted automatically from parallel corpora.
			These phrases are extracted using word alignment algorithms that are trained on parallel corpora.
			Phrases, or phrasal features, represent a mapping of source sequences into a target sequences which are typically a few words long.In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of training alignment algorithms based on supervised alignment data.
			Although there is a modest cost associ ated with annotating data, we show that a reduction of 40% relative in alignment error (AER) is possible over the GIZA++ aligner (Och and Ney, 2003).
			Although there are a number of other applications for word alignment, for example in creating bilingual dictionaries, the primary application continues to be as a component in a machine translation system.
			We test our aligner on several machine translation tests and show encouraging improvements.
