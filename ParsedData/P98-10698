corpus the total number of occurrences of word i in the corpus SO(We, We) = where wic = wie = (wieX wie) VELiwic2 x ELiwie2 TFic TFie The IDF of virus is 1.81 and that of Hong Kong is 1.23 in the English text.
    The IDF of WS is 1.92 and that of Hong Kong is 0.83 in Chinese.
    So in both cases, virus is a stronger &amp;quot;bridge&amp;quot; for biglliougan than Hong Kong.
    Hence, for every context seed word i, we assign a word weighting factor (Salton and Buckley, 1988) w = TFiw x IDFi where TFiw is the TF of word i in the context of word W. The updated vector space model of word W has wi in its i-th dimension.
    The ranking of the 20 words in the contexts of W,,,f3 Iliougan is rearranged by this weighting factor as shown in Table3.
    Variants of similarity measures such as the above have been used extensively in the IR community (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992).
    They are mostly based on the Cosine Measure of two vectors.
    For different tasks, the weighting factor might vary.
    For example,
