a relative recall of 5.31 with ESP-, which means that the RH02 system outputs 5.31 times more correct relations than ESP- (at a cost of much lower precision).
    Similarly, PR04 has a relative recall of 0.23 with ESP-, which means that PR04 outputs 4.35 fewer correct relations than ESP(also with a smaller precision).
    We did not include the results from GI03 in the tables since the system is only applicable to part-of relations and we did not reproduce it.
    However, the authors evaluated their system on a sample of the TREC9 dataset and reported 83% precision and 72% recall (this algorithm is heavily supervised.)
    In all tables, RH02 extracts many more relations than ESP-, but with a much lower precision, because it uses generic patterns without filtering.
    The high precision of ESP- is due to the effective reliability measures presented in Section 3.2.
    Experimental results, for all relations and the two different corpus sizes, show that ESP- greatly outperforms the other methods on precision
