st be abandoned; the best score drops to &#8722;13.9, backed by the parse in figure 2(b).
    Specifying the right tag to be &#8220;,&#8221; drops the score further to &#8722;15.1, given by figure 2(c).
    The actual best parse is figure 2(d), with a score of &#8722;18.1.
    These estimates are similar to quantities calculated in Corazza et al. (1994); in that work, they are interested in the related problem of finding best completions for strings which contain gaps.
    For the SX estimate, for example, the string would be the edge&#8217;s label and two (fixed-length) gaps.
    They introduce quantities essentially the same as our SX estimate to fill gaps, and their oneword update algorithms are similarly related to those we use here.
    The primary difference here is in the application of these quantities, not their calculation.
    The context summary estimates described above use local information, combined with span sizes.
    This gives the effect that, for larger contexts, the best parses which back
