 it assigns probability mass to nonsensical clusterings.
    Specifically, it will allow Prior work (Soon et al., 2001; Denis and Baldridge, 2007) has generated training data for pairwise classifiers in the following manner.
    For each mention, work backwards through the preceding mentions in the document until you come to a true coreferent mention.
    Create negative examples for all intermediate mentions, and a positive example for the mention and its correct antecedent.
    This approach made sense for Soon et al. (2001) because testing proceeded in a similar manner: for each mention, work backwards until you find a previous mention which the classifier thinks is coreferent, add a link, and terminate the search.
    The COREF-ILP model of Denis and Baldridge (2007) took a different approach at test time: for each mention they would work backwards and add a link for all previous mentions which the classifier deemed coreferent.
    This is equivalent to finding the most likely assignment to each x(i,j) in
