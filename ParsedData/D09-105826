ntations from unlabeled data.
  
  
    This paper has described an extension of the semi-supervised learning approach of (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008) to the dependency parsing problem.
    In addition, we have described extensions that incorporate the cluster-based features of Koo et al. (2008), and that allow the use of second-order parsing models.
    We have described experiments that show that the approach gives significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods for dependency parsing; performance improves when the amount of unlabeled data is increased from 43.8 million tokens to 3.72 billion tokens.
    The approach should be relatively easily applied to languages other than English or Czech.
    We stress that the SS-SCM approach requires relatively little hand-engineering: it makes direct use of the existing feature-vector representation f(x, y) used in a discriminative model, and does not require the design of new features.
    The main choice in the approach is the partitioning of f(x, y) into com
