d tagger described in the previous section and then applying the k-best tag transformations.
    These transformations were learned from a separate 240,000 word corpus.
    As a baseline, we did k-best tagging of a test corpus.
    Each known word in the test corpus was tagged with all tags seen with that word in the training corpus and the five most likely unknown-word tags were assigned to all words not seen in the training corpus.'
    This resulted in an accuracy of 99.0%, with an average of 2.28 tags per word.
    The transformation-based tagger obtained the same accuracy with 1.43 tags per word, one third the number of additional tags as the baseline tagger.'
  
  
    In this paper, we have described a new transformation-based approach to corpus-based learning.
    We have given details of how this approach has been applied to part-ofspeech tagging and have demonstrated that the transformation-based approach obtains competitive performance with stochastic taggers on tagging both unknown and known words
