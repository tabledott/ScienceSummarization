e, I f )  is normalized by the frequency P(e,) of associating e~ with an average word.
  Thus it is reasonable to consider e, a likely translate of f if P(e, I f ) is sufficiently large?
  The above normalization may seem arbitrary, but it has a sound underpinning from the field of Information Theory [ 10].
  In fact, the quantity P(eilf) l(ei; f )  = log (3.2) P(e,) is the mutual information between the French word f and the English word e,.
  Unfortunately, while normalization yields ordered lists of likely English word translates of French words, it does not provide us with the desired probability values.
  Furthermore, we get no guidance as to the size of a threshold T such that e, would be a candidate translate of f if and only if l (~ ; f )  &gt; T (3.3) Various ad hoe modifications exist to circumvent he two problems?
  One might, for instance, find the pair e, f with the highest mutual information, criminate e~ and f from all corresponding sentences in which they occur (i.e.
