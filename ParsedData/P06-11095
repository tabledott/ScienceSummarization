uted on the leftmost nonterminal frontier node of the first subtree).
    Thus a new sentence such as Mary likes Susan can be derived by The probability of a derivation t1o...otn is computed by the product of the probabilities of its subtrees ti: As we have seen, there may be several distinct derivations that generate the same parse tree.
    The probability of a parse tree T is the sum of the assigning all possible binary trees to this string, where each root node is labeled S and each internal node is labeled X.
    Thus NNS VBD JJ NNS has a total of five binary trees shown in figure 4 -- where for readability we add words as well.
    Thus DOP1 considers counts of subtrees of a wide range of sizes: everything from counts of singlelevel rules to entire trees is taken into account to compute the most probable parse tree of a sentence.
    A disadvantage of the approach may be that an extremely large number of subtrees (and derivations) must be considered.
    Fortunately there exists a compact isomorphic PCF
