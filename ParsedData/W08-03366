d led to a 0.38 BLEU point gain on the test data (MT05).
    Second, we extend the CRF label set of our CRF segmenter to identify proper nouns.
    This gives 3.3% relative improvement on the OOV recall rate, and a 0.32 improvement in BLEU.
    Finally, we tune the CRF model to generate shorter or longer words to directly optimize the performance of MT.
    For MT, we found that it is preferred to have words slightly shorter than the CTB standard.
    The paper is organized as follows: we describe the experimental settings for the segmentation task and the task in Section 2.
    In Section 3.1 we demonstrate that it is helpful to have word segmenters for MT, but that segmentation performance does not directly correlate with MT performance.
    We analyze what characteristics of word segmenters most affect MT performance in Section 3.2.
    In Section 4 and 5 we describe how we tune a CRF model to fit the &#8220;word&#8221; granularity and also how we incorporate external lexicon and information about named en
