emory bandwidth which is nowadays a bottleneck of parsers and many other applications.
			By using parallel algorithms, we could further increase the parsing time by a factor of 3.4 on a 4 core CPU and including hyper threading by a factor of 4.6.
			The parsing speed is 16 times fasterfor the English test set than the conventional ap proach.
			The parser needs only 77 millisecond in average to parse a sentence and the speed willscale with the number of cores that become avail able in future.
			To gain even faster parsing times, it may be possible to trade accuracy against speed.
			In a pilot experiment, we have shown that it is possible to reduce the parsing time in this way to as little as 9 milliseconds.
			We are convinced thatthe Hash Kernel can be applied successful to tran sition based dependency parsers, phrase structure parsers and many other NLP applications.
			4 4We provide the Parser and Hash Kernel as open source for download from http://code.google.com/p/mate-tools.
