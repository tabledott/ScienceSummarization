BM models, researchers have proposed a number of alternative alignment methods.
    These methods often involve using a statistic such as &#966;2 (Gale and Church, 1991) or the log likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) to create a score to measure the strength of correlation between source and target words.
    Such measures can then be used to guide a constrained search to produce word alignments (Melamed, 2000).
    It has been shown that once a baseline alignment has been created, one can improve results by using a refined scoring metric that is based on the alignment.
    For example Melamed uses competitive linking along with an explicit noise model in (Melamed, 2000) to produce a new scoring metric, which in turn creates better alignments.
    In this paper, we present a simple, flexible, statistical model that is designed to capture the information present in a baseline alignment.
    This model allows us to compute the probability of an alignment for a given sentence pair.
    It also allows for the easy i
