ack ambiguities and enable us to define useful features.
    Meanwhile, feature functions indicate an atomic unit of probability, and are designed to capture statistical regularity of the target problem.
    We expect the separation of a unit of probability from linguistic structures to open up a new framework for flexible probabilistic modeling.
  
  
    The authors wish to thank the anonymous reviewers of Computational Linguistics for their helpful comments and discussions.
    We would also like to thank Takashi Ninomiya and Kenji Sagae for their precious support.
