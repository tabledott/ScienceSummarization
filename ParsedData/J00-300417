    Of course, this may not be possible either, and further escapes may take place.
    Ultimately, the order 0 model may be reached; in this case the character can be transmitted if it is one that has occurred before.
    Otherwise, there is one further escape (to an order &#8212;1 model), and the standard ASCII representation of the character is sent.
    The only remaining question is how to calculate the probabilities from the counts&#8212; a simple matter once we have resolved how much space to allocate for the escape probability.
    There has been much discussion of this question, and several different methods have been proposed.
    Our experiments calculate the escape probability in a particular conte
