ation method as new system outputs.
    Various other features may be explored in this framework although the tuning may be limited by the chosen optimization method in the higher dimensional parameter space.
    The phrase-level combination was based on deriving a new phrase translation table from the alignments to source provided in all system outputs.
    The phrase translation scores were based on the level of agreement between the system outputs and sentence posterior estimates.
    A standard phrasal decoder with the new phrase table was used to produce the final combination output.
    The handling of the alignments from non-phrasal decoders may not be optimal, though.
    The phrase-level combination yields fairly good gains on the tuning sets.
    However, the performance does not seem to generalize to the test sets used in this work.
    As usual, the phrasal decoder can generate -best lists which were used successfully in the word-level combination method as new system outputs.
    The word-level c
