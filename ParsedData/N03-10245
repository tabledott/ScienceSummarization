   An important part of the paper is dedicated to evaluating the quality of the finite-state representations that we derive (see Section 4).
    Since our representations encode thousands and sometimes millions of equivalent verbalizations of the same meaning, we use both manual and automatic evaluation techniques.
    Some of the automatic evaluations we perform are novel as well.
  
  
    The data we use in this work is the LDC-available Multiple-Translation Chinese (MTC) Corpus1 developed for machine translation evaluation, which contains 105 news stories (993 sentences) from three sources of journalistic Mandarin Chinese text.
    These stories were independently translated into English by 11 translation agencies.
    Each sentence group, which consists of 11 semantically equivalent translations, is a rich source for learning lexical and structural paraphrases.
    In our experiments, we use 899 of the sentence groups &#8212; the sentence groups with sentences longer than 45 words were dropped.
