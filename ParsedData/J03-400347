on was described in section 3.1.1, deserves more discussion and motivation.
    In this section we consider it from three perspectives: its influence on parsing accuracy; an analysis of distributions in training data that are sensitive to the distance variables; and some examples of sentences in which the distance measure is useful in discriminating among competing analyses.
    7.2.1 Impact of the Distance Measure on Accuracy.
    Table 7 shows the results for models 1 and 2 with and without the adjacency and verb distance measures.
    It is clear that the distance measure improves the models&#8217; accuracy.
    What is most striking is just how badly model 1 performs without the distance measure.
    Looking at the parser&#8217;s output, the reason for this poor performance is that the adjacency condition in the distance measure is approximating subcategorization information.
    In particular, in phrases such as PPs and SBARs (and, to a lesser extent, in VPs) that almost always take exactly one complemen
