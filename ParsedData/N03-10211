n MTG is the maximum rank of its production rules. is the class of MTGs of rank Each row of P and M corresponds to a different component of multitext.
    Each permutation is written as a row in P, and each link is written as a column M, as in Equation 3 below.
    If empty, then the dth component of every link in M must be empty If not empty, then at least one of the links in M must have a non-empty dth component.
    The position of a non-empty terminal or nonterminal relative to other non-empty elements of its component is its role.
    If there are m non-empty nonterminals component (row) M then a permutation roles from 1 to Pd empty if and only if is empty.
    The D-MTG derivation process begins with the link $, which is a vector of of the start symbol $ derivation continues with nondeterministic application of production rules.
    The semantics of = are the usual semantics of rewriting systems, i.e., that the expression on the LHS can be rewritten as the expression on the RHS.
