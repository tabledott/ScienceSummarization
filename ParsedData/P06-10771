 have been suggested to be the state-of-theart in statistical machine translation by empirical evaluations.
    In phrase-based models, phrases are usually strings of adjacent words instead of syntactic constituents, excelling at capturing local reordering and performing translations that are localized to from that paper: a source string fJ1 = f1, ... ,fj, ... , fJ is to be translated into a target string eI1 = el, ... , ei, ... , eI.
    Here, I is the length of the target string, and J is the length of the source string. substrings that are common enough to be observed on training data.
    However, a key limitation of phrase-based models is that they fail to model reordering at the phrase level robustly.
    Typically, phrase reordering is modeled in terms of offset positions at the word level (Koehn, 2004; Och and Ney, 2004), making little or no direct use of syntactic information.
    Recent research on statistical machine translation has lead to the development of syntax-based models.
