classes of adjuncts, such as temporal ones, are fairly easy to identify once information about the object of the preposition is taken into account.
    Beginning with such an identification step (which could be conceived of as adding a feature such as [+temporal] to individual prepositions, or replacing individual token prepositions with an abstract temporal preposition) might yield a lexical association procedure that would do better with adjuncts.
    But it is also possible that a procedure that evaluates associations with individual nouns and verbs is simply inappropriate for adjuncts.
    This is an area for further investigation.
    This experiment was deliberately limited to one kind of attachment ambiguity.
    However, we expect that the method will be extendable to other instances of PP attachment ambiguity, such as the ambiguity that arises when several prepositional phrases follow a subject NP, and to ambiguities involving other phrases, especially phrases such as infinitives that have syntactic
