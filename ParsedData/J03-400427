owever, for three reasons.
    First, our results for the direct-object slot are for all verbs in the English all-words task, as opposed to just those selecting strongly for their direct objects.
    We would expect that WSD results using selectional preferences would be better for the latter class of verbs.
    Second, we do not use manually produced parses, but the output from our fully automatic shallow parser.
    Third and finally, the baselines reported for Resnik&#8217;s test set were higher than those for the all-words task.
    For Resnik&#8217;s test data, the random baseline was 28.5%, whereas for the polysemous nouns in the direct-object relation on the all-words task, it was 23.9%.
    The distribution of senses was also perhaps more skewed for Resnik&#8217;s test set, since the first sense heuristic was 82.8% (Abney and Light 1999), whereas it was 53.6% for the polysemous direct objects in the all-words task.
    Although our results do show that the precision for the TCMs compares favorably wit
