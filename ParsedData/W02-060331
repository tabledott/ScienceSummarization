s which is especially suitable for languages such as Finnish.
    However, there is still room for considerable improvement in the model structure, especially regarding the representation of contextual dependencies.
    Considering the two examined model optimization methods, the Recursive MDL method performed consistently somewhat better.
    Whether this is due to the cost function or the splitting strategy cannot be deduced based on these experiments.
    In the future, we intend to extend the latter method to utilize an MDL-like cost function.
    Table 4: Some English and Finnish word segmentations produced by the three methods.
    The Finnish words are el&#168;ainl&#168;a&#168;ak&#168;ari (veterinarian, lit. animal doctor), el&#168;ainmuseo (zoological museum, lit. animal museum), el&#168;ainpuisto (zoologicalpark, lit. animalpark), and el&#168;aintarha (zoo, lit. animalgarden).
    The suffixes -lle, -n, -on, and -sta are linguistically correct.
