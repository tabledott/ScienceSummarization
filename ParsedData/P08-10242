y applying a sequence of steps (a derivation) of either phrase translations or synchronous grammar rules, depending on the type of system.
    Existing discriminative models require a reference derivation to optimise against, however no parallel corpora annotated for derivations exist.
    Ideally, a model would account for this ambiguity by marginalising out the derivations, thus predicting the best translation rather than the best derivation.
    However, doing so exactly is NP-complete.
    For this reason, to our knowledge, all discriminative models proposed to date either side-step the problem by choosing simple model and feature structures, such that spurious ambiguity is lessened or removed entirely (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2007; Watanabe et al., 2007), or else ignore the problem and treat derivations as translations (Liang et al., 2006; Tillmann and Zhang, 2007).
    In this paper we directly address the problem of spurious ambiguity in discriminative models.
    We use a synchronous context free gram
