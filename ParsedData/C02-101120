lyzed the reasons for incorrect translations and found that the incorrect translations were due to: (1) no existence of dictionary entry (19%), (2) non-compositional translation (13%), (3) ranking error (68%).
			4.2 Our Method vs. Nagata et als Method.
			Table 3.
			Translation results Accuracy (%) Top 1 Top 3 Coverage (%) Our Method 61.7 80.3 89.9 Nagata et als 72.0 76.0 10.5 We next used Nagata et als method to perform translation.
			From Table 3, we can see that the accuracy of Nagata et als method is higher than that of our method, but the coverage of it is lower.
			The results indicate that our proposed Back-off strategy for translation is justifiable.
			4.3 Combination.
			In the experiment, we tested the Back-off strategy, Table 4 shows the results.
			The Back-off strategy Table 4.
			Translation results Accuracy% Top 1 Top 3 Coverage % Back-off (Ensemble) 62.9 79.7 Back-off (TF-IDF) 62.2 79.8 91.4 helps to further improve the results whether EM-NBC-Ensemble or EM-TF-IDF is used.
