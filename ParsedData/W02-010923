re for grammar development has a long history in unification-based (or constraint-based) grammar frameworks, from DCG (Pereira and Warren, 1980) to HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994).
    Recent work includes (Copestake, 2000; Baldridge et al., 2002a).
    A concurrent development has been the finite state toolkits, such as the Xerox toolkit (Beesley and Karttunen, 2002).

    Other Researchers and Developers.
    A variety of toolkits have been created for research or R&amp;D purposes.
    Examples include the CMU-Cambridge Statistical Language Modeling Toolkit (Clarkson and Rosenfeld, 1997), the EMU Speech Database System (Harrington and Cassidy, 1999), the General Architecture for Text Engineering (Bontcheva et al., 2002), the Maxent Package for Maximum Entropy Models (Baldridge et al., 2002b), and the Annotation Graph Toolkit (Maeda et al., 2002).
