 (see below).
    This work, on the other hand, is in the orthogonal direction, where we utilize forests in rule extraction instead of decoding.
    BLEU score Our experiments will use both default 1-best decoding and forest-based decoding.
    As we will see in the next section, the best result comes when we combine the merits of both, i.e., using forests in both rule extraction and decoding.
    There is also a parallel work on extracting rules from k-best parses and k-best alignments (Venugopal et al., 2008), but both their experiments and our own below confirm that extraction on k-best parses is neither efficient nor effective.
  
  
    Our experiments are on Chinese-to-English translation based on a tree-to-string system similar to (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).
    Given a 1best tree T, the decoder searches for the best derivation d&#8727; among the set of all possible derivations D: where the first two terms are translation and language model probabilities, &#964;(d) is the target string (Eng
