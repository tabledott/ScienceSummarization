    Both pre-discourse and post-discourse meanings in our current system are represented using a simple frame representation.
    Figure 3 shows a sample semantic frame corresponding to the parse in Figure 2.
    Recall that the semantic interpreter is required to compute P(M s ,T) P(W IT) .
    The conditional word probability P(W IT) has already been computed during the parsing phase and need not be recomputed.
    The current problem, then, is to compute the prior probability of meaning Ms and parse T occurring together.
    Our strategy is to embed the instructions for constructing Ms directly into parse T , resulting in an augmented tree structure.
    For example, the instructions needed to create the frame shown in Figure 3 are: These instructions are attached to the parse tree at the points indicated by the circled numbers (see Meanings Ms are decomposed into two parts: the frame type FT, and the slot fillers S. The frame type is always attached to the topmost node in
