Joshi Del)artment of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104 U.S.A Abstract  We have embedded Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) in a fea- ture structure based unification system.
  The resulting system, Feature Structure based Tree Adjoining Grammars (FTAG), captures the princi- ple of factoring dependencies and recursion, fundamental to TAGs.
  Wc show that FTAG has an enhanced escriptive capacity compared to TAG formalisnr.
  We consider some restricted versions of this system and some possible linguistic stipulations that can be made.
  We briefly describe a calculus to represent the structures used by this system, extending on the work of Rounds, and Kasper [Rounds et al.
  1986, Kasper et al.
  1986] involving the logical formulation of feature structures.
