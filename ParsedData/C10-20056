jective tweets (subjectivity detection).
			The second onefurther classifies the subjective tweets into posi tive and negative, namely, the polarity detection.Both classifiers perform prediction using an ab stract representation of the sentences as features, as we show later in this section.
			3.1 Features.
			A variety of features have been exploited on the problem of sentiment detection (Pang and Lee, 2004; Pang et al, 2002; Wiebe et al, 1999; Wiebeand Riloff, 2005; Riloff et al, 2006) including unigrams, bigrams, part-of-speech tags etc. A natural choice would be to use the raw word represen tation (n-grams) as features, since they obtained good results in previous works (Pang and Lee, 2004; Pang et al, 2002) that deal with large texts.However, as we want to perform sentiment detection on very short messages (tweets), this strategy might not be effective, as shown in our ex periments.
			In this context, we are motivated to develop an abstract representation of tweets.
