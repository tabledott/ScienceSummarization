ant drop in performance when we used just the glosses of the concept alone, showing that the expansion is necessary.
    In addition, the frequency cutoffs used to construct the Word Space played a critical role.
    The best setting of the frequency cutoffs removed both low and high frequency words, which eliminates two different sources of noise.
    Very low frequency words do not occur enough to draw distinctions among different glosses, whereas high frequency words occur in many glosses, and again do not provide useful information to distinguish among glosses.
    An application-oriented comparison of five measures of semantic relatedness was presented in (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001).
    In that study they evaluate five WordNet-based measures of semantic relatedness with respect to their performance in context sensitive spelling correction.
    We present the results of an application-oriented evaluation of the measures of semantic relatedness.
    Each of the seven measures of semantic relatedness was
