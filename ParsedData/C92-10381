ention to reducing the length of a referring expression, and far more attention to making sure they use attributes and values that human hearers can easily process; in the terms introduced in [Da188,Da189], hearers are more concerned with the principle of sensitivity than with the principle of efficiency.
  We have designed a new referring expression generation algorithm that is based on the~ observations, and believe that the new algorithm is more practical for real-world natu- ral language generation systems than the algorithms we have previously proposed.
  In particular, the al- gorithm is: ?
  fast: its run-time is linear in the number of distrac- tors, and independent of the number of possible modifiers; ?
  sensitive to human preferences: it attempts to use easily perceivable attributes and basic-level [Ros78] attribute values; and ?
