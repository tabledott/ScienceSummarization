aluations on Chinese word segmentation of the two systems have been published by press time.
    More comprehensive comparisons (with other wellknown systems) and detailed error analysis form one area of our future work.
    As mentioned above, to achieve a fair comparison, we compare the above three systems only in terms of NER precision-recall and the number of OAS errors.
    However, we find that due to the different annotation specifications used by these systems, it is still very difficult to compare their results automatically.
    For example, &#21271;&#20140;&#24066;&#25919;&#24220; &#8216;Beijing city government&#8217; has been segmented inconsistently as &#21271;&#20140;&#24066;/&#25919;&#24220; &#8216;Beijing city&#8217; + &#8216;government&#8217; or &#21271;&#20140;/ &#24066;&#25919;&#24220; &#8216;Beijing&#8217; + &#8216;city government&#8217; even in the same system.
    Even worse, some LNs tagged in one system are tagged as ONs in another system.
    Therefore, we have to manually check the r
