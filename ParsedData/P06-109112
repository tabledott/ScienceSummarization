8217;costMargin&#8217; between the &#8217;true&#8217; block sequence set and the &#8217;alternative&#8217; block sequence set is maximized.
    Note that due to the truth and alternative set up, we always have .
    This loss function gives an upper bound of the error we will suffer if the order of and is wrongly predicted (that is, if we predict instead of ).
    It also has the property that if for the BLEU scores holds, then the loss value is small (proportional to ).
    A major contribution of this work is a procedure to solve Eq.
    3 approximately.
    The main difficulty is that the search space covered by the decoder can be extremely large.
    It cannot be enumerated for practical purposes.
    Our idea is to replace this large space by a small subspace which we call relevant set.
    The possibility of this reduction is based on the following theoretical result.
    If is a convex function of (as in our choice), then we know that the global optimal solution remains the same if the whole decoding s
