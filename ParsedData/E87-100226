a in Table I is, of course, insufficient to answer question. but a plausible answer that strongly suggests itself is that the &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; slot prefers a consonantal filler that would result in gemination.
    If this is true, then it is another case where the notion of gemination, though not actually exemplified in the form, plays a central role.
    Supposing that the analysis is correct, the next question is, how is it to be implemented.
    The most appealing answer would be to make &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; the exact obverse of &amp;quot;G&amp;quot;, when filled with a consonant.
    In other words, when a root consonant fills such a slot, the root tape must advance so that the same consonant will no longer be to fill the next position.
    The that the next root consonant would simply be a repetition of the current one would be excluded if we were to take over from autosegmental phonology and morphology, some version of th Contour Principle (OCP) 1979) which disallows repeated segments except in th
