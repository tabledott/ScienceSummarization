nly over some of the more probable alignments, ignoring the vast sea of much less probable ones.
    Specifically, we begin with the most probable alignment that we can find and then include all alignments that can be obtained from it by small changes.
    To define unambiguously the subset, S, of the elements of A(fle) over which we evaluate the sums, we need yet more terminology.
    We say that two alignments, a and a', differ by a move if there is exactly one value of j for which ai 0 .
    We say that they differ by a swap if aj = ai' except at two values, Ii and j2, for which (111 = al,' and = a111.
    We say that two alignments are neighbors if they are identical or differ by a move or by a swap.
    We denote the set of all neighbors of a by .Ai(a).
    Let b(a) be that neighbor of a for which the likelihood Pr(b(a)lf, e) is greatest.
    Suppose that ij is pegged for a.
    Among the neighbors of a for which ij is also pegged, let b,+_1(a) be that for which the likelihood is greatest.
