er all word pairs.
    Also, since the learning curve for the BLIPP corpus is steeper than the learning curve for the Raw corpus, this suggests that discourse relation classifiers trained on most representative word pairs and millions of training examples can achieve higher levels of performance than classifiers trained on all word pairs (unannotated data).
  
  
    The results in Section 3 indicate clearly that massive amounts of automatically generated data can be used to distinguish between discourse relations defined as discussed in Section 2.2.
    What the experiments manually labeled RST relations that hold between elementary discourse units.
    Performance results are shown in bold; baselines are shown in normal fonts. in Section 3 do not show is whether the classifiers built in this manner can be of any use in conjunction with some established discourse theory.
    To test this, we used the corpus of discourse trees built in the style of RST by Carlson et al. (2001).
    We automatically extracted
