e Web to achieve impressive performance with relatively simple techniques.
    While the Web is a powerful resource, its usefulness in Question Answering is not without limits.
    The Web, while nearly infinite in content, is not a complete repository of useful information.
    Most newspaper texts, for example, do not remain accessible on the Web for more than a few weeks.
    Further, while Information Retrieval techniques are relatively successful at managing the vast quantity of text available on the Web, the exactness required of Question Answering systems makes them too slow and impractical for ordinary users.
    In order to combat these inadequacies, we propose a strategy in which information is extracted automatically from electronic texts offline, and stored for quick and easy access.
    We borrow techniques from Text Mining in order to extract semantic relations (e.g., concept-instance relations) between lexical items.
    We enhance these techniques by increasing the yield and precision of the r
