  Learning Non-Isomorphic Tree Mappings For Machine Translation
  
    Often one may wish to learn a tree-to-tree mapping, training it on unaligned pairs of trees, or on a mixture of trees and strings.
    Unlike previous statistical formalisms (limited to isomorphic TSG local distortion of the tree topology.
    We reformulate it to permit dependency trees, and sketch EM/Viterbi algorithms for alignment, training, and decoding.
  
  
    Statistical machine translation systems are trained on pairs of sentences that are mutual translations.
    For example, (beaucoup d&#8217;enfants donnent un baiser a` Sam, kids kiss Sam quite often).
    This translation is somewhat free, as is common in naturally occurring data.
    The first sentence is literally Lots of&#8217;children give a kiss to Sam.
    This short paper outlines &#8220;natural&#8221; formalisms and algorithms for training on pairs of trees.
    Our methods work on either dependency trees (as shown) or phrase-structure trees.
