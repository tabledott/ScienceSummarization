elationship between them.
    Since we would like to use automatic evaluation metric not only in comparing systems but also in in-house system development, a good linear correlation with human judgment would enable us to use automatic scores to predict corresponding human judgment scores.
    Therefore, Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient is a good measure to look at.
    Spearman&#8217;s correlation coefficient 6 is also a measure of correlation between two variables.
    It is a non-parametric measure and is a special case of the Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient when the values of data are converted into ranks before computing the coefficient.
    Spearman&#8217;s correlation coefficient does not assume the correlation between the variables is linear.
    Therefore it is a useful correlation indicator even when good linear correlation, for example, according to Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient between two variables could not be found.
    It also suits the NIST MT evaluation scenario where
