ction, it waits until all other processes also encounter a (possibly different) shift action.
    Figure 2.3 shows a snapshot of the stack list right after shifting the word with in the sentence I saw a man on the bed in the apartment with a telescope using the grammar in Figure 2.1 and the parsing table in Figure 2.2.
    For the sake of convenience, we denote a stack with vertices and edges.
    The leftmost vertex is the bottom of the stack, and the rightmost vertex is the top of the stack.
    Vertices represented by a circle are called state vertices, and they represent a state number.
    Vertices represented by a square are called symbol vertices, and they represent a grammar symbol.
    Each stack is exactly the same as a stack in the standard LR parsing algorithm.
    The distance between vertices (length of an edge) does not have any significance, except it may help the reader understand the status of the stacks.
