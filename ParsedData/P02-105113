 possible English translations for German and Spanish compound nouns.
    We use normalized Web counts of named entity phrases as the first re-scoring factor used to rescore translation candidates.
    For the &#8220; klyntwn byl&#8221; example, the top two translation candidates are Bell Clinton with transliteration score and Bill Clinton with score .
    The Web frequency counts of these two names are: and respectively.
    This gives &#8220; al-h&#728; n&#175;azyr kyl &#711;gwn.&#8221; The transliteration module proposes Jon and John as possible transliterations for the first name, and Keele and Kyl among others for the last name.
    The normalized counts for the individual words are: (John, 0.9269), (Jon, 0.0688), (Keele, 0.0032), and (Kyl, 0.0011).
    To use these normalized counts to score and rank the first name/last name combinations in a way similar to a unigram language model, we would get the following name/score pairs: (John Keele, 0.003), (John Kyl, 0.001), (Jon Keele, 0.0002), and (Jon Kyl, ).
