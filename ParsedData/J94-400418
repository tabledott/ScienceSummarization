e syntactic structures are based on the X framework of government-binding theory (see Chomsky 1981, 1982, 1986a, 1986b).
  For ease of illustration, the word order used in all formal definitions i head-initial/spec-initial ( .e., the setting for English).
  The syntactic operations that determine word order are completely independent from the lexical-semantic operations that use these definitions.
  Thus, the formal definitions can be stated in terms of an arbitrary ordering of constituents, without loss of generality, as long as it is understood that the constituent order is independently determined.
