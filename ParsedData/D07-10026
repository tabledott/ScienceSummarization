ntactic information as a means of abstracting over word order differences and structural alternations (e.g., passive vs. active voice).
			Most syntax-based QA systems (Wu et al, 2005) incorporate some means of comparison between the tree representing the question with the subtree surrounding the answer candidate.
			The assumption here is that appropriate answers are more likely to have syntactic relationsin common with their corresponding question.
			Syntactic structure matching has been applied to passage retrieval (Cui et al, 2005) and answer extrac tion (Shen and Klakow, 2006).
			Narayanan and Harabagiu (2004) were the firstto stress the importance of semantic roles in an swering complex questions.
			Their system identifies predicate argument structures by merging semanticrole information from PropBank and FrameNet.
			Expected answers are extracted by performing probabilistic inference over the predicate argument struc tures in conjunction with a domain specific topicmodel.
