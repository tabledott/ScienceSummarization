etter, and it is against this stricter standard that we computed the baseline in Table 2.
    Here, the binomial distribution shows that some numbers are not significantly better than the baseline.
    The numbers that are significantly better than chance at p &lt; .05 by the binomial distribution are starred.
    Tables 1 and 2 present aggregate results, when all texts are classified for each facet or level.
    Table 3, by contrast, shows which classifications are assigned for texts that actually belong to a specific known level.
    For example. the first row shows that of the 18 texts that really are of the REPORTAGE GENRE level, 83% were correctly classified as REPORTAGE, 6% were misclassified as EDITORIAL. and 11% as NONFICTION.
    Because of space constraints, we present this amount of detail only for the six GENRE levels, with logistic regression on selected surface variables.
  
  
    The experiments indicate that categorization decisions can be made with reasonable accuracy on the basis of surface
