xtracted Named Entities from articles in the same domain as the test domain.
    Since we wanted to test how easy it was to build gazetteers automatically, we wanted to minimise the amount of processing done on Named Entities already found.
    We decided to only used first names of people, and marked them all as &amp;quot;likely&amp;quot; first names: the fact that &amp;quot;Bill&amp;quot; actually occurs as a first name does not guarantee it will definitely be a first name next time you see it.
    Company names found in the 30 articles were put in the company gazetteer, irrespective of whether they were full company names (e.g.

    Names of locations found in the 30 texts were simply added to the list of 200 location names already used in the previous experiments.
    The hope was that, despite the little effort involved in building these limited gazetteers, there would be an impr
