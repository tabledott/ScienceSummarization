t technologies being developed for information extraction, flmctions which would be of 1)ractical use, would be largely domain indet)endent, and couhl in the near term be performed automatically with high ac(uracy.
  To meet this goal the con&gt; mittce developed the "named entity" task, which t(asically involves identifying the names of all the people, organizations, and geographic locations in a text.
