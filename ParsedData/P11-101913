ed using any rule in the grammar&#8217;).
    Therefore, we believe that many (longer-distance) grammatical constructions and errors found in texts can be (implicitly) captured by this feature type.
    In developing our AA system, a number of different grammatical complexity measures were extracted from parses, and their impact on the accuracy of the system was explored.
    For the experiments reported here, we use complexity measures representing the sum of the longest distance in word tokens between a head and dependent in a grammatical relation (GR) from the RASP GR output, calculated for each GR graph from the top 10 parses per sentence.
    In particular, we extract the mean and median values of these distances per sentence and use the maximum values per script.
    Intuitively, this feature captures information about the grammatical sophistication of the writer.
    However, it may also be confounded in cases where sentence boundaries are not identified through, for example, poor punctuation.
