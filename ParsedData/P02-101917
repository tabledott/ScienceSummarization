ionary for which the product P (r)PCMB(wjr) is maximized.
    In our experiments we used a uniform source language model over the words in the dictionary.
    Therefore our spelling correction algorithm selects the word r that maximizes PCMB(wjr).
    Brill and Moore (2000) showed that adding a source language model increases the accuracy significantly.
    They also showed that the addition of a language model does not obviate the need for a good error model and that improvements in the error model lead to significant improvements in the full noisy channel model.
    We build two separate error models, LTR and PH (standing for &#8220;letter&#8221; model and &#8220;phone&#8221; model).
    The letter-based model estimates a probability distribution PLTR(wjr) over words, and the phone-based model estimates a distribution PPH(pron wjpron r) over pronunciations.
    Using the PH model and the letter-to-phone model, we derive a distribution PPHL(wjr) in a way to be made precise shortly.
    We combine the two mod
