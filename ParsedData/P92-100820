    As can be seen, such features in combination can be quite helpful in distinguishing repairs from false positives of this pattern.
    Future work will investigate the use of prosody in distinguishing the M11X/V/1 repair not only from false positives, but also from other possible repairs having this pattern, i.e., MiRi IM1R1 and RIM].
    A second way in which acoustics can be helpful given the output of a pattern matcher is in determining whether or not potential cue words such as &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; are used as an editing expression (Hockett, 1967) as in &amp;quot;...flights &lt;between&gt; &lt;boston&gt; &lt;and&gt; &lt;dallas&gt; &lt;no&gt; between oakland and boston.&amp;quot; False positives for these cases are instances in which the cue word functions in some other sense (&amp;quot;I want to leave boston no later than one p m.&amp;quot;).
