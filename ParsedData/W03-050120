  We also used the 2496 manual abstracts for the DUC2003 10-word summarization task as reference translations for the 624 test documents of that task.
    We used two variants of HMM Hedge, one which selects headline words from the first 60 words of the story, and one which selects words from the first sentence of the story.
    Table 1 shows the BLEU score using trigrams, and the 95% confidence interval for the score.
    These results show that although Hedge Trimmer scores slightly higher than HMM Hedge on both data sets, the results are not statistically significant.
    However, we believe that the difference in the quality of the systems is not adequately reflected by this automatic evaluation.
    Human evaluation indicates significantly higher scores than might be guessed from the automatic evaluation.
    For the 100 AP stories from the TIPSTER corpus for August 6, 1990, the output of Hedge Trimmer and HMM Hedge was evaluated by one human.
    Each headline was given a subjective score from 1 to 5, w
