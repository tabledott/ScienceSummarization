on only to the merged entry would give an unreasonably low estimate of recall.
    Figure 2 gives the raw results for the merged entries and corpus analysis on each verb.
    It shows the number of true positives (TP), correct classes proposed by our system, false positives (FP), incorrect classes proposed by our system, and false negatives (FN), correct classes not proposed by our system, as judged against the merged entry, and, for seven of the verbs, against the corpus analysis.
    It also shows, in the final column, the number of sentences from which classes were extracted.
    Figure 3 gives the type precision and recall of our system's recognition of subcategorization classes as evaluated against the merged dictionary entries (14 verbs) and against the manually analysed corpus data (7 verbs).
    The frequency distribution of the classes is highly skewed: for example for believe, there are 107 instances of the most common class in the corpus data, but only 6 instances in total of the least common four
