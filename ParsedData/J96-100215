 allowable.
    Imposing one linear constraint CI restricts us to those p E P that lie on the region defined by CI, as shown in (b).
    A second linear constraint could determine p exactly, if the two constraints are satisfiable; this is the case in (c), where the intersection of CI and C2 is non-empty.
    Alternatively, a second linear constraint could be inconsistent with the first&#8212;for instance, the first might require that the probability of the first point is 1/3 and the second that the probability of the third point is 3/4&#8212;this is shown in (d).
    In the present setting, however, the linear constraints are extracted from the training sample and cannot, by construction, be inconsistent.
    Furthermore, the linear constraints in our applications will not even come close to determining p E P uniquely as they do in (c); instead, the set C C1 n C n n C of allowable models will be infinite.
    Among the models p E C, the maximum entropy philosophy dictates that we select the most uniform distr
