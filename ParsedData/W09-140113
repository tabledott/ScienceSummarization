h are t-entities and equality holds between them, or (2-2) both are events and equality holds between them.
    Due to the condition (2-2), event equality is defined recursively for events referring to events.
    Equality of t-entities is defined as follows: T-entity Equality equality holds between any two t-entities when (1) the entity types are the same, and (2) the spans are the same.
    Any two text spans (beg1, end1) and (beg2, end2), are the same iff beg1 = beg2 and end1 = end2.
    Note that the event triggers are also t-entities thus their equality is defined by the t-entity equality.
    Various evaluation modes can be defined by varying equivalence criteria.
    In the following, we describe three fundamental variants applied in the evaluation.
    Strict matching The strict matching mode requires exact equality, as defined in section 4.1.
    As some of its requirements may be viewed as unnecessarily precise, practically motivated relaxed variants, described in the following, are also applied.
