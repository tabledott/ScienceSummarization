e label.
			The first-order model scores a factor as score1(w,x, ?h, m, l?)
			= ?1(x, h, m) ? wl1.The higher-order model defined in this paper de composes a dependency structure into factors that include children of the head and the modifier.
			In particular, a factor in our model is represented by the signature f = ?h, m, l, ch, cmi, cmo?
			where, as in the first-order model, h, m and l are respectively the head, modifier and label of the main dependency of the factor; ch is the child of h in [h . . .m] that is closest to m; cmi is child of m inside [h . . .m]that is furthest from m; cmo is the child of m outside [h . . .
			m] that is furthest from m. Figure 1 de picts a factor of the higher-order model, and Table 1 lists the factors of an example sentence.
			Note that a factor involves a main labeled dependency and threeadjacent unlabeled dependencies that attach to chil dren of h and m. Special values are used when either of these children are null.
			The higher-order model defines additional m h ch
