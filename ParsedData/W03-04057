    The only difference being that to generate equivalent Spanish data, a database of training examples an order of magnitude larger was required.
    This may be because for each database entry more pages were available on English websites than on Spanish websites.
  
  
    This section examines clustering of web pages which containing an ambiguous personal name (with multiple real referents).
    The cluster method we employed is bottom-up centroid agglomerative clustering.
    In this method, each document is assigned a vector of automatically extracted features.
    At each stage of the clustering, the two most similar vectors are merged, to produce a new cluster, with a vector equal to the centroid of the vectors in the cluster.
    This step is repeated until all documents are clustered.
    To generate the vectors for each document, we explored a variety of methods: word weight(mi) weight(extfeat) adderley 5.30 0 snipes 5.16 0 coltrane 5.06 0 montreux 5.01 0 bitches 4.99 0 danson 4.97 0 hemp 4.9
