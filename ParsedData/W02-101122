feature/class functions are traditionally defined as binary (Berger et al., 1996); hence, explicitly incorporating frequencies would require different functions for each count (or count bin), making training impractical.
    But cf.
    (Nigam et al., 1999).
    Parts of speech We also experimented with appending POS tags to every word via Oliver Mason&#8217;s Qtag program.12 This serves as a crude form of word sense disambiguation (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998): for example, it would distinguish the different usages of &#8220;love&#8221; in &#8220;I love this movie&#8221; (indicating sentiment orientation) versus &#8220;This is a love story&#8221; (neutral with respect to sentiment).
    However, the effect of this information seems to be a wash: as depicted in line (5) of Figure 3, the accuracy improves slightly for Naive Bayes but declines for SVMs, and the performance of MaxEnt is unchanged.
    Since adjectives have been a focus of previous work in sentiment detection (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Turn
