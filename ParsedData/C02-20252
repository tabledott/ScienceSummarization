 many classes of applications, they have not met the full range of needs for NLP, particularly where precise interpretation is important, or where the variety of linguistic expression is large relative to the amount of training data available.
  On the other hand, deep approaches to NLP have only recently achieved broad enough grammatical coverage and sufficient processing efficiency to allow the use of precise linguistic grammars in certain types of real-world applications.
  In particular, applications of broad-coverage analyti- cal grammars for parsing or generation require the use of sophisticated statistical techniques for resolving ambigu- ities; the transfer of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Gram- mar (HPSG) systems into industry, for example, has am- plified the need for general parse ranking, disambigua- tion, and robust recovery techniques.
  We observe general consensus on the necessity for bridging activities, com- bining symbolic and stochastic approaches to NLP.
  But although we find promising re
