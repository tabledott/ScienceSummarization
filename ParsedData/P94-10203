    This paper presents a method for constructing probabilistic classifiers for word-sense disambiguation that offers advantages over previous approaches.
    Most previous efforts have not attempted to systematically identify the interdependencies among contextual features (such as collocations) that can be used to classify the meaning of an ambiguous word.
    Many researchers have performed disambiguation on the basis of only a single feature, while others who do consider multiple contextual features assume that all contextual features are either conditionally independent given the sense of the word or fully independent.
    Of course, all contextual features could be treated as interdependent, but, if there are several features, such a model could have too many parameters to estimate in practice.
    We present a method for formulating
