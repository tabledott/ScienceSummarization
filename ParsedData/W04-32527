    Similarly, it is the application that dictates the type of relations that are used to draw connections between any two such vertices, e.g. lexical or semantic relations, contextual overlap, etc.
    Regardless of the type and characteristics of the elements added to the graph, the application of graphbased ranking algorithms to natural language texts consists of the following main steps: In the following, we investigate and evaluate the application of TextRank to two natural language processing tasks involving ranking of text units: (1) A keyword extraction task, consisting of the selection of keyphrases representative for a given text; and (2) A sentence extraction task, consisting of the identification of the most &#8220;important&#8221; sentences in a text, which can be used to build extractive summaries.
  
  
    The task of a keyword extraction application is to automatically identify in a text a set of terms that best describe the document.
    Such keywords may constitute useful ent
