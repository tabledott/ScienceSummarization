    Analogous failures occur with Chinese text.
    Dai, Khoo, and Loh (1999) use statistical methods to perform text segmentation.
    They concentrate on two-character words, because two characters is the most common word length in Chinese.
    Several different notions of frequency of characters and bigrams are explored: relative frequency, document frequency, weighted document frequency, and local frequency.
    They also look at both contextual and positional information.
    Contextual information is found to be the single most important factor that governs the probability that a bigram forms a word; incorporating the weighted document frequency can improve the model significantly.
    In contrast, the positional frequency is not found to be helpful in determining wor
