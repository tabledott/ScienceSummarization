hout further increasing computational complexity.
    So we sacrifice a small amount of fluency by allowing re-ordering without compensating lexical choice &#8211; in exchange for gaining potentially a larger amount of fluency by getting the predicate-argument structure right.
    The model has a similar rationale for employing a re-ordering pass instead of re-ranking n-best lists or lattices.
    Oracle analysis of n-best lists and lattices show that they often focus on lexical choice alternatives rather than re-ordering / role variations which are more important to semantic adequacy.
  
  
    A Chinese-English experiment was conducted on the two-pass hybrid model.
    A phrase-based SMT baseline model was built by augmenting the open source statistical machine translation decoder Moses (Koehn et al. 2007) with additional preprocessors.
    English and Chinese shallow semantic parsers followed those discussed in Section 1.
    The model was trained on LDC newswire parallel text consisting of 3.42 million se
