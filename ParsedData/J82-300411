vantage of regularities among the alternative parse trees.
    In particular, we observe that enumerating the parse trees as above fails to capture the important generalization that prepositional phrases are &amp;quot;every way ambiguous,&amp;quot; or more precisely, the set of parse trees over i PPs is the same as the set of binary trees that can be constructed over i terminal elements.
    Notice, for example, that there are two possible binary trees over three elements, corresponding to (2a) and (2b), respectively, and that there are five binary trees over four elements corresponding to (3a)&#8212;(3c), respectively.
    PPs, adjuncts, conjuncts, noun-noun modification, stack relative clauses, and other &amp;quot;every way ambiguous&amp;quot; constructions will be treated as primitive objects.
    They can be combined in various ways to produce composite constructions, such as lexical ambiguity, which may also be very ambiguous but not necessarily &amp;quot;every way ambiguous.&amp;quot; Lexical ambiguity,
