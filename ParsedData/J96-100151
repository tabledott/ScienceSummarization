locations should be kept as candidates for the final translation of the source collocation.
    In Section 6 we explain why this incremental filtering process is necessary and we show that it does not significantly degrade the quality of Champ&#176;llion's output.
    To our surprise, we found that the filtering process may even increase the quality of the proposed translation.
    The absolute frequency threshold Tf (currently set at 5) also helps limit the size of S, by rejecting words that appear too few times opposite the source collocation.
    Its most important function, however, is to remove from consideration words that appear too few times for our statistical methods to be meaningful.
    Applying the Dice measure (or any other statistical similarity measure) to very sparse data can produce misleading results, so we use Tf as a guide for the applicability of our method to low frequency words.
    It is possible to modify the thresholds Td and Tf according to properties of the database corpus and the
