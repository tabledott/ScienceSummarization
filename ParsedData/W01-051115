xample, Cause (1-2) indicates that the first noun causes the second, and Cause (2-1) indicates the converse.
    We ran the experiments creating models that used different levels of the MeSH hierarchy.
    For example, for the NC flu vaccination, flu maps to the MeSH term D4.808.54.79.429.154.349 and vaccination to G3.770.670.310.890.
    Flu vaccination for Model 4 would be represented by a vector consisting of the concatenation of the two descriptors showing only the first four levels: D4.808.54.79 G3.770.670.310 (see Table 2).
    When a word maps to a general MeSH term (like treatment, Y11) zeros are appended to the end of the descriptor to stand in place of the missing values (so, for example, treatment in Model 3 is Y 11 0, and in Model 4 is Y 11 0 0, etc.).
    The numbers in the MeSH descriptors are categorical values; we represented them with indicator variables.
    That is, for each variable we calculated the number of possible categories c and then represented an observation of the variable as a s
