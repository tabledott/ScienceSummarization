as in the previous Section 2.3, we as3In the given formula we fixed two mistakes of the original presentation [Diab and Finch, 2000]: The square of the differences is used, and the denominator contains the additional factor 4, since essentially 4 150-word vectors are compared. sume that we will already have a seed lexicon.
    For a new word we can look up its similarity scores to the seed words, thus creating a similarity vector.
    Such a vector can be translated into the other language &#8211; recall that dimensions of the vector are the similarity scores to seed words, for which we already have translations.
    The translated vector can be compared to other vectors in the second language.
    As before, we search greedily for the best matching similarity vectors and add the corresponding words to the lexicon.
    Finally, another simple clue is the observation that in comparable corpora, the same concepts should be used with similar frequencies.
    Even if the most frequent word in the German corpus is
