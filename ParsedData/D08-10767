utcomes that a rescoring of Cs may yield if the parameter set &#955;M1 is moved along the chosen direction.
    Once the upper envelope has been determined, we can project its constituent line segments onto the error counts of the corresponding candidate translations (cf.
    Figure 1).
    This projection is independent of how the envelope is generated and can therefore be applied to any set of line segments1.
    An effective means to compute the upper envelope is a sweep line algorithm which is often used in computational geometry to determine the intersection points of a sequence of lines or line segments (Bentley and Ottmann, 1979).
    The idea is to shift (&#8220;sweep&#8221;) a vertical ray from~8to8over the plane while keeping track of those points where two or more lines intersect.
    Since the upper envelope is fully specified by the topmost line segments, it suffices to store the following components for each line object &#8467;: the x-intercept &#8467;.x with the leftadjacent line, the slope &#8
