    The addition of any new hypernym relation to a preexisting taxonomy will usually necessitate the addition of a set of other novel relations as implied by the taxonomic constraints.
    We refer to the full set of novel relations implied by a new link Rij as I(Rij); we discuss the efficient computation of the set of implied links for the purpose of hyponym acquisition in Section 3.4.
    We propose that the event Rij E T has some prior probability P(Rij E T), and P(Rij E T) + P(Rij E&#65533; T) = 1.
    We define the probability of the taxonomy as a whole as the joint probability of its component relations; given a partition of all possible relations R = {A, B} where A E T and We assume that we have some set of observed evidence E consisting of observed features over pairs of objects in some domain DE; we&#8217;ll begin with the assumption that our features are over pairs of words, and that the objects in the taxonomy also correspond directly to words.4 Given a set of features ERij E E, we assume we ha
