ur the probability that a token of u will be translated as a token of v association.
    On the other hand, noise can reduce the strength of an indirect association without affecting any direct associations.
    Therefore, direct associations are usually stronger than indirect associations.
    If all the entries in a translation lexicon are sorted by their association scores, the direct associations will be very dense near the top of the list, and sparser towards the bottom.
    Gale and Church (1991) have shown that entries at the very top of the list can be over 98% correct.
    Their algorithm gleaned lexicon entries for about 61% of the word tokens in a sample of 800 English sentences.
    To obtain 98% precision, their algorithm selected only entries for which it had high confidence that the association score was high.
    These would be the word pairs that co-occur most frequently.
    A random sample of 800 sentences from the same corpus showed that 61% of the word tokens, where the tokens are of the
