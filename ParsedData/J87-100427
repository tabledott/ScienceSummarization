ssible parses in a sentence.5 Figure 5.5 shows the relationship between the parsing time and the ambiguity of a sentence.
    Recall that within the given time the algorithm produces all possible parses in the shared-packed forest representation.
    It is concluded that our algorithm can parse (and produce a forest for) a very ambiguous sentence with a million possible parses in a reasonable time.
  
  
    So far, we have described the algorithm as a pure context-free parsing algorithm.
    In practice, it is often desired for each grammar nonterminal to have attributes, and for each grammar rule to have an augmentation to define, pass, and test the attribute values.
    It is also desired to produce a functional structure (in the sense of functional grammar formalism (Kay 1984, Bresnan and Kaplan 1982) rather than the context-free forest.
    Subsection 6.1 describes the augmentation, and subsection 6.2 discusses the shared-packed representation for functional structures.
