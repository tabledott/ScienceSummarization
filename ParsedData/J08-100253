t to capture semantic preferences.
    A possible reason is that, as reported in Gildea (2001), bilexical dependencies may be too sparse to capture semantic preferences.
    For reference, our results are competitive with the best corresponding results reported in CCG parsing (LP/LR = 86.6/86.3) (Clark and Curran 2004b), although our results cannot be compared directly with other grammar formalisms because each formalism represents predicate&#8211;argument dependencies differently.
    In contrast with the results of CCG and PCFG (Collins 1997, 1999, 2003; Charniak 2000), the recall is clearly lower than precision.
    This may have resulted from the HPSG grammar having stricter feature constraints and the parser not being able to produce parse results for around 1% of the sentences.
    To improve recall, we need techniques to deal with these 1% of sentences.
