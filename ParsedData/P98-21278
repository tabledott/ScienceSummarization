Two words are a pair of respective nearest neighbors (RNNs) if each is the other's most similar word.
    Our program found 543 pairs of RNN nouns, 212 pairs of RNN verbs and 382 pairs of RNN adjectives/adverbs in the automatically created thesaurus.
    Appendix A lists every 10th of the RNNs.
    The result looks very strong.
    Few pairs of RNNs in Appendix A have clearly better alternatives.
    We also constructed several other thesauri using the same corpus, but with the similarity measures in Figure 1.
    The measure SirriHindie is the same as the similarity measure proposed in (Hindl
