			Recall is calculated as the portion of items from class i that are present in cluster j, thus measuring how complete cluster j is with respect toclass i. Similarly, Precision is calculated as the por 412 Solution A Solution B F-Measure=0.5 F-Measure=0.5 V-Measure=0.14 V-Measure=0.39 Solution C Solution D F-Measure=0.6 F-Measure=0.6 V-Measure=0.30 V-Measure=0.41 Figure 2: Examples of the Problem of Matchingtion of cluster j that is a member of class i, thus mea suring how homogenous cluster j is with respect to class i.Like some other external cluster evaluation tech niques (misclassification index (MI) (Zeng et al, 2002), H (Meila and Heckerman, 2001), L (Larsenand Aone, 19
