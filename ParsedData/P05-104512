dataset is used for testing, there is no development set.
    We also used their evaluation metric, which is slightly different from the method for CoNLL data.
    Instead of evaluating precision and recall on a per-entity basis, they are evaluated on a per-token basis.
    Then, to calculate the overall F1 score, the F1 scores for each class are averaged.
  
  
    Our models of non-local structure are themselves just sequence models, defining a probability distribution over all possible state sequences.
    It is possible to flexibly model various forms of constraints in a way that is sensitive to the linguistic structure of the data (e.g., one can go beyond imposing just exact identity conditions).
    One could imagine many ways of defining such models; for simplicity we use the form where the product is over a set of violation types A, and for each violation type A we specify a penalty parameter &#952;&#955;.
    The exponent #(A, s, o) is the count of the number of times that the violation A occurs in t
