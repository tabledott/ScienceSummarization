    In particular, many verbs take prepositional phrases (PPs) headed by a particular preposition or class of prepositions.
    For example, put requires a location as a second argument, and locations are often represented by PPs headed by locative prepositions.
    Extending Lerner to detect PPs is trivial.
    Since the set of prepositions in the language is essentially fixed, all prepositions can be included in the initial lexicon.
    Detecting a PP requires nothing more than detecting a preposition.'
    The statistical model can, of course, be applied without modification.
    The problem, however, is determining which PPs are arguments and which are adjuncts.

    For instance, almost any verb can occur with a temporal PP headed by on, as in John arrived on Monday.
