ough 374 show hyperresolutions that result in all the terms of the question being derived in their positive form so the proof by contradiction succeeds, which is indicated by the $F in the final step and the hyperresolution of all the derived terms with the negated question from step 1 of the proof.
    The success of this proof boosts the candidate answer to the first position.
    When the proof fails, we devised a way to incrementally relax some of the conditions that hinder the completion of the proof.
    This relaxation process puts weights on the proof such that proofs weaker than a predefined threshold are not accepted.
  
  
    COGEX was implemented and integrated into a state-ofthe-art Question Answering system that participated in TREC 2002.
    All questions are attempted by the prover, but if the proof fails the QA system resorts to other answer extraction methods that were part of the system before the prover.
    Thus, some questions are answered by the QA system without the prover, some only
