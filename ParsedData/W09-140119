 differentiate binding events by their number of themes, while the former two give no specific treatment to multi-theme binding events.
    Such observations and comparisons are a clear benefit of a community-wide shared task.
    Table 6 shows the evaluation results for the teams who participated in Task 2.
    The &#8220;All&#8221; column shows the overall performance of the systems for Task 2, while the &#8220;All Second Args.&#8221; column shows the performance of finding only the secondary arguments.
    The evaluation results show considerable differences between the criteria.
    For example, the system [Team 24] shows performance comparable to the top ranked system in finding secondary arguments, although its overall performance for Task 2 is more limited.
    Table 6 also shows the three systems, [UT+DBCLS], [Team 24] and [CNBMadrid], show performance at a practical level in particular in finding specific sites of phosphorylation.
    As shown in Table 7, the performance range for Task 3 is very low
