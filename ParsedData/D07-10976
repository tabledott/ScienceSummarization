			Since the parsing algorithm only produces projective dependency graphs, we may use pseudo-projective parsing to recover non-projective dependencies, i.e., projectivize training data and encode information about these transformations in extended arc labels to support deprojectivization of the parser output(Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).
			Pseudo-projective parsing was found to have a positive effect on over all parsing accuracy only for Basque, Czech, Greek and Turkish.
			This result can probably be explainedin terms of the frequency of non-projective depen dencies in the different languages.
			For Basque, Czech, Greek and Turkish, more than 20% of the sentences have non-projective dependency graphs; for all the remaining languages the corresponding4For Arabic, Basque, Czech, and Greek, the lack of im provement can be explained by the fact that these data sets allow more than one label for dependencies from the artificial root.With empty stack initialization all such dependencies are assigned a
