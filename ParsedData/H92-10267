proximation than the usual P-CFG is to use a decision tree to determine which aspects of the left- most derivation have a bearing on the probability of how node i will be expanded.
  In other words, the probabil- ity distribution p(rilt~" ) will be modeled by p(r~lE[t~]) where E[~] is the equivalence class of the history t as de- termined by the decision tree.
  This allows our probabilis- tic model to use any information anywhere in the partial derivation tree to determine the probability of different expansions of the i-th non-terminal.
  The use of deci- sion trees and a large bracketed corpus may shift some of the burden of identifying the intended parse from the grammarian to the statistical estimation methods.
  We refer to probabilistic methods based on the derivation as History-based Grammars (HBG).
  iNote the abuse of notat ion since we denote by p(r~) the con- ditional probabil ity of rewriting the non-terminal Ni.
  135 In this paper, we explored a restricted implementation of this model in which
