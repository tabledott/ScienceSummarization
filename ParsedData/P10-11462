Venugopal, 2006), we compare several methods for extracting a synchronous grammar from tree-to-tree data.
    One confounding factor in such a comparison is that some methods generate many new syntactic categories, making it more difficult to satisfy syntactic constraints at decoding time.
    We therefore propose to move these constraints from the formalism into the model, implemented as features in the hierarchical phrasebased model Hiero (Chiang, 2005).
    This augmented model is able to learn from data whether to rely on syntax or not, or to revert back to monotone phrase-based translation.
    In experiments on Chinese-English and ArabicEnglish translation, we find that when both source and target syntax are made available to the model in an unobtrusive way, the model chooses to build structures that are more syntactically well-formed and yield significantly better translations than a nonsyntactic hierarchical phrase-based model.
