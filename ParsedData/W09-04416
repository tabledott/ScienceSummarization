e reference translation and the measuring of similarity only by exact word matches between the hypothesis and the reference.
    The handicap of using a single reference can be addressed by the construction of a lattice of reference translations.
    Such a technique has been used with TER to combine the output of multiple translation systems (Rosti et al., 2007).
    TERp does not utilize this methodology2 and instead focuses on addressing the exact matching flaw of TER.
    A brief description of TER is presented in Section 2.1, followed by a discussion of how TERp differs from TER in Section 2.2.
    One of the first automatic metrics used to evaluate automatic machine translation (MT) systems was Word Error Rate (WER) (Niessen et al., 2000), which is the standard evaluation metric for Automatic Speech Recognition.
    WER is computed as the Levenshtein (Levenshtein, 1966) distance between the words of the system output and the words of the reference translation divided by the length of the reference trans
