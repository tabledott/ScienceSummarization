 a reliable evaluation, a manually annotated test set was developed.
    The text corpus contains approximately half million Chinese characters that have been proofread and balanced in terms of domain, styles, and times.
    Before we annotate the corpus, several questions have to be answered: (1) Does the segmentation depend on a particular lexicon?
    (2) Should we assume a single correct segmentation for a sentence?
    (3) What are the evaluation criteria?
    (4) How to perform a fair comparison across different systems?
    As described earlier, it is more useful to define words depending on how the words are used in real applications.
    In our system, a lexicon (containing 98,668 lexicon words and 59,285 morphologically derived words) has been constructed for several applications, such as Asian language input and web search.
    Therefore, we annotate the text corpus based on the lexicon.
    That is, we segment each sentence as much as possible into words that are stored in our lexicon, and tag onl
