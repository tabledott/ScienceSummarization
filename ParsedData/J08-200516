  3.2 Argument Identification The argument identification stage utilizes binary classification to identify whether a candidate is an argument or not.
  When full parsing is available, we train and apply the binary classifiers on the constituents supplied by the pruning stage.
  When only shallow parsing is available, the system does not have a pruning stage, and also does not have constituents to begin with.
  Therefore, conceptually, the system has to consider all possible subsequences (i.e., consecutive words) in a sentence as potential argument candidates.
  We avoid this by using a learning scheme that utilizes two classifiers, one to predict the beginnings of possible arguments, and the other the ends.
  The predictions are combined to form argument candidates.
  However, we can employ a simple heuristic to filter out some candidates that are obviously not arguments.
  The final predication includes those that do not violate the following constrai
