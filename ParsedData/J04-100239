    MIDAS is driven by the idea that novel metaphors are derived from known, existing ones.
    The hierarchical structure of conventional metaphor is a regularity not captured by other computational approaches.
    Although MIDAS can quickly understand novel metaphors that are the descendants of metaphors in its memory, it cannot interpret compound metaphors or detect intermetaphor relationships besides inheritance.
    INVESTMENTS &#8594; CONTAINERS and MONEY &#8594; WATER, for instance, are clearly related, but not in a way that MIDAS can represent.
    Since not all novel metaphors are descendants of common conventional metaphors, MIDAS&#8217;s coverage is limited.
    MetaBank (Martin 1994) is an empirically derived knowledge base of conventional metaphors designed for use in natural language applications.
    MetaBank starts with a knowledge base of metaphors based on the Master Metaphor List.
    MetaBank can search a corpus for one metaphor or scan a large corpus for any metaphorical content.
