s for the correctness of each answer instead of 0 (&amp;quot;incorrect&amp;quot;) and 1 (&amp;quot;correct&amp;quot;).
    We defined the correctness of each answer as the relative frequency of the association between the two adjectives among the human models and the incorrectness of each answer as 1 - correctness; in this way, associations receive a correctness value proportional to their popularity among the human judges.
    For example, in the sample set of adjectives discussed in the previous section, the association (foreign, international) received a correctness value of 1, since all the humans placed these two adjectives in the same group, while the association (legal, severe) received a correctness value of 0.
    The pair (economic, political) on the other hand received a correctness value of 0.67, since two thirds of the judges placed the two adjectives in the same group.
    Once correctness and incorrectness values have been defined, we can generalize measures such as &amp;quot;the number of corr
