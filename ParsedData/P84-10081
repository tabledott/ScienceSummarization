 like, such high-level terms typically stand for collections of features.
    Features, in this sense of the word, are usually thought of as attribute-value pairs: [person: 1st], [number: sg], although singleton features are also admitted in some theories.
    The values of phonological and morphological features are traditionally atomic; e.g.
    1st, 2nd, 3rd; they are often binary: +, Most current theories also allow features that have complex values.
    A complex value is a collection of features, for example:
  
  
    number person 3rd In graphs of this sort, values are reached by traversing paths of attribute names.
    We use angle brackets to mark expressions that designate paths.
    With that convention, the above graph can also be represented as a set of equations: &lt;agreement number&gt; = sg &lt;agreement person&gt; = 3rd Such equations also provide a convenient way to express conditions on features.
    This idea lies at the heart of UG, LFG, and the PATR-II grammar for English [Shieber, et a
