el Default Maximum Non-lexical 86.8 87.4 Lexical 88.4 89.7 Table 3: Prediction accuracy for MBL modelsThe second column shows the accuracy for the best pa rameter settings found in the experiments (averaged overboth models), which differ from the default in the follow ing respects:?
			Overlap metric replaced by the modified value dis tance metric (MVDM) (Stanfill and Waltz, 1986; Cost and Salzberg, 1993).
			No weighting of features.?
			k = 5, i.e. classification based on 5 nearest neigh bors.
			Distance weighted class voting with inverse distance weighting (Dudani, 1976).
			For more information about the different parameters and settings, the reader is referred to Daelemans et al (2003).The results show that the lexical model performs con sistently better than the non-lexical model, and that the difference increases with the optimization of the learning algorithm (all differences being significant at the .0001level according to McNemar?s test).
			This confirms previous results from statistical parsing i
