he cannot guarantee that two contraindexed pronouns will not choose the same NP as a co-specifier.
    Hobbs also assumes that his algorithm can somehow collect discourse entities mentioned alone into sets as co-specifiers of plural anaphors.
    Hobbs discusses at length other assumptions that he makes about the capabilities of an interpretive process that operates before the algorithm [Hob761)].
    This includes such things as being able to recover syntactically recoverable omitted text, such as elided verb phrases, and the identities of the speakers and hearers in a dialogue.
    A major component of any discourse algorithm is the prediction of which entities are salient, even though all the factors that contribute to the salience of a discourse entity have not been identified [Pri81, Pri85, BF83, HTD86].
    So an obvious question is when the two algorithms actually make different predictions.
    The main difference is that the choice of a co-specifier for a pronoun in the Hobbs algorithm depends in par
