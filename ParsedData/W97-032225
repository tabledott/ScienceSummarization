    These common features may be sufficient for the level of disambiguation achieved here.
    This explanation seems more plausible for the EM algorithm, where features are weighted, but less so for McQuitty's and Ward's which use a representation that does not allow feature weighting.
    Based on the average accuracy over part&#8212;of&#8212;speech categories, the EM algorithm performs with the highest accuracy for nouns while McQuitty's method performs most accurately for verbs and adjectives.
    This is true regardless of the feature set employed.
    The standard deviations give an indication of the effect of ties on the clustering algorithms and the effect of the random initialization on the the EM algorithm.
    In few cases is the standard deviation very small.
    For the clustering algorithms, a high standard deviation indicates that ties are having some effect on the cluster analysis.
    This is undesirable and may point to a need to expand the feature set in order to reduce ties.
    For the
