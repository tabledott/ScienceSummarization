    An MDL model can most easily be conceptualized if we encode all such knowledge by means of lists; see Figure 2.
    In the present case, we have three lists: a list of stems, of suffixes, and of signatures.
    We construct a list of the stems of the corpus defined as the set of the unanalyzed words, plus the material that precedes the final suffix of each morphologically analyzed word.
    We also construct a list of suffixes that occur with at least one stem.
    Finally, each stem is empirically associated with a set of suffixes (those with which it appears in the corpus); we call this set the stem's signature, and we construct a third list, consisting of the signatures that appear in this corpus.
    This third list, however, contains no letters (as the other A sample morphology.
    This morphology covers the words: cat, cats, dog, dogs, hat, hats, save, saves, saving, savings, jump, jumped, jumping, jumps, laugh, laughed, laughing, laughs, walk, walked, walking, walks, the, John. lists do), bu
