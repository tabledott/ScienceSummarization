 To define them, we use the terms Number of words occurring in the hand-segmentation Number of words incorrectly identified by the automatic method Number of words correctly identified by the automatic method Recall and precision are standard information retrieval measures used to assess the quality of a retrieval system in terms of how many of the relevant documents are retrieved (recall) and how many of the retrieved documents are relevant (precision): The overall error rate can be defined as error rate = This in principle can give misleading results&#8212;an extreme condition is where the automatic method only identifies a single word, leading to a very small error rate of 1/N despite the fact that all words but one are misidentified.
    However, in all our experiments extreme conditions do not occur because n is always close to N and we find that the error rate is a useful overall indicator of the quality of segmentation.
    We also used the F-measure to compare our results with others: If the automatic
