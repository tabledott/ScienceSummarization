g the rich syn tactic information available in the CCG categories.
			We explore the potential of letting supertags direct translation by including them as a factor on the source.
			This is similar to syntax-directed translation originally proposed for compiling (Aho and Ullman, 1969), and also used in machine translation (Quirk et al., 2005; Huang et al, 2006).
			Information about thesource words?
			syntactic function and subcategori sation can directly influence the hypotheses beingsearched in decoding.
			These experiments were per formed on the German to English translation task, in contrast to the Dutch to English results given in previous experiments.
			We use a model which combines more specificdependencies on source words and source CCG su pertags, with a more general model which only has dependancies on the source word, see Equation 4.We explore two different ways of balancing the sta tistical evidence from these multiple sources.
			The first way to combine the general and specific sources of in
