hbors pick up the composite meaning rather than that of the adjective or noun alone.
    For example, cover is an ambiguous word, but the hardback neighbor relates to its &#8220;front of a book&#8221; meaning that is the most natural one in combination with red.
    Similarly, it makes more sense that a young husband (rather than an old one) would have small sons and daughters (not to mention the mistress!).
    We realize that the evidence presented here is of a very preliminary and intuitive nature.
    Indeed, we will argue in the next section that there are cases in which the corpus-derived AN vector might not be a good approximation to our semantic intuitions about the AN, and a model-composed AN vector is a better semantic surrogate.
    One of the most important avenues for further work will be to come to a better characterization of the behaviour of corpus-observed ANs, where they work and where the don&#8217;t.
    Still, the neighbors of average and ANspecific vectors of Tables 1 and 2 suggest that,
