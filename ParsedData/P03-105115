of &#8220;unknown stem&#8221; errors at 39.6% indicating that our unsupervised acquisition of new stems is working well, as well as suggesting to use a larger unsegmented corpus for unsupervised stem acquisition.
    &#1605;&#65262;&#65268;&#1127;&#65247;&#1575; (Alywm) should be segmented differently depending on its part-of-speech to capture the semantic ambiguities.
    If it is an adverb or a proper noun, it is segmented as &#1605;&#65262;&#65268;&#1127;&#65247;&#1575; 'today/Al-Youm', whereas if it is a noun, it is segmented as &#1605;&#65262;&#1127;&#65267; #&#1604;&#1575; 'the day.'
    Proper segmentation of &#1605;&#65262;&#65268;&#1127;&#65247;&#1575; primarily requires its part-of-speech information, and cannot be easily handled by morpheme trigram models alone.
    Other errors include over-segmentation of foreign words such as &#65254;&#1127;&#65268;&#1127;&#65175;&#65262;&#1127;&#65169; (bwtyn) as &#1576;# &#65254;&#1127;&#65268;&#1127;&#65175;&#1608; and &#65198;&#1127;&#65176;&#1127;&#65268;&#
