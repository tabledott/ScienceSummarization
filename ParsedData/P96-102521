 in the sentence the probability, Ph, of the highest probability constituent is recorded.
    All other constituents spanning the same words must have probability greater than 9- for some constant beam size - constituents which fall out of this beam are discarded.
    The method risks introducing search-errors, but in practice efficiency can be greatly improved with virtually no loss of accuracy.
    Table 5 shows the trade-off between speed and accuracy as the beam is narrowed. as the beam-size is varied.
    Model (3) was used for this test on all sentences &lt; 100 words in section 23.
  
  
    We have shown that a simple statistical model based on dependencies between words can parse Wall Street Journal news text with high accuracy.
    The method is equally applicable to tree or dependency representations of syntactic structures.
    There are many possibilities for improvement, which is encouraging.
    More sophisticated estimation techniques such as deleted interpolation should be tried.
