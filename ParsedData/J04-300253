    Of the 45 parameter pairs, the minimum percentage increase over baseline is 22%.
    Fully 24% of the 45 parameter pairs yield increases of 200% or more; 38% yield increases between 100% and 199%, and 38% yield increases between 22% and 99%.
    In addition, the increases are significant.
    Using the set of high-density PSEs defined by the parameter pair with the least increase over baseline, we tested the difference in the proportion of PSEs in opinion pieces that are high-density and the proportion of PSEs in nonopinion pieces that are high-density.
    The difference between these two proportions is highly significant (z = 46.2, p &lt; 0.0001).
    Notice that, except for one blip (T, W = 6,10 under WSJ-SE-M), the precisions decrease and the frequencies increase as we go down each column in Table 11.
    The same pattern can be observed with all 45 parameter pairs (results not included here because of space considerations).
    But the parameter pairs are ordered in Table 11 based on performan
