te information about con- stituent structure, the syntactic filters described below are extremely accurate (see the discussion of this point in section 4).
			Condition i is implemented bylocating all discourse referents with GFUN value direct object, indirect object, or oblique which follow a pronoun with GFUN value subject or direct object, as long as no subject intervenes (the hypothesis being that a subject indicates the beginning of the next clause).
			Discourse referents which satisfy these conditions are identified as disjoint.
			Condition 2 is implemented by locating for ev- ery non-adjunct and non-embedded pronoun the set of non-pronominal discourse referents in its sentence which follow it, and eliminating these as potential an- tecedents.
			In effect, the command relation is inferred from precedence and the information provided by the syntactic patterns: an argument which is neither con- tained in an adjunct nor embedded in another nominal commands those expressions which it precedes.
