g 1974).
    The descriptive notations and accepting automata for regular languages can also be generalized to the n-dimensional case.
    An n-way regular expression is simply a regular expression whose terms are n-tuples of alphabetic symbols or &#8364;.
    For ease of writing we separate the elements of an n-tuple by colons.
    Thus the expression a:b E:C describes the two-relation containing the single pair (a,bc), and a:b:c* q:r:s describes the three-relation {(anq,bnr,cns) I n &gt; 0}.
    The regular-expression notation provides for concatenation, union, and Kleene-closure of these terms.
    The accepting automata for regular n-relations are the n-way finite-state transducers.
    As illustrated by the two-dimensional examples given in Section 2, these are an obvious extension of the standard one-tape finite-state machines.
    The defining properties of the regular languages, regular expressions, and finitestate machines are the basis for proving the well-known Kleene correspondence theorems showin
