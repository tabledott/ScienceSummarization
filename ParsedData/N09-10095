ymbol or a terminal symbol analogous to the emissions of an HMM).
    Each step or emission of an HMM and each rewriting operation of a PCFG is conditionally independent of the other rewriting operations given a single structural element (one HMM or PCFG state); this Markov property permits efficient inference for the probability distribution defined by the probabilistic grammar.
    In general, a probabilistic grammar defines the joint probability of a string x and a grammatical where fk,i is a function that &#8220;counts&#8221; the number of times the kth distribution&#8217;s ith event occurs in the derivation.
    The &#952; are a collection of K multinomials (&#952;1, ..., &#952;K), the kth of which includes Nk events.
    Note that there may be many derivations y for a given string x&#8212;perhaps even infinitely many in some kinds of grammars.
  
  
    HMMs and PCFGs are the best-known probabilistic grammars, but there are many others.
    In this paper, we use the &#8220;dependency model with valence&
