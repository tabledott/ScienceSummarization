 another semantic role that has an important pragmatic restriction on it in this example, the object2 semantic role in wait. for &amp;quot;part (awp).
    The semantics of wait for &amp;quot;part indicates that a particular type of part has been ordered, and is expected to arrive.
    But it is not a specific entity that might have already been mentioned.
    It is a more abstract object, which is indicated by restricting it to being non-specific.
    This tells reference resolution that although a syntactic constituent, preferably the object, can and should fill this semantic role, and must be of type machine-part, that reference resolution should not try to find a specific referent for it (see Section 4).
    The last verb representation that is needed for the example is the representation of be.
    In this domain be is used to associate predicate adjectives or nominals with an object, as in disk drive is up or spindle motor is bad.
    The representation merely indicates that a modifier is associated with
