ual structure looks different from what Jackendoff envisions.
  Whichever of these proposals i correct, neither Jackendoff nor Marantz considers their proposals in the context of interlingual machine translation.
  If the exceptional mappings are indeed arbitrary, then one needs to explain how this affects the handling of different languages.
  Moreover, neither Jackendoff nor Marantz mentions the possibility that the number of exceptional mappings might not be arbitrarily large, but that there might be a fixed number of exceptions, delineated in such a way that only a handful need to be considered at any time for any given language.
  This is why the formalization described in this paper is a valuable resource: it provides a means for proving that only certain types of exceptions are allowed and that the number of such exceptions i  actually quite small.
  Finally, neither Jackendoff nor Marantz considers keeping Jackendoffs version of the LCS intact and using a single parameterized mapping along the lines p
