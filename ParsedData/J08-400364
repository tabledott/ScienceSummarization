ity to capture non-projective dependencies does make a significant difference, even though such dependencies are infrequent in most languages.
    The best result is about one percentage point below the top scores from the original CoNLL-X shared task, but it must be remembered that the results in this article have been obtained without optimization of feature representations or learning algorithm parameters.
    The net effect of this can be seen in the result for the pseudo-projective version of the arc-eager, stack-based parser, which is identical to the system used by Nivre et al. (2006), except for the lack of optimization, and which suffers a loss of 1.12 percentage points overall.
    The results for UAS show basically the same pattern as the LAS results, but with even less variation between the parsers.
    Nevertheless, there is still a statistically significant margin between the non-projective, list-based parser and the three pseudoprojective parsers, on the one hand, and the strictly projective pa
