ptance/rejection scheme to define a transition kernel with the desired distribution ?(s).
			Specifically, given the current state s, a sample s?
			6= s drawn from Q(s?|s) is accepted as the next state with probability A(s, s?)
			= min { 1, ?(s ?)Q(s|s?) ?(s)Q(s?|s) }and with probability 1 ?A(s, s?)
			the proposal is re jected and the next state is the current state s. We use a component-wise proposal distribution, generating new proposed values for ti, where i is chosen at random.
			Our proposal distribution is the posterior distribution over parse trees generated bythe PCFG with grammar G and production proba bilities ??, where ??
			is chosen based on the current t?i as described below.
			Each step of our Hastings sampler is as follows.
			First, we compute ??
			from t?i as described below.
			Then we sample t?i fromP(ti|wi, ??)
			using the algorithm described in Sec tion 4.
			Finally, we accept the proposal t?i given the old parse ti for wi with probability: A(ti, t?i) = min { 1, P(t ? i|wi, t?i,
