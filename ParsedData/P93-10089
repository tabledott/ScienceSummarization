 test set it was 90.9%.
    Since Gemini was designed with spoken language interpretation in mind, key aspects of the Gemini parser are motivated by the increased needs for robustness and efficiency that characterize spoken language.
    Gemini uses essentially a pure bottom-up chart parser, with some limited left-context constraints applied to control creation of categories containing syntactic gaps.
    Some key properties of the parser are An important feature of the parser is the mechanism used to constrain the construction of categories containing syntactic gaps.
    In earlier work (Moore and Dowding, 1991), we showed that approximately 80% of the edges built in an allpaths bottom-up parser contained gaps, and that it is possible to use prediction in a bottom-up parser only to constrain the gap categories, without requiring prediction for nongapped categories.
    This limited form of left-context constraint greatly reduces the total number of edges built for a very low overhead.
