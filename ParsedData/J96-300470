ts own sake but instead with a larger purpose in mind.
    As described in Sproat (1995), the Chinese segmenter presented here fits directly into the context of a broader finite-state model of text analysis for speech synthesis.
    Furthermore, by inverting the transducer so that it maps from phonemic transcriptions to hanzi sequences, one can apply the segmenter to other problems, such as speech recognition (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994).
    Since the transducers are built from human-readable descriptions using a lexical toolkit (Sproat 1995), the system is easily maintained and extended.
    While size of the resulting transducers may seem daunting&#8212;the segmenter described here, as it is used in the Bell Labs Mandarin TTS system has about 32,000 states and 209,000 arcs&#8212;recent work on minimization of weighted machines and transducers (cf.
    Mohri [1995]) shows promise for improving this situation.
    The model described here thus demonstrates great potential for use in widespread applicati
