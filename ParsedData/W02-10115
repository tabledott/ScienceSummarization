y, our baseline experiments, described in Section 4, show that humans may not always have the best intuition for choosing discriminating words.
    Turney&#8217;s (2002) work on classification of reviews is perhaps the closest to ours.2 He applied a specific unsupervised learning technique based on the mutual information between document phrases and the words &#8220;excellent&#8221; and &#8220;poor&#8221;, where the mutual information is computed using statistics gathered by a search engine.
    In contrast, we utilize several completely prior-knowledge-free supervised machine learning methods, with the goal of understanding the inherent difficulty of the task.
  
  
    For our experiments, we chose to work with movie reviews.
    This domain is experimentally convenient because there are large on-line collections of such reviews, and because reviewers often summarize their overall sentiment with a machine-extractable rating indicator, such as a number of stars; hence, we did not need to hand-label the data
