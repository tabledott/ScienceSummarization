ous work, vector-space lexical similarity and word sense discovery have been treated as two separate tasks.
    This paper shows how they can be combined to create an improved vector-space model of lexical semantics.
    First, a word&#8217;s contexts are clustered to produce groups of similar context vectors.
    An average &#8220;prototype&#8221; vector is then computed separately for each cluster, producing a set of vectors for each word.
    Finally, as described above, these cluster vectors can be used to determine the semantic similarity of both isolated words and words in context.
    The approach is completely modular, and can integrate any clustering method with any traditional vector-space model.
    We present experimental comparisons to human judgements of semantic similarity for both isolated words and words in sentential context.
    The results demonstrate the superiority of a clustered approach over both traditional prototype and exemplar-based vector-space models.
    For example, given the i
