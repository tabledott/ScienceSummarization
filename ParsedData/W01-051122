ersus the lexical model in the case of unseen words; we are also interested in seeing the relative importance of the first versus the second noun.
    Therefore, we split the data into 5% training (73 data points) and 95% testing (1587 data points) and partitioned the testing set into 4 subsets as follows (the numbers in parentheses are the numbers of points for each case): Table 5 and Figures 3 and 4 present the accuracies for these test set partitions.
    Figure 3 shows that the MeSH-based models are more robust than the lexical when the number of unseen words is high and when the size of training set is (very) small.
    In this more realistic situation, the MeSH models are able to generalize over previously unseen words.
    For unseen words, lexical reduces to guessing.4 Figure 4 shows the accuracy for the MeSH basedmodel for the the four cases of Table 5.
    It is interesting to note that the accuracy for Case 1 (first noun not present in the training set) is much higher than the accuracy for Case 2 (
