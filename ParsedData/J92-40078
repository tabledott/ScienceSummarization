tional) and subject matter (i.e., informational) relations would result in analyses that contain only presentational relations, since these are what most directly express the speaker's purpose.
    But, as we argue below, a complete model of discourse structure must maintain both levels of relation.
    We begin by showing that in discourse interpretation, recognition may flow from the informational level to the intentional level or vice versa.
    In other words, a hearer may be able to determine what the speaker is trying to do because of what the hearer knows about the world or what she knows about what the speaker believes about the world.
    Alternatively, the hearer may be able to figure out what the speaker believes about the world by recognizing what the speaker is trying to do in the discourse.
