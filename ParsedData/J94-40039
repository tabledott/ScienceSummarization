was then correct for 91% of the cases.
    We cite also the results of a later experiment (Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993) that tested a weaker variant of our method on texts in the computer domain, achieving a precision of 85%.
    Both results significantly improve upon a naive method that uses only a priori word probabilities.
    These results are comparable to recent reports in the literature (see Section 7).
    It should be emphasized, though, that our results were achieved for a realistic simulation of a broad coverage machine translation system, on randomly selected examples.
    We therefore believe that our figures reflect the expected performance of the algorithm in a practical implementation.
    On the other hand, most other results relate to a small number of words and senses that were determined by the experimenters.
    Section 2 of the paper describes the linguistic model we use, employing a syntactic parser and a bilingual lexicon.
    Section 3 presents the statistical model, assuming
