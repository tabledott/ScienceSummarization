 The system described here was developed as part of the BioNLP/NLPBA 2004 shared task.
    Experiments were conducted on a training and evaluation set provided by the task organizers.
  
  
    Biomedical named entity recognition can be thought of as a sequence segmentation problem: each word is a token in a sequence to be assigned a label (e.g.
    PROTEIN, DNA, RNA, CELL-LINE, CELL-TYPE, or OTHER1).
    Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are undirected statistical graphical models, a special case of which is a linear chain that corresponds to a conditionally trained finite-state machine.
    Such models are well suited to sequence analysis, and CRFs in 'More accurately, the data is in IOB format.
    B-DNA labels the first word of a DNA mention, I-DNA labels all subsequent words (likewise for other entities), and O labels non-entities.
    For simplicity, this paper only refers to the entities, not all the IOB label variants. particular have been shown to be useful in partof-speech tagging (Lafferty et al., 2
