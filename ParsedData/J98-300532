ce, and the times at which both sources made their reports.'
    We found having the source of the report immensely useful for discovering and reporting contradictions and generalizations, because often different reports of an event are in conflict.
    Also, source information can indicate the level of confidence of the report, particularly when reported information changes over time.

    Their prototype uses pattern-matching techniques to track changes to on-line news sources and provide a live feed of articles that relate to a changing event.
    SUMMONS's summarization component generates a base summary, which contains
