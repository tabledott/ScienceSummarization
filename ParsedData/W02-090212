n respect to 150 so-called peripheral tokens, basically the most frequent words.
    These counts are collected for each position in a 4-word window around the word in focus.
    This results in a 600-dimensional vector.
    Instead of comparing these co-occurrence counts directly, the Spearman rank order correlation is applied: For each position the tokens are compared in frequency and the frequency count is replaced by the frequency rank &#8211; the most frequent token count is replaced by 1, the least frequent by n = 150.
    The similarity of two context vectors a = (ai) and b = (bi) is then defined by:3 The result of all this is a matrix with similarity scores between all German words, and second one with similarity scores between all English words.
    Such matrices could also be constructed using the definitions of context we reviewed in the previous section.
    The important point here is that we have generated a similarity matrix, which we will use now to find new translation word pairs.
    Again,
