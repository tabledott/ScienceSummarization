ted the long-range dependency, in this case the object relative pronoun category.
    The dependency annotation also permits complex categories as arguments.
    For example, the marked up category for about (as in about 5,000 pounds) is: If 5,000 has the category (NX/NX)5,000, the dependency relation marked on the (N/N)Y,1 argument in (12) allows the dependency between about and 5,000 to be captured.
    In the current implementation every argument slot in a lexical category corresponds to a dependency relation.
    This means, for example, that the parser produces subjects of to-infinitival clauses and auxiliary verbs.
    In the sentence IBM may like to buy Lotus, IBM will be returned as the subject of may, like, to, and buy.
    The only exception is during evaluation, when some of these dependencies are ignored in order to be consistent with the predicate&#8211;argument dependencies in CCGbank, and also DepBank.
    In future work we may investigate removing some of these dependencies from the parsing mo
