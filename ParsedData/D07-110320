ut C(s?, t?)
			= 1.
			Another question that came up is the role of phrasepairs that occur only once: C(s?, t?)
			= 1.
			In particu lar as discussed above, the most significant of these are the 1-1-1 phrase pairs whose components also only occur once: C(s?) = 1, and C(t?) = 1.
			Thesephrase pairs are amazingly frequent in the phrasetables and are pruned in all of the experiments ex cept when pruning threshold is equal to 14.
			The Chinese?English large corpus experiments give us a good opportunity to show that significance level seems to be more an issue than the case that C(s?, t?)
			= 1.
			Note that we could have kept the phrase pairs whose marginal counts were greater than one but most of these are of lower significance and likelyare pruned already by the threshold.
			The given con figuration was considered the most likely to yield a benefit and its poor performance led to the whole idea being put aside.
	
	
			To sum up, the main conclusions are five in number: 1.
