 empirical probability of x1 is 1 / 3, so X1's contribution to f4fd is 1/3 &#8226; 1, and its contribution to /3[f3] is 1/3 &#8226; 2.
    The weight is obtained from p[f] by normalizing among rules with the same left-hand side.
    For example, the expected rule frequencies 13[fd and [f2] of rules with left-hand side S already sum to 1, so they are adopted without change as /31 and 02.
    On the other hand, the expected rule frequencies 13 [f5] and p[f6] for rules with left-hand side B sum to 1/2, not 1, so they are doubled to yield weights Os and /36.
    It should be observed that the resulting weights are precisely the weights of model A41.
    It can be proven that the ERF weights are the best weights for a given contextfree grammar, in the sense that they define the distribution that is most similar to the empirical distribution.
    That is, if /3 are the ERF weights (for a given grammar), defining distribution q, and 0' defining q' is any set of weights such that q q', then D(13iiq) &lt; D(13iiqi)One
