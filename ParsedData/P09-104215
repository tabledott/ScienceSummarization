 is very similar to the first iteration of our model, since for a large corpus the different random choices made in different sentences tend to smooth each other out.
    We also tried to create rules for the adoption of orphans, but the simple rules we tried added bias and performed worse than the baseline we report.
    Table 2 shows attachment accuracy of our method and the baseline for both language pairs under several conditions.
    By attachment accuracy we mean the fraction of words assigned the correct parent.
    The experimental details are described in this section.
    Link-left baselines for these corpora are much lower: 33.8% and 27.9% for Bulgarian and Spanish respectively.
    Preliminary experiments showed that our word alignments were not always appropriate for syntactic transfer, even when they were correct for translation.
    For example, the English &#8220;bike/V&#8221; could be translated in French as &#8220;aller/V en v&#233;lo/N&#8221;, where the word &#8220;bike&#8221; would be alig
