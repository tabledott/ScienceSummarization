 conversion process on Section 23 of the Penn Treebank and evaluating the output against DepBank.
    As well as providing some measure of the effectiveness of the conversion, this method would also provide an upper bound for the Collins parser, giving the score that a perfect Penn Treebank parser would obtain on DepBank (given the conversion process).
    We perform such an evaluation for the CCG parser, with the surprising result that the upper bound on DepBank is only 84.8%, despite the considerable effort invested in developing the conversion process.
