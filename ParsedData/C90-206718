			In our model, word nodes corttrol the behavior of sense nodes by means of a differential neuron that prevents, for example, a sense node from becoming more activated than its master word node.
			Our experimentation with VLNNs has also shed light on the role of and need for various other parameters, uch as thresholds, decay, etc.
	
	
			The use of word relations implicitly encoded in machine-readable dictionaries, coupled with the neural network strategy, seems to offer a promising approach to WSD.
			This approach succeeds where the Lesk strategy fails, and it does not require determining and encoding microfeatures or other semantic information.
			The model is also more robust than the Lesk strategy, since it does not rely on the presence or absence of a particular word or words and can filter out some degree of "noise" (such as inclusion of some wrong lemmas due to lack of information about part-of-speech or occasional activation of misleading homographs).
			How- ever, there are clearly several
