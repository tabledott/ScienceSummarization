ation in categories and states.
    We use a 5-tuple (LF, LN, h, RN, RF) to represent the category of a dependency structure. h represents the head.
    LF and RF represent the farthest two children on the left and right sides respectively.
    Similarly, LN and RN represent the nearest two children on the left and right sides respectively.
    The three types of categories are as follows.
    Similar operations as described in Section 2.2 are used to keep track of the head and boundary child nodes which are then used to compute depLM scores in decoding.
    Due to the limit of space, we skip the details here.

    Discount on ill-formed dependency structures We have eight features in our system.
    The values of the first four features are accumulated on the rules used in a translation.
    Following (Chiang, 2005), we also use concatenation rules like X &#8212;* XX for backup.
    The 5th feature counts the number of concatenation rules used in a translation.
    In our system, we allow substit
