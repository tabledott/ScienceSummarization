put phrases to factors in output phrases.
			Generation steps map outputfactors within individual output words.
			To reiter ate: all translation steps operate on the phrase level, while all generation steps operate on the word level.
			Since all mapping steps operate on the same phrase segmentation of the input and output sentence into phrase pairs, we call these synchronous factored models.
