 ] ] SME =  [e l ,  [ r ,ea ,  [e l3  ]  ]  ] The main tasks in this step are to retrieve translation units and compare the source WD with retrieved translation units.
  To retrieve translation units quickly, we use some hashing techniques.
  There are two program to do the comparison task; one for English WDs and one for Japanese WDs.
  In comparison of Japanese WDs, the order of subtrees is not inlportant.
  To reduce the search space and the num- ber of candidates, we define replaceablity be- tween syntactic categories.
  If two nodes are replaceable, system makes only ~ replace- command.
  As a result, the the system does not make some matching expressions; e.g.
  [el, [d,e3] ,  [a,el ,   [e13]]  ] 4.2 Transfer in the transfer step, the system replaces every ID in the source matching expression with its corresponding ID.
  For example, SME = [el,[r,eS,[el3]]] TME = [j1,[r,jS,[j15]]] 4.3 Compos i t ion in the composition step, the system composes the target word-dependency tree according to the target matc
