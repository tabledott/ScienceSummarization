ences in different styles.
    But fortunately, we can automatically obtain a noisy form of the necessary paired-tree training data.
    A parser trained on the source corpus can parse the sentences in our target corpus, yielding trees (or more generally, probability distributions over trees) in the source style.
    We will then learn a tree transformation model relating these noisy source trees to our known trees in the target style.
    This model should enable us to convert the original large source corpus to target style, giving us additional training data in the target style.
    For many target languages, however, we do not have the luxury of a large parsed &#8220;source corpus&#8221; in the language, even one in a different style or domain as above.
    Thus, we may seek other forms of data to augment our small target corpus.
    One option would be to leverage unannotated text (McClosky et al., 2006; Smith and Eisner, 2007).
    But we can also try to transfer syntactic information from a parsed sour
