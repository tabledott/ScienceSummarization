blem we define the SubCategorization Feature (SCF).
    This is the subparse tree which includes the sub-categorization frame of the target verbal predicate.
    For example, Figure 3 shows the parse tree of the sentence &amp;quot;He flushed the pan and buckled his belt&amp;quot;.
    The solid line describes the SCF of the predicate flush, i.e.
    Fflush whereas the dashed line tailors the SCF of the predicate buckle, i.e.
    Fbuckle.
    Note that SCFs are features for predicates, (i.e. they describe predicates) whereas PAF characterizes predicate/argument pairs.
    Once semantic representations are defined, we need to design a kernel function to estimate the similarity between our objects.
    As suggested in Section 2 we can map them into vectors in Rn and evaluate implicitly the scalar product among them.
    Given the semantic objects defined in the previous section, we design a convolution kernel in a way similar to the parse-tree kernel proposed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002).
