ear in the size of a hypergraph representation of the dynamic program.
    Note that A and b specify a set of p linear constraints.
    We now give an explicit description of the resulting constraints for CFG parsing:7 similar constraints arise for other dynamic programming algorithms for parsing, for example the algorithms of Eisner (2000).
    The exact form of the constraints, and the fact that they are polynomial in number, is not essential for the formal results in this paper.
    However, a description of the constraints gives valuable intuition for the structure of the marginal polytope.
    The constraints are given in figure 2.
    To develop some intuition, consider the case where the variables &#181;r are restricted to be binary: hence each binary vector &#181; specifies a parse tree.
    The second constraint in Eq.
    5 specifies that exactly one rule must be used at the top of the tree.
    The set of constraints in Eq.
