simple combinatorical restrictions on the processed sets of source sentence positions.1 A set of four parameters is given to control the word reordering.
    Additionally, a set of four states is introduced to deal with grammatical reordering restrictions (e.g., for the translation direction German to English, the word order difference between the two languages is mainly due to the German verb group.
    In combination with the reordering restrictions, a data-driven beam search organization for the search procedure is proposed.
    A beam search pruning technique is conceived that jointly processes partial hypotheses according to two criteria: (1) The partial hypotheses cover the same set of source sentence positions, and (2) the partial hypotheses cover sets C of source sentence positions of equal cardinality.
    A partial hypothesis is said to cover a set of source sentence positions when exactly the positions in the set have already been processed in the search process.
