# is described in Appendix A.)
    We strongly recommend this figure of merit as the basis for best-first statistical parsers.
    The measurements presented here almost certainly underestimate the true benefits of this model.
    We restricted sentence length to a maximum of 30 words, in order to keep the number of edges in the exhaustive parse to a practical size; however, since the percentage of edges needed by the best-first parse decreases with increasing sentence length, we assume that the improvement would be even more dramatic for sentences longer than 30 words.
  
  
    We compute estimates of the inside probability for each proposed constituent incrementally as new constituents are added to the chart.
    Initially, # is set to 1 for each terminal symbol, since our input is given as a stream of tags, which are our terminals.
    When a new proposed constituent is added to the agenda, its [3 estimate is set to its current inside probability according to the constituents already in the chart.
