ter, on any structure previously generated elsewhere in the tree).
    Distance can be incorporated into the model by modifying the independence assumptions so that each modifier has a limited dependence on the previous modifiers: Here distancel and distancer are functions of the surface string below the previous modifiers.
    (See Figure 4 for illustration.)
    The distance measure is similar to that in Collins (1996), a vector with the following two elements: (1) Is the string of zero length?
    (2) Does the string contain a verb?
    The first feature allows the model to learn a preference for right-branching structures.
    The second feature6 allows the model to learn a preference for modification of the most recent verb.7 The tree depicted in Figure 2 illustrates the importance of the complement/adjunct distinction.
    It would be useful to identify IBM as a subject and Last week as an adjunct (temporal modifier), but this distinction is not made in the tree, as both NPs are in the same position8 (s
