tential predictors to user satisfaction.
    The PARADISE methodology consists of the following steps: Note that all of these steps are required to develop the performance function.
    However once the weights in the performance function have been solved for, user satisfaction ratings no longer need to be collected.
    Instead, predictions about user satisfaction can be made on the basis of the predictor variables, as illustrated in the application of PARADISE to subdialogues.
    Given the current state of knowledge, it is important to emphasize that researchers should be cautious about generalizing a derived performance function to other agents or tasks.
    Performance function estimation should be done iteratively over many different tasks and dialogue strategies to see which factors generalize.
    In this way, the field can make progress on identifying the relationship between various factors and can move towards more predictive models of spoken dialogue agent performance.
