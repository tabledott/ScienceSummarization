(T), using word alignments.
    Given two aligned word sequences set of scored alignments from the source language to the target language, where (wTj , wSaj, sj,aj) &#8712; AT |S is an alignment from the ajth source word to the jth target word, with score sj,aj &#8805; &#948;.2 We use the shorthand j &#8712; AT |S to denote those target words wTj that are aligned to some source word wSaj.
    Provided a clustering CS, we assign the target word t &#8712; VT to the cluster with which it is most often aligned: where [&#183;&#65533; is the indicator function.
    We refer to the cross-lingual clusters induced in this way as PROJECTED CLUSTERS.
    This simple projection approach has two potential drawbacks.
    First, it only provides a clustering of those target language words that occur in the word 2In our case, the alignment score corresponds to the conditional alignment probability p(wTj |wSa&#65533; ).
    All E-alignments are ignored and we use S = 0.95 throughout. aligned data, which is typically smaller t
