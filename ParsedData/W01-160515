econd and third sub-trees are then linked via an explanation-argumentative relation, after which, the fourth sub-tree is linked via an elaborationadditional relation.
    The resulting span [17-26] is finally attached to node [16] as an example satellite.
  
  
    A number of steps were taken to ensure the quality of the final discourse corpus.
    These involved two types of tasks: checking the validity of the trees and tracking inter-annotator consistency.
    Annotators reviewed each tree for syntactic and semantic validity.
    Syntactic checking involved ensuring that the tree had a single root node and comparing the tree to the document to check for missing sentences or fragments from the end of the text.
    Semantic checking involved reviewing nuclearity assignments, as well as choice of relation and level of attachment in the tree.
    All trees were checked with a discourse parser and tree traversal program which often identified errors undetected by the manual validation process.
    In the end, a
