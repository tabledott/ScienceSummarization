s in the appropriate alphabet) from a Dirichlet process with concentration parameter &#945; and base distribution Pe or Pf respectively: The base distributions Pe and Pf can encode prior knowledge about the properties of morphemes in each of the two languages, such as length and character n-grams.
    For simplicity, we use a geometric distribution over the length of the string with a final end-morpheme character.
    The distributions E and F which result from the respective Dirichlet processes place most of their probability mass on a small number of morphemes with the degree of concentration As before, the resulting distribution A will give non-zero probability to all abstract morphemes (e, f).
    The base distribution acts as a prior on such pairs.
    To define we can simply use a mixture of geometric distributions in the lengths of the component morphemes.
    However, if the languages &#163; and are related and the regular phonetic correspondences between the letter in the two alphabets are known, the
