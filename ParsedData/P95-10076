y, the use of a window provides a natural means of trading off the amount of data against its quality.
    When data sparseness undermines the system accuracy, a wider window may admit a sufficient volume of extra accurate data to outweigh the additional noise.
    There are at least four existing corpus-based algorithms proposed for syntactically analysing noun compounds.
    Only two of these have been subjected to evaluation, and in each case, no comparison to any of the other three was performed.
    In fact all authors appear unaware of the other three proposals.
    I will therefore briefly describe these algorithms.
    Three of the algorithms use what I will call the ADJACENCY MODEL, an analysis procedure that goes back to Marcus (1980, p253).
    Therein, the procedure is stated in terms of calls to an oracle which can determine if a noun compound is acceptable.
    It is reproduced here for reference: Given three nouns n1, n2 and n3: Only more recently has it been suggested that corpus statistics mi
