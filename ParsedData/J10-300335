ic equivalence.
    In the next section, we look at paraphrasing methods operating over data that does contain such explicit clues.
    It is also possible to generate paraphrastic phrase pairs from a parallel corpus where each component of the corpus is in the same language.
    Obviously, the biggest advantage of parallel corpora is that the sentence pairs are paraphrases almost by definition; they represent different renderings of the same meaning created by different translators making different lexical choices.
    In effect, they contain pairs (or sets) of sentences that are either semantically equivalent (sentential paraphrases) or have significant semantic overlap.
    Extraction of phrasal paraphrases can then be effected by extracting phrasal correspondences from a set of sentences that represent the same (or similar) semantic content.
    We present four techniques in this section that generate paraphrases by finding such correspondences.
    The first two techniques attempt to do so by relying, ag
