 templates, if INCIDENT.LOCATION is the same, the time of first report is before time of second report, the report sources are different, and at least one other slot differs in value, apply the contradiction operator to combine the templates.
    A summary operator encodes a means for linking information in two different templates.
    Often it results in the synthesis of new information.
    For example, a generalization may be formed from two independent facts.
    Alternatively, since we are summarizing reports written over time, highlighting how knowledge of the event changed is important and, therefore, summaries sometimes must identify differences between reports.
    A description of the operators we identified in our corpus follows, accompanied by an example of system output for each operator.
    Each example primarily summarizes two or three input templates, as this is the result of applying a single operator once.
    More complex summaries can be produced by applying multiple operators on the same
