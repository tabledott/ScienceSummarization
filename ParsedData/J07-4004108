 to enable a comparison with, for example, the Collins and Charniak parsers.
    The difficulty is that CCG derivations often have a different shape to the Penn Treebank analyses (coordination being a prime example) and reversing the mapping used by Hockenmaier to create CCGbank is a far from trivial task.
    There is some existing work comparing parser performance across formalisms.
    Briscoe and Carroll (2006) evaluate the RASP parser on the Parc Dependency Bank (DepBank; King et al. 2003).
    Cahill et al. (2004) evaluate an LFG parser, which uses an automatically extracted grammar, against DepBank.
    NVliyao and Tsujii (2004) evaluate their HPSG parser against PropBank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005).
    Kaplan et al. (2004) compare the Collins parser with the Parc LFG parser by mapping Penn Treebank parses into the dependencies of DepBank, claiming that the LFG parser is more accurate with only a slight reduction in speed.
    Preiss (2003) compares the parsers of Collins and Charniak, the gr
