			The result of the inter-annotator agreement test indicates that the writing style rather than the contents of the research abstracts is the source of the difficulty in tree annotation.
			Con trary to the expectation that the lack of domain knowledge causes a problem in annotation on attachments of modifiers, the number of cases where annotation of modifier attachment needs domain knowledge is small.
			This indicates that linguists can annotate most of syntactic structure without an expert level of domain knowledge.
			A major source of difficulty is coordination, especially the ones involving ellipsis.
			Coordination is reported to be difficult phenomena in an notation of different levels in the GENIA corpus (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), (Kim et al, 2003).
			In addition to the fact that this is the major source of inter-annotator agreement, the annotator often commented the coordinated structure as ?unsure?.
			The problem of coordination can be divided
