    A method for computationally interpreting metaphorical language would be useful for NLP.
    Although metaphorical word senses can be cataloged and treated as just another part of the lexicon, this kind of representation ignores regularities in polysemy.
    A conventional metaphor may have a very large number of linguistic manifestations, which makes it useful to model the metaphor&#8217;s underlying mechanisms.
    CorMet is not capable of interpreting any manifestation of conventional metaphor but is a step toward such a system.
    CorMet analyzes large corpora of domain-specific documents and learns the selectional preferences of the characteristic verbs of each domain.
    A selectional preference is a verb&#8217;s predilection for a particular type of argument in a particular role.
