rated were appropriate members of the cate gories sought.
			Riloff and Shepherd (1997) also give some credit for ?related words?
			(for example crash might be regarded as being related to the category vehicles).
			One problem with these techniques is the danger of ?infections?
			once any incorrect or out-of-category word has been admitted, theneighbours of this word are also likely to be ad mitted.
			In Section 4 we present an algorithmwhich goes some way towards reducing such in fections.
			The early results have been improved upon byRiloff and Jones (1999), where a ?mutual boot strapping?
			approach is used to extract words in particular semantic categories and expression patterns for recognising relationships betweenthese words for the purposes of information extraction.
			The accuracy achieved in this experiment is sometimes as high as 78% and is there fore comparable to the results reported in this paper.
			Another way to obtain word-senses directly from corpora is to use clustering algorithms o
