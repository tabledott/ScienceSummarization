ure 5, with only PP and VPB swapped from the English word order.
    These two parse trees can be represented as a single forest by sharing common subtrees such as NPB0, 1 and VPB3, 6, as shown in Figure 4.
    Such a forest has a structure of a hypergraph (Huang and Chiang, 2005), where items like NP0, 3 are called nodes, whose indices denote the source span, and combinations like we call hyperedges.
    We denote head(e) and tails(e) to be the consequent and antecedant items of hyperedge e, respectively.
    For example, We also denote BS(v) to be the set of incoming hyperedges of node v, being different ways of deriving it.
    For example, in Figure 4, BS(IP0, 6) = {e1, e2}.
    Like in tree-based extraction, we extract rules from a packed forest F in two steps: It turns out that the exact formulation developed for admissible set in the tree-based case can be applied to a forest without any change.
    The fragmentation step, however, becomes much more involved since we now face a choice of multiple parse
