 underlines indicating combinatory reduction and arrows indicating the direction of the application: Formally, a dependency is defined as a 4-tuple: hf f s ha , where hf is the head word of the functor,2 f is the functor category (extended with head and dependency information), s is the argument slot, and ha is the head word of the argument&#8212;for example, the following is the object dependency yielded by the first step of derivation (3): The head of the infinitival complement&#8217;s subject is identified with the head of the object, using the variable X. Unification then &#8220;passes&#8221; the head of the object to the subject of the infinitival, as in standard unification-based accounts of control.3 The kinds of lexical items that use the head passing mechanism are raising, auxiliary and control verbs, modifiers, and relative pronouns.
    Among the constructions that project unbounded dependencies are relativisation and right node raising.
