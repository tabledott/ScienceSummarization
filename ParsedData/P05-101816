es large scale automatic evaluation.
    The underlying assumption is that the original sentence order in the source document must be coherent, and so we should prefer models that rank it higher than other permutations.
    Since we do not know the relative quality of different permutations, our corpus includes only pairwise rankings that comprise the original document and one of its permutations.
    Given k original documents, each with n randomly generated permutations, we obtain k &#183; n (trivially) annotated pairwise rankings for training and testing.
    Using the technique described above, we collected data in two different genres: newspaper articles and accident reports written by government officials.
    The first collection consists of Associated Press articles from the North American News Corpus on the topic of natural disasters.
    The second includes narratives from the National Transportation Safety Board&#8217;s database2.
