 study demonstrates that the composite kernel is very effective for relation extraction.
    It also shows without the need for extensive feature engineering the composite kernel can not only capture most of the flat features used in the previous work but also exploit the useful syntactic structure features effectively.
    An advantage of our method is that the composite kernel can easily cover more knowledge by introducing more kernels.
    Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that our method outperforms the previous bestreported methods and significantly outperforms the previous kernel methods due to its effective exploration of various syntactic features.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    In Section 2, we review the previous work.
    Section 3 discusses our composite kernel.
    Section 4 reports the experimental results and our observations.
    Section 5 compares our method with the 1 Convolution kernels were proposed for a discrete structure by Haussler (1999) in the machine learnin
