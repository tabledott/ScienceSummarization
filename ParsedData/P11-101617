    As we mentioned in Section 1, since tweets are usually shorter and more ambiguous, it would be useful to take their contexts into consideration when classifying the sentiments.
    In this paper, we regard the following three kinds of related tweets as context for a tweet.
    Based on these three kinds of relations, we can construct a graph using the input tweet collection of a given target.
    As illustrated in Figure 1, each circle in the graph indicates a tweet.
    The three kinds of edges indicate being published by the same person (solid line), retweeting (dash line), and replying relations (round dotted line) respectively.
    If we consider that the sentiment of a tweet only depends on its content and immediate neighbors, we can leverage a graph-based method for sentiment classification of tweets.
    Specifically, the probability of a tweet belonging to a specific sentiment class can be computed with the following formula: Where c is the sentiment label of a tweet which belo
