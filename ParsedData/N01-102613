 no word segmentation (only raw characters) were used.
    For French, the increase from 59% F-measure on direct projection to 91% F-measure for the stand-alone induced bracketer shows that the training algorithm is able to generalize successfully from the very noisy raw projection data, distilling a reasonably accurate (and transferable) model of BaseNP structure from this high degree of noise.
  
  
    This paper has shown that automatically wordaligned bilingual corpora can be used to induce both successful part-of-speech taggers and noun-phrase bracketers.
    It has further illustrated that simple direct projection of POS and NP annotations across languages is very noisy, even when the word alignments have been manually corrected.
    Noise-robust data filtering and modeling procedures are shown to train effectively on this low-quality data.
    The resulting stand-alone part-of-speech taggers and BaseNP bracketers significantly outperform the raw direct projections on which they were trained.
