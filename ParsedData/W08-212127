 for non-atomic labels containing a gapping label.
    A dependency link wi &#8212;* wj is said to be projective if all words occurring between wi and wj in the surface word order are dominated by wi (where dominance is the transitive closure of the direct link relation).
    Nonprojective links are impossible to handle for the search procedures in many types of dependency parsers.
    It has been previously observed that the majority of dependencies in all languages are projective, and this is particularly true for English &#8211; in the complete corpus, only 4118 links (0.4%) are nonprojective.
    3312 sentences, or 7.6%, contain at least one nonprojective link.
    Even to make love, he says, you need experience; split noun phrases such as hold a hearing tomorrow on the topic; and all other types of nonprojective links.
    Lastly, Tables 8 and 9 summarizes statistics for semantic predicates and roles.
    Table 8 shows the number of non-support predicates with a given POS tag in the whole corpus (we used
