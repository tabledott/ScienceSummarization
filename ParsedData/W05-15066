 original design of the algorithm described below, we have become aware of two efforts that are very closely related to ours, one by Jime?nez and Marzal (2000) and another done in parallel to ours by Charniakand Johnson (2005).
			Jime?nez and Marzal present an al gorithm very similar to our Algorithm 3 (Sec.
			4.4) while Charniak and Johnson propose using an algorithm similar to our Algorithm 0, but with multiple passes to improve efficiency.
			They apply this method to the Charniak (2000)parser to get 50-best lists for reranking, yielding an im provement in parsing accuracy.
			Our work differs from Jime?nez and Marzal?s in thefollowing three respects.
			First, we formulate the parsing problem in the more general framework of hypergraphs (Klein and Manning, 2001), making it applica ble to a very wide variety of parsing algorithms, whereasJime?nez and Marzal define their algorithm as an exten sion of CKY, for CFGs in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)only.
			This generalization is not only of theoretical importan
