e criteria.
    In all experiments, we use the following six error criteria: of the target sentence, so that the WER measure alone could be misleading.
    To overcome this problem, we introduce as additional measure the position-independent word error rate (PER).
    This measure compares the words in the two sentences ignoring the word order. more detailed analysis, subjective judgments by test persons are necessary.
    Each translated sentence was judged by a human examiner according to an error scale from 0.0 to 1.0 (NieBen et al., 2000).
    &#8226; IER (information item error rate): The test sentences are segmented into information items.
    For each of them, if the intended information is conveyed and there are no syntactic errors, the sentence is counted as correct (NieBen et al., 2000).
    In the following, we present the results of this approach.
    Table 2 shows the results if we use a direct translation model (Eq.
    6).
    As baseline features, we use a normal word trigram language model an
