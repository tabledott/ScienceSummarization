  Clustering Polysemic Subcategorization Frame Distributions Semantically
  
    Previous research has demonstrated the utility of clustering in inducing semantic verb classes from undisambiguated corpus data.
    We describe a new approach which involves clustering subcategorizaframe distributions using the Information Bottleneck and nearest neighbour methods.
    In contrast to previous work, we particularly focus on clustering polysemic verbs.
    A novel evaluation scheme is proposed which accounts for the effect of polysemy on the clusters, offering us a good insight into the potential and limitations of semantically classifying
  
  
    Classifications which aim to capture the close relation between the syntax and semantics of verbs have attracted a considerable research interest in both linguistics and computational linguistics (e.g.
    (Jackendoff, 1990; Levin, 1993; Pinker, 1989; Dang et al., 1998; Dorr, 1997; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001)).
    While such classifications may not provide a means for
