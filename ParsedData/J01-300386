at our own work and work of others support our hypotheses concerning the importance of the relation between classes of verbs and the syntactic expression of argument structure in corpora.
    In light of this, it is instructive to evaluate our results in the context of other work that shares this view.
    Some related work requires either exact exemplars for acquisition, or external pre-compiled resources.
    For example, Dorr (1997) summarizes a number of automatic classification experiments based on encoding Levin's alternations directly, as symbolic properties of a verb (Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg 1995; Dorr and Jones 1996).
    Each verb is represented as the binary settings of a vector of possible alternations, acquired through a large corpus analysis yielding exemplars of the alternation.
    To cope with sparse data, the corpus information is supplemented by syntactic information obtained from the LDOCE and semantic information obtained from WordNet.
    This procedure classifies 95 unknown verbs wit
