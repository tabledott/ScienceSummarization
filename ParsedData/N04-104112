 two columns of numbers indicate the frequency and mutual information score for each feature respectively.
    In order to discover the characteristics of human naming conventions, we manually named 50 concepts discovered by CBC.
    For each concept, we extracted the relationships between the concept committee and the assigned label.
    We then added the mutual information scores for each extracted relationship among the 50 concepts.
    The top-4 highest scoring relationships are: To name a class, we simply search for these syntactic relationships in the signature of a concept.
    We sum up the mutual information scores for each term that occurs in these relationships with a committee of a class.
    The highest scoring term is the name of the class.
    For example, the top-5 scoring terms that occurred in these relationships with the signature of the concept represented by the committee {Curtis Joseph, John Vanbiesbrouck, Mike Richter, Tommy Salo} are: goalie 40.37 goaltender 33.64 goalkeeper 19.22 play
