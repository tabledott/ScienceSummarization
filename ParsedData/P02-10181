arch on parsing is that syntactic structure provides important information for semantic interpretation; hence syntactic parsing is an important first step in a variety of useful tasks.
    Broad coverage syntactic parsers with good performance have recently become available (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000), but these typically produce as output a parse tree that only encodes local syntactic information, i.e., a tree that does not include any &#8220;empty nodes&#8221;.
    (Collins (1997) discusses the recovery of one kind of empty node, viz., WH-traces).
    This paper describes a simple patternmatching algorithm for post-processing the output of such parsers to add a wide variety of empty nodes to its parse trees.
    Empty nodes encode additional information about non-local dependencies between words and phrases which is important for the interpretation of constructions such as WH-questions, relative clauses, etc.1 For example, in the noun phrase the man Sam likes the fact the man is interpreted as the direc
