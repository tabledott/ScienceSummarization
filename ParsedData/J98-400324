    In many cases it is possible to narrow things further&#8212;given the phrase &amp;quot;such-and-such, Arizona,&amp;quot; we can restrict our P(w) model to include only those cities and towns in Arizona.
    It is also interesting to consider transliteration for other languages.

    Furthermore, Arabic is usually written without vowels, so we must generate vowel sounds from scratch in order to produce correct English.
    Finally, it may be possible to embed phonetic-shift models inside speech recognizers, to explicitly adjust for heavy foreign accents.
