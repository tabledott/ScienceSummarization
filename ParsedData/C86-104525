f the gap, and a second one that is set to NIL if a gap has been found and that is then sent through all the const ituents to the r ight of the gap, unifying it on the way with potential gaps.
			It requires that information about the two special features be added to every rule.
			In PATR a preprocessor f rules adds this information for all rules in which the grammar writer did not include any gap threading information herself, e.g., for encoding island constraints.
			In a CUG that only contains two (or at least very ? few) rules, the first method of duplicating rules appears preferrable over the gap threading approach.
			Rules that propagate gap information might also include rules that permit parasitic gaps along the lines of Steedman's rules of functional substitution.
