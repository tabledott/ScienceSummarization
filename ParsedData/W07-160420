ing through the system undetected.
    Given this, we chose to set the threshold for the system so that it ensures high precision which in turn resulted in a recall figure (0.3) that leaves us much room for improvement.
    Our plans for future system development include: 1.
    Using more training data.
    Even a cursory examination of the training corpus reveals that there are many gaps in the data.
    Seven million seems like a large number of examples, but the selection of prepositions is highly dependent on the presence of other specific words in the context.
    Many fairly common combinations of Verb+Preposition+Noun or Noun+Preposition+Noun are simply not attested, even in a sizable corpus.
    Consistent with this, there is a strong correlation between the relative frequency of a preposition and the classifier&#8217;s ability to predict its occurrence in edited text.
    That is, prediction is better for prepositions that have many examples in the training set and worse for those with fewer example
