epts RECHARGEBATTERYCELL and 316LT, is available (see Hahn, Markert, and Strube [1996] for a detailed treatment of the resolution of inferables).
    In the case of nominal anaphors, a conceptual specialization relation has to be determined between the specific antecedent and the more general anaphoric expression, for example, between 316LT and Rechner, 'computer', in (1a) and (1c), respectively.
    Finally, the resolution of pronominal anaphors need not take conceptual constraints into account at all, but is restricted to grammatical constraints, as illustrated by the masculine gender of Rechner, 'computermascc (co-specifying with 316LT masc) and er 'Wmasc. in (1c) and (1d), respectively.
    Certainly, the types of phenomena we discuss cover only a limited range of anaphora.
    In particular, we leave out the whole range of quantificational studies on anaphora (in particular, the &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; issues related to generalized quantifiers), deictic phenomena, etc., which significantly complicate ma
