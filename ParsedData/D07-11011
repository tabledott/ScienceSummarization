er representations translate into higher complexity of the inference algorithms associated with the model.
			In dependency parsing, the basic first-order modelis defined by a decomposition of a tree into head modifier dependencies.
			Previous work extended this basic model to include second-order relations?i.e.dependencies that are adjacent to the main depen dency of the factor.
			Specifically, these approaches considered sibling relations of the modifier token (Eisner, 1996; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
			In this paper we extend the parsing model with other typesof second-order relations.
			In particular, we incorpo rate relations between the head and modifier tokens and the children of the modifier.
			One paradigmatic case where the relations we consider are relevant is PP-attachment.
			For example,in ?They sold 1,210 cars in the U.S.?, the ambigu ity problem is to determine whether the preposition ?in?
			(which governs ?the U.S.?)
			is modifying ?sold?
			or ?cars?, the former being correct in thi
