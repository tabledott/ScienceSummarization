at the first child does tend to carry information which is relevant throughout the sub-derivation for the node, and suggests that this child deserves a special status in a history representation.
    Interestingly, a smaller, although still substantial, degradation occurs when the previous history representation for the same node is replaced with its node label.
    We suspect that this is because the same information can be passed via its children&#8217;s history representations.
    Finally, not using any of these sources of induced history features (all labels) results in dramatically worse performance, with a 58% increase in F-measure error over using all three.
    One bias which is conspicuously absent from our parser design is a bias towards paying particular attention to lexical heads.
    The concept of lexical head is central to theories of syntax, and has often been used in designing hand-crafted history features (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).
    Thus it is reasonable to suppose that the incorpo
