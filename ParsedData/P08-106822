 of cluster-based features is fairly insensitive to the threshold value, whereas the performance of baseline features clearly degrades as the vocabulary size is reduced.
    In Table 8, we show the development-set performance of the first- and second-order parsers when features containing part-of-speech-based information are eliminated.
    Note that the performance obtained by using clusters without parts of speech is close to the performance of the baseline features.
  
  
    As mentioned earlier, our approach was inspired by the success of Miller et al. (2004), who demonstrated the effectiveness of using word clusters as features in a discriminative learning approach.
    Our research, however, applies this technique to dependency parsing rather than named-entity recognition.
    In this paper, we have focused on developing new representations for lexical information.
    Previous research in this area includes several models which incorporate hidden variables (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Koo and Collins, 200
