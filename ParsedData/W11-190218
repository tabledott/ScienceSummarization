 corpora and report B3 scores between 63 and 77 points.
    While the corpora used in (Haghighi and Klein, 2010) are different from the one in this shared task, our result of 68 B3 suggests that our system&#8217;s performance is competitive.
    In this task, our submissions in both the open and the closed track obtained the highest scores.
  
  
    In this work we showed how a competitive end-toend coreference resolution system can be built using only deterministic models (or sieves).
    Our approach starts with a high-recall mention detection component, which identifies mentions using only syntactic information and named entity boundaries, followed by a battery of high-precision deterministic coreference sieves, applied one at a time from highest to lowest precision.
    These models incorporate lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse information, and have access to document-level information (i.e., we share mention attributes across clusters as they are built).
    For this shared task, we extended o
