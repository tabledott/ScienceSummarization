an that of pronominal anaphors, the success rate for the whole anaphora resolution process is not distinctive enough for a proper evaluation of the functional constraints.
    The reason for this lies in the fact that nominal anaphors are far more constrained by conceptual criteria than pronominal ones.
    Thus, the chance of properly resolving a nominal anaphor, even when ranked at a lower position in the center lists, is greater than for pronominal anaphors.
    By shifting our evaluation criteria away from resolution success data to structural conditions reflecting the proper ordering of center lists (in particular, we focus on the most highly ranked item of the forward-looking centers), these criteria are intended to compensate for the high proportion of nominal anaphora in our sample.
    Table 5 enumerates the types of centering transitions we consider. of centering transitions between the utterances in the three test sets.
    The first column contains those generated by the naive approach (such a pro
