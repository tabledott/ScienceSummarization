sure into the n-gram language model over supertags.
    Decoder The decoder used in this work is Moses, a log-linear decoder similar to Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004), modified to accommodate supertag phrase probabilities and supertag language models.
  
  
    In this section we present a number of experiments that demonstrate the effect of lexical syntax on translation quality.
    We carried out experiments on the NIST open domain news translation task from Arabic into English.
    We performed a number of experiments to examine the effect of supertagging approaches (CCG or LTAG) with varying data sizes.
    Data and Settings The experiments were conducted for Arabic to English translation and tested on the NIST 2005 evaluation set.
    The systems were trained on the LDC Arabic&#8211;English parallel corpus; we use the news part (130K sentences, about 5 million words) to train systems with what we call the small data set, and the news and a large part of the UN data (2 million sentences, about 50 million words) fo
