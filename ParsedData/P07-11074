e divided into three categories, proper mentions (names), nominal mentions (descriptions), and pronominal mentions (pronouns).
    In section 3, we present a sequence of increasingly enriched models, motivating each from shortcomings of the previous.
    As we go, we will indicate the performance of each model on data from ACE 2004 (NIST, 2004).
    In particular, we used as our development corpus the English translations of the Arabic and Chinese treebanks, comprising 95 documents and about 3,905 mentions.
    This data was used heavily for model design and hyperparameter selection.
    In section 5, we present final results for new test data from MUC-6 on which no tuning or development was performed.
    This test data will form our basis for comparison to previous work.
    In all experiments, as is common, we will assume that we have been given as part of our input the true mention boundaries, the head word of each mention and the mention type (proper, nominal, or pronominal).
    For the ACE data sets, t
