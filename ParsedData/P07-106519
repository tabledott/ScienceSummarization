filtering on the actual error rate.
    Although, the false positive rate for the BF containing 2-grams, in addition, to 3-grams (filtered) is higher than the false positive rate of the unfiltered BF containing only 3-grams, the actual error rate of the former is lower for models with less memory.
    By testing for 2-grams prior to querying for the 3-grams, we can avoid performing some queries that may otherwise have incurred errors using the fact that a 3-gram cannot be present if one of its constituent 2-grams is absent.
  
  
    We are not the first people to consider building very large scale LMs: Kumar et al. used a four-gram LM for re-ranking (Kumar et al., 2005) and in unpublished work, Google used substantially larger ngrams in their SMT system.
    Deploying such LMs requires either a cluster of machines (and the overheads of remote procedure calls), per-sentence filtering (which again, is slow) and/or the use of some other lossy compression (Goodman and Gao, 2000).
    Our approach can complement
