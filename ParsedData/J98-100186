r in the hierarchy).
    However, despite the obvious appeal of this approach, it runs up against the same problem of the lack of an established, agreed-upon hierarchy of senses.
    Aware of this problem, Resnik and Yarowsky suggest creating the sense distance matrix based on results in experimental psychology such as Miller and Charles (1991) or Resnik (1995b).
    Even ignoring the cost of creating such a matrix, the psycholinguistic literature has made clear that these results are highly influenced by experimental conditions and the task imposed on the subjects (see, for example, Tabossi [1989, 1991], Rayner and Morris [1991]); in addition, it is not clear that psycholinguistic data can be of help in WSD aimed toward practical use in NLP systems.
    In general, WSD evaluation confronts difficulties of criteria that are similar to, but orders of magnitude greater than, those facing other tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, due to the elusive nature of semantic distinctions.
    It may be that at best we
