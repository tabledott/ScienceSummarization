ource sentences grows exponentially with the length of Y , so exhaustive search is probably infeasible.
    TAGs provide a systematic way of formalizing the channel model, and their polynomialtime dynamic programming parsing algorithms can be used to search for likely repairs, at least when used with simple language models like a bigram language model.
    In this paper we first identify the 20 most likely analysis of each sentence using the TAG channel model together with a bigram language model.
    Then each of these analysis is rescored using the TAG channel model and a syntactic parser based language model.
    The TAG channel model&#8217;s analysis do not reflect the syntactic structure of the sentence being analyzed; instead they encode the crossed dependencies of the speech repairs.
    If we want to use TAG dynamic programming algorithms to efficiently search for repairs, it is necessary that the intersection (in language terms) of the TAG channel model and the language model itself be describable by
