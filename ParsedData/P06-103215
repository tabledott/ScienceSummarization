om the table, that given sufficient data, SMT techniques can successfully offer corrections for a significant percentage of cases of the phenomena in question.
    Table 2 shows some sample inputs together with successful corrections made by the system.
    Table 3 illustrates a case where two valid corrections are found in the 5-best ranked translations; intervening candidates were identical with the top-ranked candidate.
    Table 1 also indicates that errors associated with the SMT system itself are encouragingly few.
    A small number of errors in word order were found, one of which resulted in a severely garbled sentence in the 45K data set.
    In general, the percentage of this type of error declines consistently with growth of the training data size.
    Linearity of the training data may play a role, since the sentence pairs differ by only a few words.
    On the whole, however, we expect the system&#8217;s order model to benefit from more training data.
    The most frequent single class of newly i
