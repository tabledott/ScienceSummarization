r operating on the remaining pair of tapes.
    A simple algorithm exists for constructing the transition diagram for this composite machine given those of the original pair.
    By repeated application of this algorithm, it is therefore possible to reduce a cascade of transducers, each linked to the next by a common tape, to a single transducer which accepts exactly the same pair of tapes as was accepted by the original cascade as a whole.
    From these two facts together, it follows that an arbitrary ordered set of rewriting rules can be modeled by a finite-state transducer which can be automatically constructed from them and which serves as well for analyzing surface forms as for generating them from underlying lexical strings.
    A transducer obtained from an ordered set of rules in the way just outlined is a two level device in the sense that it mediates directly between lexical and surface forms without ever constructing the intermediate forms that would arise in the course of applying the original ru
