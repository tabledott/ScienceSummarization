na (particularly the distance features) may fail to be modeled correctly given treebanks with different annotation styles.
    This may be an important point to bear in mind when applying the models to other treebanks or other languages.
    In particular, it may be important to perform transformations on some structures in treebanks with different annotation styles.
    &#8226; Section 7.4 gave evidence showing the importance of the models&#8217; ability to break down the context-free rules in the treebank, thereby generalizing to produce new rules on test examples.
    Table 12 shows that precision on section 0 of the treebank decreases from 89.0% to 87.0% and recall decreases from 88.8% to 87.9% when the model is restricted to produce only those context-free rules seen in training data.

    Although certainly similar to Charniak&#8217;s model, the three models in this article have some significant differences, which are identified in section 8.1.
