large corpus size.
    This explains the rather low coverage on the Canadian Hansards task for both the nonmonotone and the monotone search.
    For the Xerox task, the nonmonotone search can produce 75.1% of the sentence pairs whereas the monotone can produce 65.3%.
    The ratio of the two numbers measures how much the system deteriorates by using the monotone search and will be called the degree of monotonicity.
    For the Xerox task, the degree of monotonicity is 87.0%.
    This means the monotone search can produce 87.0% of the sentence pairs that can be produced with the nonmonotone search.
    We see that for the SpanishEnglish Xerox task and for the French-English Canadian Hansards task, the degree of monotonicity is rather high.
    For the German-English Verbmobil task it is significantly lower.
    This may be caused by the rather free word order in German and the long range reorderings that are necessary to translate the verb group.
    It should be pointed out that in practice the monotone searc
