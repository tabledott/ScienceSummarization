 are discussed later in this section.
    The resulting F measures were almost the same for all heuristics, but there was clearly an increase in recall with a loss of precision when enlarging the window size.&amp;quot; The recency heuristic had the best recall, but the lowest precision, although not much lower than the others.
    The best precision was achieved with a one-sentence window, and recall was not dramatically affected, but this only happened because the window size constraint was relaxed.
    To show what happens when a strict version of the window-based segmentation approach is used, consider Table 6.
    (Strict segmentation means that the system only considers those antecedents that are inside the sentence window for resolving a description, with no exceptions.)
    As the table shows, this form of segmentation results in higher precision, but has a strong negative effect on recall.
    The overall F values are all worse than for the heuristics in Table 5.
    Finally, we tried a combination of
