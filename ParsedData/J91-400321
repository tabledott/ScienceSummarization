the door.
    Lakoff (1970), Jackendoff (1972), and others have suggested that the sense in 21c must incorporate something like cause-to-become-not-open for its meaning.
    Similarly, a verb such as give specifies a transfer from one person to another, e.g., cause-to-have.
    Most decomposition theories assume a set of primitives and then operate within this set to capture the meanings of all the words in the language.
    These approaches can be called exhaustive since they assume that with a fixed number of primitives, complete definitions of lexical meaning can be given.
    In the sentences in 21, for example, close is defined in terms of the negation of a primitive, open.
    Any method assuming a fixed number of primitives, however, runs into some well-known problems with being able to capture the full expressiveness of natural language.
    These problems are not, however, endemic to all decomposition approaches.
    I would like to suggest that lexical (and conceptual) decomposition is possible if i
