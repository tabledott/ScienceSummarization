of slots.
			However, I have not yet seen a convincing example of nesting constraints among subcategorization and long-distance dependencies.
			Therefore, I consider the question of the appropriate place for encoding long-distance dependencies still open.
			A last remark on long-distance dependencies.
			In a unification based system like PATR it is not trivial to ensure that gap information is passed up from one daughter const i tuent only when a rule is applied.
			There are two ways to enforce this constraint.
			The first one involves a multipl ication of rules.
			For a binary rule A --&gt; B C, for instance, one could introduce three new rules, one of which does not do any gaP passing, another one the passing of a gap from B to A, and the third the passing of a gap from C to A. PATR uses a little more elegant method which has been first suggested by Fernando Pereira.
			Two features are threaded through every tree, one of which carries a gap up a tree, passing through all the constituents o the left o
