arch procedure.
    For each combination of FT and T, the beam search procedure considers all possible combinations of fill operations, while pruning partial theories that fall beneath the threshold imposed by the beam limit.
    The surviving theories are then combined with the conditional word probabilities P(W I 7), computed during the parsing model.
    The final result of these steps is the n-best set of candidate pre-discourse meanings, scored according to the measure P(Ms,T) P(W IT) .
  
  
    The discourse module computes the most probable postdiscourse meaning of an utterance from its pre-discourse meaning and the discourse history, according to the measure: Because pronouns can usually be ignored in the ATIS domain, our work does not treat the problem of pronominal reference.
    Our probability model is instead shaped by the key discourse problem of the ATIS domain, which is the inheritance of constraints from context.
    This inheritance phenomenon, similar in spirit to one-anaphora, is illustra
