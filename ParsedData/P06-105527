ny classical distinctions not specifically mentioned or modeled in previous work.
    For example, the whdeterminers (WDT) split into one class for that and another for which, while the wh-adverbs align by reference type: event-based how and why vs. entity-based when and where.
    The possesive particle (POS) has one class for the standard &#8217;s, but another for the plural-only apostrophe.
    As a final example, the cardinal number nonterminal (CD) induces various categories for dates, fractions, spelled-out numbers, large (usually financial) digit sequences, and others.
    Analyzing the splits of phrasal nonterminals is more difficult than for lexical categories, and we can merely give illustrations.
    We show some of the top productions of two categories in Table 3.
    A nonterminal split can be used to model an otherwise uncaptured correlation between that symbol&#8217;s external context (e.g. its parent symbol) and its internal context (e.g. its child symbols).
    A particularly clean example of
