ty recognition In work by Wiebc, Bruce, and OHara (Wiebe ct al., 1999; Bruce and Wicbe, 2000), a corpus of 1,001 sen- tences 3 of the Wall Street Journal TreeBank Corpus 3Conlpoutld sentences were manually segmented into their con- juncts, and each conjtmct treated as a scparale sentence.
  302 (Marcus et al., 1993) was nlanually annotated with sub- jeciivity chlssifications.
  Specifically, each sentence was assigned a subjective or objective classitication, accord- ing to concensus lags derived by a slalistical analysis of lhe chisses assigned by three human judges (see (Wiebe et al., 1999) for further infornmtion).
  The total nulnber of subjective sentences in lhe data is 486, and the total number of objeclive sentences i 515.
  Bruce and Wiebe (2000) performed a statistical anal- ysis of the assigned classitications, linding lhat ac(iec- tivcs are statistically signilicantly and positively corre- lated with subjective sentences in the corpus on the basis (, .
