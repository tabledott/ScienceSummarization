 in Equation 1 provides a mechanism to capture semantic similarity between lexical items which allows us to identify chairman+resign and ceo+quit as the most similar pair of patterns.
    It is important to choose appropriate values for the elements of W. We chose to make use of the research that has concentrated on computing similarity between pairs of lexical items using the WordNet hierarchy (Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Patwardhan et al., 2003).
    We experimented with several of the measures which have been reported in the literature and found that the one proposed by Jiang and Conrath (1997) to be the most effective.
    The similarity measure proposed by Jiang and Conrath (1997) relies on a technique developed by Resnik (1995) which assigns numerical values to each sense in the WordNet hierarchy based upon the amount of information it represents.
    These values are derived from corpus counts of the words in the synset, either directly or via the hyponym relation and are used to derive the
