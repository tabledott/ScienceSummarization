fts&#8212;as well as three new edit operations: Stem Matches, Synonym Matches and Phrase Substitutions.
    TERp identifies words in the hypothesis and reference that share the same stem using the Porter stemming algorithm (Porter, 1980).
    Two words are determined to be synonyms if they share the same synonym set according to WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
    Sequences of words in the reference are considered to be paraphrases of a sequence of words in the hypothesis if that phrase pair occurs in the TERp phrase table.
    The TERp phrase table is discussed in more detail in Section 4.
    With the exception of the phrase substitutions, the cost for all other edit operations is the same regardless of what the words in question are.
    That is, once the edit cost of an operation is determined via optimization, that operation costs the same no matter what words are under consideration.
    The cost of a phrase substitution, on the other hand, is a function of the probability of the paraphrase and the number of
