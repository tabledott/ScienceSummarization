un phrases, instead leaving them flat.
    This significantly simplified and sped up the manual annotation process.
    Therefore, any system trained on Penn Treebank data will be unable to model the syntactic and semantic structure inside base-NPs.
    The following NP is an example of the flat structure of base-NPs within the Penn Treebank:
  
  
    Air Force is a specific entity and should form a separate constituent underneath the NP, as in our new annotation scheme: We use NML to specify that Air Force together is a nominal modifier of contract.
    Adding this annotation better represents the true syntactic and semantic structure, which will improve the performance of downstream NLP systems.
    Our main contribution is a gold-standard labelled bracketing for every ambiguous noun phrase in the Penn Treebank.
    We describe the annotation guidelines and process, including the use of named entity data to improve annotation quality.
    We check the correctness of the corpus by measuring interannotator a
