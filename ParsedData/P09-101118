the coIn the annotated data, each text w has been divided into a set of lines.
    These lines correspond to clauses in the weather domain and sentences in the Robocup and NFL domains.
    Each line is annotated with a (possibly empty) set of records.
    Let A be the gold set of these line-record alignment pairs.
    To evaluate a learned model, we compute the Viterbi segmentation and alignment (argmaxr,f,c p(r, f, c  |w, s)).
    We produce a predicted set of line-record pairs A' by aligning a line to a record ri if the span of (the utterance corresponding to) ri overlaps the line.
    The reason we evaluate indirectly using lines rather than using utterances is that it is difficult to annotate the segmentation of text into utterances in a simple and consistent manner.
    We compute standard precision, recall, and F1 of A' with respect to A.
    Unless otherwise specified, performance is reported on all scenarios, which were also used for training.
    However, we did not tune any hyperparameters, but rath
