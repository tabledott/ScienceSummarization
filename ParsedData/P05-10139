 we have performed experiments with three different encoding schemes (plus a baseline), which are described schematically in Table 1.
    The baseline simply retains the original labels for all arcs, regardless of whether they have been lifted or not, and the number of distinct labels is therefore simply the number n of distinct dependency types.2 In the first encoding scheme, called Head, we use a new label d&#8593;h for each lifted arc, where d is the dependency relation between the syntactic head and the dependent in the non-projective representation, and h is the dependency relation that the syntactic head has to its own head in the underlying structure.
    Using this encoding scheme, the arc from je to Z in Figure 2 would be assigned the label AuxP&#8593;Sb (signifying an AuxP that has been lifted from a Sb).
    In the second scheme, Head+Path, we in addition modify the label of every arc along the lifting path from the syntactic to the linear head so that if the original label is p the new label is p&
