).
    In particular, we make use of the principles of type coercion and qualia structure.
    This model of semantic knowledge associated with words is based on a system of generative devices that is able to recursively define new word senses for lexical items in the language.
    These devices and the associated dictionary make up a generative lexicon, where semantic information is distributed throughout the lexicon to all categories.
    The general framework assumes four basic levels of semantic description: argument structure, qualia structure, lexical inheritance structure, and event structure.
    Connecting these different levels is a set of generative devices that provide for the compositional interpretation of words in context.
    The most important of these devices is a semantic transformation called type coercion&#8212;analogous to coercion in programming languages&#8212;which captures the semantic relatedness between syntactically distinct expressions.
