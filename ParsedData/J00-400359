uristics 2 and 3 is equivalent to heuristic 3 alone, since rule 3 subsumes rule 2.)
    Heuristic 2 and 3 alone are counterintuitive and indeed give the poorest results; however, the impact is greater on recall than precision, which suggests that the introduction of new information in noun modification is not very frequent.
    One of the problems with our premodifier heuristics is that although a difference in premodification usually indicates noricoreference, as for the company's abrasive segment and the engineering materials segment, there are a few cases in our corpus in which coreferent descriptions have totally different premodification from their antecedents, as in (42) the pixie-like clarinetist .
    .
    . the soft-spoken clarinetist.
    These cases would be hard even for a system using real commonsense reasoning, since often the information in the premodifier is new; we consider these examples one of the best arguments for including in the system a focus-tracking mechanism along the lines of Sidn
