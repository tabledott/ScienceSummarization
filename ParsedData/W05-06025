			Syntactic structure provides information of how the parts should be composed.
			Ambiguities arise in both syntactic structure and the semantic interpretation of words and phrases.
			By in tegrating syntax and semantics in a single statisticalparser that produces an SAPT, we can use both se mantic information to resolve syntactic ambiguitiesand syntactic information to resolve semantic ambi guities.
			In a SAPT, each internal node in the parse tree is annotated with a semantic label.
			Figure 1 showsthe SAPT for a simple sentence in the CLANG do main.
			The semantic labels which are shown afterdashes are concepts in the domain.
			Some type con cepts do not take arguments, like team and unum (uniform number).
			Some concepts, which we refer to as predicates, take an ordered list of arguments,like player
