For open texts, tile morphological nalyzer achieved 95.1% recall and 94.6% precision for the top candidate, and 97.8% recall and 73.2% precision for the 5 best candidates.
  This performance is very encouraging, and is comparable to the state-of-the-art stochastic tagger for English [2-4, 10, 11].
  Since the segmentation accuracy of the proposed sys- tem is relatively high (97.7% recall and 97.2% precision for the top candidate) compared to the morphologi- cal analysis accuracy, it is likely that we can improve the part of speech assignment accuracy by refining the statistically-based tagging model.
  We find a fair num- ber of tagging errors happened in conjugation forms.
  We assume that this is caused by the fact that the Japanese tag set used in tile ATR.
  Corpus is not de- tailed enough to capture the complicated Japanese verb morphology.
