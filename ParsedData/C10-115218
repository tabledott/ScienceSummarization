			There are two kinds of nodes in the training tree: data nodes in rectangles and operation nodes in circles.
			Data nodes contain data and operation nodes execute operations.
			The training is a supervised learning 1357 process with the parse tree of c as input and the two strings s1 and s2 as the desired output.
			root stores the parse tree of c and also s1 and s2.
			sp, ro, mp and sub are splitting, reordering, mapping and substitution operations.
			sp res and mp res store the results of sp and mp.
			In our example, sp splits the parse tree into two parse trees pt1 and pt2 (Fig.
			3).
			sp res1 contains pt1 and s1.
			sp res2 contains pt2 and s2.
			Then dp, ro and mp are iteratively applied to each non-terminal node at each level of pt1 and pt2 from top to down.
