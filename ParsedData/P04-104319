re the results with previous literature works, e.g.
    (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003).
    For the evaluation of SVMs, we used the default regularization parameter (e.g., C = 1 for normalized kernels) and we tried a few costfactor values (i.e., j E {0.1,1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) to adjust the rate between Precision and Recall.
    We chose parameters by evaluating SVM using Kp3 kernel over the validation-set.
    Both A (see Section 3.3) and -y parameters were evaluated in a similar way by maximizing the performance of SVM using KPAF and -y KSCF tively.
    These parameters were adopted also for all the other kernels.
    To study the impact of our structural kernels we firstly derived the maximal accuracy reachable with standard features along with polynomial kernels.
    The multi-class accuracies, for PropBank and FrameNet using Kpd with d = 1,.., 5, are shown in Figure 5.
    We note that (a) the highest performance is reached for d = 3, (b) for PropBank our maximal accur
