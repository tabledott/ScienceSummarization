enerated from this structure Interlingua-based systems on the other hanc require that a source string has to be analyzec into a structure that is identical to a structure from which a target string has to be generated.
    Without further constraints, each of these approaches could in principle be successful.
    Ar interlingual representation could be devised for example, to contain whatever informatior is needed to make all the appropriat( distinctions for all the sentences in all the languages under consideration.
    Similarly, E transfer structure could be arbitraril3 configured to allow for the contrastive analysi: of any two particular languages.
    It seem: unlikely that systems based on such ar undisciplined arrangement of information wil ever succeed in practice.
    Indeed, most translation researchers have based theii systems on representations that have SOMI more general and independent motivation The levels of traditional linguistic analysi: (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics discourse,
