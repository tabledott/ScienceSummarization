riments with different models and parameter settings from Herda&#711;gdelen, Erk, and Baroni (2009) (whose corpus is about half the size of ours) and Pad&#180;o and Lapata (2007) (who use a much smaller corpus).
    For the latter, we also report the best result they obtain when using cosine as the similarity measure (cosDV-07).
    Overall, the TypeDM result is in line with the state of the art, given the size of the input corpus, and the fact that we did not perform any tuning.
    Following Pad&#180;o, Pad&#180;o, and Erk (2007) we used the approximate test proposed by Raghunathan (2003) to compare the correlations with the human ratings of sets of models (this is only possible for the models we developed, as the test requires computation of correlation coefficients across models).
    The test suggests that the difference in correlation with human ratings between TypeDM and our second best model, Win, is significant (Q = 4.55, df = 0.23, p &lt; 0.01).
    On the other hand, there is no significant differe
