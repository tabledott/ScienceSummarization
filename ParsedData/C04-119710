ent, target word parent is an ancestor of predicate, predicate parent is an ancestor of target word, or otherwise.Because each argument consists of a single be ginning and a single ending, these classifiers can be used to construct a set of potential arguments (by combining each predicted begin with each predicted end after it of the same type).
			Although this phase identifies typed arguments (i.e. labeled with argument types), the second phasewill re-score each phrase using phrase-based classifiers ? therefore, the goal of the first phase is sim ply to identify non-typed phrase candidates.
			In thistask, we achieves 98.96% and 88.65% recall (overall, without verb) on the training and the develop ment set, respectively.
			Because these are the onlycandidates passed to the second phase, the final sys tem performance is upper-bounded by 88.65%.
			3.3 Second Phase: Argument Classification.
			The second phase of our system assigns the final argument classes to (a subset) of the argument can didates supplied
