ed as follows.
    Section 2 gives an overview of some of the things that can influence contextual polarity.
    In Section 3, we describe our corpus and present our annotation scheme and inter-annotator agreement study for marking contextual polarity.
    Sections 4 and 5 describe the lexicon used in our experiments and how the contextual polarity annotations are used to determine the gold-standard tags for instances from the lexicon.
    In Section 6, we consider what kind of performance can be expected from a simple, prior-polarity classifier.
    Section 7 describes the features that we use for recognizing contextual polarity, and our experiments and results are presented in Section 8.
    In Section 9 we discuss related work, and we conclude in Section 10.
