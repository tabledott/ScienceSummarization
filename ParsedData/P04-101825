n from the MUC format to the ACE format.
  
  
    There exists a large body of literature on the topic of coreference resolution.
    We will compare this study with some relevant work using machine learning or statistical methods only.
    Soon et al. (2001) uses a decision tree model for coreference resolution on the MUC6 and MUC7 data.
    Leaves of the decision tree are labeled with &#8220;link&#8221; or &#8220;not-link&#8221; in training.
    At test time, the system checks a mention against all its preceding mentions, and the first one labeled with &#8220;link&#8221; is picked as the antecedent.
    Their work is later enhanced by (Ng and Cardie, 2002) in several aspects: first, the decision tree returns scores instead of a hard-decision of &#8220;link&#8221; or &#8220;not-link&#8221; so that Ng and Cardie (2002) is able to pick the &#8220;best&#8221; candidate on the left, as opposed the first in (Soon et al., 2001); Second, Ng and Cardie (2002) expands the feature sets of (Soon et al., 2001).
