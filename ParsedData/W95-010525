   As a baseline, ten runs were done selecting senses by random choice, with the average percent correct being 34.8%, standard deviation 3.58.
    As an upper bound, Judge 2 was correct on 65.7% of those test instances.
    The disambiguation algorithm shows considerable progress toward this upper bound, with 58.6% correct.
    For Judge 2, there were 86 test instances with sufficiently high confidence to be considered.
    As a baseline, ten runs were done selecting senses by random choice, with the average percent correct being 33.3%, standard deviation 3.83.
    As an upper bound, Judge 1 was correct on 68.6% of those test instances.
    Again, the disambiguation algorithm performs well, with 60.5% correct.
  
  
    The results of the evaluation are extremely encouraging, especially considering that disambiguating word senses to the level of fine-grainedness found in WordNet is quite a bit more difficult than disambiguation to the level of homographs (Hearst, 1991; Cowie et al., 1992).
    A note worth ad
