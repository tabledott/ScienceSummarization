e entire database is viewed as a graph, we currently leverage and enforce only local consistency.
    It would be useful to enforce global consistency, e.g.
    V1 stronger-than V2, and V2 strongerthan V3 indicates that V1 stronger-than V3, which may be leveraged to identify additional relations or inconsistent relations (e.g.
    V3 stronger-than V1).
    Finally, as discussed in Section 5.3, entailment relations may be derivable by processing the complete graph of the identified semantic relation.
  
  
    We have demonstrated that certain fine-grained semantic relations between verbs are present on the Web, and are extractable with a simple patternbased approach.
    In addition to discovering relations identified in WordNet, such as opposition and enablement, we obtain strong results on strength relations (for which no wide-coverage resource is available).
    On a set of 29,165 associated verb pairs, experimental results show an accuracy of 65.5% in assigning similarity, strength, antonymy, enablement,
