NP N\N ?x.flight(x) bos ?f.?x.f(x) ?to(x, new york) TR N\N ?f.?x.f(x) ? from(x, bos) &lt; N ?f.?x.flight(x) ? from(x, bos) &lt; N ?x.flight(x) ? to(x, new york) ? from(x, bos) The second rule we consider is the null-head type shifting rule: N\N : f ? N : f(?x.true) (TN)This rule allows parses of fragments such as Amer ican Airlines from New York, where there is again aword that is in some sense missing (it is straightfor ward to derive a parse for American Airlines flights from New York).
			The analysis would be as follows: American Airlines from New York N/N N\N ?f.?x.f(x) ? airline(x, aa) ?f.?x.f(x) ? from(x, new york) TN N ?x.from(x, new york) &gt; N ?x.airline(x, aa) ? from(x, new york)The new rule effectively allows the preposi tional phrase from New York to type-shift to an entry with syntactic type N and semantics ?x.from(x, new york), representing the set of all things from New York.7 We introduce a single additional feature which counts the number of times this rule is used.
