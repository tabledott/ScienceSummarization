  Word Sense Disambiguation Improves Statistical Machine Translation
  
    Recent research presents conflicting evidence on whether word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems can help to improve the performance of statistical machine translation (MT) systems.
    In this paper, we successfully integrate a state-of-the-art WSD system into a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based MT system, Hiero.
    We show for the first time that integrating a WSD system improves the performance of a state-ofthe-art statistical MT system on an actual translation task.
    Furthermore, the improvement is statistically significant.
  
  
    Many words have multiple meanings, depending on the context in which they are used.
    Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of determining the correct meaning or sense of a word in context.
    WSD is regarded as an important research problem and is assumed to be helpful for applications such as machine translation (MT) and information retrieval.
