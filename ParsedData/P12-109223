			Thisdataset requires models to examine context when de termining word meaning.
			Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we collected 10 human similarity ratings for each pair, as Snow et al.
			(2008) found that 10 non-expert annotators can achieve very close inter-annotator agreement with expert raters.
			To ensure worker quality, we only allowed workers with over 95% approval rate to work on our task.
			Furthermore, we discarded all ratings by a worker if he/she entered scores out ofthe accepted range or missed a rating, signaling low quality work.
			We obtained a total of 2,003 word pairs and their sentential contexts.
			The word pairs consist of 1,712 unique words.
			Of the 2,003 word pairs, 1328 are noun-noun pairs, 399 verb-verb, 140 verb-noun, 97adjective-adjective, 30 noun-adjective, and 9 verb adjective.
			241 pairs are same-word pairs.
