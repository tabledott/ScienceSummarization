nk are better than Centroid in multi-document generic text summarization.
    However, it is hard to say that Degree and LexPageRank are significantly different from each other.
    This is an indication that Degree may already be a good enough measure to assess the centrality of a node in the similarity graph.
    Considering the relatively low complexity of degree centrality, it still serves as a plausible alternative when one needs a simple implementation.
    Computation of Degree can be done on the fly as a side product of LexPageRank just before the power method is applied on the similarity graph.
    Another interesting observation in the results is the effect of threshold.
    Most of the top ROUGE scores belong to the runs with the threshold , and the runs with threshold are worse than the others most of the time.
    This is due to the information loss in the similarity graphs as we move to higher thresholds as discussed in Section 3.
    As a comparison with the other summarization systems, we pres
