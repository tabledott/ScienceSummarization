 as input to the Co-Training algorithm.
    In addition, we plan to explore the following points that bear on understanding the nature of the Co-Training learning algorithm: &#8226; The contribution of the dictionary of trees extracted from the unlabeled set is an issue that we would like to explore in future experiments.
    Ideally, we wish to design a co-training method where no such information is used from the unlabeled set.
    &#8226; The relationship between co-training and EM bears investigation.
    (Nigam and Ghani, 2000) is a study which tries to separate two factors: (1) The gradient descent aspect of EM vs. the iterative nature of co-training and (2) The generative model used in EM vs. the conditional independence between the features used by the two models that is exploited in co-training.
    Also, EM has been used successfully in text classification in combination of labeled and unlabeled data (see (Nigam et al., 1999)).
    &#8226; In our experiments, unlike (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) we do n
