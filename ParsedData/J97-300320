m another entry in the lexicon, its frequency count (f) is incremented.
    Then the infrequent rules with f &lt; 19 are eliminated from the endingguessing rule set.
    After applying the A and v operations to the training lexicon, we obtained rule collections of 40,000-50,000 entries.
    Filtering out the rules with frequency counts of 1 reduced the collections to 5,000-7,000 entries.
    Of course, not all acquired rules are equally good at predicting word classes: some rules are more accurate in their guesses and some rules are more frequent in their application.
    For every rule acquired, we need to estimate whether it is an effective rule worth retaining in the working rule set.
    To do so, we perform a statistical experiment as follows: we take each rule from the extracted rule sets, one by one, take each wordtype from the training lexicon and guess its Pos-class using the rule, if the rule is applicable to the word.
    For example, if a guessing rule strips off a particular suffix and a current
