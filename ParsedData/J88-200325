sic category&#8212; by which we mean the type assigned in the lexicon and inherited by the proposition in the absence of any coercion&#8212;is that of a process.
    As a result, (30) carries no implication that Sue finished playing the sonata: A similar transition path is needed to make sense of examples like the following, in which a culmination is coerced to become a point, and then in turn coerced to become a process by being iterated: The aspectual network would wrongly predict the existence of afor-adverbial paradox, parallel to the imperfective paradox, if for-adverbials were permitted to freely coerce culminated processes (and hence culminations) to be (not necessarily completed) processes.
    The theory might seem to wrongly predict that (a) below would mean roughly the same as (b): However, it is hard to find a context in which (a) means anything at all.
    The reason for this lies in the way English syntax and morphology control coercion in the aspectual transition network.
