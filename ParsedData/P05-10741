 the production of paraphrases allows for the creation of more varied and fluent text (Iordanskaja et al., 1991).
    In multidocument summarization the identification of paraphrases allows information repeated across documents to be condensed (McKeown et al., 2002).
    In the automatic evaluation of machine translation, paraphrases may help to alleviate problems presented by the fact that there are often alternative and equally valid ways of translating a text (Pang et al., 2003).
    In question answering, discovering paraphrased answers may provide additional evidence that an answer is correct (Ibrahim et al., 2003).
    In this paper we introduce a novel method for extracting paraphrases that uses bilingual parallel corpora.
    Past work (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Ibrahim et al., 2003) has examined the use of monolingual parallel corpora for paraphrase extraction.
    Examples of monolingual parallel corpora that have been used are multiple translations of cl
