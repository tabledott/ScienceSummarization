    Looking at these two problems in detail is useful for understanding the differences between the coefficients.
    The difference between &#960; and &#945; on the one hand and &#954; on the other hand lies in the interpretation of the notion of chance agreement, whether it is the amount expected from the the actual distribution of items among categories (&#960;) or from individual coder priors (&#954;).
    As mentioned in Section 2.4, this difference has been the subject of much debate (Fleiss 1975; Krippendorff 1978, 2004b; Byrt, Bishop, and Carlin 1993; Zwick 1988; Hsu and Field 2003; Di Eugenio and Glass 2004; Craggs and McGee Wood 2005).
    A claim often repeated in the literature is that single-distribution coefficients like &#960; and &#945; assume that different coders produce similar distributions of items among categories, with the implication that these coefficients are inapplicable when the annotators show substantially different distributions.
    Recommendations vary: Zwick (1988
