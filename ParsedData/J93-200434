er hour alternating with brief rests.
  At an average rate of 750 words per hour, a team of five part-time annotators annotating three hours a day should maintain an output of about 2.5 million words a year of "treebanked" sentences, with each sentence corrected once.
  It is worth noting that experienced annotators can proofread previously corrected material at very high speeds.
  A parsed subcorpus of over I million words was recently proofread at an average speed of approximately 4,000 words per annotator per hour.
  At this rate of productivity, annotators are able to find and correct gross errors in parsing, but do not have time to check, for example, whether they agree with all prepositional phrase attachments.
