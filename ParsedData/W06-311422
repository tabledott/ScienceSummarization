broad estimates.
    For instance: if 10 systems participate, and one system does better than 3 others, worse then 2, and is not significant different from the remaining 4, its rank is in the interval 3&#8211;7.
    At first glance, we quickly recognize that many systems are scored very similar, both in terms of manual judgement and BLEU.
    There may be occasionally a system clearly at the top or at the bottom, but most systems are so close that it is hard to distinguish them.
    In Figure 4, we displayed the number of system comparisons, for which we concluded statistical significance.
    For the automatic scoring method BLEU, we can distinguish three quarters of the systems.
    While the Bootstrap method is slightly more sensitive, it is very much in line with the sign test on text blocks.
    For the manual scoring, we can distinguish only half of the systems, both in terms of fluency and adequacy.
    More judgements would have enabled us to make better distinctions, but it is not clear what the uppe
