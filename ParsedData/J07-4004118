e, the current category is (S[dcl]\NP1)/(S[to]\NP)2, which is associated with wants; this combines with (S[to]\NP)/(S[b]\NP), associated with to; and the argument of (S[to]\NP)/(S[b]\NP) is wean.
    The %k variable allows us to look beyond the arguments of the current category when creating the GRs.
    A further difficulty in creating the transformation is that the head passing conventions differ between DepBank and CCGbank.
    By &#8220;head passing&#8221; we mean the mechanism which determines the heads of constituents and the mechanism by which words become arguments of long-range dependencies.
    For example, in the sentence The group said it would consider withholding royalty payments, the DepBank and CCGbank annotations create a dependency between said and the following clause.
    However, in DepBank the relation is between said and consider, whereas in CCGbank the relation is between said and would.
    We fixed this problem by changing the head of would consider to be consider rather than would.
