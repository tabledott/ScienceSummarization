lin- guistic structures originally produced.
  We argue that even if one extends the domain of locality of CFGs to trees, us- ing only substitution does not givo the freedom to choose the head of each structure.
  We show how adjunction al- lows us to lexicalize a CFG freely.
  We then show how a lexicalized grammar naturally follows from the extended omain of locality of TAGs and present some of the linguistic advantages ofour approach.
  A novel general parsing strategy for lexicalized gram- mars is discussed.
  In a first stage, the parser builds a set structures corresponding to the input sentence and in a second stage, the sentence is parsed with respect o this set.
  The strategy is independent of the linguistic theory adopted and of the underlying rammar formalism.
  How- ever, we focus our attention on TAGs.
  Since the set of trees needed to parse an input sentence is supposed to be finite, the parser can use in principle any search strategy.
  Thus, in particular, a top-down strategy can be used sin
