    It also suggests possible problems with the CLARIFY category, since unlike EXPLAIN and INSTRUCT moves, most CLARIFY moves follow replies, and since CLARIFY moves are intended to contain unelicited information.
    However, in general the agreement on segmentation reached was very good and certainly provides a solid enough foundation for more classification.
    4.3.2 Reliability of Move Classification.
    The argument that move classification is reliable uses the kappa coefficient; units in this case are moves for which all move coders agreed on the boundaries surrounding the move.
    Note that it is only possible to measure reliability of move classification over move segments where the boundaries were agreed.
    The more unreliable the segmentation, the more data must be omitted.
    Classification results can only be interpreted if the underlying segmentation is reasonably robust.
    Overall agreement on the entire coding scheme was good (K = .83, N = 563, k -= 4), with the
