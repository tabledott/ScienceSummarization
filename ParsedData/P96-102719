e participates in, it will be constructed once and only once.
    Although the number of structures of a string can grow exponentially with the length of the string, the number of edges that needs to be constructed grows only with the square of the string length and the whole parsing process can be accomplished in cubic time.
    Innumerable variants of the basic chart parsing scheme are possible.
    For example, if there were languages with truly free word order, we might attempt to characterize them by rules like those of context-free grammar, but with a somewhat different interpretation.
    Instead of replacing nonterminal symbols in a derivation with strings from the righthand side of corresponding rules, we would remove the nonterminal symbol and insert the symbols from the righthand side of the rule at arbitrary places in the string.
    A chart parser for languages with free word order would be a minor variant of the standard one.
    An edge would take the form where v is a vector with a bit for eve
