ing for this disparity in available knowledge sources, we find that our base NP algorithm performs comparably, achieving slightly worse precision (-1.1%) and slightly better recall (+0.2%) than the Ramshaw &amp; Marcus approach.
    Moreover, our approach offers many important advantages that make it appropriate for many NLP tasks: Note also that the treebank approach to base NP identification obtains good results in spite of a very simple algorithm for &amp;quot;parsing&amp;quot; base NPs.
    This is extremely encouraging, and our evaluation suggests at least two areas for immediate improvement.
    First, by replacing the naive match heuristic with a probabilistic base NP parser that incorporates lexical preferences, we would expect a nontrivial increase in recall and precision.
    Second, many of the remaining base NP errors tend to follow simple patterns; these might be corrected using localized, learnable repair rules.
    The remainder of the paper describes the specifics of the approach and its evalu
