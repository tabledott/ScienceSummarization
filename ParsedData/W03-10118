recision and recall can be computed once for every pair of words whereas similarity is something which will be computed for a specific task and will depend on the values of )3 and -y.
    Table 1 summarizes some special parameter settings.
  
  
    In this section, we evaluate the performance of the framework, using the combinatorial and MI-based models of precision and recall, at two application based tasks against Lin's MIbased Measure (simun) and the a-skew Divergence Measure (simasd).
    The formulae for these measures are given in Figure 1.
    For the askew divergence measure we set a = 0.99 since this most closely approximates the KullbackLeibler divergence measure.
    The two evaluation tasks used pseudo-disambiguation and WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) prediction are fairly standard for distributional similarity measures.
    However, in the future we wish to extend our evaluation to other tasks such as malapropism correction (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001) and PP-attachment ambiguity resolution (Resnik, 1
