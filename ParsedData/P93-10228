) is the probability of the joint event (a cooccurrence pair).
    We estimate mutual information values using the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE): d 4 (Y) (2) where f denotes the frequency of an event and N is the length of the corpus.
    While better estimates for small probabilities are available (Good, 1953; Church and Gale, 1991), MLE is the simplest to implement and was adequate for the purpose of this study.
    Due to the unreliability of measuring negative mutual information values in corpora that are not extremely large, we have considered in this work any negative value to be 0.
    We also set i (x , y) to 0 if f (x y) = 0.
    Thus, we assume in both cases that the association between the two words is as expected by chance.
  
  
    Assume that we have at our disposal a method for determining similarity between cooccurrence patterns of two words (as described in the next section).
    We say that two cooccurrence pairs, (wi, w2) and (01, w;), are similar if wc is similar to w1 and 74 is simi
