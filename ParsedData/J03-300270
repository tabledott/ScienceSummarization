g English-Chinese as an example.
    By way of context, Chen and Nie (2000) reported that PTMiner found around 15,000 English-Chinese document pairs by crawling 185 sites in the .hk (Hong Kong) domain, with the run taking about a week.
    We did a STRAND search of the two Internet Archive crawls used in the English-Arabic study, seeking English-Chinese parallel text in multiple domains where Chinese is a dominant language (e.g., .hk, .tw, .cn).
    Our initial candidate pair set was generated in approximately 30 hours, and contains over 70,000 candidate page pairs.
    We are optimistic that this can be improved still further by expanding the search to include all sites that contain at least one Chinese document, regardless of the domain.
    In terms of dissemination, the STRAND distribution mechanism models itself after Web search engines, distributing the URLs rather than the pages themselves.
    This places the legal burden on individual users, who are presumably safe under fair use provisions if they d
