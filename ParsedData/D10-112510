 for taking word r as the next dependency, and transitioning from state s to s0.
    A similar function gL is defined for left modifiers.
    We define to be the joint score for dependencies y|i, and left and right state sequences s0 ... sq and t0 ... tp.
    We specify that s0 = t0 = START and sq = tp = END.
    In this case we define and it follows that argmaxy|i&#8712;Zi fi(y|i) can be computed in O(n|S|2) time using a variant of the Viterbi algorithm, hence the model satisfies the siblingdecomposition assumption.
  
  
    We now describe the dual decomposition parsing algorithm for models that satisfy Assumption 1.
    Consider the following generalization of the decoding problem from Eq.
    1, where f(y) = Ei fi(y|i), Although the maximization w.r.t. z is taken over the set i, the constraints in Eq.
    5 ensure that z = y for some y E Y, and hence that z E Y.
    Without the z(i, j) = y(i, j) constraints, the objective would decompose into the separate maximizations z&#8727; = argmaxz&#8712;Z f(z), an
