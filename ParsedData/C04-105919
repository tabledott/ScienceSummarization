o retrieve the data for language model adaptation gives an improvement over using the first-best translation only for query construction.
			Using only one translation hypothesis to build an adapted language model has the tendency to reinforce that translation.
			4.3.3 Results for Query TMQ The third bag-of-words query model uses all translation alternatives for source words and source phrases.
			Figure-4 shows the results of this query model TMQ . The best results are 7.91 NIST score and 0.1995 Bleu.
			For this query model best results were achieved using the top 1000 relevant sentences mined from the AFE corpus per source sentence.
			The improvement is not as much as the other two query models.
			The reason is probably that all translation alternatives, even wrong translations resulting from errors in the word and phrase alignment, contribute alike to retrieve similar sentences.
			Thereby, an adapted language model is built, which reinforces not only good translations, but also bad translations.
