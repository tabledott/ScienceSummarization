on, we would like to Definitions: find the setting for 0 with the highest likelihood: We define the training set {(xi, yi)|i = 1... n}, O(0) = rl p(yi|xi; 0) = rl E p(yi, z|xi; 0) where i is an index corresponding to a particu- i i z lar entity pair (ej, ek) in A, xi contains all of However, this objective would be difficult to opthe sentences in E with mentions of this pair, and timize exactly, and algorithms for doing so would yi = relVector(ej, ek). be unlikely to scale to data sets of the size we conComputation: sider.
    Instead, we make two approximations, deinitialize parameter vector O &lt;-- 0 scribed below, leading to a Perceptron-style addifort = 1...T do tive (Collins, 2002) parameter update scheme which for i = 1...n do has been modified to reason about hidden variables, (y', z') &lt;-- arg maxy,z p(y, z|xi; 0) similar in style to the approaches of (Liang et al., if y' =&#65533; yi then 2006; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007), but adapted z* &lt;-- arg maxz for our specific model.
    This approxim
