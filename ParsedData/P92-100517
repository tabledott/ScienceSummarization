by replacing it.
    (Keep in mind that the discharge and replacement operations take place at the level of the evaluation rules for QLF; they are not applied to the QLF expressions representing natural language meanings themselves).
    As with Lewin's scoping algorithm, (Lewin 1990), there are no constraints built explicitly into the QLF semantics on where a quantification rule for a term may be applied, or indeed on the number of times it may be applied.
    However, several constraints arise out of (a) the absence of any semantic rules for evaluating isolated terms, term indices or scope lists, and (b) the requirement that a term be selected from a formula so that its quantifier is known.
    The emergent conditions on legitimate scoping are The last two constraints have often been attributed to restrictions on free variables and vacuous quantification.
    The attribution is problematic since open formulas and vacuously quantified formulas are both logically well defined, and without suspect appeal to th
