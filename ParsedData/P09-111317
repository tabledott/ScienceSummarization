ecause it is relatively upto-date, and because its sentences tend to make explicit many facts that might be omitted in newswire.
    Much of the information in Freebase is derived from tabular data from Wikipedia, meaning that Freebase relations are more likely to appear in sentences in Wikipedia.
    Each sentence of this unstructured text is dependency parsed by MINIPAR to produce a dependency graph.
    In preprocessing, consecutive words with the same named entity tag are &#8216;chunked&#8217;, so that Edwin/PERSON Hubble/PERSON becomes [Edwin Hubble]/PERSON.
    This chunking is restricted by the dependency parse of the sentence, however, in that chunks must be contiguous in the parse (i.e., no chunks across subtrees).
    This ensures that parse tree structure is preserved, since the parses must be updated to reflect the chunking.
    For held-out evaluation experiments (see section 7.1), half of the instances of each relation are not used in training, and are later used to compare against newly discove
