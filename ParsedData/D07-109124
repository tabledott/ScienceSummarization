			6.4 Integrated Recasing.
			To demonstrate the versatility of the factored translation model approach, consider the task of recas ing (Lita et al, 2003; Wang et al, 2006).
			Typically in statistical machine translation, the training data islowercased to generalize over differently cased surface forms ? say, the, The, THE ? which neces sitates a post-processing step to restore case in the output.
			With factored translation models, it is possible to integrate this step into the model, by adding a generation step.
			See Table 4 for an illustration of this model and experimental results on the IWSLT2006 task (Chinese-English).
			The integrated recas ing model outperform the standard approach with an BLEU score of 21.08% to 20.65%.
