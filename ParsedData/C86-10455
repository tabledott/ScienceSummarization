			A Sample CUG in PATR Notat ion Since the first categorial unification grammars were written in the PATR formalism and tested on the PATR systems implemented at SRI, and since PATR is especially well suited for the emulation of other grammar formalisms, I will use its notation.
			The representations in PATR are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) 2 . Rules have two parts, a head and a body.
			The head is a context-free rewrite rule and the body is a DAG.
			Here is an example, a simple rule that forms a sentence by combining anoun phrase with a verb phrase.
			188 (4) head XO -~ X1, X2 body in unification otation &lt;X0 cat&gt; = S &lt;X1 cat&gt; = NP &lt;X2cat&gt; = VP &lt;X1 agr&gt; = &lt;X2agr&gt; body in graph notation xo r S NP The rule states that two constituents X1 and X2 can combine to form a constituent X0 if the terminal string covered by X1 immediately precedes the terminal string of X2 and if the DAGs of X0, X1, and X2 unify with the X0, X1, and X2 subgraphs
