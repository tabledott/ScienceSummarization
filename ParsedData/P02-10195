han the incorrect spelling w, provided that where P (wjr)IP (wjw) would be approximately the odds of doubling the s in Osama.
    We do not pursue this, here, however.
    Brill and Moore (2000) present an improved error model for noisy channel spelling correction that goes beyond single insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions.
    The model has a set of parameters P(a !
    ,) for letter sequences of lengths up to 5.
    An extension they presented has refined parameters P(a !
    ,jPSN) which also depend on the position of the substitution in the source word.
    According to this model, the misspelling is generated by the correct word as follows: First, a person picks a partition of the correct word and then types each partition independently, possibly making some errors.
    The probability for the generation of the misspelling will then be the product of the substitution probabilities for each of the parts in the partition.
    For example, if a person chooses to type the word bouncy and
