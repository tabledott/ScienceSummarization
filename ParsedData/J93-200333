es in a different way.
    Casual inspection of some translations quickly establishes that the is usually translated into a single word (le, la, or 1), but is sometimes omitted; or that only is often translated into one word (for example, seulement), but sometimes into two (for example, ne .
    .
    . que), and sometimes into none.
    The number of French words to which e is connected in a randomly selected alignment is a random variable, (13&#8222; that we call the fertility of e. Each choice of the parameters in Model 1 or Model 2 determines a distribution, Pr(cl)e = 0), for this random variable.
    But the relationship is remote: just what change will be wrought in the distribution of 43the if, say, we adjust a(112, 8,9) is not immediately clear.
    In Models 3, 4, and 5, we parameterize fertilities directly.
    As a prolegomenon to a detailed discussion of Models 3, 4, and 5, we describe the generative process upon which they are based.
    Given an English string, e, we first decide the fertility o
