    All these corpora have documents in the same, matching topics.
    They can be described as on-topic documents.
    In fact, both Zhao and Vogel (2002) and Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) assume similar sentence orders and applied dynamic programming in their work.
    In our work, we try to find parallel sentences from far more disparate, very-non-parallel corpora than in any previous work.
    Since many more multilingual texts available today contain documents that do not have matching documents in the other language, we propose finding more parallel sentences from off-topic documents, as well as on-topic documents.
    An example is the TDT corpus, which is an aggregation of multiple news sources from different time periods.
    We suggest the &#8220;find-one-get-more&#8221; principle, which claims that as long as two documents are found to contain one pair of parallel sentence, they must contain others as well.
    Based on this principle, we propose an
