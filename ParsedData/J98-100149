e can be disambiguated with certitude, the system automatically acquires additional statistical information from these newly disambiguated occurrences, thus improving its knowledge incrementally.
    Hearst indicates that an initial set of at least 10 occurrences is necessary for the procedure, and that 20 or 30 occurrences are necessary for high precision.
    This overall strategy is more or less that of most subsequent work on bootstrapping.
    Recently, a class-based bootstrapping method for semantic tagging in specific domains has been proposed (Basili et al. 1997).
    Schiitze (1992, 1993) proposes a method that avoids tagging each occurrence in the training corpus.
    Using letter fourgrams within a 1,001-character window, his method, building on the vector-space model from information retrieval (see Salton, Wong, and Yang [1975]), automatically clusters the words in the text (each target word is represented by a vector); a sense is then assigned manually to each cluster, rather than to each occurre
