l phrase.
    With this constraint, estimating the paraphrase probability now requires the incorporation of syntactic type into the equation: where s(e) denotes the syntactic type of the English phrase e. As before, maximum likelihood estimation is employed to compute the two component probabilities: number of times f&#175; is extracted with &#175;ej and type s(ek) number of times f&#175; is extracted with any e&#175; and type s(ek) p(&#175;ej |&#175;f, s(ek)) If the syntactic types are restricted to be simple constituents (NP, VP, etc.
    ), then using this constraint will actually exclude some of the paraphrase pairs that could have been extracted in the unconstrained approach.
    This leads to the familiar precisionrecall tradeoff: It only extracts paraphrases that are of higher quality, but the approach has a significantly lower coverage of paraphrastic phenomena that are not necessarily syntactically motivated.
    To increase the coverage, complex syntactic types such as those used in Combinatory Cate
