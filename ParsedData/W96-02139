ely affects the speed of the tagger.
    Even though use of the Tag Dictionary gave an apparently insignificant (.12%) improvement in accuracy, it is used in further experiments since it significantly reduces the number of hypotheses and thus speeds up the tagger.
    The running time of the parameter estimation algorithm is 0(NTA), where N is the training set size, T is the number of allowable tags, and A is the average number of features that are active for a given event (h, t).
    The running time of the search procedure on a sentence of length N is 0(NTAB), where T, A are defined above, and B is the beam size.
    In practice, the model for the experiment shown in Table 6 requires approximately 24 hours to train, and 1 hour to test' on an IBM RS/6000 Model 380 with 256MB of RAM.
  
  
    The Maximum Entropy model allows arbitrary binary-valued features on the context, so it can use additional specialized, i.e., word-specific, features to correctly tag the &amp;quot;residue&amp;quot; that the baseline fe
