P is the preposition, whereas PropBank roles can be assigned to the entire PP (7), or only to the NP argument of the preposition (8), in which case the head word comes from the NP: In embedded clauses, CCG assumes that the head is the complementizer, whereas in PropBank, the head comes from the embedded sentence itself.
    In complex verb phrases (eg.
    &#8220;might not have gone&#8221;), the CCG parser assumes that the first auxiliary (might) is head, whereas PropBank assumes it is the main verb (gone).
    Therefore, CCG assumes that not modifies might, whereas PropBank assumes it modifies gone.
    Although the head rules of the parser could in principle be changed to reflect more directly the dependencies in PropBank, we have not attempted to do so yet.
    Further mismatches occur because the predicate-argument structure returned by the CCG parser only contains syntactic dependencies, whereas the PropBank data also contain some anaphoric dependencies, eg.
    : Such dependencies also do not correspond
