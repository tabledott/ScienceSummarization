ords for Jaccard.
    For other similarity metrics the result is similar.
    The weighting schemes wtrp had surprisingly little influence on results.
    For Jaccard similarity, the model had an error rate of 0.1858 for uniform weights, 0.1874 for frequency weighting, and 0.1806 for discriminativity.
    For other similarity metrics the results were similar.
    A cutoff was used in the similarity-based model: For each seen headword, only the 500 most similar words (according to a given similarity measure) were included in the computaof similar words; (b) % of times the more frequent word won; (c) number of distinct similar words per seen headword; (d) avg. size of intersection between roles tion; for all others, a similarity of 0 was assumed.
    Experiments testing a range of values for this parameter show that error rates stay stable for parameter values &gt; 200.
    So similarity-based models seem not overly sensitive to the weighting scheme used, the number of seen headwords, or the number of similar w
