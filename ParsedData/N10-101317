isons of which 87 were discarded.
    For the non-contextual case, Figure 3 left plots the fraction of raters preferring the multi-prototype prediction (using AvgSim) over that of a single prototype as the number of clusters is varied.
    When asked to choose between the single best word for each method (top word), the multi-prototype prediction is chosen significantly more frequently (i.e. the result is above 0.5) when the number of clusters is small, but the two methods perform similarly for larger numbers of clusters (Wald test, &#945; = 0.05.)
    Clustering more accurately identifies homonyms&#8217; clearly distinct senses and produces prototypes that better capture the different uses of these words.
    As a result, compared to using a single prototype, our approach produces better nearsynonyms for homonyms compared to polysemes.
    However, given the right number of clusters, it also produces better results for polysemous words.
    The near-synonym prediction task highlights one of the weaknesses of
