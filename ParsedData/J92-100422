ng forms such as &amp;quot;Pick up the box up&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Pick up the box up the box!&amp;quot; This problem can be overcome either by giving the two structures different LHS names or by grouping &amp;quot;up the box&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the box up&amp;quot; into distinct parent nodes, adding another layer to the hierarchy on the RHS.
    Another solution is to use a trace mechanism to link the two positions for the object, thus preventing it from occurring in both places.
    A final alternative is to include a PARTICLE bit among the features which, once set, cannot be reset.
    In fact, there were only a few situations where such problems arose, and reasonable solutions could always be found.
    TINA's design includes a number of features that lead to rapid development of the grammar and/or porting of the grammar to a new domain, as well as efficient implementation capabilities, in terms of both speed and memory.
    Among its features are semi-automatic training from a set of example sente
