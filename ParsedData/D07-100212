			In the example given above, the predicate beat evoques a single frame (i.e., Cause harm).
			However,predicates often have multiple meanings thus evo quing more than one frame.
			Knowing which is the appropriate frame for a given predicate impacts the semantic role assignment task; selecting the wrong frame will unavoidably result in erroneous semanticroles.
			Rather than disambiguiting polysemous pred icates prior to semantic role assignment, we performthe assignment for each frame evoqued by the pred icate.
			Semantic Role Assignment Before describing our approach to semantic role labeling we define dependency relation paths.
			A relation path R is a relation sequence ?r1,r2, ...,rL?, in which rl (l = 1,2, ...,L) is one of predefined dependency relations with suffix of traverse direction.
			An example of arelation path is R = ?sub jU ,ob jD?, where the sub scripts U and D indicate upward and downwardmovement in trees, respectively.
