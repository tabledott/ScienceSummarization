word is uniquely identified by its path from the root, and this path can be compactly represented with a bit string, as in Figure 2.
    In order to obtain a clustering of the words, we select all nodes at a certain depth from the root of the hierarchy.
    For example, in Figure 2 we might select the four nodes at depth 2 from the root, yielding the clusters {apple,pear}, {Apple,IBM}, {bought,run}, and {of,in}.
    Note that the same clustering can be obtained by truncating each word&#8217;s bit-string to a 2-bit prefix.
    By using prefixes of various lengths, we can produce clusterings of different granularities (Miller et al., 2004).
    For all of the experiments in this paper, we used the Liang (2005) implementation of the Brown algorithm to obtain the necessary word clusters.
  
  
    Key to the success of our approach is the use of features which allow word-cluster-based information to assist the parser.
    The feature sets we used are similar to other feature sets in the literature (McDonald et al
