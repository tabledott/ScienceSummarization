    For example, a two-level equivalent capturing happy + er = happier is y:i &lt;=&gt; p:p _, quite similar in spirit and function to our probabilistic model P(y&#8212;xil...app, +er).
    Theron and Cloete (1997) sought to learn a 2-level rule set for English, Xhosa and Afrikaans by supervision from 0(4000) aligned inflection-root pairs extracted from dictionaries.
    Single character insertion and deletions were allowed, and the learned rules supported both prefixation and suffixation.
    Their supervised learning approach could be applied directly to the aligned pairs induced in this paper.
    Finally, Oflazer and Nirenburg (1999) have developed a framework to learn two-level morphological analyzers from interactive supervision in a Elicit-Build-Test loop under the Boas project.
    Humans provide as-needed feedback regarding errors and omissions.
    Recently applied to Polish, the model also assumes concatenative morphology and treats non-concatenative irregular forms through table lookup.
    Thus
