he established metrics.
    The guidelines used by the PE-effort judges to assign 1-5 scores were the same as the ones used for creating the training data.
    We have used the same criteria to ensure the consistency of the human judgments.
    The initial set of candidates consisted of 604 sentences, of which only 442 met this criteria.
    The final scores used as goldvalues have been obtained using the same weightedaverage scheme as for the training data.
  
  
    In addition to the training and test materials, we made several additional resources that were used for the baseline QE system and/or the SMT system that produced the training and test datasets: For the ranking task, we defined a novel metric that provides some advantages over a more traditional ranking metrics like Spearman correlation.
    Our metric, called DeltaAvg, assumes that the reference test set has a number associated with each entry that represents its extrinsic value.
    For instance, using the effort scale we described in Section
