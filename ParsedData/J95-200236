tween scanning steps (since null productions do not have to be matched against one or more input symbols).
    Our strategy will be to collapse all predictions and completions due to chains of null productions into the regular prediction and completion steps, not unlike the way recursive predictions/completions were handled in Section 4.5.
    A prerequisite for this approach is to precompute, for all nonterminals X, the probability that X expands to the empty string.
    Note that this is another recursive problem, since X itself may not have a null production, but expand to some nonterminal Y that does.
    Computation of P(X E) for all X can be cast as a system of non-linear equations, as follows.
    For each X, let ex be an abbreviation for P(X z E).
    For example, let X have productions The semantics of context-free rules imply that X can only expand to E if all the RHS nonterminals in one of X's productions expand to E. Translating to probabilities, we obtain the equation In other words, each product
