], these definitions typically give results about 0.4% higher than the more obvious ones.
    The results for the new parser as well as for the previous top-three individual parsers on this corpus are given in Figure 1.
    As is typical, all of the standard measures tell pretty much the same story, with the new parser outperforming the other three parsers.
    Looking in particular at the precision and recall figures, the new parser's give us a 13% error reduction over the best of the previous work, Co1199 [9].
  
  
    In the previous sections we have concentrated on the relation of the parser to a maximumentropy approach, the aspect of the parser that is most novel.
    However, we do not think this aspect is the sole or even the most important reason for its comparative success.
    Here we list what we believe to be the most significant contributions and give some experimental results on how well the program behaves without them.
    We take as our starting point the parser labled Char97 in Figure 1 [5]
