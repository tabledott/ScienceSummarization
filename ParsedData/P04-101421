 test sentences, and to allow a fair comparison with other CCG parsers, extra rules were encoded in the parser (but we emphasise these were only used to obtain the section 23 test data; they were not used to parse unseen data as part of the testing).
    This resulted in 2,365 dependency structures for section 23 (98.5% of the full section), and 1,825 (95.5%) dependency structures for section 00.
    The first stage in parsing the test data is to apply the supertagger.
    We use the novel strategy developed in Clark and Curran (2004): first assign a small number of categories (approximately 1.4) on average to each word, and increase the number of categories if the parser fails to find an analysis.
    We were able to parse 98.9% of section 23 using this strategy.
    Clark and Curran (2004) shows that this supertagging method results in a highly efficient parser.
    For the normal-form model we returned the dependency structure for the most probable derivation, applying the two types of normal-form constrai
