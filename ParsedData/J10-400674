    The classic TOEFL synonym detection task focuses on the high end of the similarity scale, asking the models to make a discrete decision about which word is the synonym from a set of candidates.
    The data set, introduced to computational linguistics by Landauer and Dumais (1997), consists of 80 multiplechoice questions, each made of a target word (a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb) and four candidates.

    Our algorithms pick the candidate with the highest cosine to the target item as their guess of the right synonym.
