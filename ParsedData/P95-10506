the 100 * 100 matrices always corresponds to a zero-value in the other.
  
  
    The simulation was conducted by randomly permuting the word order of the German matrix and then computing the similarity s to the English matrix.
    For each permutation it was determined how many words c had been shifted to positions different from those in the original German matrix.
    The simulation was continued until for each value of c a set of 1000 similarity values was available.'
    Figure 1 shows for the three formulas how the average similarity a between the English and the German matrix depends on the number of non-corresponding word positions c. Each of the curves increases monotonically, with formula 1 having the steepest, i. e. best discriminating characteristic.
    The dotted curves in figure 1 are the minimum and maximum values in each set of 1000 similarity values for formula 1.
    'The logarithm has been removed from the mutual information measure since it is not defined for zero cooccurrences.
