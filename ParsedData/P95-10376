 Ih), where f is an element of the future vocabulary (the set of choices) and h is a history (the context of the decision).
    This probability P(flh) is determined by asking a sequence of questions qi q2...q&#8222; about the context, where the ith question asked is uniquely determined by the answers to the i &#8212;1 previous questions.
    For instance, consider the part-of-speech tagging problem.
    The first question a decision tree might ask is: If the answer is the, then the decision tree needs to ask no more questions; it is clear that the decision tree should assign the tag f = determiner with probability 1.
    If, instead, the answer to question 1 is bear, the decision tree might next ask the question: If the answer to question 2 is determiner, the decision tree might stop asking questions and assign the tag f = noun with very high probability, and the tag f = verb with much lower probability.
    However, if the answer to question 2 is noun, the decision tree would need to ask still more question
