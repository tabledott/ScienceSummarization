e the choice of measure in a given appli cation is likely to be important.
			We also identified one of the major axes ofvariation in neighbour sets as being the fre quency of the neighbours selected relative to the frequency of the target word.
			There are threemajor classes of distributional similarity mea sures which can be characterised as 1) higher frequency selecting or high recall measures; 2)lower frequency selecting or high precision mea sures; and 3) similar frequency selecting or high precision and recall measures.
			A word tends to have high recall similarity with its hyponyms and high precision similarity with its hypernyms.
			Further, in the majority ofcases, it tends to be more frequent than its hy ponyms and less frequent than its hypernyms.Thus, there would seem to a three way corre lation between word frequency, distributional generality and semantic generality.We have considered the impact of these observations on a technique which uses a distributional similarity measure to determine co
