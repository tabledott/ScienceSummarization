r appears to offer a more difficult modelling problem than the French-English pair.
    With both the translation score features (Dice and Model 1) removed &#8211; the sentence aligned data are not used &#8211; the AER of the Romanian is more than twice that of the French, despite employing more word aligned data.
    This could be caused by the lack of possible (P) alignment markup in the Romanian data, which provide a boost in AER on the French data set, rewarding what would otherwise be considered errors.
    Interestingly, without any features derived from the sentence aligned corpus, our model achieves performance equivalent to Model 3 trained on the full corpus (Och and Ney, 2003).
    This is a particularly strong result, indicating that this method is ideal for data-impoverished alignment tasks.
    Up to this point our Hansards model has been trained using only the sure (S) alignments.
    As the data set contains many possible (P) alignments, we would like to use these to improve our model.
