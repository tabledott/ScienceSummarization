 to the substring of w that the edge is designated to cover.
    However, this is not a requirement.
    For example, German compounds frequently have so-called Fugenelemente, one or two characters that &#8220;glue together&#8221; the primary morphemes in a compound.
    Since we permit these characters to be deleted, then an edge where they are deleted will have fewer characters than the coverage indicated by the edge&#8217;s starting and ending vertices.
    Except for the minimum segment length restriction, our model defines probabilities for all segmentations of an input word, making the resulting segmentation lattices are quite large.
    Since large lattices are costly to deal with during translation (and may lead to worse translations because poor segmentations are passed to the decoder), we prune them using forward-backward pruning so as to contain just the highest probability paths (Sixtus and Ortmanns, 1999).
    This works by computing the score of the best path passing through every edge in the la
