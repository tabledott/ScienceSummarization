			We were unable to replicate the behavior observed by the participant, nor could we determine a common set of software versions that might lead to the problem.
			We verified our computed scores on two different operating systems and two different hardware architectures.
			In each case the difference was inthe participants favor (i.e., resulted in an in creased F score) though the impact was minimal.
