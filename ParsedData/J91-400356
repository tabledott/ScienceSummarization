for this opposition (cf.
    Wright 1963): Similarly, by operating over other qualia role values we can generate semantically related concepts.
    I will call any operator that performs such an operation a projective transformation, and define them below: Definition A projective transformation, 7r, on a predicate Qi generates a predicate, Q2, such that 7r(Q1) = Q2, where Q2 cl (I) .
    The set of transformations includes: negation, &lt;, temporal precedence, &gt;, temporal succession, =, temporal equivalence, and act, an operator adding agency to an argument.
    Intuitively, the space of concepts traversed by the application of such operators will be related expressions in the neighborhood of the original lexical item.
    This space can be characterized by the following two definitions: A series of applications of transformations, , 7rn, generates a sequence of predicates, (121 , &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , Qn), called the projective expansion of Qi, P(Qi ).
    The projective conclusion space, P('DR), is t
