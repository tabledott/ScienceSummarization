To compare the performance with that of previous studies, we selected widely used test collections.
    For our POS tagging experiments, we used the Wall Street Journal in PTB III (Marcus et al., 1994) with the same data split as used in (Shen et al., 2007).
    For our syntactic chunking and NER experiments, we used exactly the same training, development and test data as those provided for the shared tasks of CoNLL&#8217;00 (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) and CoNLL&#8217;03 (Tjong Kim Sang and Meulder, 2003), respectively.
    The training, development and test data are detailed in Table 11 .
    The unlabeled data for our experiments was taken from the Reuters corpus, TIPSTER corpus (LDC93T3C) and the English Gigaword corpus, third edition (LDC2007T07).
    As regards the TIPSTER corpus, we extracted all the Wall Street Journal articles published between 1990 and 1992.
    With the English Gigaword corpus, we extracted articles from five news sources published between 1994 and 1996.
