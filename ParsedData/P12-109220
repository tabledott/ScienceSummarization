cribe each step in detail.
			In step 1, in order to make sure we select a diverse list of words, we consider three attributes of a word: frequency in a corpus, number of parts of speech, and number of synsets according to WordNet.
			For frequency, we divide words into three groups, top 2,000 most frequent, between 2,000 and 5,000, and between 5,000 to 10,000 based on occurrences in Wikipedia.
			For number of parts of speech, we group words based on their number of possible parts of speech (noun, verb or adjective), from 1 to 3.
			We also group words by their number of synsets: [0,5],[6,10], [11, 20], and [20, max].
			Finally, we sam ple at most 15 words from each combination in the Cartesian product of the above groupings.
			In step 2, for each of the words selected in step 1, we want to choose the other word so that the paircaptures an interesting relationship.
			Similar to Manandhar et al (2010), we use WordNet to first ran domly select one synset of the first word, we then construct a set of words i
