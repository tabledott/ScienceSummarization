ed result of Grenager et al. (2005) which is 72.4%.
    Furthermore, our PROTO+SIM+BOUND model comes close to the supervised HMM accuracy of 74.4% reported in Grenager et al. (2005).
    We also compared our method to the most basic semi-supervised setting, where fully labeled documents are provided along with unlabeled ones.
    Roughly 25% of the data had to be labeled in order to achieve an accuracy equal to our PROTO+SIM+BOUND model, suggesting that the use of prior knowledge in the prototype system is particularly efficient.
    In table 5.3, we provide the top confusions made by our PROTO+SIM+BOUND model.
    As can be seen, many of our confusions involve the FEATURE field, which serves as a general purpose background state, which often differs subtly from other fields such as SIZE.
    For instance, the parenthical comment: ( master has walk - in closet with vanity ) is labeled as a SIZE field in the data, but our model proposed it as a FEATURE field.
    NEIGHBORHOOD and ADDRESS is another natural con
