P, and S[adj]\NP.
    It is implemented by adding one of three fixed sets of categories to the chart whenever an NP, PP, or S[adj]\NP is present.
    Appendix A gives the category sets.
    Each category transformation is an instance of the following two rule schemata: Appendix A lists the punctuation and type-changing rules implemented in the parser.
    This is a larger grammar than we have used in previous articles (Clark and Curran 2004b, 2004a, 2006), mainly because the improvement in the supertagger since the earlier work means that we can now use a larger grammar but still maintain highly efficient parsing.
  
  
    The statistics relating to model estimation were obtained using Sections 02&#8211;21 of CCGbank as training data.
    The results for parsing accuracy were obtained using Section 00 as development data and Section 23 as the final test data.
    The results for parsing speed were obtained using Section 23.
    There are various hyperparameters in the parsing system, for example the frequenc
