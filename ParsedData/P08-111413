ns only one token in the Chinese parses. definitions of XP+, XP_, and XP2 are analogous. feature can be viewed as a disjunctive &#8220;alllabels=&#8221; feature, we also defined &#8220;all-labels+&#8221;, &#8220;all-labels2&#8221;, and &#8220;all-labels_&#8221; analogously.
  
  
    We carried out MT experiments for translation from Chinese to English and from Arabic to English, using a descendant of Chiang&#8217;s Hiero system.
    Language models were built using the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998).
    Word-level alignments were obtained using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000).
    The baseline model in both languages used the feature set described in Section 2; for the Chinese baseline we also included a rule-based number translation feature (Chiang, 2007).
    In order to compute syntactic features, we analyzed source sentences using state of the art, tree-bank trained constituency parsers ((Huang et al., 2008) for Chinese, and the Stanf
