ndependence assumptions (68)-(70), we can calculate the sum over alignments (52) in closed form: Equation (73) is useful in computations since it involves only 0(/m) arithmetic operations, whereas the original sum over alignments (72) involves 0(/m) operations.
    Concavity.
    The objective function (51) for this model is a strictly concave function of the parameters.
    In fact, from Equations (51) and (73), which is clearly concave in E(m I 1) and t(f I e) since the logarithm of a sum is concave, and the sum of concave functions is concave.
    Because ';/) is concave, it has a unique local maximum.
    Moreover, we will find this maximum using the EM algorithm, provided that none of our initial parameter values is zero.
    E(m I 1) string length probabilities t(f I e) translation probabilities a(i I j,l,m) alignment probabilities Here i= 0, .
    ,1; and j = 1,. , m. General Formula.
    This model is not deficient.
    Model 1 is the special case of this model in which the alignment probabilities are
