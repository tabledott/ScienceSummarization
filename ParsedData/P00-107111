ted by: Currently the combined score represents an un-normalized measure of answer correctness.
    The answer extraction is performed by choosing the answer candidate with the highest score.
    Some of the scores approximate very simple abductions.
    For example, the recognition of keywords or other question words in an apposition determines the Punctuation_sign-score, the Same_parse_subtreescore, the Comma_3_words-score and the Same_sentence-score to go up.
    Moreover, the same sequence score gives higher plausibility to answer candidates that contain in their window sequences of question words that follow the same orders in the question.
    This score approximates the assumption that concepts are lexicalized in the same manner in the question and in the answer.
    However, the combined score allows for keywords and question words to be matched in the same order.
    Table 3 illustrates some of the scores that were attributed to the candidate answers LASSO has extracted successfully.
