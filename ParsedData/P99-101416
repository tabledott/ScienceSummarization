 causative/inchoative verb increase, is composed of an actor/causative verb combining with a one-place predicate in the structure on the left in Fig.

    Linguistically, such representations are motivated by argument alternations (diathesis), case linking and deep word order, language acquistion, scope ambiguity, by the desire to represent aspects of lexical meaning, and by the fact that in some languages, the postulated decomposed representations are overt, with each primitive predicate corresponding to a morpheme.
    For references and recent discussion of this kind of theory see Hale and Keyser (1993) and Kural (1996).
    We will sketch an understanding of the lexical representations induced by latent-class labeling in terms of the linguistic theories mentioned above, aiming at an interpretation which combines computational learnability, linguistic motivation, and denotational-semantic adequacy.
    The basic idea is that latent classes are computational models of the atomic relation symbols occu
