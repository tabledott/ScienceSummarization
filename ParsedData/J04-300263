 Anderson and McMaster (1998) use fixed sets of high-frequency words to assign connotative scores to documents and sections of documents along dimensions such as how pleasant, acrimonious, pious, or confident, the text is.
    What distinguishes our work from work on subjectivity in other fields is that we focus on (1) automatically learning knowledge from corpora, (2) automatically performing contextual disambiguation, and (3) using knowledge of subjectivity in NLP applications.
    This article expands and integrates the work reported in Wiebe and Wilson (2002), Wiebe, Wilson, and Bell (2001), Wiebe et al. (2001) and Wiebe (2000).
    Previous work in NLP on the same or related tasks includes sentence-level and document-level subjectivity classifications.
    At the sentence level, Wiebe, Bruce, and O&#8217;Hara (1999) developed a machine learning system to classify sentences as subjective or objective.
    The accuracy of the system was more than 20 percentage points higher than a baseline accuracy.
