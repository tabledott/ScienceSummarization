positives: During development, we discovered many errors which involved a variant of appositives which we call &#8216;role appositives&#8217; (see painter in Figure 3), where an NP modifying the head NP describes the role of that entity (typically a person entity).
    There are several challenges to correctly labeling these role NPs as being appositives.
    First, the NPs produced by Treebank parsers are flat and do not have the required internal structure (see Figure 3(a)).
    While fully solving this problem is difficult, we can heuristically fix many instances of the problem by placing an NP around maximum length sequences of NNP tags or NN (and JJ) tags within an NP; note that this will fail for many constructions such as U.S. President Barack Obama, which is analyzed as a flat sequence of proper nouns.
    Once this internal NP structure has been added, whether the NP immediately to the left of the head NP is an appositive depends on the entity type.
    For instance, Rabbi Ashi is an apposition but I
