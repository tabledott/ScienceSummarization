    In some cases, there may be several or even several tens of translations depending on the context in which the word appears, but we should be quite surprised to find a word with hundreds of mutually exclusive translations.
    Although we use these models as part of an automatic system for translating French into English, they provide, as a byproduct, very satisfying accounts of the word-by-word alignment of pairs of French and English strings.
