 It can be viewed as an extension of the IBM-4 model distortion probabilities.
    Using the above states, we define partial hypothesis extensions of the following type: Not only the coverage set C and the positions j, j', but also the verb group states S, S', are taken into account.
    For the sake of brevity, we have omitted the target language words e, e' in the notation of the partial hypothesis extension.
    For each extension an uncovered position is added to the coverage set C of the partial hypothesis, and the verb group state S may change.
    A more detailed description of the partial hypothesis extension for a certain state S is given in the next section in a more general context.
    Covering the first uncovered position in the source sentence, we use the lanTillmann and Ney DP Beam Search for Statistical MT guage model probability p(e  |$,$).
    Here, $ is the sentence boundary symbol, which is thought to be at position 0 in the target sentence.
    The search starts in the hypothesis (Initial
