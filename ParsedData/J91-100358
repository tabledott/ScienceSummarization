ecedence over the class of assertion-based semantic relations for lexical disambiguation.
    The rank order among preference-based semantic relations is literal metaphorical &#8212;&gt; anomalous.
    If the semantic vectors are still tied then the measure of conceptual similarity is employed.
    This measure was initially developed to test a claim by Tourangeau and Sternberg (1982) about the aptness of a metaphor.
    They contend that aptness is a function of the distance between the conceptual domains of the source and target involved: the claim is that the more distant the domains, the better the metaphor.
    This is discussed further in Section 5.
    The conceptual similarity measure is also used for lexical ambiguity resolution (see Fass 1988c).
  
  
    CS has been implemented in the meta5 natural language program.
    The meta5 program is written in Quintus Prolog and consists of a lexicon holding the sense-frames of just over 500 word senses, a small grammar, and semantic routines that embody co
