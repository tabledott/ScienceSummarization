seen words (UwoRD), previously unseen word-tag pairs (UTAG) and ambiguous words (AMB), that is, those with more than one tag over the testing, training and development datasets.
    Note that the unseen word-tag pairs do not include the previously unseen words.
    We first replicated the results of the MXPOST tagger.
    In doing so, we discovered a number of minor variations from Ratnaparkhi (1998): MXPOST uses a cutoff of 1 for the current word feature and 5 for other features.
    However, the current word must have appeared at least 5 times with any tag for the current word feature to be included; otherwise the word is considered rare and morphological features are included instead.
  
  
    Table 4 shows the performance of MXPOST and our reimplementation.3 The third row shows a minor improvement in performance when the correction feature is removed.
    We also experimented with the default contextual predicate but found it had little impact on the performance.
    For the remainder of the experiments
