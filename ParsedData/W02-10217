cause it takes the exact probability as heuristic, i.e. the probability of the partial hypothesis multiplied with the rest cost estimation yields the actual probability of the complete hypothesis.
    Thus, the N best hypothesis are extracted from the graph without additional overhead of finding sentences with a lower probability.
    Of course, the hypotheses must not be recombined during this search.
    We have to keep every partial hypothesis in the priority queue in order to determine the N best sentences.
    Otherwise, we might lose one of them by recombination.
    The graph error rate is computed by determining that sentence in the word graph that has the minimum Levenstein distance to a given reference.
    Thus, it is a lower bound for the word error rate and gives a measurement of what can be achieved by rescoring with more complex models.
    The calculation of the graph error rate is performed by a dynamic programming based algorithm.
    Its space complexity is the number of graph nodes times t
