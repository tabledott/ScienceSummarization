d the rest of the histogram.
    To evaluate the plausibility of each possible estimate j of Jo, measure the fit between the predicted distribution of -S verbs, assuming j is the boundary of the -S cluster, and the observed distribution of the -S verbs, also assuming j is the boundary of the -S cluster.
    Given j, let p_s stand for the average rate at which verbs in bins j or lower are followed by cues for S. The predicted distribution for -S verbs is proportional to P(i,N,p_s) for 0 &lt; i &lt; N. The observed distribution of -S verbs, assuming j is the boundary of the -S cluster, is H[i] for 0 &lt; i &lt;j and 0 for j &lt; i &lt; N. Measure the fit between the predicted and observed distributions by normalizing both to have unit area and taking the sum over 0 &lt; i &lt; N of the squares of the differences between the two distributions at each bin i. j p_, TP FP TN FN MC %MC PRE REC cl 2 0.0037 25 1 28 8 9 15 .96 .76 inf 2 0.0048 22 1 32 5 6 10 .96 .81 NPc1 1 0.0002 3 2 2 0 2 29 .60 1.00 NPinf 1 0.0005 5
