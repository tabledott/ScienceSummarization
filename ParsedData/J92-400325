cted, using Prnear (w1 w2), in a manner similar to that described in the preceding section.
    Some classes group together words having the same morphological stem, such as performance, performed, perform, performs, and performing.
    Other classes contain words that are semantically related but have different stems, such as attorney, counsel, trial, court, and judge.
  
  
    We have described several methods here that we feel clearly demonstrate the value of simple statistical techniques as allies in the struggle to tease from words their linguistic secrets.
    However, we have not as yet demonstrated the full value of the secrets thus gleaned.
    At the expense of a slightly greater perplexity, the 3-gram model with word classes requires only about one-third as much storage as the 3-gram language model in which each word is treated as a unique individual (see Tables 1 and 4).
    Even when we combine the two models, we are not able to achieve much improvement in the perplexity.
    Nonetheless, we are
