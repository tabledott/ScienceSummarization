			Pre sumably this is simply because of this small set ofwords, which seem particularly skewed to the fi nancial domain.
			Note that whilst the distributionsin the domain-specific corpora are more skewed to wards a predominant sense, only 7 of the 40 words in the FINANCE corpus and 5 of the 40 words in the SPORTS corpus have only one sense attested.
