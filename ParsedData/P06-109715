ould like to thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting that this experiment would be useful even when using a small discriminative training corpus. our algorithm produces heuristically symmetrized final alignments of improved F-measure.
    Using these alignments in our phrasal SMT system, we produced a statistically significant BLEU improvement (at a 95% confidence interval a gain of 0.78 is necessary) on the French/English task and a statistically significant BLEU improvement on the Arabic/English task (at a 95% confidence interval a gain of 1.2 is necessary).
    The error criterion we used for all experiments is 1 &#8722; F-measure.
    The formula for F-measure is shown in Equation 3.
    (Fraser and Marcu, 2006) established that tuning the trade-off between Precision and Recall in the F-Measure formula will lead to the best BLEU results.
    We tuned &#945; by building a collection of alignments using our baseline system, measuring Precision and Recall against the alignment discriminative training set,
