 should also be large enough to obtain reliable estimates of word-frequency distribution for at least 10,000-15,000 words.
    Since a word can take on several different POS-tags, in the lexicon it can be represented as a [string/Pos-class] record, where the Pos-class is a set of one or more POS-tags.
    For instance, the entry for the word book, which can be a noun (NN) or a verb (VB) would look like [book (NN VB)].
    Thus the nth entry of the lexicon (wn) can be represented as [W C], where W is the surface lexical form and C is its Pos-class.
    Different lexicon entries can share the same Pos-class but they cannot share the same surface lexical form.
    In our experiments, we used a lexicon derived from CELEX (Burnage 1990), a large multilingual database that includes extensive lexicons of English, Dutch, and German.
    We constructed an English lexicon of 72,136 word forms with morphological features, which we then mapped into the Penn Treebank tag set (Marcus, Marcinkiewicz, and Santorini 1993).
