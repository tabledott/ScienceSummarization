al values for and are obtained from the training data via density estimation&#8212;using a small, hand-labeled subset of sentences we estimate the proportion of sentences that are positive or negative.
    The values of the average log-likelihood score that correspond to the appropriate tails of the score distribution are then determined via Monte Carlo analysis of a much larger sample of unlabeled training data.
  
  
    We used the TREC2 8, 9, and 11 collections, which consist of more than 1.7 million newswire articles.
