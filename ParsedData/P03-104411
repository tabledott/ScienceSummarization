 document set.
    We now outline the main steps of the algorithm, followed by the formulas used in these steps.
    The formula used for scoring candidate patterns in step 3 is similar to that in (Riloff, 1996): where are documents where matched, and the support is computed as the sum of their relevance: Document relevance is computed as in (Yangarber et al., 2000) where is the set of accepted patterns that match ; this is a rough estimate of the likelihood of relevance of , based on the pattern accuracy measure.
    Pattern accuracy, or precision, is given by the average relevance of the documents matched by : Equation 1 can therefore be written simply as: The two terms in Equation 5 capture the trade-off between precision and recall.
    As mentioned in Section 2.1, the learner running in isolation will eventually acquire patterns that are too general for the scenario, which will cause it to assign positive relevance to non-relevant documents, and learn more irrelevant patterns.
    From that point onward
