nt the average polysemy, i.e., the number of possible senses we can expect for each ambiguous word in the corpus.
    The average polysemy is calculated by counting the sum of possible senses for each ambiguous token and dividing by the number of tokens.
    This is represented by (11), where w ranges over all ambiguous tokens in the corpus, S(w) is the number of possible senses for word w, and N is the number of ambiguous tokens.
    The average polysemy for our evaluation corpus is 14.62.
    Ew in text S(W) Average polysemy =Our annotated corpus has the unusual property that more than one sense may be marked as correct for a particular token.
    This is an unavoidable side-effect of a mapping between lexicon senses which is not one-to-one.
    However, it does not imply that WSD is easier in this corpus than one in which only a single sense is marked for each token, as can be shown from an imaginary example.
    The worst case for a WSD algorithm is when each of the possible semantic tags for a given word
