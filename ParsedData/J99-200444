key difference is that the tagging is done in a probabilistic setting in the supertagging approach while it is rule based in the constraint grammar approach.
    We are currently developing supertaggers for other languages.
    In collaboration with Anne Abeille and Marie-Helene Candito of the University of Paris, using their French TAG grammar, we have developed a supertagger for French.
    We are currently working on evaluating the performance of this supertagger.
    Also, the annotated corpora necessary for training supertaggers for Korean and Chinese are under development at the University of Pennsylvania.
    A version of the supertagger trained on the WSJ corpus is available under GNU Public License from http: / / www.cis.upenn.edu / &#8212;xtag / swrelease.html.
  
  
    In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to robust parsing distinguished from the previous approaches to robust parsing by integrating the flexibility of linguistically motivated lexical descriptions with the robustness of
