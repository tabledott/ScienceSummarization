 Referent(B) = Referent(C) U Referent(D).
    Even assuming that each of A,B,C, and D has been properly identified as a markable during step 1, this is little guarantee that annotators of step 2 will realize the complex coreference relation between the combination of A and B and that of C and D. (Recall that coreference relations are to be annotated even in the absence of an anaphoric relationship.)
    The number of possible combinations of markables (some 2' when there are n markables) will often be too large to handle.
    Remedy.
    One alternative is to have a first pass where only referring expressions that look like anaphors are marked up, such as pronouns and definite NPs.
    Subsequent passes would look for antecedents for these expressions and link coreferring elements.
    An intermediate approach would be to mark up a core set of referring expressions on the first pass, allowing for further referring expressions to be identified on subsequent passes if this is necessary to resolve coreference.
