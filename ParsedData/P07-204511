 and the translation models.
    It also contains tools for tuning these models using minimum error rate training (Och 2003) and evaluating the resulting translations using the BLEU score (Papineni et al. 2002).
    Moses uses standard external tools for some of the tasks to avoid duplication, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003) for word alignments and SRILM for language modeling.
    Also, since these tasks are often CPU intensive, the toolkit has been designed to work with Sun Grid Engine parallel environment to increase throughput.
    In order to unify the experimental stages, a utility has been developed to run repeatable experiments.
    This uses the tools contained in Moses and requires minimal changes to set up and customize.
    The toolkit has been hosted and developed under sourceforge.net since inception.
    Moses has an active research community and has reached over 1000 downloads as of 1st March 2007.
