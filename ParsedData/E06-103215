    In the next section we give two significant examples that show that Bleu can indeed fail to correlate with human judgments in practice.
  
  
    The NIST Machine Translation Evaluation exercise has run annually for the past five years as part of DARPA&#8217;s TIDES program.
    The quality of Chinese-to-English and Arabic-to-English translation systems is evaluated both by using Bleu score and by conducting a manual evaluation.
