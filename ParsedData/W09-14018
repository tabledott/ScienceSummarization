inal GENIA corpus, some new types of annotation were added to make the event annotation more appropriate for the purposes of the shared task.
    The following sections describe the key changes to the corpus.
    The named entity (NE) annotation of the GENIA corpus has been somewhat controversial due to differences in annotation principles compared to other biomedical NE corpora.
    For instance, the NE annotation in the widely applied GENETAG corpus (Tanabe et al., 2005) does not differentiate proteins from genes, while GENIA annotation does.
    Such differences have caused significant inconsistency in methods and resources following different annotation schemes.
    To remove or reduce the inconsistency, GENETAG-style NE annotation, which we term gene-or-gene-product (GGP) annotation, has been added to the GENIA corpus, with appropriate revision of the original annotation.
    For details, we refer to (Ohta et al., 2009).
    The NE annotation used in the BioNLP task data is based on this annotation.
