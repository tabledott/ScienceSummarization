  likely to much exceed the 69% prior probability expected by chance.
  But this is not what we observe.
  For example, when tested on the word-to-the-right collocation, disambiguations based solely on a single data point exceed 92% accuracy, and performance on 2/0 and 3/0 distributions climb rapidly from there, and reach nearly perfect accuracy for training samples as small as 15/0, as shown in Figure 2.
  In contrast, acollocation 30 words away which also exhibits a 1/0 sense distribution has a predictive value of only 3% greater than chance.
  This difference in the reliability of low frequency data from local and wide context will have implications for algorithm design.
