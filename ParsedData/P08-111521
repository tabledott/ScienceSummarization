    Lattice Translation.
    The &#8216;noisier channel&#8217; model of machine translation has been widely used in spoken language translation as an alternative to selecting the single-best hypothesis from an ASR system and translating it (Ney, 1999; Casacuberta et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005; Saleem et al., 2005; Matusov et al., 2005; Bertoldi et al., 2007; Mathias, 2007).
    Several authors (e.g.
    Saleem et al. (2005) and Bertoldi et al.
    (2007)) comment directly on the impracticality of using n-best lists to translate speech.
    Although translation is fundamentally a nonmonotonic relationship between most language pairs, reordering has tended to be a secondary concern to the researchers who have worked on lattice translation.
    Matusov et al. (2005) decodes monotonically and then uses a finite state reordering model on the single-best translation, along the lines of Bangalore and Riccardi (2000).
