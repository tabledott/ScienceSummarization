 control and raising, via an enriched notion of syntactic types, without the need for syntactic movement, null elements, or traces.
    It also provides a &#8220;surface-compositional&#8221; syntax&#8211;semantics interface, in which monotonic rules of semantic composition are paired one-to-one with rules of syntactic composition.
    The corresponding predicate&#8211;argument structure or logical form can therefore be directly obtained from any derivation if the semantic interpretation of each lexical entry is known.
    In this article and in CCGbank, we approximate such semantic interpretations with dependency graphs that include most semantically relevant non-anaphoric local and long-range dependencies.
    Although certain decisions taken by the builders of the original Penn Treebank mean that the syntactic derivations that can be obtained from the Penn Treebank are not always semantically correct (as we will discuss), subsequent work by Bos et al. (2004) and Bos (2005) has demonstrated that the output o
