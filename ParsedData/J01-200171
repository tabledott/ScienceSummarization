 a single pair of suffixes may be a very convincing signature for other reasons as well.
    In Italian, for example, even in a relatively small corpus we are likely to find a signature such as a.ando.ano.are.ata.ate.ati.ato.azione.6 with several stems in it; once we are sure that the 10-suffix signature is correct, then the discovery of a subsignature along with a stem is perfectly natural, and we would not expect to find multiple stems associated with each of the occurring combinations.
    (A similar example in English from Tom Sawyer is NULLedfuLing.ive.less for the single stem rest.)
    And a signature may be &amp;quot;contaminated,&amp;quot; so to speak, by a spurious intruder.
    A corpus containing rag, rage, raged, raging, and rags gave rise to a signature: NULL.e.ed.ing.s for the stem rag.
    It seems clear that we need to use information that we have obtained regarding the larger, robust patterns of suffix combinations in the language to influence our decisions regarding smaller combinations.
