struction of hierarchical lexicon models on the basis of equivalence classes of words.
    In addition, we introduce sentence-level restructuring transformations which aim at the assimilation of word order in related sentences.
    We have systematically investigated the amount of bilingual training data required to maintain an acceptable quality of machine translation.
    The combination of the suggested methods for improving translation quality in frameworks with scarce resources has been successfully tested: We were able to reduce the amount of bilingual training data to less than 10% of the original corpus, while losing only 1.6% in translation quality.
    The improvement of the translation results is demonstrated on two German-English corpora taken from the Uerbmobil task and the Nespole! task.
  
  
    The statistical approach to machine translation has proved successful in various comparative evaluations since its revival by the work of the IBM research group more than a decade ago.
