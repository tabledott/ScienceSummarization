 of unaccusative (The man broke the vase) and unergative verbs (The jockey raced the horse past the barn) is an agent of causation, whereas the subject of the intransitive variant of unaccusative verbs has a theme role (i.e., undergoes a change of state: The vase broke), and the intransitive subject of unergative verbs has instead an agent role (The horse raced past the barn).
    Thus, their surface identity notwithstanding, the semantic properties of the syntactic slots of the verbs in each class are very different.
    By testing the W1LxW2 space on such a task we can therefore evaluate its ability to capture non-trivial properties of the verb&#8217;s thematic structure.
    We address these tasks by measuring the similarities between the W1LxW2 vectors of the transitive subject, intransitive subject, and direct object slots of a verb, and using these inter-slot similarities to classify the verb.
    For instance, given the definition of the C/I alternation, we can predict that with alternating verbs the i
