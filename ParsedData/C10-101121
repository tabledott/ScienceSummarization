set.
			This is 3.5 times faster than the baseline parser.
			The reason for that is the faster feature mapping of the Hash Kernel.Therefore, the measured time te for the feature ex traction and the calculation of the weight arrays are much lower than for the baseline parser.
			The training is about 19% slower since we could no longer use a file to store the feature indexes of the training examples because of the large number of negative features.
			We counted about twice the number of nonzero weights in the weight vector of the Hash Kernel compared to the baseline parser.For instance, we counted for English 17.34 Mil lions nonzero weights in the Hash Kernel and 8.47 Millions in baseline parser and for Chinese 18.28 Millions nonzero weights in the Hash Kernel and 8.76 Millions in the baseline parser.

			It increased most for Catalan and Span ish.
