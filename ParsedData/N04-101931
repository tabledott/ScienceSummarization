    The strengths of pyramid scores are that they are reliable, predictive, and diagnostic.
    The pyramid method not only assigns a score to a summary, but also allows the investigator to find what important information is missing, and thus can be directly used to target improvements of the summarizer.
    Another diagnostic strength is that it captures the relative difficulty of source texts.
    This allows for a fair comparison of scores across different input sets, which is not the case with the DUC method.
    We hope to address two drawbacks to our method in future work.
    First, pyramid scores ignore interdependencies among content units, including ordering.
    However, our SCU annotated summaries and correlated pyramids provide a valuable data resource that will allow us to investigate such questions.
    Second, creating an initial pyramid is laborious so large-scale application of the method would require an automated or semi-automated approach.
    We have started exploring the feasibility o
