  Redefinit ion of Selected Constituents The third step in the process of preparing initial parsed input for evaluation is necessary only if the parse submitted treats any of three particular constructions in a manner different from the canonical analysis currently accepted by the group.
  This step consists of redrawing constituent boundaries in conformity with the adopted standard.
