ures from machine learning tasks must be implemented also in the search for semantic compositionality in DSM.
    In this paper we present work in progress on the computational modelling of compositionality in a data-set of English Adjective-Noun pairs extracted from the BNC.
    We extrapolate three different models of compositionality: a simple additive model, a pointwise-multiplicative model and, finally, a multinomial multiple regression model by Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR).
  
  
    Previous work in the field has produced a small number of operations to represent the composition of vectorial representations of word meaning.
    In particular, given two independent vectors v1 and v2, the semantically compositional result v3 is modelled by: In the DSM literature, the additive model has become a de facto standard approach to approximate the composed meaning of a group of words (or a document) as the sum of their vectors (which results in the centroid of the starting vectors).
    This has been
