ved after several hundred iterations.
			It is well-known that EM oftentakes a large number of iterations to converge in likelihood, and we found this here too, as shown in Fig ure 1.
			As that figure makes clear, likelihood is still increasing after several hundred iterations.Perhaps more surprisingly, we often found dramatic changes in accuracy in the order of 5% occur ing after several hundred iterations, so we ran 1,000 iterations of EM in all of the experiments describedhere; each run took approximately 2.5 days compu tation on a 3.6GHz Pentium 4.
			It?s well-known thataccuracy often decreases after the first few EM it erations (which we also observed); however in our experiments we found that performance improves again after 100 iterations and continues improving roughly monotonically.
			Figure 2 shows how 1-to-1 accuracy varies with iteration during 10 runs from different random starting points.
			Note that 1-to-1 accuracy at termination ranges from 0.38 to 0.45; a spread of 0.07.We obtained a dram
