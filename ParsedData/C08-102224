			6.3 Determiners.
			Our work on determiner error correction is still in the early stages.
			We follow a similar procedure to the prepositions task, selecting a number of both correct and incorrect instances.
			On the former (set size 2000) accuracy is comparable to that on L1data: 92.2%.
			The danger of false alarms, then, ap pears not to be as significant as for the prepositions 174 task.
			On the incorrect instances (set size ca.
			1200), however, accuracy is less than 10%.
			Preliminary error analysis shows that the modelis successful at identifying cases of misused deter miner, e.g. a for the or vice versa, doing so in overtwo-thirds of cases.
			However, by far the most fre quent error type for determiners is not confusion between indefinite and definite article, but omitting an article where one is needed.
			At the moment, themodel detects very few of these errors, no doubt in fluenced by the preponderance of null cases seen in training.
			Furthermore, some of
