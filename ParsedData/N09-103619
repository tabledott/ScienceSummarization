l we cannot even compute the normalizing constants for these posterior distributions, so we chose a sampler that does not require this.
    We use a slice sampler here because it does not require a proposal distribution (Neal, 2003).
    (We initially tried a Metropolis-Hastings sampler but were unable to find a proposal distribution that had reasonable acceptance ratios for all of our adaptor grammars).
    As Table 1 makes clear, sampling the adaptor parameters makes a significant difference, especially on the collocation-syllable adaptor grammar.
    This is not surprising, as the adaptors in that grammar play many different roles and there is no reason to to expect the optimal values of their parameters to be similar.
