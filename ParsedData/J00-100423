ns a single word.
    For each bitext there are, in general, multiple such recursive decompositions that satisfy the synchronization constraints for hierarchical alignments.
    We wish to find such an alignment that respects the co-occurrence statistics of bitexts as well as the phrasal structure implicit in the source and target strings.
    For this purpose we define a cost function on hierarchical alignments.
    The cost function is the sum of three terms.
    The first term is the total of all the translation pairing costs c(w,f (w)) of each source word w and its translation f (w) in the alignment; the second term is proportional to the distance in the source string between dependents wd and their heads g(wd); and the third term is proportional to the distance in the target string between target dependent words vd and their heads h(vd).
    The hierarchical alignment that minimizes this cost function is computed using a dynamic programming procedure.
    In this procedure, the pairing costs are first re
