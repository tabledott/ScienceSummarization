    Allowing non-projective trees generally makes parsing computationally harder.
    Exact inference for parsing models that allow non-projective trees is NP hard, except under very restricted independence assumptions (Neuhaus and Br&#168;oker, 1997; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; McDonald and Satta, 2007).
    There is recent work on algorithms that can cope with important subsets of all nonprojective trees in polynomial time (Kuhlmann and Satta, 2009; G&#180;omez-Rodr&#180;&#305;guez et al., 2009), but the time complexity is at best O(n6), which can be problematic in practical applications.
    Even the best algorithms for deterministic parsing run in quadratic time, rather than linear (Nivre, 2008a), unless restricted to a subset of non-projective structures as in Attardi (2006) and Nivre (2007).
    But allowing non-projective dependency trees also makes parsing empirically harder, because it requires that we model relations between nonadjacent structures over potentially unbo
