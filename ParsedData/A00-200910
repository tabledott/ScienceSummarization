o 11 total 2368 Table 2: Distribution of senses for interest - the experiments in this paper and previous work use the entire corpus, where each sense occurs the number of times shown above. quency distribution are shown in Table 2.
    Unlike line, the sense distribution is skewed; the majority sense occurs in 53% of the sentences, while the smallest minority sense occurs in less than 1%.
  
  
    Eighty-one Naive Bayesian classifiers were trained and tested with the line and interest data.
    Fivefold cross validation was employed; all of the sensetagged examples for a word were randomly shuffled and divided into five equal folds.
    Four folds were used to train the Naive Bayesian classifier while the remaining fold was randomly divided into two equal sized test sets.
    The first, devtest, was used to evaluate the individual classifiers for inclusion in the ensemble.
    The second, test, was used to evaluate the accuracy of the ensemble.
    Thus the training data for each word consists of 80% of the
