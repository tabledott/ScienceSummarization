ty as suggesting an order in which to place these source words.
    Thus, as illustrated in Figure 1, a statistical translation system requires a method for computing language model probabilities, a method for computing translation probabilities, and, finally, a method for searching among possible source sentences S for the one that gives the greatest value for Pr(S )Pr(T1 S ).
    In the remainder of this paper we describe a simple version of such a system that we have implemented.
    In the A Source Language Model and a Translation Model furnish a probability distribution over source-target sentence pairs (5,T).
    The joint probability Pr (S,T) of the pair (5, T) is the product of the probability Pr(S) computed by the language model and the conditional probability Pr (T I S) computed by the translation model.
    The parameters of these models are estimated automatically from a large database of source-target sentence pairs using a statistical algorithm which optimizes, in an appropriate sense, the fit b
