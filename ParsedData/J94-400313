    The following subsections describe in detail the processing steps of the linguistic model.
    These include locating the ambiguous words and the relevant syntactic relations among them in the source language sentence, mapping these relations to alternative relations in the target language, and finally, counting occurrences of these alternatives in a target language corpus.
    Our model defines the different &amp;quot;senses&amp;quot; of a source word to be all its possible translations to the target language, as listed in a bilingual lexicon.
    Some translations can be eliminated by the syntactic environment of the word in the source language.
    For example, in the following two sentences the word 'consider' should be translated In these examples, the different syntactic subcategorization frames determine two different translations to Hebrew (mahshiv versus shoqe1), thus eliminating some of the ambiguity.
    Such syntactic rules that allow us to resolve some of the ambi
