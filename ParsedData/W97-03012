    The parser consists of the following three conceptually distinct parts: The maximum entropy models used here are similar in form to those in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra, 1996; Lau, Rosenfeld, and Roukos, 1993).
    The models compute the probabilities of actions based on certain syntactic characteristics, or features, of the current context.
    The features used here are defined in a concise and simple manner, and their relative importance is determined automatically by applying a training procedure on a corpus of syntactically annotated sentences, such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1994).
    Although creating the annotated corpus requires much linguistic expertise, creating the feature set for the parser itself requires very little linguistic effort.
    Also, the search heuristic is very simple, and its observed running time on a test sentence is linear with respect to
