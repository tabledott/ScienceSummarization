    Grammarians, the human decision-makers in parsing, solve this problem by enumerating the features of a sentence which affect the disambiguation decisions and indicating which parse to select based on the feature values.
    The grammarian is accomplishing two critical tasks: identifying the features which are relevant to each decision, and deciding which choice to select based on the values of the relevant features.
    Decision-tree classification algorithms account for both of these tasks, and they also accomplish a third task which grammarians classically find difficult.
    By assigning a probability distribution to the possible choices, decision trees provide a ranking system which not only specifies the order of preference for the possible choices, but also gives a measure of the relative likelihood that each choice is the one which should be selected.
    A decision tree is a decision-making device which assigns a probability to each of the possible choices based on the context of the decision: P(f
