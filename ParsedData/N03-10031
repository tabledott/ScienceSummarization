    &#8212; Monty Python, &#8220;Pet Shop&#8221; A mechanism for automatically generating multiple paraphrases of a given sentence would be of significant practical import for text-to-text generation systems.
    Applications include summarization (Knight and Marcu, 2000) and rewriting (Chandrasekar and Bangalore, 1997): both could employ such a mechanism to produce candidate sentence paraphrases that other system components would filter for length, sophistication level, and so forth.'
    Not surprisingly, therefore, paraphrasing has been a focus of generation research for quite some 'Another interesting application, somewhat tangential to generation, would be to expand existing corpora by providing time (McKeown, 1979; Meteer and Shaked, 1988; Dras, 1999).
    One might initially suppose that sentence-level paraphrasing is simply the result of word-for-word or phraseby-phrase substitution applied in a domain- and contextindependent fashion.
    However, in studies of paraphrases across several d
