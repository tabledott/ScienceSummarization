guities may be encoded in the lexicon (e.g., Golan, Lappin, and Rimon 1988).
    However, many ambiguities cannot be resolved on syntactic grounds.
    The purpose of this work is to resolve the remaining ambiguities using lexical co-occurrence preferences, obtained by statistical methods.
    Our basic concept is the syntactic tuple, which denotes a syntactic relation between two or more words.
    It is denoted by the name of the syntactic relation followed by a sequence of words that satisfies the relation, appearing in their base form (without morphological inflections).
    For example (subj&#8212;verb: man walk) is a syntactic tuple, which occurs in the sentence 'The man walked home.'
    We assume that our parser (or an auxilliary program) can locate the syntactic relation corresponding to a given syntactic tuple in a sentence.
    The use of the base form of words is justified by the additional assumption that morphological inflections do not affect the probability of syntactic tuples.
