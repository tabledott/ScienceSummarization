es that is widely used in SMT (Hoang and Koehn, 2008).
    The POS tagger and dependency parser for sentence preprocessing are SVMTool (Gimenez and Marquez, 2004) and MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2006).
    The language model is trained using a 9 GB English corpus.
    Our method is not restricted in domain or sentence style.
    Thus any sentence can be used in development and test.
    However, for the sentence similarity computation purpose in our experiments, we want to evaluate if the method can enhance the stringlevel similarity between two paraphrase sentences.
    Therefore, for each input sentence s, we need a reference sentence s' for similarity computation.
    Based on the above consideration, we acquire experiment data from the human references of the MT evaluation, which provide several human translations for each foreign sentence.
    In detail, we use the first translation of a foreign sentence as the source s and the second translation as the reference s' for similarity computation.
    In our
