 a separate test by using a subset of the &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; data set with only 4 senses (sense 1, 4, 5, and 6), so as to compare their results with previous work on WSD (Black, 1988; Zernik, 1990; Yarowsky, 1992), which were tested on 4 senses of the noun &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot;.
    However, the work of (Black, 1988; Zernik, 1990; Yarowsky, 1992) were not based on the present set of sentences, so the comparison is only suggestive.
    We reproduced in Table 3 the results of past work as well as the classification accuracy of LEXAS, which is 89.9% with a standard deviation of 1.09% over 100 random trials.
    In summary, when tested on the noun &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot;, LEXAS gives higher classification accuracy than previous work on WSD.
    In order to evaluate the relative contribution of the knowledge sources, including (1) POS and morphological form; (2) unordered set of surrounding words; (3) local collocations; and (4) verb to the left (verb-object syntactic relation), we conducted
