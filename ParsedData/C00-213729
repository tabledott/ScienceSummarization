te the sta- l, istical significance of the difli;rences between the results.
  We point out some analyt;ica.1 statis- tics tests like lnatched-l)air t,, sign mid Wilcoxon tests, which do not midge this assmnption and show that they (;tl,ll ])e l lsed Oll a l l letr ic like recall, l?br more complicated 1nettles like pre- cision and balanced F-score, wc use a compute-- intensive randonfization test, which also avoids this assumption.
  A next topic to address is that of possible dependencies l)etween test set  sam- ples.
