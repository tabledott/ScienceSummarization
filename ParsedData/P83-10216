fficient parsers for suitably constructed grammars (Warren and Pereira, 1983: Pereira, 1982), but the broader questions of the relation between parsing and deduction and of the derivation of online parsing algorithms for unification formalisms require that we look at a more generally applicable class of proof procedures.
    Chart parsing is a general framework for constructing parsing algorithms for context-free grammars and related formalisms.
    The Earley context-free parsing algorithm. although independently developed, can be seen as a particular case of chart parsing.
    We will give here just the basic terminology of chart parsing and of the Earley algorithm.
    Full accounts can be found in the articles by Kay (Kay.
    1080) and Earley (Earley, 1970).
    The state of a chart parser is represented by the chart, which is a directed graph.
    The nodes of the chart represent positions in the string being analyzed.
    Each edge in (lie chart. is either active or passive.
    Both types of edges are
