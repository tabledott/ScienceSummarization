, {&#8709;}, 0).
    {&#8709;} denotes the empty set, where no source sentence position is covered.
    The following recursive equation is evaluated: The search ends in the hypotheses (Initial, {1, ... , J}, j); the last covered position may be in the range j &#8712; {J&#8722;L, ... , J}, because some source positions may have been skipped at the end of the input sentence.
    {1,. .
    .
    , J} denotes a coverage set including all positions from position 1 to position J.
    The final translation probability QF is where p($  |e,e') denotes the trigram language model, which predicts the sentence boundary $ at the end of the target sentence.
    QF can be obtained using an algorithm very similar to the one given in Table 2.
    The complexity of the verb group reordering for the translation direction German to English is O(E3 &#183; J &#183; (R2 &#183; L &#183; R)), as shown in Tillmann (2001).
    For the translation direction English to German, the word reordering can be restricted in a similar way as fo
