thout sacrificing speed of processing with respect to other statistical parsers).
    These advantages appear to effectively offset the disadvantage of relying on a coarser, purely structural model for probabilistic parse selection.
    In future work, we hope to improve the accuracy of the system by adding lexical information to the statistical parse selection component without exploiting in-domain treebanks.
    Clearly, more work is needed to enable more accurate, informative, objective and wider comparison of extant parsers.
    More recent PTB-based parsers show small improvements over Collins&#8217; Model 3 using PARSEVAL, while Clark and Curran (2004) and Miyao and Tsujii (2005) report 84% and 86.7% F1-scores respectively for their own relational evaluations on section 23 of WSJ.
    However, it is impossible to meaningfully compare these results to those reported here.
    The reannotated DepBank potentially supports evaluations which score according to the degree of agreement between this and the ori
