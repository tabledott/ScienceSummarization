    The frequency threshold of 20 is intended to remove noisy data.
    We set the threshold by examining a plot of BNC frequency and the percentage of verbs at particular frequencies that are not listed in WordNet (Figure 2).
    Using 20 as a threshold for the subject slot results in only 5% verbs that are not found in WordNet, whereas 73% of verbs with fewer than 20 BNC occurrences are not present in WordNet.4 The selectional-preference models for adjective&#8211;noun relations are conditioned on an ac.
    Each ac comprises a group of adjective WordNet synsets linked by the &#8220;similarto&#8221; relation.
    These groups are formed such that they partition all adjective synsets.
    Thus AC = {ac E WordNet adjective synsets linked by similar-to}.
    For example, Figure 3 shows the adjective classes that include the adjective fundamental and that are formed in this way.5 For selectional-preference models conditioned on adjective classes, we u
