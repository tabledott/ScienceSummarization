    Hiero (Chiang, 2005) is a hierarchical, string-tostring translation system.
    Its rules, which are extracted from unparsed, word-aligned parallel text, are synchronous CFG productions, for example: As the number of nonterminals is limited to two, the grammar is equivalent to an inversion transduction grammar (Wu, 1997).
    The baseline model includes 12 features whose weights are optimized using MERT.
    Two of the features are n-gram language models, which require intersecting the synchronous CFG with finite-state automata representing the language models.
    This grammar can be parsed efficiently using cube pruning (Chiang, 2007).
    Our syntax-based system transforms source Chinese strings into target English syntax trees.
    Following previous work in statistical MT (Brown et al., 1993), we envision a noisy-channel model in which a language model generates English, and then a translation model transforms English trees into Chinese.
    We represent the translation model as a tree transd
