f the : RELS and :PREF fields and how they permit the expression of role-related preferences from any perspective.
    Collocation is the relationship among any group of words that tend to co-occur in a predictable configuration.
    Although collocations seem to have a semantic basis, many collocations are best recognized by their syntactic form.
    Thus, for current purposes, we limit the use of the term &amp;quot;collocation&amp;quot; to sense preferences that result from these well-defined syntactic constructions.1 For example, the particle combination pick up 1 Traditionally many of these expressions have been categorized as idioms (see Cowie and Mackin 1975; Cowie, Mackin, and McCraig 1983), but as most are at least partly compositional and can be processed by normal parsing methods, we prefer to use the more general term &amp;quot;collocation.&amp;quot; This categorization thus happily encompasses both the obvious idioms and the compositional expressions whose status as idioms is highly debatable.
