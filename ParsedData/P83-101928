omes a more difficult problem.
    It is not clear whether the rules for category disambiguation extend across an editing signal or not.
    The results I present depend on a successful disambiguation of the syntactic categories, though the algorithm to accomplish this is not completely specified.
    Thus, to test the self-correction routines I have, where necessary, imposed the proper category assignment.
    Table 1 shows the result of this editing system in the parsing of the interview transcripts from one speaker.
    All in all this shows the editing system to be quite successful in resolving non-fluencies.
  
  
    Although the editing rules for Fidditch are written as deterministic pattern-action rules of the same sort as the rules in the parsing grammar, their operation is in a sense isolable.
    The patterns of the self-correction rules are checked first, before any of the grammar rule patterns are checked, at each step in the parse.
    Despite this independence in terms of rule ordering, the ope
