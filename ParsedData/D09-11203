final system shows that its failures are far more often due to syntactic failures (e.g. parsing mistakes) and semantic failures (e.g. missing knowledge) than failure to model discourse phenomena or appropriately weigh conflicting evidence.
    One contribution of this paper is the exploration of strong modularity, including the result that our system beats all unsupervised systems and approaches the state of the art in supervised ones.
    Another contribution is the error analysis result that, even with substantial syntactic and semantic richness, the path to greatest improvement appears to be to further improve the syntactic and semantic modules.
    Finally, we offer our approach as a very strong, yet easy to implement, baseline.
    We make no claim that learning to reconcile disparate features in a joint model offers no benefit, only that it must not be pursued to the exclusion of rich, nonreference analysis.
