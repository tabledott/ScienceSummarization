d trans lations derived from sense distinctions defined in monolingual ontologies do not match translation distinction made by human translators (Specia et al, 2006).
			4.3 WSD uses the same training data as the.
			SMT system WSD training does not require any other resourcesthan SMT training, nor any manual sense annota tion.
			We employ supervised WSD systems, sinceSenseval results have amply demonstrated that supervised models significantly outperform unsupervised approaches (see for instance the English lexi cal sample tasks results described by Mihalcea et al (2004)).
			Training examples are annotated using the phrasealignments learned during SMT training.
			Every in 64 put language phrase is sense-tagged with its aligned output language phrase in the parallel corpus.
			The phrase alignment method used to extract the WSD training data therefore depends on the one used by the SMT system.
			This presents the advantage of training WSD and SMT models on exactly the same data, thus eliminating domain mi
