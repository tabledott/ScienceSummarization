at counts as co-occurrence; which figures of merit to use for new seed word selection and final ranking; the method of initial seed word selection; and how to manage compound nouns.
    In sections 2-5 we will cover each of these topics in turn.
    We will also present some experimental results from two corpora, and discuss criteria for judging the quality of the output.
  
  
    The first question that must be answered in investigating this task is why one would expect it to work at all.
    Why would one expect that members of the same semantic category would co-occur in discourse?
    In the word sense disambiguation task, no such claim is made: words can serve their disambiguating purpose regardless of part-of-speech or semantic characteristics.
    In motivating their investigations, Riloff and Shepherd (henceforth R&amp;S) cited several very specific noun constructions in which cooccurrence between nouns of the same semantic class would be expected, including conjunctions (cars and trucks), lists (pla
