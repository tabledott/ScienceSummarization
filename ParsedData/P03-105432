    Why should this be useful?
    Most tags have a canonical category.
    For example, NNS tags occur under NP nodes (only 234 of 70855 do not, mostly mistakes).
    However, when a tag somewhat regularly occurs in a non-canonical position, its distribution is usually distinct.
    For example, the most common adverbs directly under ADVP are also (1599) and now (544).
    Under VP, they are n&#8217;t (3779) and not (922).
    Under NP, only (215) and just (132), and so on.
    TAG-PA brought F1 up substantially, to 80.62%.
    In addition to the adverb case, the Penn tag set conflates various grammatical distinctions that are commonly made in traditional and generative grammar, and from which a parser could hope to get useful information.
    For example, subordinating conjunctions (while, as, if), complementizers (that, for), and prepositions (of, in, from) all get the tag IN.
    Many of these distinctions are captured by TAGPA (subordinating conjunctions occur under S and prepositions under PP)
