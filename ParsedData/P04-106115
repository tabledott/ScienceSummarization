 of the fragment D(h) of the dependency tree rooted at h: One can view a structure generated by this derivational process as a &#8220;lexicalized&#8221; tree composed of the local binary and unary context-free configurations shown in figure 4.3 Each configuration equivalently represents either a head-outward derivation step or a context-free rewrite rule.
    There are four such configurations.
    Figure 4(a) shows a head h 3It is lexicalized in the sense that the labels in the tree are derived from terminal symbols, but in our experiments the terminals were word classes, not individual lexical items. taking a right argument a.
    The tree headed by h contains h itself, possibly some right arguments of h, but no left arguments of h (they attach after all the right arguments).
    The tree headed by a contains a itself, along with all of its left and right children.
    Figure 4(b) shows a head h taking a left argument a &#8211; the tree headed by h must have already generated its right stop to do so.
