r gument classification and argument identification tasks, when added individually to the baseline.
			Addition ofnamed entities improves the F1 score for adjunctive arguments ARGM-LOC from 59% to ?68% and ARGM TMP from 78.8% to ?83.4%.
			But, since these arguments are small in number compared to the core arguments, theoverall accuracy does not show a significant improve ment.
			We found that adding this feature to the NULL vs NON-NULL classifier degraded its performance.
			It also shows the contribution of replacing the head word and the head word POS separately in the feature where the head of a prepositional phrase is replaced by the head word of the noun phrase inside it.
			Apparently, a combinationof relative features seem to have a significant improve ment on either or both the classification and identification tasks, and so do the first and last words in the constituent.
