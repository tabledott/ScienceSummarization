nt template system obtains significantly better results than a single-word-based translation model.
    In the Chinese&#8211;English 2002 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) machine translation evaluation it yields statistically significantly better NIST scores than all competing research and commercial translation systems.
  
  
    A phrase-based statistical machine translation approach &#8212; the alignment template approach &#8212; is described.
    This translation approach allows for general many-to-many relations between words.
    Thereby, the context of words is taken into account in the translation model, and local changes in word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly.
    The model is described using a log-linear modeling approach, which is a generalization of the often used source&#8211;channel approach.
    Thereby, the model is easier to extend than classical statistical machine translation systems.
    We describe in detail the process for learning phr
