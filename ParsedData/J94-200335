plained as the main verb, which requires an animate subject and object2.
  Since there are two animate zeros in 5c, which are also contra-indexed by syntactic onstraints, both Ziroo and Taroo must be realized in 5c.
  Constraint (3) restricts the Cb to Taroo as the highest-ranked lement from the Cf(Sb).
  The interpretive process must also generate the possible candidates for the Cf.
  If no constraints applied, then all four candidates shown above as Cfl, Cf2, Cf3, and Cf4 would be possible.
  However, the contraindexing filter will rule out Cf3 and Cf4.
  As mentioned above, there is no reason that these filters cannot be applied at the GENERATE phase rather than later on.
  The only CONTINUE interpretation available, Taroo explained the newly equipped func- tions to John, corresponds to the forward centers Cfl.
  It is a CONTINUE interpretation because Cb(5c) = Cb(5b) and also Cb(5c) = Cp(5c).
  The RETAIN interpretation is less preferred and is defined by the fact that Cb(5c) = Cb(5b), but Cb(5c) ~ Cp(5c)
