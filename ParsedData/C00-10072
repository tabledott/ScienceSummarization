n-gram language model, but; we augment it with a tree-based stochastic model and a traditional tree-based syntactic grammar.
  More recent work on aspects of stochastic gen- eration include (Langkilde and Knight, 2000), (Malouf, 1999) and (Ratnaparkhi, 2000).
  Betbre we describe in more detail how we use stochastic models in NLG, we recall the basic tasks in NLG (Rainbow and Korelsky, 1992; Re- iter, 1994).
  During text  p lanning,  content and structure of the target text; are determined to achieve the overall communicative goal.
  Dur- ing sentence planning, linguistic means - in particular, lexical and syntactic means are de- termined to convey smaller pieces of meaning.
  l)uring real izat ion,  the specification chosen in sentence planning is transtbrmed into a surface string, by line~rizing and intlecting words in the sentence (and typically, adding function words).
  As in the work by Langkilde and Knight, our work ignores the text planning stage, but it; does address the sentence, planning and the r
