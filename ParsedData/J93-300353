    Recall that the prosodic model in Figure 6 includes the following intonational profiles: Discourse Type A, in which a cue phrase constitutes an entire intermediate phrase, or is in a phrase containing only other cue phrases, and may have any type of pitch accent; Discourse Type B, in which a cue phrase occurs at the beginning of a larger intermediate phrase, or is preceded only by other cue phrases, and bears a L* pitch accent or is deaccented; Sentential Type A, in which the cue phrase occurs at the beginning of a larger phrase and bears a H* or complex pitch accent; and Sentential Type B, in which the cue phrase occurs in noninitial position in a larger phrase.
    Table 7 shows that our prosodic model fits the new data reasonably well, successfully predicting 662 (75.4%) of the classified tokens.
    Of the 341 cue phrases we both judged discourse, 301 (88.3%) fit the prosodic discourse model; 50 of these were of Discourse Type A and 251 were of Discourse Type B.
