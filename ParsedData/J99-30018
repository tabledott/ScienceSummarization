    The second deals with an empirical issue, in that we demonstrate how a functional model of centering can be successfully applied to the analysis of different forms of anaphoric text phenomena, namely pronominal, nominal, and functional anaphora.
    Finally, we propose a new evaluation methodology for centering data in terms of a cost-based evaluation approach that can be directly derived from and justified by the cognitive load premises of the centering model.

    In Section 4, we elaborate on particular information structure criteria underlying such a functional center ordering.
    We also make a second, mor
