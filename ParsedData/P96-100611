re are nine features related to collocations in an example.
    Table 1 lists the nine features and some collocation examples for the noun &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot;.
    For example, the feature with left offset = -2 and right offset = 1 refers to the possible collocations beginning at the word two positions to the left of &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; and ending at the word one position to the right of &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot;.
    An example of such a collocation is &amp;quot;in the interest of&amp;quot;.
    The method for extraction of local collocations is similar to that for extraction of keywords.
    For each of the nine collocation features, LEXAS concatenates the words between the left and right offset positions.
    Using similar conditional probability criteria for the selection of keywords, collocations that are predictive of a certain sense are selected to form the possible values for a collocation feature.
    LEXAS also makes use of the verb-object syntactic relation as one feature V for
