1990; Melamed 2000; Och and Ney 2002), and they can provide the connection between vocabularies in cross-language information retrieval (e.g., Davis and Dunning 1995; Landauer and Littman 1990; see also Oard 1997).
    More recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland have been exploring new ways to exploit parallel corpora in order to develop monolingual resources and tools, using a process of annotation, projection, and training: Given a parallel corpus in English and a less resource-rich language, we project English annotations across the parallel corpus to the second language, using word-level alignments as the bridge, and then use robust statistical techniques in learning from the resulting noisy annotations (Cabezas, Dorr, and Resnik 2001; Diab and Resnik 2002; Hwa et al. 2002; Lopez et al.
    2002; Yarowsky, Ngai, and Wicentowski 2001; Yarowsky and Ngai 2001; Riloff, Schafer, and Yarowsky 2002).
    For these reasons, parallel corpora can be thought of as a critical
