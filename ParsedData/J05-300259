standing the sentence and not salient enough to include in the summary.
    These approaches are based on the observation that the &#8220;importance&#8221; of a sentence constituent can often be determined based on shallow features, such as its syntactic role and the words it contains.
    For example, in many cases a relative clause that is stopped airing in 1979, but will instead be called &#8220;Clinton/Dole&#8221; one week and &#8220;Dole/Clinton&#8221; the next week. peripheral to the central point of the document can be removed from a sentence without significantly distorting its meaning.
    While earlier approaches for text compression were based on symbolic reduction rules (Grefenstette 1998; Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999), more recent approaches use an aligned corpus of documents and their human written summaries to determine which constituents can be reduced (Knight and Marcu 2002; Jing and McKeown 2000; Reizler et al. 2003).
    The summary sentences, which have been manually compressed, are alig
