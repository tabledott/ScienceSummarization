he elimination of double occurrences and contradicting examples, reduced the training set to 17577 quadruples, with an average quadruple ambiguity of 86, as of the ambiguity definition in section 1.2.
  
  
    Because the induction of the decision tree for the PP attachment is based on a supervised learning from sense-tagged examples, it was necessary to sense-disambiguate the entire training set.
    This was done by the iterative algorithm described in Chapter 2.
    To form an approximate evaluation of the quality of this disambiguation, we have randomly selected 500 words, manually12 assigned sets of possible senses to them (sets, because without a full sentential context a full disambiguation is not always possible), and compared these with the automatic disambiguation.
    If the automatically chosen sense was present in the manually assigned set, the disambiguation was considered correct.
    Out of these 500 words 362 could be considered correctly disambiguated, which represents slightly over 72%.
