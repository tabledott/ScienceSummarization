irst considering each subsequence of the sentence as a candidate to be a target instance.
    It computes a score for each candidate by comparing it to the training corpus, which consists of a set of pre-bracketed sentences.
    The algorithm then finds a consistent bracketing for the input sentence, giving preference to high scoring subsequences.
    In the remainder of this section we describe the scoring and bracketing methods in more detail.
    We first describe the mechanism for scoring an individual candidate.
    The input is a candidate subsequence, along with its context, i.e., the other tags in the input sentence.
    The method is presented at two levels: a general memory-based learning schema and a particular instantiation of it.
    Further instantiations of the schema are expected in future work.
    The MBSL scoring algorithm works by considering situated candidates.
    A situated candidate is a sentence containing one pair of brackets, indicating a candidate to be a target instance.
