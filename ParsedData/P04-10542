    We describe a relation extraction technique based on kernel methods.
    Kernel methods are nonparametric density estimation techniques that compute a kernel function between data instances, where a kernel function can be thought of as a similarity measure.
    Given a set of labeled instances, kernel methods determine the label of a novel instance by comparing it to the labeled training instances using this kernel function.
    Nearest neighbor classification and support-vector machines (SVMs) are two popular examples of kernel methods (Fukunaga, 1990; Cortes and Vapnik, 1995).
    An advantage of kernel methods is that they can search a feature space much larger than could be represented by a feature extraction-based approach.
    This is possible because the kernel function can explore an implicit feature space when calculating the similarity between two instances, as described in the Section 3.
    Working in such a large feature space can lead to over-fitti
