 text, it is necessary to construct a representation of its meaning that is amenable to some form of inference.
    This requires a syntactic representation which is transparent to the underlying semantics, making the local and long-range dependencies between heads, arguments, and modifiers explicit.
    It also requires a grammar that has sufficient coverage to deal with the vocabulary and the full range of constructions that arise in free text, together with a parsing model that can identify the correct analysis among the many alternatives that such a wide-coverage grammar will generate even for the simplest sentences.
    Given our current machine learning techniques, such parsing models typically need to be trained on relatively large treebanks&#8212;that is, text corpora hand-labeled with detailed syntactic structures.
    Because such annotation requires linguistic expertise, and is therefore difficult to produce, we are currently limited to at most a few treebanks per language.
