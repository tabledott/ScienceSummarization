between LSA dimensionality, training data and accuracy.
    Our new algorithm, CWM, was used in this experiment.
    The method is identical to C99 except the stemming algorithm has been disabled and LSA is used in the formulation of the similarity matrix.
    Ten LSA spaces were examined.
    Each space is characterised by the training data and its dimensionality. s and p imply the LSA space was trained on sentences and paragraphs, respectively.
    The values {100, 200, 300, 400, 500} represent the dimensionality of the trained space.
    For instance, &amp;quot;p, 400&amp;quot; is a 400-dimensional space that was trained on paragraphs.
    Like C99, +r implies ranking is applied to the similarity matrix.
    +b means CWM finds the ten most prominent boundaries.
    Let ji be the column average.
    Test results (table 4) show ranked LSA (column 4) has the lowest error rate.
    The raw values (column 1 and 3) performed well.
    The 1% difference in accuracy implies the termination strategy works well with
