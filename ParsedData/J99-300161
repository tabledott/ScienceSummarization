    In this algorithm, the metaphor of costs translates into the number of elements of the Cf that have to be tested until the correct antecedent is found.
    If the Cp of the previous utterance is the correct one, then the costs are indeed very low.
    We were also interested in finding out whether the functional criteria we propose might explain the linguistic data in a more satisfactory way than the grammaticalrole-based criteria discussed so far.
    So, we screened sample data from the literature, which were already annotated by centering analyses (for English, we considered all examples discussed in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein [1995] and Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard [1987]).
    We achieved consistent results for the grammatical and the functional approach for all the examples contained in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) but found diverging analyses for some examples discussed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987).
