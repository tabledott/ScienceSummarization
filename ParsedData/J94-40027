head&#8212;adjunct relations of the phrase structure that the Slot Grammar assigns to a sentence (phrase).
    Clausal representations of the previous four sentences in the text are retained in the Prolog workspace.
    The discourse representation used by our algorithm consists of these clausal representations, together with additional unit clauses declaring discourse referents evoked by NPs in the text and specifying anaphoric links among discourse referents.2 All information pertaining to a discourse referent or its evoking NP is accessed via an identifier (ID), a Prolog term containing two integers.
    The first integer identifies the sentence in which the evoking NP occurs, with the sentences in a text being numbered consecutively.
    The second integer indicates the position of the NP's head word in the sentence.
    2.1.1 The Syntactic Filter on Pronoun&#8212;NP Coreference.
    The filter consists of six conditions for NP&#8212;pronoun non-coreference within a sentence.
    To state these conditions
