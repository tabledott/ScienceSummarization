			Currently there are only a handful of approachesthat tackle the problem of preposition error detec tion in English learner texts.
			(Gamon et al, 2008)used a language model and decision trees to de tect preposition and determiner errors in the CLEC corpus of learner essays.
			Their system performs at 79% precision (which is on par with our system),however recall figures are not presented thus making comparison difficult.
			In addition, their eval uation differs from ours in that they also include errors of omission, and their work focuses o
