  Supervised Noun Phrase Coreference Research: The First Fifteen Years
  
    The research focus of computational coreference resolution has exhibited a shift from heuristic approaches to machine learning approaches in the past decade.
    This paper surveys the major milestones in supervised coreference research since its inception fifteen years ago.
  
  
    Noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution, the task of determining which NPs in a text or dialogue refer to the same real-world entity, has been at the core of natural language processing (NLP) since the 1960s.
    NP coreference is related to the task of anaphora resolution, whose goal is to identify an antecedent for an anaphoric NP (i.e., an NP that depends on another NP, specifically its antecedent, for its interpretation) [see van Deemter and Kibble (2000) for a detailed discussion of the difference between the two tasks].
    Despite its simple task definition, coreference is generally considered a difficult NLP task, typically involving the use o
