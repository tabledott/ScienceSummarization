 and take full advantageof not residing strictly within the Bayesian source channel model in order to benefit from the much richer Senseval-style feature set this facilitates.
			Garcia Varea et al found that the best results are obtained when the training of the context-dependent translation model is fully incorporated with the EM training of the SMT system.
			As described below,the training of our new WSD model, though not in corporated within the EM training, is also far more closely tied to the SMT model than is the case with traditional standalone WSD models.In contrast with Brown et al (1991), our approach incorporates the predictions of state-of-the art WSD models that use rich contextual features for any phrase in the input vocabulary.
			In Brown et al?s early study of WSD impact on SMT performance, the authors reported improved translation quality on a French to English task, by choosing an English translation for a French word based on the single contextual feature which is reliably discriminative
