dicate alguments, a The resulting variants of Proteus were applied to the formal training corpus and the (hidden) formal test corpus for MUC-6, and the output evaluated with the MUC scorer.
  The results on the training corpus are: Pattern Base Recall Precision Seed 38 83 Ex I ) Isco 62 80 Union 69 __79 Manual-MUC ~ 71 L~1.9~ Manual-NOW 6(3~ 79 L7!~z[)_t_j and on the test cortms: 4There are also a few noun phrase patterns which can give rise to scenario events.
  For example, "Mr Smith, former president of IBM", may produce an event record where l%ed Smith left IBM.
  These patterns were left in Proteus for all the runs, and they make some contribu- tion to the relatively high baseline scores obtained using just the seed event patterns.
  ~ExD~sco f und patterns which were relevant to the task lint could not be easily aceomodated in Proteus.
  For instance "X remained as president" could be rele- vant, particularly in the case of a merger creating anew corporate ntity, but Proteus was not equipped to trun- dl
