    For learning , we use Support Vector Machines.7 The features used include: the fraction of words in the tweet which are capitalized, the fraction which appear in a dictionary of frequently lowercase/capitalized words but are not lowercase/capitalized in the tweet, the number of times the word &#8216;I&#8217; appears lowercase and whether or not the first word in the tweet is capitalized.
    Results comparing against the majority baseline, which predicts capitalization is always informative, are shown in Table 5.
    Additionally, in &#167;3 we show that features based on our capitalization classifier improve performance at named entity segmentation.
  
  
    We now discuss our approach to named entity recognition on Twitter data.
