thesize that the most predictive features of an aspect rating are features derived from the text segments discussing the corresponding aspect.
    Motivated by these observations, we construct a joint statistical model of text and sentiment ratings.
    The model is at heart a topic model in that it assigns words to a set of induced topics, each of which may represent one particular aspect.
    The model is extended through a set of maximum entropy classifiers, one per each rated aspect, that are used to pre2E.g., http://zagat.com and http://tripadvisor.com. dict the sentiment rating towards each of the aspects.
    However, only the words assigned to an aspects corresponding topic are used in predicting the rating for that aspect.
    As a result, the model enforces that words assigned to an aspects&#8217; topic are predictive of the associated rating.
    Our approach is more general than the particular statistical model we consider in this paper.
    For example, other topic models can be used as a part of
