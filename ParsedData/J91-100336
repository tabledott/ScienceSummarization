 is called the target (after Martin 1985).
    Syntactic dependencies consist of pairs of lexical items of certain parts of speech in which the source, an item from one part of speech, applies one or more syntactic constraints to the target, another lexical item.
    Examples of source-target pairs include a determiner and a noun, an adjective and a noun, a noun and a verb, and an adverb and a verb.
    &amp;quot;The ship ploughed the waves.&amp;quot; Semantic dependencies occur in the same places as syntactic dependencies.
    The (metaphorical) sentence (15) contains four semantic dependencies: between the determiner 'the' and the noun 'ship,' between 'ship' and the verb stem 'plough,' between 'the' and the noun 'waves,' and between 'waves' and 'plough.'
    In each semantic dependency, one lexical item acts as the source and applies constraints upon the other lexical item, which acts as the target.
    In (15), 'the' and 'plough' both apply constraints upon 'ship,' and 'the' and 'plough' apply constraints
