at we are aware of is described in (Kuboli 99).
    This is a rule-based system which is based on a manually designed set of rules.
    The system's accuracy is not evaluated on a test corpus, so it is difficult to compare our results to theirs.
    We can, however, make some comparison of the results in this paper to those on parsing English.
    (Collins 99) describes results of 91% accuracy in recovering dependencies on section 0 of the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, using Model 2 of (Collins 97).
    This task is almost certainly easier for a number of reasons: there was more training data (40,000 sentences as opposed to 19,000); Wall Street Journal may be an easier domain than the PDT, as a reasonable proportion of sentences come from a sub-domain, financial news, which is relatively restricted.
    Unlike model 1, model 2 of the parser takes subcategorization information into account, which gives some improvement on English and might well also improve results on Czech.
    Given these differences, i
