p;quot;perfect&amp;quot; scheme would achieve roughly 93% precision and recall, which is a dramatic increase over the top 1 accuracy of 87% precision and 86% recall.
    Figure 10 shows that the &amp;quot;Exact Match&amp;quot;, which counts the percentage of times the proposed parse P is identical (excluding POS tags) to the treebank parse T, rises substantially to about 53% from 30% when the &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; scheme is applied.
    For this reason, research into reranking schemes appears to be a promising step towards the goal of improving parsing accuracy.
  
  
    The two parsers which have previously reported the best accuracies on the Penn Treebank Wall St. Journal are the bigram parser described in (Collins, 1996) and the SPATTER parser described in (Jelinek et al., 1994; Magerman, 1995).
    The parser presented here outperforms both the bigram parser and the SPATTER parser, and uses different modelling technology and different information to drive its decisions.
    The bigram parser is a s
