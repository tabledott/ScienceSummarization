 in evaluating candidate antecedents; nor does it model intentional or global discourse structure (as in Grosz and Sidner 1986).
    In Section 2 we present RAP and discuss its main properties.
    We provide examples of its output for different sorts of cases in Section 3.
    Most of these examples are taken from the computer manual texts on which we trained the algorithm.
    We give the results of a blind test in Section 4, as well as an analysis of the relative contributions of the algorithm's components to the overall success rate.
    In Section 5 we discuss a procedure developed by Dagan (1992) for using statistically measured lexical preference patterns to reevaluate RAP's salience rankings of antecedent candidates.
    We present the results of a comparative blind test of RAP and this procedure.
    Finally, in Section 6 we compare RAP to several other approaches to anaphora resolution that have been proposed in the computational literature.
  
  
    RAP contains the following main components.
