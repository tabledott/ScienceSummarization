ation we would have to make to the abduction scheme is to allow conjuncts in the antecedents to take costs directly as well as weights.
    Constraints on the application of phrase structure rules have been omitted, but could be incorporated in the usual way.
    For example, the first axiom says that there is a sentence from point i to point k asserting eventuality e if there is a noun phrase from i to j referring to x and a verb phrase from j to Jr denoting predicate p with arguments args and having an associated requirement req, and there is (or, for $3, can be assumed to be) an eventuality e of p's being true of c, where c is related to or coercible from x (with an assumability cost of $20), and the requirement req associated with p can be proved or, for $10, assumed to hold of the arguments of p. The symbol edzei denotes the conjunction of eventualities e and ei (See Hobbs (1985b), p.
    35.)
    The third argument of predicates corresponding to terminal nodes such as n and det is the word itself, which
