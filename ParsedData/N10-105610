oned lexical edit instances A &#8212;* a.
    Since the focus of our study was not word alignment, we used a simple method that identified the longest differing segments (based on word boundaries) between each sentence, except that to prevent the extraction of entire (highly nonmatching) sentences, we filtered out A &#8212;* a pairs if either A or a contained more than five words.
    Baselines RANDOM returns lexical edit instances drawn uniformly at random from among those extracted from SimpleEW.
    FREQUENT returns the most frequent lexical edit instances extracted from SimpleEW.
    Dictionary of simplifications The SimpleEW editor &#8220;Spencerk&#8221; (Spencer Kelly) has assembled a list of simple words and simplifications using a combination of dictionaries and manual effort9.
    He provides a list of 17,900 simple words &#8212; words that do not need further simplification &#8212; and a list of 2000 transformation pairs.
    We did not use Spencerk&#8217;s set as the gold standard because many tran
