given group.
    We compute this for all 899 groups and find the mean for edgain to be 0.91 (std. dev = 0.78).
    Table 5 gives the count for groups whose edgain falls into the specified range.
    We can see that the majority of edgain falls under 2.
    We are also interested in the relation between the predictive power of the FSAs and the number of reference translations they are derived from.
    For a given group, we randomly order the sentences in it, set the last one as the test sentence, and try to predict it with the first 1, 2, 3, ... 10 sentences.
    We investigate whether more sentences Let ed(FSAn) be the edit distance from the test sentence to the FSA built on the first n sentences; similarly, let ed(inputn) be the minimum edit distance from the test sentence to an input set that consists of only the first n sentences.
    Table 6 reports the effect of using different number of reference translations.
    The first column shows that each translation is contributing to the predictive power of o
