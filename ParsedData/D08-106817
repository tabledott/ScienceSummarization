and some can be inferred from simple linguistic cues (e.g., &#8220;Ms.
    Galen&#8221; is a singular female person, while &#8220;XYZ Corp.&#8221; is an organization).3 Entity type assignment is represented by the unit clause Type(+x, +e) and similarly for number and gender.
    A mention should agree with its cluster in entity type.
    This is ensured by the hard rule (which has infinite weight and must be satisfied) InClust(m, c) ==&gt; (Type(m, e) &lt;---&gt; Type(c, e)) 3We used the following cues: Mr., Ms., Jr., Inc., Corp., corporation, company.
    The proportions of known properties range from 14% to 26%.
    There are similar hard rules for number and gender.
    Different pronouns prefer different entity types, as represented by which only applies to pronouns, and whose weight is positive if pronoun t is likely to assume entity type e and negative otherwise.
    There are similar rules for number and gender.
    Aside from semantic compatibility, pronouns tend to resolve with nearby mentions.
