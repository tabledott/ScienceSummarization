    The first step of the algorithm is to extract phrases containing adjectives or adverbs.
    Past work has demonstrated that adjectives are good indicators of subjective, evaluative sentences (Hatzivassiloglou &amp; Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe et al., 2001).
    However, although an isolated adjective may indicate subjectivity, there may be insufficient context to determine semantic orientation.
