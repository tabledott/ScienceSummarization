features that relate certain grammatical dependencies of source and target language.
    For example, using a function k(&#183;) that counts how many arguments the main verb of a sentence has in the source or target sentence, we can define the following feature, which has a nonzero value if the verb in each of the two sentences has the same number of arguments: In the same way, we can introduce semantic features or pragmatic features such as the dialogue act classification.
    For the three different tasks on which we report results, we use two different training approaches.
    For the VERBMOBiL task, we train the model parameters &#955;M1 according to the maximum class posterior probability criterion (equation (4)).
    For the French&#8211; English HANSARDS task and the Chinese&#8211;English NIST task, we simply tune the model parameters by coordinate descent on held-out data with respect to the automatic evaluation metric employed, using as a starting point the model parameters obtained on the VERBMOBiL
