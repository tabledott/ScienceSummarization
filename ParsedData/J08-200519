in the parse tree that expands to its parent.
  As an example, if the predicate is elect in Figure 1, its subcategorization is VP?
  (VBN)-NP while the subcategorization of the predicate assume is VP?(VBN)-PP.
  Parentheses indicate the position of the predicate.
  Generally speaking, we consider only the arguments that correspond to some con- stituents in parse trees.
  However, in some cases, we need to consider an argument that does not exactly correspond to a constituent, for example, in our experiment in Sec- tion 4.2 where the gold-standard boundaries are used with the parse trees generated by an automatic parse.
  In such cases, if the information on the constituent, such as phrase type, needs to be extracted, the deepest constituent that covers the whole argument will be used.
  For example, in Figure 1, the phrase type for by John Smith is PP, and its path feature to the predicate assume is PP?VP?VBN.
  We also use the following additional features.
  These features have been shown to be useful for t
