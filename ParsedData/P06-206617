on-root nodes k, then the two paths from r to k and from i to j would cross.
    This particular property does not seem to be mirrored in any linguistic prediction.
    In contrast to planarity, well-nestedness is independent from both gap degree and edge degree in the sense that for every d &gt; 0, there are both wellnested and non-well-nested dependency graphs with gap degree or edge degree d. All projective dependency graphs (d = 0) are trivially well-nested.
    Well-nestedness also brings computational benefits.
    In particular, chart-based parsers for grammar formalisms in which derivations obey the well-nestedness constraint (such as Tree Adjoining Grammar) are not hampered by the &#8216;crossing configurations&#8217; to which Satta (1992) attributes the fact that the universal recognition problem of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems is X30-complete.
  
  
    In this section, we present an experimental evaluation of planarity, well-nestedness, gap degree, and edge degree, by examining how large
