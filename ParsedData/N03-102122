02).
    For expository purposes, we begin with Parser R2D2A, which is a naive CKY-style chart parser for 2-L2MTG(2).6 The chart of Parser R2D2A is initialized with &amp;quot;seed&amp;quot; items, illustrated in Figure 2.
    A one-dimensional seed is put in the chart for every word in every component of the input.
    After initialization, the parser can translational equivalence between seeds components by firing Y inference rules: Y inference rules infer YIELD production rules.
    Each two-dimensional instantiation expresses the translational equivalence of two word tokens, h1 and h2, at positions i1 and i2 in their respective components.
    One-dimensional Y inferences assert that a word vanishes in translation.
    E.g.
    : Parser R2D2A spends most of its time composing pairs of non-seed items into larger items.7 A bottom-up one-dimensional parser composes onedimensional items until it infers an item that covers the input text.
    A bottom-up synchronous parser composes multi-dimensional items until
