 : f B/C : g ? A/C : ?x.f(g(x)) (&gt; B) B\C : g A\B : f ? A\C : ?x.f(g(x)) (&lt; B)These rules allow for an unrestricted notion of con stituency that is useful for modeling coordination and other linguistic phenomena.
			As we will see, theyalso turn out to be useful when modeling construc tions with relaxed word order, as seen frequently in domains such as ATIS.
			In addition to the application and compositionrules, we will also make use of type raising and co ordination combinators.
			A full description of these combinators goes beyond the scope of this paper.Steedman (1996; 2000) presents a detailed descrip tion of CCG.
			2.3 Log-Linear CCGs.
			We can generalize CCGs to weighted, or probabilis tic, models as follows.
			Our models are similar to several other approaches (Ratnaparkhi et al, 1994; Johnson et al, 1999; Lafferty et al, 2001; Collins,2004; Taskar et al, 2004).
			We will write x to de note a sentence, and y to denote a CCG parse for asentence.
			We use GEN(x; ?) to refer to all possi ble
