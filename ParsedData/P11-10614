ly significant improvements.
    Our final average POS tagging accuracy of 83.4% compares very favorably to the average accuracy of Berg-Kirkpatrick et al.&#8217;s monolingual unsupervised state-of-the-art model (73.0%), and considerably bridges the gap to fully supervised POS tagging performance (96.6%).
  
  
    The focus of this work is on building POS taggers for foreign languages, assuming that we have an English POS tagger and some parallel text between the two languages.
    Central to our approach (see Algorithm 1) is a bilingual similarity graph built from a sentence-aligned parallel corpus.
    As discussed in more detail in &#167;3, we use two types of vertices in our graph: on the foreign language side vertices correspond to trigram types, while the vertices on the English side are individual word types.
    Graph construction does not require any labeled data, but makes use of two similarity functions.
    The edge weights between the foreign language trigrams are computed using a co-occurence b
