dels of Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993) are not suitable for small corpora because of data sparseness problems.
    We show that this is not the case if these models are parametrized suitably.
    In the Appendix, we describe some methods for efficient training of fertility-based alignment models.
  
  
    We distinguish between two general approaches to computing word alignments: statistical alignment models and heuristic models.
    In the following, we describe both types of models and compare them from a theoretical viewpoint.
    The notational convention we employ is as follows.
    We use the symbol Pr(&#183;) to denote general probability distributions with (almost) no specific assumptions.
    In contrast, for model-based probability distributions, we use the generic symbol p(&#183;).
    2.1.1 Statistical Alignment Models.
    In statistical machine translation, we try to model the translation probability Pr(f1 J  |eI1), which describes the relationship between a source languag
