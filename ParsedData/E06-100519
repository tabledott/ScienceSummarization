or translations.
    These translations can be improved if we compute a consensus translation from the output of at least two different speech translation systems.
    From each system, we take the translation of the single best ASR output, and the translation of the ASR word lattice.
    Two different statistical MT systems capable of translating ASR word lattices have been compared by (Matusov and Ney, 2005).
    Both systems produced translations of better quality on the BTEC Italian-English speech translation task when using lattices instead of single best ASR output.
    We obtained the output of each of the two systems under each of these translation scenarios on the CSTAR03 test corpus.
    The first-best recognition word error rate on this corpus is 22.3%.
    The objective error measures for the 4 translation hypotheses are given in Table 7.
    We then computed a consensus translation of the 4 outputs with the proposed method.
    The better performing word lattice translations were given higher sys
