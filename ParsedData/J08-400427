in an analysis of variance; the number of levels is thus the number of items i, and because each coder marks each item, the number of observations for each item is the number of coders c. Within-level variance is the sum of the square differences from the mean of each item, SSwithin = &#8721;i &#8721;c(xic &#8722; &#175;xi)2, divided by the degrees of freedom dfwithin = i(c &#8722; 1).
    We can express this as the sum of the squares of the differences between all of the judgment pairs for each item, summed over all items and scaled by the appropriate factor.
    We use the notation xic for the value given by coder c to item i, and &#175;xi for the mean of all the values given to item i.
