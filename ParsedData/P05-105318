data.
    This suggests the difficulty of detecting and classifying the relation type &#8220;AT&#8221; and its subtypes.
    Table 5 separates the performance of relation detection from overall performance on the testing set.
    It shows that our system achieves the performance of 84.8%/66.7%/74.7 in precision/recall/Fmeasure on relation detection.
    It also shows that our system achieves overall performance of 77.2%/60.7%/68.0 and 63.1%/49.5%/55.5 in precision/recall/F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types and the best-reported systems on the ACE corpus.
    It shows that our system achieves better performance by ~3 F-measure largely due to its gain in recall.
    It also shows that feature-based methods dramatically outperform kernel methods.
    This suggests that feature-based methods can effectively combine different features from a variety of sources (e.g.
    WordNet and gazetteers) that can be brought to bear on relation extraction.
    The tree kernels developed in Culotta et al (2004) are yet to be
