 a transitive derivative of speak-- outspeak rather than as the adjective outspoken.
  However, even given explicit criteria for assigning POS tags to potentially ambiguous words, it is not always possible to assign a unique tag to a word with confidence.
  Since a major concern of the Treebank is to avoid requiring annotators to make arbitrary decisions, we allow words to be associated with more than one POS tag.
  Such multiple tagging indicates either that the words part of speech simply cannot be decided or that the annotator is unsure which of the alternative tags is the correct one.
  In principle, annotators can tag a word with any number of tags, but in practice, multiple tags are restricted to a small number of recurring two-tag combinations: JJINN (adjective or noun as prenominal modifier), JJIVBG (adjective or gerund/present participle), JJ[VBN (adjective or past participle), NNIVBG (noun or gerund), and RBIRP (adverb or particle).
