ier-based parsing framework is that, depending on node (NP) with four children.
    In the transformed tree, internal structure (marked by nodes with asterisks) was added to the subtree rooted by the node with more than two children.
    The word &#8220;dog&#8221; is the head of the original NP, and it is kept as the head of the transformed NP, as well as the head of each NP* node. the classifier used, its training time can be much longer than that of other approaches.
    Like other deterministic parsers (and unlike many statistical parsers), our parser considers the problem of syntactic analysis separately from partof-speech (POS) tagging.
    Because the parser greedily builds trees bottom-up in one pass, considering only one path at any point in the analysis, the task of assigning POS tags to words is done before other syntactic analysis.
    In this work we focus only on the processing that occurs once POS tagging is completed.
    In the sections that follow, we assume that the input to the parser is a
