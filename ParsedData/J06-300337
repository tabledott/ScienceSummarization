orresponding element in the vector r is log(x + 1).
    Several authors report that the logarithmic transformation of frequencies improves cosine-based similarity measures (Salton and Buckley 1988; Ruge 1992; Lin 1998b).
    Turney and Littman (2005) evaluated the VSM approach by its performance on 374 SAT analogy questions, achieving a score of 47%.
    Since there are five choices for each question, the expected score for random guessing is 20%.
    To answer a multiple-choice analogy question, vectors are created for the stem pair and each choice pair, and then cosines are calculated for the angles between the stem pair and each choice pair.
    The best guess is the choice pair with the highest cosine.
    We use the same set of analogy questions to evaluate LRA in Secti on 6.
    Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 3 The VSM was also evaluated by its performance as a distance (nearness) measure in a supervised nearest neighbor classifier for noun-modifier semantic relations (Turney and Littman 20
