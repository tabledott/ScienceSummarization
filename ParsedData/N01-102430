e, to our knowledge, complete morphology induction performance measures have not previously been obtained.
    Lastly, we showed a mechanism whereby circumfixes as well as combinations of prefixing and suffixing can be induced in lieu of the suffixonly strategies prevailing in most previous research.
    For the future, we expect improvements could be derived by coupling this work, which focuses primarily on inducing regular morphology, with that of Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), who assume some information about regular morphology in order to induce irregular morphology.
    We also believe that some findings of this work can benefit other areas of linguistic induction, such as part of speech.
