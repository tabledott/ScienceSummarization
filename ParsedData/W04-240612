 of which clusters to split or merge is decided by a criteria function.
    This section describes the clustering algorithms and criteria functions that have been employed in our experiments.
    Hierarchical algorithms are either agglomerative or divisive.
    They both proceed iteratively, and merge or divide clusters at each step.
    Agglomerative algorithms start with each instance in a separate cluster and merge a pair of clusters at each iteration until there is only a single cluster remaining.
    Divisive methods start with all instances in the same cluster and split one cluster into two during each iteration until all instances are in their own cluster.
    The most widely known criteria functions used with hierarchical agglomerative algorithms are single link, complete link, and average link, also known as UPGMA.
    (Sch&#168;utze, 1998) points out that single link clustering tends to place all instances into a single elongated cluster, whereas (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) and (Purandare, 2003) show
