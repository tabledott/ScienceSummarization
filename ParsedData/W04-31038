portant use is in building test/train datasets for knowledge discovery systems.
    For example, let us assume that in a 1985 publication we find a speculation about two topics/concepts A and C being related and later in a 1995 document there is a definite statement declaring that A and C are connected via B.
    This pair of statements can then form the basis of a discovery problem.
    We may use it to test a KR system&#8217;s ability to predict B as the connecting aspect between A and C and to do this using data prior to the 1995 publication.
    The same example could also be used differently: KR systems could be assessed on their ability to make a speculation between A and C using data up to 1985 excluding the particular publication making the speculation.
    In this way such pairs of temporally ordered speculative-definite statements may be of value in KR research.
    Differentiating between speculative and definite statements is one part of finding such statement pairs.
