he WordNet class labels from the single similarity score derived from the noun pair&#8217;s cluster similarity.
    Hyponym acquisition is among the simplest and most straightforward of the possible applications of our model; here we show how we efficiently implement our algorithm for this problem.
    First, we identify the set of all the word pairs (i, j) over which we have hypernym and/or coordinate evidence, and which might represent additions of a novel hyponym to the WordNet 2.1 taxonomy (i.e., that has a known noun hypernym and an unknown hyponym, or has a known noun coordinate term and an unknown coordinate term).
    This yields a list of 95,000 single links over threshold P(Rij) &gt; 0.12.
    For each unknown hyponym i we may have several pieces of evidence; for example, for the unknown term continental we have 21 relevant pieces of hypernym evidence, with links to possible hypernyms {carrier, airline, unit,... }; and we have 5 pieces of coordinate evidence, with links to possible coordinate terms
