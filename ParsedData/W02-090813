ow frequency potential synonyms can eliminate many unnecessary comparisons.
    Figure 2 presents both the performance of the system using direct match evaluation (left axis) and execution times (right axis) for increasing cutoffs.
    This test was performed using JACCARD and the TTEST and LIN98A weight functions.
    The first feature of note is that as we increase the minimum cutoff to 30, the direct match results improve for TTEST, which is probably a result of the TTEST weakness on low frequency counts.
    Initially, the execution time is rapidly reduced by small increments of the minimum cutoff.
    This is because Zipf&#8217;s law applies to relations, and so by small increments of the cutoff we eliminate many terms from the tail of the distribution.
    There are only 29,737 terms when the cutoff is 30; 88,926 terms when the cutoff is 5; and 246,067 without a cutoff, and because the extraction algorithm is O(n2m), this results in significant efficiency gains.
