tten expository texts, multi-paragraph segmentation has many potential uses, including the improvement of computational tasks that make use of distributional information.
    For example, disambiguation algorithms that train on arbitrary-size text windows, e.g., Yarowsky (1992) and Gale et a/.
    (1992b), and algorithms that use lexical co-occurrence to determine semantic relatedness, e.g., Schiitze (1993), might benefit from using windows with motivated boundaries instead.
    Information retrieval algorithms can use subtopic structuring to return meaningful portions of a text if paragraphs are too short and sections are too long (or are not present).
    Motivated segments can also be used as a more meaningful unit for indexing long texts.
    Salton et at.
    (1993), working with encyclopedia text, find that comparing a query against sections and then paragraphs is more successful than comparing against full documents alone.
