abeled with rolenames; and a dependency graph can be derived algorithmically from FrameNet annotation; an early ver sion of this was proposed by (Fillmore et al, 2004b)Fig.
			1 shows the semantic dependency graph derived from sentence (1); this graphical representa tion was derived from a semantic dependency XML file (see Sec.
			5).
			It shows that the top frame in this sentence is evoked by the word important, although the syntactic head is the copula is (here given the more general label ?Support?).
			The labels on thearcs are either the names of frame elements or indications of which of the daughter nodes are seman tic heads, which is important in some versions of the evaluation.
			The labels on nodes are either frame names (also colored gray), syntactic phrases types (e.g. NP), or the names of certain other syntactic ?connectors?, in this case, Marker and Support.
