    Pour eux, c'est une mesure risible.
    P(FplE) we express the translation model as a distribution P([Ep; Fp]) over sentence beads.
    The alignment problem becomes discovering the alignment A that maximizes the joint distribution P(E, Y, A) .
    Assuming that successive sentence beads are generated independently, we get where A = ([Epi; Fpii; ; ; .
    ;[EpL; FpL])\ is consistent with E and .T and where p(L) is the probability that a corpus contains L sentence beads.
    For our translation model, we desire the simplest model that incorporates lexical information effectively.
    We describe our model in terms of a series of increasingly complex models.
    In this section, we only consider the generation of sentence beads containing a single English sentence E = el &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; en and single French sentence F = Ii &#8226; &#8226; fm.
