e experiments in this paper demonstrate that distributional similarities can perform as well as the knowledge-based approaches, and a combination of the two can exceed the performance of results previously reported on the same datasets.
    An application to cross-lingual (CL) similarity identification is also described, with applications such as CL Information Retrieval or CL sponsored search.
    A discussion on the differences between learning similarity and relatedness scores is provided.
    The paper is structured as follows.
    We first present the WordNet-based method, followed by the distributional methods.
    Section 4 is devoted to the evaluation and results on the monolingual and crosslingual tasks.
    Section 5 presents some analysis, including learning curves for distributional methods, the use of distributional similarity to improve WordNet similarity, the contrast between similarity and relatedness, and the combination of methods.
    Section 6 presents related work, and finally, Section 7
