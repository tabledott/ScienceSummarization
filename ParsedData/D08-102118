    Averaged Substitution Constraints + LM &#8211; As above, but including a language model probability.
    We evaluated the paraphrase quality through a substitution test.
    We retrieved a number of sentences which contained each test phrase and substituted the phrase with automatically-generated paraphrases.
    Annotators judged whether the paraphrases had the same meaning as the original and whether the resulting sentences were grammatical.
    They assigned two values to each sentence using the 5-point scales given in Table 5.
    We considered an item to have the same meaning if it was assigned a score of 3 or greater, and to be grammatical if it was assigned a score of 4 or 5.
    We evaluated several instances of a phrase when it occurred multiple times in the test corpus, since paraphrase quality can vary based on context (Szpektor et al., 2007).
    There were an average of 3.1 instances for each phrase, with a maximum of 6.
    There were a total of 1,195 sentences that paraphrases were sub
