 of segment goals.
    We do not, however, ask coders to identify hierarchical relations among segments.
    The hypothesis that discourse has a tree struchire has frequently been questioned (Dale 1992; Moore and Pollack 1992; Hearst 1994; Walker 1995), and the magnitude of our segmentation task precludes asking subjects to specify hierarchical relations.
    Finally, we quantify our results using a significance test, a reliability measure, and, for purposes of comparison with other work, percent agreement.
    The segmental structure of discourse has been claimed to constrain and be constrained by disparate phenomena, e.g., cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985; Cohen 1984), plans and intentions (Carberry 1990; Litman and Allen 1990; Grosz and Sidner 1986), prosody (Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986; Butterworth 1980), nominal reference (Webber 1991; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Linde 1979), and tense (Webber 1988; Hwang and Schubert 1992; Song and Cohen 1991).
