ute the change in description length occasioned by a particular structural change in the morphology proposed by a particular heuristic.
    This template is rather complex in its most general form, but it simplifies considerably in any specific application.
    The heuristic determines which of the terms in these formulas take on nonzero values, and what their values are; the overall formula determines whether the change in question improves the description length.
    In addition, we may regard the formulas in 35 As the discussion in the text may suggest, I am skeptical of the generative position, and I would like to identify what empirical result would confirm the generative position and dissolve my skepticism.
    The result would be the discovery of two grammars of English, G1 and G2, with the following properties: G1 is inherently simpler than G2, using some appropriate notion of Turing machine program complexity, and yet G2 is the correct grammar of English, based on some of the complexity of G2 being t
