ardinality histogram pruning is denoted by nc: If the numbers of active hypotheses for each coverage set C and cardinality c, N(C) and N(c), exceed the above thresholds, only the partial hypotheses with the highest translation probabilities are retained (e.g., we may use nc = 1,000 for the coverage histogram pruning).
    The third type of pruning conducted observation pruning: The number of words that may be produced by a source word f is limited.
    For each source language word f the list of its possible translations e is sorted according to where puni(e) is the unigram probability of the target language word e. Only the best no target words e are hypothesized during the search process (e.g., during the experiments to hypothesize, the best no = 50 words was sufficient.
    In this section, we describe the implementation of the beam search algorithm presented in the previous sections and show how it is applied to the full set of IBM-4 model parameters.
