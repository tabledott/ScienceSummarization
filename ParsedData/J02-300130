he part of speech of the target word and, as the last element, the phrase type or syntactic category of the sentence constituent marked as a frame element.
    After some experimentation, we settled on a version of the path feature that collapses the various part-of-speech tags for verbs, including past-tense verb (VBD), third-person singular present-tense verb (VBZ), other present-tense verb (VBP), and past participle (VBN), into a single verb tag denoted &#8220;VB.&#8221; Our path feature is dependent on the syntactic representation used, which in our case is the Treebank-2 annotation style (Marcus et al. 1994), as our parser is trained on this later version of the Treebank data.
    Figure 4 shows the annotation for the sentence &#8220;They expect him to cut costs throughout the organization,&#8221; which exhibits In this example, the path from the target word ate to the frame element He can be represented as VBTVPTS&#8595;NP, with T indicating upward movement in the parse tree and &#8595; downward movemen
