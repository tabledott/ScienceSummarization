    An evaluation on scenario-template tasks shows that the proposed Subtree model outperforms the previous models.
    Section 2 describes the Subtree model for extraction pattern representation.
    Section 3 shows the method for automatic acquisition.

    Our research on improved representation models for extraction patterns is motivated by the limitations of the prior extraction pattern representations.
    In this section, we review two of the previous models in detail, namely the Predicate-Argument model (Yangarber et al., 2000) and the Chain model (Sudo et al., 2001).
    The main cause of difficulty in finding entities by extraction patterns is the fact that the part
