    Using statistical methods, Church's Parts program (1988), in addition to identifying parts of speech, also inserted brackets identifying core NPs.
    These brackets were placed using a statistical model trained on Brown corpus material in which NP brackets had been inserted semi-automatically.
    In the small test sample shown, this system achieved 98% recall for correct brackets.
    At about the same time, Ejerhed (1988), working with Church, performed comparisons between finite state methods and Church's stochastic models for identifying both non-recursive cla
