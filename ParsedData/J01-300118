ch knowledge source.
    This was carried out by re-running the data from the &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; corpus through the learning algorithm, this time removing all but one set of features.
    The results are shown in Table 1.
    They found that the local collocations were the most useful knowledge source in their system.
    However, it must be remembered that this experiment was carried out on a data set consisting of a single word and may, therefore, not be generalizable.
    This review has been extremely brief and has not covered large areas of research into WSD.
    For example, we have not discussed connectionist approaches, as used by Waltz and Pollack (1985), Veronis and Ide (1990), Hirst (1987), and Cottrell (1984).
    However, we have attempted to discuss some of the approaches to combining diverse types of linguistic knowledge for WSD and have concentrated on those which are related to the techniques used in our own disambiguation system.
    Of central interest to our research is the relat
