ecause different words are ambiguous in different ways, credit tends to accumulate in the taxonomy only in those classes for which there is real evidence of co-occurrence; the rest tends to disperse unsystematically, resulting primarily in noise.
    Thus, despite the absence of class annotation in the training text, it is still possible to arrive at a usable estimate of class-based probabilities.
  
  
    Table 1 presents a selected sample of Resnik's (1993a) comparison with argument plausibility judgments made by human subjects.
    What is most interesting here is the way in which strongly selecting 'Word w is typically the head of a noun phrase, which could lead the model astray &#8212; for example, toy soldiers behave differently from soldiers (McCawley, 1968).
    In principle, addressing this issue requires that noun phrases be mapped to taxonomic classes based on their compositional interpretation; however, such complications rarely arise in practice. verbs &amp;quot;choose&amp;quot; the sense of the
