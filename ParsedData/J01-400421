ee whether they corefer with it.
    (her boss)75 is not tested because (her)76 is its nested noun phrase.
    Finally, the decision tree determines that the noun phrase (Ms. Washington)73 corefers with (her)76.
    In Table 2, we only show the system considering the three anaphors (her)76, (She)80, and (Ms. Washington)83, in that order.
    We use the same method to generate coreference chains for both MUC-6 and MUC7, except for the following.
    For MUC-7, because of slight changes in the coreference task definition, we include a filtering module to remove certain coreference chains.
    The task definition states that a coreference chain must contain at least one element that is a head noun or a name; that is, a chain containing only prenominal modifiers is removed by the filtering module.
  
  
    In order to evaluate the performance of our learning approach to coreference resolution on common data sets, we utilized the annotated corpora and scoring programs from MUC-6 and MUC-7, which assembled a set o
