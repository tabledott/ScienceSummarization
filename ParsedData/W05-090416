a problem, since the kernel measures implicitly consider the overlapping ratios of the sub-trees of all shapes, and thus will be very much affected by the sparse data problem.
    Though our syntactic metrics are proposed for evaluating the sentences&#8217; fluency, we are curious how well they do in the overall evaluation of sentences.
    Thus we also computed each metric&#8217;s correlation with human overall judgments in E14, E15 and JHU testing set.
    The overall human score for each sentence in E14 and E15 is computed by summing up its fluency score and adequacy score.
    The results are shown in Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5.
    We can see that the syntactic metrics achieve competitive correlations in the test, among which HWCM, based on headword chains, gives better performances in evaluation of E14 and E15, and a slightly worse performance in JHU testing set than BLEU.
    Just as with the fluency evaluation, HWCM and other syntactic metrics present more stable performance as the n-gram&#8217;s l
