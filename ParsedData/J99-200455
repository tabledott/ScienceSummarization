endencies.
    Auxiliary trees, by adjunction to elementary trees, account for the longdistance behavior of these dependencies.
    An additional advantage of a grammar possessing FRD and EDL properties is that feature structures in these grammars are extremely simple.
    Since the recursion has been factored out of the domain of dependency, and since the domain is large enough for agreement, subcategorization, and filler-gap dependencies, feature structures in such systems do not involve any recursion.
    In fact they reduce to typed terms that can be combined by simple term-like unification.
