ed paraphrase pairs from the same data that are more likely to be semantically related.
    We used both sets of paraphrases in TERp as alternatives to the paraphrase pairs that we extracted from the Arabic newswire bitext.
    The results are shown in the last four rows of Table 5 and show that using a pivot language other than the one that the MT system is actually translating yields results that are almost as good.
    It also shows that the syntactic constraints imposed by Callison-Burch (2008) on the pivot-based paraphrase extraction process are useful and yield improved results over the baseline pivot-method.
    The results further support our claim that the pivot paraphrase probability is not a very useful indicator of semantic relatedness.
  
  
    To evaluate the differences between human judgment types we first align the hypothesis to the references using a fixed set of edit costs, identical to the weights in Table 1, and then optimize the edit costs to maximize the correlation, without realigning
