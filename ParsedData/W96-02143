n the training data.
    Next, we present an algorithm for parsing, which returns the parse that is expected to have the largest number of correct constituents.
    We use the reduction and algorithm to parse held out test data, comparing these results to a replication of Pereira and Schabes (1992) on the same data.
    These results are disappointing: the PCFG implementation of the DOP model performs about the same as the Pereira and Schabes method.
    We present an analysis of the runtime of our algorithm and Bod's.
    Finally, we analyze Bod's data, showing that some of the difference between our performance and his is due to a fortuitous choice of test data.
    This paper contains the first published replication of the full DOP model, i.e. using a parser which sums over derivations.
    It also contains algorithms implementing the model with significantly fewer resources than previously needed.
    Furthermore, for the first time, the DOP model is compared on the same data to a competing model.
