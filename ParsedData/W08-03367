tities for better MT performance.
  
  
    For directly evaluating segmentation performance, we train each segmenter with the SIGHAN Bakeoff 2006 training data (the UPUC data set) and then evaluate on the test data.
    The training data contains 509K words, and the test data has 155K words.
    The percentage of words in the test data that are unseen in the training data is 8.8%.
    Detail of the Bakeoff data sets is in (Levow, 2006).
    To understand how each segmenter learns about OOV words, we will report the F measure, the in-vocabulary (IV) recall rate as well as OOV recall rate of each segmenter.
    The MT system used in this paper is Moses, a stateof-the-art phrase-based system (Koehn et al., 2003).
    We build phrase translations by first acquiring bidirectional GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) alignments, and using Moses&#8217; grow-diag alignment symmetrization heuristic.1 We set the maximum phrase length to a large value (10), because some segmenters described later in this paper will result in sho
