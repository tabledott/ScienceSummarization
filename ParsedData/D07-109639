 (2001),which iterates over the input tokens in a sequen tial manner and evaluates for each preceding token whether it can be linked to the current token or not.This model is used by Marinov (2007) and in com ponent parsers of the Nilsson ensemble system (Hall et al, 2007a).
			Finally, two systems use models based on LR parsing (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007; Watson and Briscoe, 2007).
			5.2.2 InferenceThe most common inference technique in transition based dependency parsing is greedy deterministic search, guided by a classifier for predicting the next transition given the current parser state and history,processing the tokens of the sentence in sequen tial left-to-right order7 (Hall et al, 2007a; Mannem, 2007; Marinov, 2007; Wu et al, 2007).
			Optionally multiple passes over the input are conducted until no tokens are left unattached (Attardi et al, 2007).
			As an alternative to deterministic parsing, several parsers use probabilistic models and maintain a heap or beam of partial transition sequences in order
