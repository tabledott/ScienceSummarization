 one is standard and aims at predicting the pronunciation information only.
    In this setting, the set of observations (X) contains 26 graphemes, and the output label set contains |Y  |= 51 phonemes.
    The second condition aims at jointly predicting phonemic and prosodic information3.
    The reasons for designing this new condition are twofold: firstly, it yields a large set of composite labels (|Y  |= 114) and makes the problem computationally challenging.
    Second, it allows to quantify how much the information provided by the prosodic marks help predict the phonemic labels.
    Both information are quite correlated, as the stress mark and the syllable openness, for instance, greatly influence the realization of some archi-phonemes.
    The features used in Nettalk experiments take the form fy,,,, (unigram) and fy0,y,,,, (bigram), where w is a n-gram of letters.
    The n-grm feature sets (n = 11, 3, 5, 7}) includes all features testing embedded windows of k letters, for all 0 &lt; k &lt; n; the n-gr
