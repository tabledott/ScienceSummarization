imilar.
    If the median is used, the number of FPs and FNs are evenly balanced.
    This is because the median threshold is, by definition, taken midway between the test items arranged in order of their similarity scores.
    There are an even number of items on either side of the decision point, and an even number of positive and negative candidates in our test sample.
    Thus, the errors on either side of the decision point are equal in number.
    For both base cuts, there are a larger number of false positives than false negatives when the mean is used.
    The mean produces a higher accuracy than the median, but gives an increase in false positives.
    Many false positives arise where the preferences at both target slots are near neighbours in WordNet.
    For example, this occurred for eat and drink.
    There verbs have a high probability mass (around 0.7) under the entity class in both target slots, since both people and types of food occur under this class.
    In cases like these, the probabilit
