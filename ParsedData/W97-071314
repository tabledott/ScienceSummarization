4, 15, 17 as unimportant, and were inconsistent in labeling unit 18 If we compute percent agreement figures only for the textual units for which at least 7 judges agreed, we get 69% for the units considered very important, 63% for those considered less Important, and 77% for those considered unimportant The overall percent agreement in this case is 75% Statistical significance.
    It has often been emphasized that agreement figures of the kinds computed above could be misleading (1Crippendorff, 1980, Passormeau and Litman, 1993) Since the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; set of important textual units cannot be independently .known, we cannot compute how valid the importance assignments of the judges were Moreover, although the agreement figures that would occur by chance offer a strong indication that our data are reliable, they do not provide a precise measurement of reliability To compute a reliability figure, we followed the same methodology as Passonneau and Litman (1993) and Hearst (1994) and applied the Cochr
