i-word NEs, and takes advantage of a dictionary (if one exists) to account for translated or partially translated NEs.
    We evaluate the algorithm on an English-Russian corpus, and show high level of NEs discovery in Russian.
  
  
    Named Entity recognition has been getting much attention in NLP research in recent years, since it is seen as significant component of higher level NLP tasks such as information distillation and question answering.
    Most successful approaches to NER employ machine learning techniques, which require supervised training data.
    However, for many languages, these resources do not exist.
    Moreover, it is often difficult to find experts in these languages both for the expensive annotation effort and even for language specific clues.
    On the other hand, comparable multilingual data (such as multilingual news streams) are becoming increasingly available (see section 4).
    In this work, we make two independent observations about Named Entities encountered in such corpora
