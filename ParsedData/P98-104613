ass (cut, hack, hew, saw) exhibits alternations of both parent classes, and has been augmented with chip, clip, slash, snip since these cut verbs also display the syntactic properties of split verbs.
    WordNet distinguishes two subclasses of cut, differentiated by the type of result: This distinction appears in the second-order Levin classes as membership vs. nonmembership in the intersective class with split.
    Levin verb classes are based on an underlying lattice of partial semantic descriptions, which are manifested indirectly in diathesis alternations.
    Whereas high level semantic relations (synonym, hypernym) are represented directly in WordNet, they can sometimes be inferred from the intersection between Levin verb classes, as with the cut/split class.
    However, other intersective classes, such as the split/push/carry class, are no more consistent with WordNet than the original Levin classes.
    The most specific hypernym common to all the verbs in this intersective class is move, displace, w
