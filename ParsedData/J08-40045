or to develop and test a computational model&#8212;need to show that such data are reliable.
    The fundamental assumption behind the methodologies discussed in this article is that data are reliable if coders can be shown to agree on the categories assigned to units to an extent determined by the purposes of the study (Krippendorff 2004a; Craggs and McGee Wood 2005).
    If different coders produce consistently similar results, then we can infer that they have internalized a similar understanding of the annotation guidelines, and we can expect them to perform consistently under this understanding.
    Reliability is thus a prerequisite for demonstrating the validity of the coding scheme&#8212;that is, to show that the coding scheme captures the &#8220;truth&#8221; of the phenomenon being studied, in case this matters: If the annotators are not consistent then either some of them are wrong or else the annotation scheme is inappropriate for the data.
    (Just as in real life, the fact that witnesses to an ev
