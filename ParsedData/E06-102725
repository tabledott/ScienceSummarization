			System evaluation considerations.
			The con tribution of this paper to the developmentof methodology of system evaluation is twofold.
			First, this research emphasizes the im portance of multiple runs on different seedlists for a more accurate evaluation of senti ment tag extraction system performance.
			Wehave shown how significantly the system re sults vary, depending on the composition of the seed list.Second, due to the high cost of manual an notation and other practical considerations, most bootstrapping and other NLP systems are evaluated on relatively small manually annotated gold standards developed for agiven semantic category.
			The implied assumption is that such a gold standard represents a random sample drawn from the pop ulation of all category members and hence, system performance observed on this goldstandard can be projected to the whole se mantic category.
