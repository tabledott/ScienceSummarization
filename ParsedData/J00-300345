zed in Table 8, along with the baseline result obtained with the decision tree model.
    Based on these experiments, a softmax network (Bridle 1990) without hidden units resulted in only a slight improvement over the decision tree.
    A network with hidden units did not afford any additional advantage, even after we optimized the number of hidden units, indicating that complex combinations of features (as far as the network could learn them) do not predict DAs better than linear combinations of input features.
    While we believe alternative classifier architectures should be investigated further as prosodic models, the results so far seem to confirm our choice of decision trees as a model class that gives close to optimal performance for this task.
    5.2.5 Intonation Event Likelihoods.
    An alternative way to compute prosodically based DA likelihoods uses pitch accents and boundary phrases (Taylor et al. 1997).
    The approach relies on the intuition that different utterance types are characterized b
