ector of factors that represent different levels of annotation (see Figure 1).
			We report on experiments with factors such assurface form, lemma, part-of-speech, morphological features such as gender, count and case, automatic word classes, true case forms of words, shallow syntactic tags, as well as dedicated factors to en sure agreement between syntactically related items.
			This paper describes the motivation, the modeling aspects and the computationally efficient decoding methods of factored translation models.
			We presentbriefly results for a number of language pairs.
			How ever, the focus of this paper is the description of theapproach.
			Detailed experimental results will be de scribed in forthcoming papers.

			Many attempts have been made to add richer in formation to statistical machine translation models.Most of these focus on the pre-processing of the in put to the statistical system, or the post-processing of its output.
			Our framework is more general and goes beyond recent wor
