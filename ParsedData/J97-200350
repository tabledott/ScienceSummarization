, q2, c) can be reached from / in A.
    The set of such (qi, q2, c) is exactly the transitive closure of I in A.
    The transitive closure of I can be determined in time linear in the size of A, 0(1(21 + I E I).
    Two such states qi and q2 are not twins if there exists a path in A from (eh, q2, 0) to (qi, q2, c), with c 0.
    Indeed, this is exactly equivalent to the existence of cycles at qi and q2 with the same input label and distinct output weights.
    According to lemma 2, it suffices to test the twins property for strings of length less than 21(2112 &#8212; 1.
    So the following gives an algorithm to test the twins property of a transducer The operations used in the algorithm (computation of the transitive closure, determination of the set of states) can all be done in polynomial time with respect to the size of A, using classical algorithms (Aho, Hoperoft, and Ullman 1974).
    0 This provides an algorithm for testing the twins property of an unambiguous trim transducer T. It is very useful whe
