icalized PCFG models for parsing by allowing much richer feature sets and simpler smoothing, while avoiding the label bias problem that may have hindered earlier classifier-based parsers (Ratnaparkhi, 1997).
    However, work in that direction has so far addressed only parse reranking (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Riezler et al., 2002).
    Full discriminative parser training faces significant algorithmic challenges in the relationship between parsing alternatives and feature values (Geman and Johnson, 2002) and in computing feature expectations.
  
  
    John Lafferty and Andrew McCallum worked with the second author on developing CRFs.
    McCallum helped by the second author implemented the first conjugategradient trainer for CRFs, which convinced us that training of large CRFs on large datasets would be practical.
    Michael Collins helped us reproduce his generalized percepton results and compare his method with ours.
