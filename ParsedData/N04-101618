djective orders.
    Each adjective pair ab is encoded as a vector of 16 features (the last eight characters of a and the last eight characters of b) and a class ((a,b) or Table 7: Performance of Altavista counts and BNC counts for adjective ordering (data from Malouf 2000) (b,a)).
    Malouf (2000) extracted 263,838 individual pairs of adjectives from the BNC which he randomly partitioned into test (10%) and training data (90%) and evaluated all the above methods for ordering prenominal adjectives.
    His results showed that a memory-based classifier that uses morphological information as well as positional probabilities as features outperforms all other methods (see Table 7).
    For the ordering task we restricted ourselves to the direct evidence strategy which simply chooses the adjective order with the highest frequency or probability (see Table 7).
    Web counts were obtained by submitting literal queries to Altavista (see Section 2).
    We used the same 263,838 adjective pairs that Malouf extracted
