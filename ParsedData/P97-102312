 possible outcomes.
    We have 90 possible predictor variables, 42 of which are linearly independent.
    Since using all the 42 independent predictors invites overfitting (Duda and Hart, 1973), we have investigated subsets of the full log-linear model for our data using the method of iterative stepwise refinement: starting with an initial model, variables are added or dropped if their contribution to the reduction or increase of the residual deviance compares favorably to the resulting loss or gain of residual degrees of freedom.
    This process led to the selection of nine predictor variables.
    We evaluated the three prediction models discussed above with and without the secondary source of morphology relations.
    For the log-linear model, we repeatedly partitioned our data into equally sized training and testing sets, estimated the weights on the training set, and scored the model's performance on the testing set, averaging the resulting scores.'
    Table 2 shows the results of these analyses.
