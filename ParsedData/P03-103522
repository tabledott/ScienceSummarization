guity (OA), and combination ambiguity (CA).
    Consider a character string ABC, if it can be segmented into two words either as AB/C or A/BC depending on different context, ABC is called an overlap ambiguity string (OAS).
    If a character string AB can be segmented either into two words, A/B, or as one word depending on different context.
    AB is called a combination ambiguity string (CAS).
    To resolve OA, we identify all OASs in the training data and replace them with a single token &lt;OAS&gt;.
    By doing so, we actually remove the portion of training data that are likely to contain OA errors.
    To resolve CA, we select 70 high-frequent two-character CAS (e.g.
    &#25165;&#33021; &#8216;talent&#8217; and &#25165;/&#33021; &#8216;just able&#8217;).
    For each CAS, we train a binary classifier (which is based on vector space models) using sentences that contains the CAS segmented manually.
    Then for each occurrence of a CAS in the initial segmented training data, the corresponding classifier
