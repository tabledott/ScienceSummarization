ssible pairs of basic clusters, and try to build a metacluster by taking the most strongly connected pair first.
    Note that in this process we may assign one basic cluster to several different metaclusters.
    When a link is found between two basic clusters that were already assigned to a metacluster, we try to put them into all the existing metaclusters it belongs to.
    However, we allow a basic cluster to be added only if it can fill all the columns in that table.
    In other words, the first two basic clusters (i.e. an initial two-row table) determines its columns and therefore define the relation of that table.
  
  
    We used twelve newspapers published mainly in the U.S. We collected their articles over two months (from Sep. 21, 2005 - Nov. 27, 2005).
    We obtained 643,767 basic patterns and 7,990 unique types.
    Then we applied metaclustering to these basic clusters and obtained 302 metaclusters (tables).
    We then removed duplicated rows and took only the tables that had 3 or more rows.
