ense in a dictionary a &amp;quot;signature&amp;quot;6 composed of the list of words appearing in the definition of that sense.
    Disambiguation was accomplished by selecting the sense of the target word whose signature contained the greatest number of overlaps with the signatures of neighboring words in its context.
    The method achieved 50-70% correct disambiguation, using a relatively fine set of sense distinctions such as those found in a typical learner's dictionary.
    Lesk's method is very sensitive to the exact wording of each definition: the presence or absence of a given word can radically alter the results.
    However, Lesk's method has served as the basis for most subsequent MRD-based disambiguation work.
    Wilks et al. (1990) attempted to improve the knowledge associated with each sense by calculating the frequency of co-occurrence for the words in definition texts, from which they derive several measures of the degree of relatedness among words.
    This metric is then used with the help
