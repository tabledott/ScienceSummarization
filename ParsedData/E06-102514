    The method is iterative, generating two sets Trkp and Trknat each iteration k, where Trkp D Trk&#8722;1 p D ... D Tr1 p = Lp and Trkn D Trk&#8722;1 n D ... D Tr1 n = Ln.
    At iteration k, Trkp is obtained by adding to Trk&#8722;1 p all synonyms of terms in Trk&#8722;1 pand all antonyms of terms in Trk&#8722;1 n ; similarly, Trknis obtained by adding to Trk&#8722;1 n all synonyms of terms in Trk&#8722;1 n and all antonyms of terms in Trk&#8722;1 p .
    If a total of K iterations are performed, then Tr = TrKp U TrKn .
    The second main feature of the method presented in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) is that terms are given vectorial representations based on their WordNet glosses (i.e. textual definitions).
    For each term ti in Tr U Te (Te being the test set, i.e. the set of terms to be classified), a textual representation of ti is generated by collating all the glosses of ti as found in WordNet4.
    Each such representation is converted into vectorial form by standard text indexi
