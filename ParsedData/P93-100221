    We then trained the model further on 20,000 sentences of the target corpus.
    Note that these 20,000 sentences were not previously aligned.
    Because of the very low error rates involved, instead of direct sampling we decided to estimate the error of the old Hansard corpus through comparison with the alignment found by Brown of the same corpus.
    We manually inspected over 500 locations where the two alignments differed to estimate our error rate on the alignments disagreed upon.
    Taking the error rate of the Brown alignment to be 0.6%, we estimated the overall error rate of our alignment to be 0.4%.
    In addition, in the Brown alignment approximately 10% of the corpus was discarded because of indications that it would be difficult to align.
    Their error rate of 0.6% holds on the remaining sentences.
    Our error rate of 0.4% holds on the entire corpus.
    Gale reports an approximate error rate of 2% on a different body of Hansard data with no discarding, and an error rate of 0.4% if
