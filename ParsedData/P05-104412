 applied to conditional densities (Jebara and Pentland, 1998) and conditional training of acoustic models with hidden variables (Valtchev et al., 1997).
    Generally speaking, CE is equivalent to some kind of EM when N(&#183;) is an equivalence relation on examples, so that the neighborhoods partition X.
    Then if q is any fixed (untrained) distribution over neighborhoods, CE equates to running EM on the model defined by CE may also be viewed as an importance sampling approximation to EM, where the sample space X is replaced by N(xi).
    We will demonstrate experimentally that CE is not just an approximation to EM; it makes sense from a modeling perspective.
    In &#167;4, we will describe neighborhoods of sequences that can be represented as acyclic lattices built directly from an observed sequence.
    The sum over Bi is then the total u-score in our model of all paths in the neighborhood lattice.
    To compute this, intersect the WFSA and the lattice, obtaining a new acyclic WFSA, and sum the u-score
