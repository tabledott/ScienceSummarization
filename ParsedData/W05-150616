hile itis represented at most once in a hyperpath.
			Thus, the k best derivations problem we solve in this paper is verydifferent in nature from the k-shortest hyperpaths prob lem in (Nielsen et al, 2005).
			However, the two problems do coincide when k = 1 (since all the sub-derivations must be optimal) and for this reason the 1-best hyperpath algorithm in (Klein andManning, 2001) is very similar to the 1-best tree algo rithm in (Knuth, 1977).
			For k-best case (k &gt; 1), they alsocoincide when the hypergraph is isomorphic to a Case Factor Diagram (CFD) (McAllester et al, 2004) (proof omitted).
			The derivation forest of CFG parsing under the CKY algorithm, for instance, can be represented as a CFD while the forest of Earley algorithm can not.
