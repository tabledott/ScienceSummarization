 coarse to distinguish 'by John' (LGS) from 'by Monday' (TMP), the lexical information may be too sparse.
    This could be assisted by clustering the lexical items into useful categories (names, dates, etc.
    ), and adding those categories as an additional feature type.
    &#8226; There is no reason to think that this work could not be integrated directly into the parsing process, particularly if one's parser is already geared partially or entirely towards feature-based statistics; the function tag information could prove quite useful within the parse itself, to rank several parses to find the most plausible.
