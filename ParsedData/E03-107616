ed systems that translate groups of words.
    One of such systems is the joint model proposed by Marcu and Wong [2002].
    We trained this sysbased statistical machine translation system.
    The ability to group split words into phrases overcomes the many mistakes of maximal (eager) splitting of words and outperforms the more accurate methods. tem with the different flavors of our training data, and evaluated the performance as before.
    Table 3 shows the results.
    Here, the eager splitting method that performed so poorly with the word based SMT system comes out ahead.
    The task of deciding the granularity of good splits is deferred to the phrase based SMT system, which uses a statistical method to group phrases and rejoin split words.
    This turns out to be even slightly better than the frequency based method.
  
  
    We introduced various methods to split compound words into parts.
    Our experimental results demonstrate that what constitutes the optimal splitting depends on the intended app
