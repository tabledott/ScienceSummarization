 examples), and three-way classification of the MS data.
    Table 13 reports the results, with the baselines computed similarly to the ones in Section 6.2.2 (for C/I, Majority is equivalent to AllTrue).
    The DM performance is also compared with the results of Merlo and Stevenson (2001) for their classifiers tested with the leave-one-out methodology (macroaveraged F has been computed on the class-by-class scores reported in that article).
    All the DM models discriminate the verb classes much more reliably than the baselines.
    The accuracy of DepDM, the worst DM model, is significantly higher than that of the best baselines, AllTrue in C/I (Fisher test, p = 0.024) and Majority on MS (p = 0.039).
    TypeDM is again our best model.
    Its performance is comparable to the lower range of the Merlo and Stevenson classifiers (considering the large confidence intervals due to the small sample size, the accuracy of TypeDM is not significantly below even that of the top model NoPass; p = 0.43).
    The TypeD
