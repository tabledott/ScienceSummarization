allows the computation of p(flh) for any f from the space of possible futures, F, for every h from the space of possible histories, H. A &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; in maximum entropy is all of the conditioning data which enables you to make a decision among the space of futures.
    In the named entity problem, we could reformulate this in terms of finding the probability of f associated with the token at index tin the test corpus as: P(f Iht) = P f Itest corpus relative to token t ) ( Information derivable from the ) The computation of p(f1h) in M.E. is dependent on a set of &amp;quot;features&amp;quot; which, hopefully, are helpful in making a prediction about the future.
    Like most current M.E. modeling efforts in computational linguistics we restrict ourselves to features which are binary functions of the history and future.
    For instance, one of our features is Here &amp;quot;current-token-capitalized(h)&amp;quot; is a binary function which returns true if the &amp;quot;current token&amp;quot; of
