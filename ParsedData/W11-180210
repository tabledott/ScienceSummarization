1.95% and Miwa10, 53.29%.
    The biggest improvement is made to the Regulation events (40.11%&#8212;*46.97%) which requires a complex modeling for recursive event structure - an event may become an argument of another event.
    The second ranked system, UMass, shows the best performance on the full paper collection.
    It suggests that what FAUST obtained from the model combination might be a better optimization to abstracts.
    The ConcordU system is notable as it is the sole rule-based system that is ranked above the average.
    It shows a performance optimized for precision with relatively low recall.
    The same tendency is roughly replicated by other rule-based systems, CCP-BTMG, TM-SCS, XABioNLP, and HCMUS.
    It suggests that a rule-based system might not be a good choice if a high coverage is desired.
    However, the performance of ConcordU for simple events suggests that a high precision can be achieved by a rule based system with a modest loss of recall.
    It might be more true when the ta
