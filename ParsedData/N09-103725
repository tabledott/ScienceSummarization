 are only used at test time; training of the components is still independent.
    These models also have the potential to suffer from search errors and are not guaranteed to find the optimal output.
  
  
    We presented a discriminatively trained joint model of parsing and named entity recognition, which improved performance on both tasks.
    Our model is based on a discriminative constituency parser, with the data, grammar, and features carefully constructed for the joint task.
    In the future, we would like to add other levels of annotation available in the OntoNotes corpus to our model, including word sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling.
