ay be improved if more sophisticated methods and larger corpora are used to establish similarity between words (such as in Hindle 1990).
    In particular, an enhancement of our disambiguation method, using similarity-based estimation (Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993), was evaluated recently.
    In this evaluation the applicability of the disambiguation method was increased by 15%, with only a slight decrease in the precision.
    The increased applicability was achieved by disambiguating additional cases in which statistical data were not available for any of the alternative tuples, whereas data were available for other tuples containing similar words.
    6.2.2 Conflicting Data.
    In very few cases two alternatives were supported equally by the statistical data, thus preventing a selection.
    In such cases, both alternatives are valid at the independent level of the syntactic relation, but may be inappropriate for the specific context.
    For instance, the two alternatives of 'to take a job' or 'to
