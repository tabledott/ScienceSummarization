 multiple systems are ranked according to some performance metrics.
    To estimate the significance of these correlation statistics, we applied bootstrap resampling, generating random samples of the 919 different sentence segments.
    The lower and upper values of 95% confidence interval are also shown in the table.
    Dark (green) cells are the best correlation numbers in their categories and light gray cells are statistically equivalent to the best numbers in their categories.
    Analyzing all runs according to the adequacy and fluency table, we make the following observations: Applying the stemmer achieves higher correlation with adequacy but keeping case information achieves higher correlation with fluency except for BLEU7-12 (only BLEU12 is shown).
    For example, the Pearson&#8217;s p (P) correlation of ROUGE-S* with adequacy increases from 0.85 (Case) to 0.95 (Stem) while its Pearson&#8217;s p correlation with fluency drops from 0.84 (Case) to 0.78 (Stem).
    We will focus our discussions on the
