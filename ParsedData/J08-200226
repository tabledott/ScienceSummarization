is formula uses the number of true positive, false positive, and false negative spans in a given guessed labeling.
    True positive is the number of spans whose correct label is one of the core or modifier argument labels (not NONE) and whose guessed label is the same as the correct label.
    False positive is the number of spans whose guessed label is non-NONE and whose correct label is different from the guessed label (possibly NONE).
    False negative is the number of spans whose correct label is non-NONE and whose guessed label is not the same as the correct one (possibly NONE).
    In the figures in this paper we show F-Measure multiplied by 100 so that it is in the same range as Whole Frame Accuracy.
    Core Argument Measures (CORE).
    These measures score the system on core arguments only, without regard to modifier arguments.
    They can be obtained by first mapping all non-core argument labels in the guessed and correct labelings to NONE.
    Coarse Modifier Argument Measures (COARSEARGM).
