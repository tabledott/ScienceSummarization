ored alternative models for the automatic acquisition of extraction patterns.
    We proposed a model based on arbitrary subtrees of dependency trees.
    The result of the experiment confirmed that the Subtree model allows a gain in recall while preserving high precision.
    We also discussed the effect of the weight tuning in TF/IDF scoring and showed an unsupervised way of adjusting it.
    There are several ways in which our pattern model may be further improved.
    In particular, we would like to relax the restraint that all the fills must be tagged with their proper NE tags by introducing a GENERIC place-holder into the extraction patterns.
    By allowing a GENERIC place-holder to match with anything as long as the context of the pattern is matched, the extraction patterns can extract the entities that are not tagged properly.
    Also patterns with a GENERIC place-holder can be applied to slots that are not names.
    Thus, the acquisition method described in Section 3 can be used to find the patter
