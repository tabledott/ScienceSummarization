o text fragments, our annotation subsumes the one proposed in RTE campaigns.
    This allows for the cost-effective generation of RTE-like annotations from the acquired cor15Although by projecting annotations the ENG1/ITA and ENG1/GER CLTE corpora came for free, the ITA1/ITA, ITA1/ENG, and ITA1/GER combinations created by crowdsourcing translations added 45 USD and approximately 5 days to these figures. pora by combining ENG&#8596;ENG1 and ENG&#8594;ENG1 pairs to form 940 positive examples (449+491), keeping the 680 ENG&#8592;ENG1 as negative examples.
    Moreover, by swapping ENG and ENG1 in the unidirectional entailment pairs, 491 additional negative examples and 680 positive examples can be easily obtained.
    Finally, the output of HITs 1-2-3 in Table 1 represents per se a valuable collection of 1,205 paraphrases.
    This suggests the great potential of crowdsourcing for paraphrase acquisition.
    Through manual verification of more than 50% of the corpus (900 pairs), a total number of 53 pairs (5.9%)
