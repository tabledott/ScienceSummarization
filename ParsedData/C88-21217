xiliary or derived by adjunction).
  The resulting tree is called a derived tree.
  Let t~ be atree containing a node n labeled by X and let # be an auxiliary tree whose root node is also labeled by X.
  Then the adjunction of fl to a at node n results a tree 7 as shown in Figure 1.
  Adjunetion enables to factor recursion from local dependencies.
  aNote that  a CFG in Greibach normal  form can be lexicallzed trivially.
  But since G~eihach normal  form of a given CFG might not generate the same tree set as  the  original grammar,  it cannot be used as a 8.eneral method for lexicaUzation.
  (a) (g) A Figure 1: The mechanism of adjunction The previous CFG can be lexicalized by using adjunc- tion as follows: 4 s NP VP NP VP I I A v n adv VP The auxiliary tree rooted by VP can be inserted in the S tree on tile VP node by adjunction.
  Using adjunction one is thus able to choose the appropriate l xical item as head.
  This example illustrates the fact that a CFG with no recursive chain rules can be lexicalized i
