 clause with respect to the semantic bits, for example.
    The setting that had been delivered to the node during the top-down cycle is retained and sent forward during the bottom-up cycle, but not communicated to the node's children.
    Another special blocking property can be associated with certain features, but the block only applies at the point where an [end] node returns a solution to a parent.
    This is true, for instance, of the mode for the verb.
    Along with the syntactic and semantic features, there are also two slots that are concerned with the trace mechanism, and these are used as well for semantic filtering on key information from the past.
    There are some special operations concerned with filling these slots and unifying semantics with these slots that will be described in more detail in later sections.
    Lexical entries contain three-tuple specifications of values for features; the fourth element is irrelevant since there are no separate top-down and bottom-up cycles.
    Thus a t
