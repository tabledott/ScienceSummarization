 parsed by SUNDANCE, our heuristic-based partial parser developed at the University of Utah.
    We generated the Si extractions by processing the first sentence of all training texts.
    This produced 849 definite NPs.
    Using these NPs as input to the existential head pattern algorithm, we generated 297 EHPs.
    The DO list was built by using only those NPs which appeared at least 5 times in the corpus and 100% of the time as definites.
    We generated the DO list in two iterations, once for head nouns alone and once for full NPs, resulting in a list of 65 head nouns and 321 full NPs6.
    Once the methods had been trained, we classified each definite NP in the test set as referential or existential using the algorithm in Figure 5.
    Figure 6 graphically represents the main elements of the algorithm.
    Note that we applied vaccines to the Si and EHP lists, but not to the DO list because gaining entry to the DO list is much more difficult &#8212; an NP must occur at least 5 times in the training cor
