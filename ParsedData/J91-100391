&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;plough,&amp;quot; which are more simple to represent in a network structure (like the sense-network of CS) so that analogies can be found between those concepts.
    We return here to Gibbs' point concerning the traditional notion of literal meaning that [1] all sentences have literal meanings that are entirely determined by the meanings of their component words and that [2] the literal meaning of a sentence is its meaning independent of context.
    Although [1] and [2] are both presently true of CS, there are means by which context can be introduced more actively into sentence interpretation.
    At present, the meaning of a sentence in CS &#8212; whether literal or nonliteral &#8212; is not derived entirely independently of context; however, the only context used is a limited notion of relevance which is generated by collation from within the sentence being analyzed: what is relevant is given by the sense of the main sentence verb.
    Nevertheless, because of this notion of releva
