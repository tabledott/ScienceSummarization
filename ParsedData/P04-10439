 defined as the set of features of the object &lt;p, a&gt;.
    Since in our representations we have only one An example of features in Y&#57739; is given in Figure 4 where the whole set of fragments, F&#57739;deliver,Arg1, of the argument structure Fdeliver,Arg1, is shown (see also Figure 2).
    It is worth noting that the allowed sub-trees contain the entire (not partial) production rules.
    For instance, the sub-tree [NP [D a]] is excluded from the set of the Figure 4 since only a part of the production NP &#8212;* D N is used in its generation.
    However, this constraint does not apply to the production VP &#8212;* V NP PP along with the fragment [VP [V NP]] as the subtree [VP [PP [...]]] is not considered part of the semantic structure.
    Thus, in step 1, an argument structure Fp,a is mapped in a fragment set F&#57739;p,a.
    In step 2, this latter is mapped into x&#57742; = (x1,..,x|F&#57738;|) E R|F&#57738;|, where xi is equal to the number of times that f&#57738;i occurs in F&#57739;p,a2.
