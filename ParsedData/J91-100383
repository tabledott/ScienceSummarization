   The left side of Figure 20 shows the knowledge representation part of the sentence representation: a simple case-frame based representation of (20).
    The right side of Figure 20, within the grey partition, is the coherence representation component of the sentence representation: abridged semantic vectors for the two main semantic dependencies in (20).
    The upper semantic vector is the match of the target carl against the source animall.
    The lower semantic vector is the match of the target gasoline1 against the source drinkl, the noun sense.
    The upper abridged semantic vector indicates a metaphorical relation.
    The lower semantic vector also indicates a metaphorical relation though, as was noted earlier, &amp;quot;drinking gasoline&amp;quot; when interpreted in isolation is surely anomalous.
    The underlines in Figure 20 denote pointers linking the semantic vectors to the case frame.
    The grey vertical arrows show that the two semantic vectors are also linked Sentence representation fo
