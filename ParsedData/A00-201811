to compute p(t 1, lp, tp, lb, lg, hp).
    We can now rewrite this in the form of Equation 5 as follows: Here we have sequentially conditioned on steadily increasing portions of c's history.
    In many cases this is clearly warranted.
    For example, it does not seem to make much sense to condition on, say, hp without first conditioning on ti,.
    In other cases, however, we seem to be conditioning on apples and oranges, so to speak.
    For example, one can well imagine that one might want to condition on the parent's lexical head without conditioning on the left sibling, or the grandparent label.
    One way to do this is to modify the simple version shown in Equation 6 to allow this: Note the changes to the last three terms in Equation 7.
    Rather than conditioning each term on the previous ones, they are now conditioned only on those aspects of the history that seem most relevant.
    The hope is that by doing this we will have less difficulty with the splitting of conditioning events, and thus somew
