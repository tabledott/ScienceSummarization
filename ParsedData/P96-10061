 of a word are listed as its various senses in a dictionary.
    The task of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is to identify the correct sense of a word in context.
    Improvement in the accuracy of identifying the correct word sense will result in better machine translation systems, information retrieval systems, etc.
    For example, in machine translation, knowing the correct word sense helps to select the appropriate target words to use in order to translate into a target language.
    In this paper, we present a new approach for WSD using an exemplar-based learning algorithm.
    This approach integrates a diverse set of knowledge sources to disambiguate word sense, including part of speech (POS) of neighboring words, morphological form, the unordered set of surrounding words, local collocations, and verb-object syntactic relation.
    To evaluate our WSD program, named LEXAS (LEXical Ambiguity-resolving System), we tested it on a common data set involving the noun &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; used by Br
