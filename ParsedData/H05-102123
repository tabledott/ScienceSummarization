s the translation performance improvements found over smaller training bitexts.
			We also find additional gains by applying MET to optimize the scaling parameters that are applied to the WFST component distributions within the TTM(Equation 1).
			In this procedure, the scale factor applied to the MJ-1 VT Phrase Translation and Re ordering component is estimated along with scale factors applied to the other model components; in other words, the ML-estimated phrase reorderingmodel itself is not affected by MET, but the likeli hood that it assigns to a phrase sequence is scaled by a single, discriminatively optimized weight.
			The improvements from MET (see rows MET-Basic andMET- IBM1) demonstrate that the MJ-1 VT reordering models can be incorporated within a discrimi native optimized translation system incorporating a variety of models and estimation procedures.
