 observed above, in many of these cases the writer seems to rely on the reader's capability to add a new object such as the Illinois Commerce Commission to her or his model of the world, rather than expecting that object to be already present.
    As already mentioned, we are in the course of implementing a system capable of performing the classification task semiautomatically (Vieira 1998).
    This system would help the human classifiers by suggesting possible classifications, and possible antecedents in the case of discourse-related definite descriptions.
    Our system implements the dual-processing strategy discussed above.
    On the one hand, it attempts to resolve anaphoric same head definite descriptions by maintaining a simple discourse model and searching back into this model to find all possible antecedents of a definite description (using special matching heuristics to deal with preand postmodification).
    On the other, it uses heuristics to identify unfamiliar and larger situation definite des
