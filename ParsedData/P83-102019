 the structure built by the parser may appear to change, but from the parser's point of view, the description remains indelible.
    The situation we describe is not far from that which occurs as the usual case in the communication of descriptions of objects between individuals.
    Suppose Don says to you, standing before you wearing a brown tweed jacket, &amp;quot;My coat is too warm&amp;quot;.
    The phrase &amp;quot;my coat&amp;quot; can refer to any coat that Don owns, yet you will undoubtedly take the phrase to refer to the brown tweed jacket.
    Given that descriptions are always necessarily partial, there must always be a conventional standard referent for a description.
    But now suppose that Don says &amp;quot;My blue coat is too warm&amp;quot;.
    He merely adds &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; to the phrase &amp;quot;my coat&amp;quot;, but the set of possible referents changes, and in fact shrinks.
    More to the point, you will now take the referent of the phrase &amp;quot;my blue coat&amp;quot; to
