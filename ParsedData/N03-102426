ur FSA.
    Even when we add the tenth translation to our FSA, we still improve its predictive power.
    The second column shows that the more sentences we add to the FSA the larger the difference between its predictive power and that of a simple set.
    The results in Table 6 suggest that our FSA may be used in order to refine the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002).
  
  
    In this paper, we presented a new syntax-based algorithm that learns paraphrases from a newly available dataset.
    The multiple translation corpus that we use in this paper is the first instance in a series of similar corpora that are built and made publicly available by LDC in the context of a series of DARPA-sponsored MT evaluations.
    The algorithm we proposed constructs finite state representations of paraphrases that are useful in many contexts: to induce large lists of lexical and structural paraphrases; to generate semantically equivalent renderings of a given meaning; and to estimate the quality of machine translation sys
