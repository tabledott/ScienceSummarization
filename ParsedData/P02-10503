ts to art assumption that the crosslanguage alignment resembles a Itomomorphism relating the syntactic graph of E to the syntactic graph of F.2 Wu's SITG makes this assumption, under the interpretation that R is the head-modifier relation expressed in a rewrite rule.
    The IBM MT models (Brown et al., 1993) do not respect the DCA, but neither do they attempt to model arty higher level syntactic relationship between constituents within or across languages the translation model (alignments) and the language model are statistically independent.
    In Yamada and Knight's (2001) extension of the IBM models, on the other hand, grammatical information from the source language is propagated into the noisy channel, and the grammatical transformations in their channel model appear to respect direct correspondence.3 The simultaneous parsing and alignment algorithm of Alshawi et al. (2000) is essentially art implementation of the DCA in which relationship R has no linguistic import (i.e. anything can be a head).
