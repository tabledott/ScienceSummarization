ften by more than a factor of ten.
    We plan to investigate how to adapt cube growing to phrasebased and hierarchical phrase-based systems.
    These forest rescoring algorithms have potential applications to other computationally intensive tasks involving combinations of different models, for example, head-lexicalized parsing (Collins, 1997); joint parsing and semantic role labeling (Sutton and McCallum, 2005); or tagging and parsing with nonlocal features.
    Thus we envision forest rescoring as being of general applicability for reducing complicated search spaces, as an alternative to simulated annealing methods (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983).
