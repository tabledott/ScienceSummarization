re 7, illustrates the implementation f both the OA and SA constraint.
  The view of the root node of a from below .suggests that b statement for this node makes the assertion that the value of the tense attribute is - (or untensed).
  However, the t statement should assert ense : + (since every complete sentence must be telised) 5.
  Thus, an auxiliary tree whose root node will correspond to a tensed sentence and whose foot node will dominate an untensed sentence can be adjoined at this node.
  Therefore, only those auxiliary trees whose main verb subcate- 5t statement is more complicated than just "view from the top", t ~tatement is a statement about the node wlfile viewing the node from the top, and hence is a statement eoncenfing the entire subtree below this node (i.e., including the part due to an auxiliary tree adjoined at the node), and ho w it constrains the derivation of the nodes wlfich are its siblings alld ancestors, bremains the same as before, and is the statement about this node and the subtree
