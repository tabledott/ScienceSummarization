    We use an archive of messages collected over the first week of March 2010 from the &#8220;Gardenhose&#8221; sample stream,3 which then consisted of 15% of all public messages, totaling millions per day.
    We aggressively filter this stream, using only messages that are tagged with physical (latitude, longitude) coordinate pairs from a mobile client, and whose authors wrote at least 20 messages over this period.
    We also filter to include only authors who follow fewer than 1,000 other people, and have fewer than 1,000 followers.
    Kwak et al. (2010) find dramatic shifts in behavior among users with social graph connectivity outside of that range; such users may be marketers, celebrities with professional publicists, news media sources, etc.
    We also remove messages containing URLs to eliminate bots posting information such as advertising or weather conditions.
    For interpretability, we restrict our attention to authors inside a bounding box around the contiguous U.S. states, yielding
