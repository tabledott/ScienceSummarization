er, these come from parallel text that has been shallowly parsed via a method known as bilingual bracketing.
    Three teams approached the shared task with baseline or prototype systems.
    Fourday combines several intuitive baselines via a nearest neighbor classifier, RACAI carries out a greedy alignment based on an automatically extracted dictionary of translations, and UMD&#8217;s implementation of IBM Model 2 provides an experimental platform for their future work incorporating prior knowledge about cognates.
    All three of these systems were developed within a short period of time before and during the shared task.
  
  
    Tables 4 and 5 list the results obtained by participating systems in the Romanian-English task.
    Similarly, results obtained during the English-French task are listed in Tables 6 and 7.
    For Romanian-English, limited resources, XRCE systems (XRCE.Nolem-56k.RE.2 and XRCE.Trilex.RE.3) seem to lead to the best results.
    These are systems that are based on GIZA++, with or wi
