s of all its paths (Eisner, 2002) using a simple dynamic programming algorithm akin to the forward algorithm.
    The sum over Ai may be computed similarly.
    CE with lattice neighborhoods is not confined to the WFSAs of this paper; when estimating weighted CFGs, the key algorithm is the inside algorithm for lattice parsing (Smith and Eisner, 2005).
    To maximize the neighborhood likelihood (Eq.
    7), we apply a standard numerical optimization method (L-BFGS) that iteratively climbs the function using knowledge of its value and gradient (Liu and Nocedal, 1989).
    The partial derivative of ,GN with respect to the jth feature weight &#952;j is Viewed as a CE method, this approach (though effective when there are few hypotheses) seems misguided; the objective says to move mass to each example at the expense of all other training examples.
    This looks similar to the gradient of log-linear likelihood functions on complete data, though the expectation on the left is in those cases replaced by an observed
