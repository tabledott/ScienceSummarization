    It was found that each collocation indicated a particular sense with a very high degree of reliability, with the most successful&#8212;the first word to the left of a noun&#8212;achieving 99% precision.
    Yet collocates have limited applicability; although precise, they can only be applied to a limited number of tokens.
    Yarowsky (1995) dealt with this problem largely by producing an unsupervised learning algorithm that generates probabilistic decision list models of word senses from seed collocates.
    This algorithm achieves 97% correct disambiguation.
    In these experiments Yarowsky deals exclusively with binary sense distinctions and evaluates his highly effective algorithms on small samples of word tokens.
    Ng and Lee (1996) explored an approach to WSD in which a word is assigned the sense of the most similar example already seen.
    They describe this approach as &amp;quot;exemplar-based learning&amp;quot; although it is also known as k-nearest neighbor lear
