ls have been suc- cessfully used for a long time (Jelinek, 1976).
			Us- ing the same basic principles, we can rewrite the probability by introducing the 'hidden' alignments af := al. . .aj . . .aa for a sentence pair If,a; e{\]: Pr(f~al es) = ~_,Vr(fal, aT\[ eI't, a7 ,1 = ~ 1-IP"(k,"stfT-',"{ -*,e/) a I j=l So far there has been no basic restriction of the approach.
			We now assume a first-order depen- dence on the alignments aj only: Vr(fj,aslf{ -~, J-* a I , e l ) where, in addition, we have assmned that tile translation probability del)ends only oil aj and not oil aj-:l. Putting everything together, we have the ibllowing llMM-based model: a Pr(f:i'le{) = ~ I-I \[p(ajlaj - ' , l).p(Y)lea,)\] (4) af J=, with the following ingredients: ? IlMM alignment probability: p(i\]i', I) or p(a j la j _ l , I ) ; ? translation probabflity: p(f\]e).
			In addition, we assume that the t{MM align- ment probabilities p(i\[i', \[) depend only on the jump width (i - i').
