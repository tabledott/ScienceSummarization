  Named Entity Recognition Through Classifier Combination
  
    This paper presents a classifier-combination experimental framework for named entity recognition in which four diverse classifiers (robust linear classifier, maximum entropy, transformation-based learning, and hidden Markov model) are combined under different conditions.
    When no gazetteer or other additional training resources are used, the combined system attains a performance of 91.6F on the English development data; integrating name, location and person gazetteers, and named entity systems trained on additional, more general, data reduces the F-measure error by a factor of 15 to 21% on the English data.
  
  
    This paper investigates the combination of a set of diverse statistical named entity classifiers, including a rule-based classifier &#8211; the transformation-based learning classifier (Brill, 1995; Florian and Ngai, 2001, henceforth fnTBL) with the forward-backward extension described in Florian (2002a), a hidden Markov model c
