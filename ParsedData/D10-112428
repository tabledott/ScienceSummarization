e relationship between language and geography has been a topic of interest to linguists since the nineteenth century (Johnstone, 2010).
    An early work of particular relevance is Kurath&#8217;s Word Geography of the Eastern United States (1949), in which he conducted interviews and then mapped the occurrence of equivalent word pairs such as stoop and porch.
    The essence of this approach&#8212;identifying variable pairs and measuring their frequencies&#8212; remains a dominant methodology in both dialectology (Labov et al., 2006) and sociolinguistics (Tagliamonte, 2006).
    Within this paradigm, computational techniques are often applied to post hoc analysis: logistic regression (Sankoff et al., 2005) and mixed-effects models (Johnson, 2009) are used to measure the contribution of individual variables, while hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling enable aggregated inference across multiple variables (Nerbonne, 2009).
    However, in all such work it is assumed that the relevant linguistic v
