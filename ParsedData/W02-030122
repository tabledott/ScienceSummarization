(complete) base set.
    The first column (A) in Table 3 shows an adding case where the base feature set is {w[&#8722;2,&#183;&#183;&#183;,2]}.
    The columns (B) and (C) show subtracting cases where the base feature set is {hw, pre, suf, sub, pos, hmmi[&#8722;k,&#183;&#183;&#183; ,k], lwck, rwck, pc[&#8722;2,&#8722;1]} with k = 2 and k = 3 respectively.
    The kernel function is the inner product.
    We can see that word cache and HMM state features surely improve the recognition accuracy.
    In the table, we also included the accuracy change for other standard features.
    Preceeding classes and suffixes are definitely helpful.
    On the other hand, the substring feature is not effective in our setting.
    Although the effects of part-of-speech tags and prefixes are not so definite, it can be said that they are practically effective since they show positive effects in the case of the maximum performance.
    In this set of experiments, we compare our SVM-based system with a named entity recognition s
