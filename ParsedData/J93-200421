ctions were signif- icant.
  The average speed for correcting was more than twice as fast as the average speed for tagging: 20 minutes vs. 44 minutes per 1,000 words.
  (Median speeds per 1,000 words were 22 vs. 42 minutes.)
  A simple measure of tagging consistency is inter-annotator disagreement rate, the rate at which annotators disagree with one another over the tagging of lexical tokens, expressed as a percentage of the raw number of such disagreements over the number of words in a given text sample.
  For a given text and n annotators, there are disagreement ratios (one for each possible pair of annotators).
  Mean inter-annotator disagreement was 7.2% for the tagging task and 4.1% for the correcting task (with me- dians 7.2% and 3.6%, respectively).
  Upon examination, a disproportionate amount of disagreement i  the correcting case was found to be caused by one text that contained many instances of a cover symbol for chemical and other formulas.
  In the absence of an explicit guideline for tagging th
