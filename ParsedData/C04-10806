d to the others, as they have used different, randomized and irreproducible splits of training and test data (Brill and Kupiec), different tag sets (Merialdo) or different corpora altogether.
			The HMM taggers we have discussed so far are similar in that they use condition only on left context when estimating probabilities of tag sequences.
			Recently, Toutanova et al (2003) presented a supervised conditional Markov Model part-of-speech tagger (CMM) which exploited information coming from both left and right contexts.
			Accuracy on the Penn Treebank using two tags to the left as features in addition to the current tag was 96.10%.
			When using tag to the left and tag to the right as features in addition to the current tag, accuracy improved to 96.55%.
			Lafferty et al (2001) also compared the accuracies of several supervised part-of-speech tagging models, while examining the effect of directionality in graphical models.
			Using a 50% 50% train-test split of the Penn Treebank to assess HMMs, maximum entro
