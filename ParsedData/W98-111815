rors which the external system is likely to make.
    An example of this is that on the evaluation system the feature which predicted person_unique given a tag of person_unique by Proteus had only a 76% higher weight than the feature which predicted person_start given person_unique.
    In other words, Proteus had a tendency to chop off multi-word names at the first word.
    MENE learned this and made it easy to override Proteus in this way.
    In fact, an analysis of the differences between the Proteus output and the MENE + Proteus output turned up a significant number of instances in which MENE extended or contracted name boundaries in this way.
    Given proper training data, MENE can pinpoint and selectively correct the weaknesses of a handcoded system.
  
  
    MENE currently has no direct ability to learn compound features or &amp;quot;patterns&amp;quot;&#8212;the &amp;quot;history&amp;quot; side of a lexical feature activates based on only a single word, for instance.
