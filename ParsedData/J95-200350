    The open question is which constraints on centers are introduced at which points during processing.
    We must leave this as a topic for future work.
  
  
    This theory can be contrasted with two previous research efforts that spurred this work: Sidner's (1979) original work on immediate focusing and pronouns, and Joshi and Weinstein's (1981) subsequent work on centering and inferences.
    The centering theory discussed here is quite close to Sidner's original theory, both in attacking local discourse issues and in the general outline of approach.
    However, it differs in several details.
