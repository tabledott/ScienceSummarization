observe that the content of the thematic roles assigned by a verb is crucial for classification.
    Our results further support the assumption that thematic differences across verb classes are apparent not only in differences in subcategorization frames, but also in differences in their frequencies.
    This connection relies heavily on the hypothesis that lexical semantics and lexical syntax are correlated, following Levin (1985; 1993).
    However, this position has been challenged by Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi (1996) and Boguraev and Briscoe (1989), among others.
    For example, in an attempt to assess the actual completeness and usefulness of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) entries, Boguraev and Briscoe (1989) found that people assigned a &amp;quot;change of possession&amp;quot; meaning both to verbs that had dative-related subcategorization frames (as indicated in the LDOCE) and to verbs that did not.
    Conversely, they also found that both verbs that have a change-of-posses
