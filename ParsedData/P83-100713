 to an object even when the description has no semantic denotation.
    In one sense, this phenomenon arises within the framework of Barwise and Perry's treatment of descriptions.
    If we understand the semantic denotation of a description to be the unique object that satisfies the content of the description, if there is one, then Barwise and Perry would allow that there are referential uses of a description D that contribute objects other than the semantic denotation of D to the propositions expressed by uses of sentences in which D occurs.
    But this is only because Barwise and Perry allow that a description may be evaluated at a resource situation other than the complete situation in order to arrive at its denotation on a given occasion of use.
    Still, the denotation of the description relative to a given resource situation is the unique object in the situation that satisfies the description relative to that situation.
    The referential uses of descriptions that Donnellan gives of do seem to arise
