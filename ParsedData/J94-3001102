epts it.
    Without loss of generality we assume that E and Q are disjoint.
    We construct a rewriting grammar that simulates the operation of T, deriving a string y from a string x if and only if the pair (x, y) is accepted by T. There will be four rules in the grammar that together implement the provisions that T starts in state go, makes transitions from state to state only as allowed by 6, and accepts a string only if the state it reaches at the end of the string is in F. Let EUQU {#, $} be the alphabet of the grammar, where # is a boundary symbol not in either E or Q and $ is another distinct symbol that will be used in representing the finality of a state.
    Our rules will introduce states into the string between ordinary tape symbols and remove them to simulate the state-to-state advance of the transducer.
    The first rule in the grammar sequence is the simple start rule: The effect of this rule is to introduce the start-state as a symbol only at the beginning of the input string, as specified i
