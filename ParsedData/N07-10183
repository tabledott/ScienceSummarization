			Given their usefulness in other disciplines, we believe that Bayesian methods like these are likelyto be of general utility in computational linguis tics as well.
			As a simple illustrative example, we use these methods to infer morphological parses for verbs from Sesotho, a southern Bantu language with agglutinating morphology.
			Our results illustrate that Bayesian inference using a prior that favors sparsitycan produce linguistically reasonable analyses in sit uations in which EM does not.
			The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
			The next section introduces the background for our paper, summarizing the key ideas behind PCFGs,Bayesian inference, and MCMC.
			Section 3 intro duces our first MCMC algorithm, a Gibbs sampler for PCFGs.
			Section 4 describes an algorithm forsampling trees from the distribution over trees de fined by a PCFG.
			Section 5 shows how to integrateout the rule weight parameters ? in a PCFG, allowing us to sample directly from the posterior distribution over p
