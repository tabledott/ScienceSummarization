lid Hebrew entries lacking tags assignment, we assign all possible tags and then simulate a grammatical constraint.
    Here, all tokeninternal collocations of tags unseen in our training data are pruned away.
    From now on all lattice arcs are tagged segments and the assignment of probability P(p &#8212;* (s, p)) to lattice arcs proceeds as usual.4 A rather pathological case is when our lexical heuristics prune away all segmentation possibilities and we remain with an empty lattice.
    In such cases we use the non-pruned lattice including all (possibly ungrammatical) segmentation, and let the statistics (including OOV) decide.
    We empirically control for the effect of our heuristics to make sure our pruning does not undermine the objectives of our joint task.
  
  
    Previous work on morphological and syntactic disambiguation in Hebrew used different sets of data, different splits, differing annotation schemes, and different evaluation measures.
    Our experimental setup therefore is designed to ser
