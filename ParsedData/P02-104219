 results can be given for individual dependency relations.
    Labelled precision and recall on Section 00 for the most frequent dependency types are shown in Table 2 (for the model without distance measures).9 The columns # deps give the total number of dependencies, first the number put forward by the parser, and second the number in the gold standard.
    F-score is calculated as (2*LP*LR)/(LP+LR).
    We also give the scores for the dependencies created by the subject and object relative pronoun categories, including the headless object relative pronoun category.
    We would like to compare these results with those of other parsers that have presented dependencybased evaluations.
    However, the few that exist (Lin, 1995; Carroll et al., 1998; Collins, 1999) have used either different data or different sets of dependencies (or both).
    In future work we plan to map our CCG dependencies onto the set used by Carroll and Briscoe and parse their evaluation corpus so a direct comparison can be made.
