re space or type of analysis that is neither explicitly mirrored nor explicitly contradicted by another language.
    In theoretical linguistics, it is commonly acknowledged that what one language codes overtly may be harder to detect for another language.
    This situation has arisen in the ParGram project.
    Case features fall under this topic.
    German, Japanese, and Urdu mark NPs with overt case morphology.
    In comparison, English, French, and Norwegian make relatively little use of case except as part of the pronominal system.
    Nevertheless, the f-structure analyses for all the languages contain a case feature in the specification of noun phrases.
    This &#8220;overspecification&#8221; of information expresses deeper linguistic generalizations and keeps the fstructural analyses as parallel as possible.
    In addition, the features can be put to use for the isolated phenomena in which they do play a role.
    For example, English does not mark animacy grammatically in most situations.
