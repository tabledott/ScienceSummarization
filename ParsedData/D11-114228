    Thus, it is possible a priori that REVERB&#8217;s gains over previous systems will diminish when extraction frequency is taken into account.
    In fact, we found that REVERB&#8217;s advantage over TEXTRUNNER when run at scale is qualitatively similar to its advantage on single sentences.
    We ran both REVERB and TEXTRUNNER on Banko and Etzioni&#8217;s corpus of 500 million Web sentences and examined the effect of redundancy on precision.
    As Downey&#8217;s work predicts, precision increased in both systems for extractions found multiple times, compared with extractions found only once.
    However, REVERB had higher precision than 1543 TEXTRUNNER at all frequency thresholds.
    In fact, REVERB&#8217;s frequency 1 extractions had a precision of 0.75, which TEXTRUNNER could not approach even with frequency 10 extractions, which had a precision of 0.34.
    Thus, REVERB is able to return more correct extractions at a higher precision than TEXTRUNNER, even when redundancy is taken into account.
