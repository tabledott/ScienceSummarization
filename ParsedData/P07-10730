  Learning to Extract Relations from the Web using Minimal Supervision
  
    We present a new approach to relation extraction that requires only a handful of training examples.
    Given a few pairs of named entities known to exhibit or not exhibit a particular relation, bags of sentences containing the pairs are extracted from the web.
    We extend an existing relation extraction method to handle this weaker form of supervision, and present experimental results demonstrating that our approach can reliably extract relations from web documents.
  
  
    A growing body of recent work in information extraction has addressed the problem of relation extraction (RE), identifying relationships between entities stated in text, such as LivesIn(Person, Location) or EmployedBy(Person, Company).
    Supervised learning has been shown to be effective for RE (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2006); however, annotating large corpora with examples of the relations to be extracted is e
