  For examl)le, many words which are countable (require a determiner before the singular form) also have a generic sense in which the determiner is not required (*"Fred bought apple."
  but "Apple is a wonderflfl fla- vor.").
  For each such problematic feature we have prepared gnidelines for the elves, but these still require considerable discretion on their part.
  Fhese problems have emphasized for ns tbe impof tanee of developing a tagged corpus in conjunction with the dictionary, so that frequency of occurrence of a feature (and frequency by text type) will be avail- able.
  We have done stone preliminary tagging in par- aim with the completion of our initial dictionary.
  We expect to start tagging in earnest in early summmer.
  Our plan is to begin by tagging verbs in the Brown corpus, in order to be able to correlate our tagging with the word sense tagging being done by tim Word- Net group on the same corpus [7].
