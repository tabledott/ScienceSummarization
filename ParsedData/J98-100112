ls of depth for a translation: level 1 uses the most frequent equivalent (e.g., German schwer heavy), producing a text where 80% of the words are correctly translated; level 2 distinguishes additional meanings (e.g., schwer = difficult), producing a translation which is 90% correct; etc.
    Although the terminology is different, this is very similar to the notion of baseline tagging used in modern work (see, e.g., Gale, Church, and Yarowsky [1992b]).
    A convincing implementation of many of these ideas was made several years later, paradoxically at the moment when MT began its decline.
    Madhu and Lytle (1965), working from the observation that domain constrains sense, calculated sense frequency for texts in different domains and applied a Bayesian formula to determine the probability of each sense in a given context&#8212;a technique similar to that applied in much later work and which yielded a similar 90% correct disambiguation result (see Section 2.4).
