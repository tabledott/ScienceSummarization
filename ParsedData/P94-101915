, the similarity between two verb meanings, e. g, a target verb and a source verb, can be defined as a summation of weighted similarities between pairs of simpler concepts in each of the domains the two verbs are projected onto.
    WordSim(Vi,V2) = Ei 1471 * ConSim(C1,i,C1,2) We have implemented a prototype lexical selection system UNICON where the representations of both the English and Chinese verbs are based on a set of shared semantic domains.
    The selection information is also included in these representations, but does not have to match exactly.
    We then organize these concepts into hierarchical structures to form an interlingua conceptual base.
    The names of our concept domain constitute the artificial language on which an interlingua must be based, thus place us firmly in the knowledge based understanding MT camp.

    The input to the system is the source verb argument structure.
    After sense disambiguation, the internal sentence representation can be fo
