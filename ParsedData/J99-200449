e and the result of the adjunction.
    The root and foot nodes of the auxiliary tree must match the node label at which the auxiliary tree adjoins.
    The node being adjoined to splits, and its top FS unifies with the top FS of the root node of the auxiliary tree, while its bottom FS unifies with the bottom FS of the foot node of the auxiliary tree.
    Figure 7(b) shows an auxiliary tree and an elementary tree, and the tree resulting from an adjunction operation.
    For a parse to be well-formed, the top and bottom FS at each node should be unified at the end of a parse.
    The result of combining the elementary trees shown in Figure 6 is the derived tree, shown in Figure 8(a).
    The process of combining the elementary trees to yield a parse of the sentence is represented by the derivation tree, shown in Figure 8(b).
    The nodes of the derivation tree are the tree names that are anchored by the appropriate lexical items.
    The combining operation is indicated by the type of the arcs (a broken line
