ing portion of the release 12http://bllip.cs.brown.edu/download/rerankingparserAug06.tar.gz 13The number of lemmas in Table 6 do not add up to this number because not all of them have examples in the training data, where the total number of instantiated senses amounts to 7933.
    4.0 data.
    Given time constraints, we had to perform two modifications: i) Instead of a single model that predicts all arguments including NULL arguments, we had to use the two-stage mode where the NULL arguments are first filtered out and the remaining NON-NULL arguments are classified into one of the argument types, and ii) The argument identification module used an ensemble of ten classifiers &#8211; each trained on a tenth of the training data and performed an unweighted voting among them.
    This should still give a close to state of the art performance given that the argument identification performance tends to start to be asymptotic around 10k training instances.
    At first glance, the performance on the newswire genre
