nces, which make their preference decisions as parsing progresses, pruning subsequent parsing paths (Frazier and Fodor, 1978), (Hobbs and Bear, 1990), (Marcus 1980).
    Applying parse preferences requires comparing two subtrees spanning the same portion of the utterance.
    The parse preference mechanism begins with a simple strategy to disprefer parse trees containing specific &amp;quot;marked&amp;quot; syntax rules.
    As an example of a dispreferred rule, consider: Book those three flights to Boston.
    This sentence has a parse on which those three is a noun phrase with a missing head (consider a continuation of the discourse Three of our clients have sufficient credit).
    After penalizing such dispreferred parses, the preference mechanism applies attachment heuristics based on the work by Pereira (1985) and Shieber (1983) Pereira's paper shows how the heuristics of Minimal Attachment and Right Association (Kimball, 1973) can both be implemented using a bottom-up shift-reduce parser.
