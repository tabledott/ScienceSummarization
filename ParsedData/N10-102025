ure of conversation model quality.
    We found this measure quite useful in the development of our models and algorithms, although our experiments show that it does not necessarily correlate with interpretability.
    We have directly compared Bayesian inference to EM on our conversation ordering task, showing a clear advantage for Bayesian methods.
    Finally, we have collected a corpus of 1.3 million Twitter conversations, which we will make available to the research community, and which we hope will be useful beyond the study of dialogue.
    In the future, we wish to scale our models to the full corpus, and extend them with more complex notions of discourse, topic and community.
    Ultimately, we hope to put the learned conversation structure to use in the construction of a data-driven, conversational agent.
