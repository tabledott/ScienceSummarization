cessing.
    In the first stage, mentions are extracted and relevant information about mentions, e.g., gender and number, is prepared for the next step.
    The second stage implements the actual coreference resolution of the identified mentions.
    Sieves in this stage are sorted from highest to lowest precision.
    For example, the first sieve (i.e., highest precision) requires an exact string match between a mention and its antecedent, whereas the last one (i.e., lowest precision) implements pronominal coreference resolution.
    Post-processing is performed to adjust our output to the task specific constraints, e.g., removing singletons.
    It is important to note that the first system stage, i.e., the mention detection sieve, favors recall heavily, whereas the second stage, which includes the actual coreference resolution sieves, is precision oriented.
    Our results show that this design lead to state-of-the-art performance despite the simplicity of the individual components.
    This strategy has b
