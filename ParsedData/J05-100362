on development data for the optimal value for a (0.0025).
    The y-axis is the level of accuracy (100 is the baseline score), and the x-axis is the number of rounds of boosting. idea of weights Si,j representing the importance of examples.
    Thus far, in the experiments in this article, we have used the definition thereby weighting examples in proportion to their difference in score from the correct parse for the sentence in question.
    In this section we compare this approach to a default definition of Si,j, namely, Si,j 1/4 1 &#240;23&#222; Using this definition, we trained the ExpLoss method on the same training set for several values of the smoothing parameter a and evaluated the performance on development data.
    Table 3 compares the peak performance achieved under the two definitions of Si,j on the development set.
    It can be seen that the definition in equation (22) outperforms the simpler method in equation (23).
