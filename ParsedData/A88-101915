    Moreover, it is worth doing so, because bigram and trigram statistics are much easier to obtain than Fidditch-type disambiguation rules, which are extremely tedious to program, test and debug.
    In addition, the proposed stochastic approach can naturally take advantage of lexical probabilities in a way that is not easy to capture with parsers that do not make use of frequency information.
    Consider, for example, the word &amp;quot;see,&amp;quot; which is almost always a verb, but does have an archaic nominal usage as in &amp;quot;the Holy See.&amp;quot; For practical purposes, &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; should not be considered noun/verb ambiguous in the same sense as truly ambiguous words like &amp;quot;program,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;house&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wind&amp;quot;; the nominal usage of &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; is possible, but not likely.
