en.5 If the ratio is exactly unity, the analyser guesses left-branching, although this is fairly rare for conceptual association as shown by the experimental results below.
    For the adjacency model, when the given compound is w1w2w3, we can estimate this ratio as: In both cases, we sum over all possible categories for the words in the compound.
    Because the dependency model equations have two factors, they are affected more severely by data sparseness.
    If the probability estimate for Pr(t2 t9 is zero for all possible categories 12 and 13 then both the numerator and the denominator will be zero.
    This will conceal any preference given by the parameters involving 11.
    In such cases, we observe that the test instance itself provides the information that the event 12 t3 can occur and we recalculate the ratio using Pr(12 19 = Jr for all possible categories 12,13 where k is any non-zero constant.
    However, no correction is made to the probability estimates for Pr(ti t2) and Pr(ti 13) for unseen c
