y possible, the extractions are still restricted to a specific ontology.
    Many systems have used syntactic patterns based on verbs to extract relation phrases, usually relying on a full dependency parse of the input sentence (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Stevenson, 2004; Specia and Motta, 2006; Kathrin Eichler and Neumann, 2008).
    Our work differs from these approaches by focusing on relation phrase patterns expressed in terms of POS tags and NP chunks, instead of full parse trees.
    Banko and Etzioni (Banko and Etzioni, 2008) showed that a small set of POS-tag patterns cover a large fraction of relationships in English, but never incorporated the patterns into an extractor.
    This paper reports on a substantially improved model of binary relation phrases, which increases the recall of the Banko-Etzioni model (see Section 3.3).
    Further, while previous work in Open IE has mainly focused on syntactic patterns for relation extraction, we introduce a lexical constraint that boosts precision and recall.
