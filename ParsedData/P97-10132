gnizes discourse usages of cue phrases and that determines clause boundaries within sentences.
    Lastly, we present the rhetorical parser and an example of its operation (section 4).
  
  
    The mathematical foundations of the rhetorical parsing algorithm rely on a first-order formalization of valid text structures (Marcu, 1997).
    The assumptions of the formalization are the following.
    1.
    The elementary units of complex text structures are non-overlapping spans of text.
    2.
    Rhetorical, coherence, and cohesive relations hold between textual units of various sizes.
    3.
    Relations can be partitioned into two classes: paratactic and hypotactic.
    Paratactic relations are those that hold between spans of equal importance.
    Hypotactic relations are those that hold between a span that is essential for the writer's purpose, i.e., a nucleus, and a span that increases the understanding of the nucleus but is not essential for the writer's purpose, i.e., a satellite.
