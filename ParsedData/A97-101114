here the tags are almost equivalent to those used by the English Constraint Grammar, and the final result equals Figure 2, where only the dependencies between the words and certain tags are printed.
    Some comments concerning the rules in the toy grammar (Figure 3) are in order: The rule states: the first noun phrase head label to the right is a subject (OSOBJ), link subj exists and is followed up to the finite verb (0+F) in a verb chain (v-ch), which is then followed up to the main verb.
    Then object or complement links are followed downwards (BOTTOM), to the last verbal reading (here decide).

Note that the conditions TOP and BOTTOM follow the chain of named link, if any, to the upper or lower end of a chain of a
