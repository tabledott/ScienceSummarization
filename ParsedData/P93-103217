l a useful exercise to undertake, as one can attain a high token success rate by just being able to accurately detect the most common subcategorization test, 40 verbs were selected (using a random number generator) from a list of 2000 common verbs.'
    Table 2 gives the subcategorizations listed in the OALD (recoded where necessary according to my classification of sub categorizations) and those in the subcategorization dictionary acquired by my program in a compressed format.
    Next to each verb, listing just a subcategorization frame means that it appears in both the OALD and my subcategorization dictionary, a subcategorization frame preceded by a minus sign (&#8212;) means that the subcategorization frame only appears in the OALD, and a subcategorization frame preceded by a plus sign (+) indicates one listed only in my program's subcategorization dictionary (i.e., one that is probably wrong).15 The numbers are the number of cues that the program saw for each sub catframes.
    14The number 2000 is arbit
