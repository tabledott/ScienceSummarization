  Efficient Parsing For Bilexical Context-Free Grammars And Head Automaton Grammars
  
    stochastic parsers use grammars, where each word type idiosyncratically prefers particular complements with parhead words.
    We present parsing algorithms for two bilexical formalisms, improvthe prior upper bounds of For a comspecial case that was known to allow (Eisner, 1997), we present an algorithm with an improved grammar constant.
  
  
    Lexicalized grammar formalisms are of both theoretical and practical interest to the computational linguistics community.
    Such formalisms specify syntactic facts about each word of the language&#8212;in particular, the type of arguments that the word can or must take.
    Early mechanisms of this sort included categorial grammar (Bar-Hillel, 1953) and subcategorization frames (Chomsky, 1965).
    Other lexicalized formalisms include (Schabes et al., 1988; Mel'euk, 1988; Pollard and Sag, 1994).
    Besides the possible arguments of a word, a natural-language grammar does w
