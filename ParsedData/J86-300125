on believe other facts.
    As the above list makes clear, the range of intentions that can serve as discourse, or discourse segment, purposes is open-ended (cf.
    Wittgenstein 1953: paragraph 23), much like the range of intentions that underlie more general purposeful action.
    There is no finite list of discourse purposes, as there is, say, of syntactic categories.
    It remains an unresolved research question whether there is a finite description of the open-ended set of such intentions.
    However, even if there were finite descriptions, there would still be no finite list of intentions from which to choose.
    Thus, a theory of discourse structure cannot depend on choosing the DP/DSPs from a fixed list (cf.
    Reichman-Adar 1984, Schank et al. 1982, Mann and Thompson 1983), nor on the particulars of individual intentions.
    Although the particulars of individual intentions, like a wide range of common sense knowledge, are crucial to understanding any discourse, such particulars cannot serve as
