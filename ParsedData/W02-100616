    In this paper, our reported results are based on the official fine-grained scoring method.
    To compute an average recall figure over a set of words, we can either adopt micro-averaging (mi) or macro-averaging (ma), defined by: total no. of test instances correctly labeled mi total no. of test instances in all word tasks That is, micro-averaging treats each test instance equally, so that a word task with many test instances will dominate the micro-averaged recall.
    On the other hand, macro-averaging treats each word task equally.
    As shown in Table 2 and Table 3, the best microaveraged recall for SENSEVAL-2 (SENSEVAL-1) is 65.4% (79.2%), obtained by combining all knowledge sources (without feature selection) and using SVM as the learning algorithm.
    In Table 4, we tabulate the best micro-averaged recall for each learning algorithm, broken down according to nouns, verbs, adjectives, indeterminates (for SENSEVAL-1), and all words.
    We also tabulate analo
