seem to have a name at all, e.g., Hovy [1988] simply refers to 'pre-generation textplanning tasks'.
    I use the JOYCE term here because I think it is the least ambiguous.
    The specific tasks performed by the sentence planner include: Relatively little is said in the papers about clause grouping and referring-expression generation, but more information is available on the first task, mapping domain entities onto linguistic entities.
    All the examined systems except perhaps PENMAN use a variant of what I have elsewhere called the 'structuremapping' approach [Reiter, 1991];2 I do not know what approach PENMAN uses (the papers are not clear on this).
    Structure-mapping is based on a dictionary that lists the semantic-net equivalents of linguistic resources [Meteer, 1991] such as content words and grammatical relationships.
    This dictionary might, for example, indicate that the English word sisteris equivalent (in the domain knowledge-base of interest) to the structure Sibling with attribute Sex:Fema
