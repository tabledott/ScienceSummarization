			Of course, the success of the distributional approachdepends on the existence of recurrent patterns.
			In arbi trary document collections, such patterns might be toovariable to be easily detected by statistical means.
			How ever, research has shown that texts from the same domain tend to exhibit high similarity (Wray, 2002).

			Content models are Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) wherein states correspond to typesof information characteristic to the domain of interest (e.g., earthquake magnitude or previous earth quake occurrences), and state transitions capture possible information-p
