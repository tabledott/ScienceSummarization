    For example, &amp;quot;male&amp;quot; is mapped to the second sense of the noun male in WordNet, &amp;quot;location&amp;quot; is mapped to the first sense of the noun location, and so on.
    The semantic class determination module assumes that the semantic class for every markable extracted is the first sense of the head noun of the markable.
    Since WordNet orders the senses of a noun by their frequency, this is equivalent to choosing the most frequent sense as the semantic class for each noun.
    If the selected semantic class of a markable is a subclass of one of our defined semantic classes C, then the semantic c
