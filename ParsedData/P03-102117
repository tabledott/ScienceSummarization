sing minimum edit distance, the results of the MMI criterion are biased toward mWER.
    It can be expected that by using a suitably definedgram precision to define the pseudo-references for MMI instead of using edit distance, it is possible to obtain better BLEU or NIST scores.
    An important part of the differences in the translation scores is due to the different translation length (last column in Table 3).
    The mWER and MMI criteria prefer shorter translations which are heavily penalized by the BLEU and NIST brevity penalty.
    We observe that the smoothed error count gives almost identical results to the unsmoothed error count.
    This might be due to the fact that the number of parameters trained is small and no serious overfitting occurs using the unsmoothed error count.
  
  
    The use of log-linear models for statistical machine translation was suggested by Papineni et al. (1997) and Och and Ney (2002).
    The use of minimum classification error training and using a smoothed error count is
