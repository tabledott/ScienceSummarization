 shows the entry for the noncompositional collocation take place, which requires that the object (r ail*) be singular and determinerless.
    These entries differ from similar representations of collocations or idioms in Smadja and McKeown (1990) and Stock (1989), in that they are sense-based rather than wordbased.
    That is, instead of expressing collocations as word-templates, the lexicon groups together collocations that combine the same sense of the head verb with particular senses or higher-level concepts (cf.
    Dyer and Zernik 1986).
    This approach better addresses the fact that collocations do have a semantic basis, capturing general forms such as give him or her (some temporal object), which underlies the collocations give month, give minute, and give time.
    Currently, the system has entries for over 1700 such collocations.
    The last source of sense preferences we need to consider is the semantic context.
    Work on lexical cohesion suggests that people use words that repeat a conceptual
