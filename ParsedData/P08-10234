this process works.
    The Chinese sentence (a) is first parsed into tree (b), which will be converted into an English string in 5 steps.
    First, at the root node, we apply rule r1 preserving top-level word-order between English and Chinese, (Liu et al., 2007) was a misnomer which actually refers to a set of several unrelated subtrees over disjoint spans, and should not be confused with the standard concept ofpackedforest. which results in two unfinished subtrees in (c).
    Then rule r2 grabs the B`ushisubtree and transliterate it Similarly, rule r3 shown in Figure 1 is applied to the VP subtree, which swaps the two NPBs, yielding the situation in (d).
    This rule is particularly interesting since it has multiple levels on the source side, which has more expressive power than synchronous context-free grammars where rules are flat.
    More formally, a (tree-to-string) translation rule (Huang et al., 2006) is a tuple (t, s, 0), where t is the source-side tree, whose internal nodes are labeled by nonterm
