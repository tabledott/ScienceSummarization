s the ratio of the maximum value of the likelihood function over the subspace represented by the hypothesis to the maximum value of the likelihood function over the entire parameter space.
    That is, where Q is the entire parameter space and Q0 is the particular hypothesis being tested.
    The particularly important feature of likelihood ratios is that the quantity &#8212;2 log A is asymptotically x2 distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in dimension between Q and Q0.
    Importantly, this asymptote is approached very quickly in the case of binomial and multinomial distributions.
    The comparison of two binomial or multinomial processes can be done rather easily using likelihood ratios.
    In the case of two binomial distributions, The hypothesis that the two distributions have the same underlying parameter is represented by the set {(Pi , P2) I pi = p2}.
    The likelihood ratio for this test is where Taking the logarithm of the likelihood ratio gives &#8212;21og A -= 2 [log L (pi
