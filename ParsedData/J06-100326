)) = IC(c) ?
  IC(par(c)) (13) Given this as the measure of semantic distance from a node to its immediate parent, the semantic distance between an arbitrary pair of nodes was taken, as per common practice, to be the sum of the distances along the shortest path that connects the nodes: distJC(c1, c2) = ?
  
  The node lso(c1, c2) is removed from Path(c1, c2) in (14)), because it has no parent in the set.
  Ex- panding the sum in the right-hand side of equation (14), plugging in the expression for parent?child distance from equation (13), and performing necessary eliminations results in the following final formula for the semantic distance between concepts c1 and c2: distJC(c1, c2) = IC(c1) + IC(c2) ?
  IC(lso(c1, c2)) (15) = 2 log p(lso(c1, c2)) ?
  (log p(c1) + log p(c2)) (16) 2.6.3 Lin?s Universal Similarity Measure.
  Noticing that all of the similarity measures known to him were tied to a particular application, domain, or resource, Lin (1998b) attempted to define a measure of similarity that would be bot
