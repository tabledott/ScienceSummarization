In Figure 5, the horizontal line is the performance level (63.3 F-measure) achieved by supervised learning (223K words).
    We find that the three informativeness-based measures perform similarly and each of them outperforms Random.
    Table 3 highlights the various data sizes to achieve the peak performance using these selection methods.
    We find that Random (83K words) on average requires over 1.5 times as much as data to achieve the same performance as the informativeness-based selection methods (52K words).
    In addition to the informativeness criterion, we further incorporate representativeness and diversity criteria into active learning using two strategies described in Section 3.
    Comparing the two strategies with the best result of the single-criterionbased selection methods Info_Min, we are to justify that representativeness and diversity are also important factors for active learning.
    Figure 6 shows the learning curves for the various methods: Strategy1, Strategy2 and Info_Min.
