uld be identified reliably.
    Also, the focus on conversational speech recognition led to a certain bias toward categories that were lexically or syntactically distinct (recognition accuracy is traditionally measured including all lexical elements in an utterance).
    While the modeling techniques described in this paper are formally independent of the corpus and the choice of tag set, their success on any particular task will of course crucially depend on these factors.
    For different tasks, not all the techniques used in this study might prove useful and others could be of greater importance.
    However, we believe that this study represents a fairly comprehensive application of technology in this area and can serve as a point of departure and reference for other work.
    The resulting SWBD-DAMSL tag set was multidimensional; approximately 50 basic tags (e.g., QUESTION, STATEMENT) could each be combined with diacritics indicating orthogonal information, for example, about whether or not the dialogue
