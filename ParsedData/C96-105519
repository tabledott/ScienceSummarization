fore.
  But now there are 189 class-based syntactic signatures, as compared with 748 verb-based signatures from before.
  187 of them mriquely identify a semantic (:lass, meaning that 97.9% of the classes have uniquely identifying syntactic signa- tures.
  Four of the semantic lasses do not have enough syntactic information to distinguish them uniquely.
  4 Although the effects of the various distinctions were present in the verb-based experiment, these effects are much clearer in the class-based experiments.
  The effects of negative and positive evidence, as well as the three ways of handling prepositions how up much clearer here, as is clear in Table 4.
  In the class-based experiment, we counted the per- centage of semantic classes that had uniquely ide.nti- fying signatures.
  In the verb-based experiment, we counted the number of perfect overlaps (i.e., index of 1.00) between the verbs as grouped in the semantic classes and grouped by syntactic signature.
