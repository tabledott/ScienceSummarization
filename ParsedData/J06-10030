  University of Toronto The quantification of lexical semantic relatedness has many applications in NLP, and many different measures have been proposed.
  We evaluate five of these measures, all of which use WordNet as their central resource, by comparing their performance in detecting and correcting real-word spelling errors.
  An information-content?based measure proposed by Jiang and Conrath is found superior to those proposed by Hirst and St-Onge, Leacock and Chodorow, Lin, and Resnik.
  In addition, we explain why distributional similarity is not an adequate proxy for lexical semantic relatedness.
  Introduction The need to determine semantic relatedness or its inverse, semantic distance, be- tween two lexically expressed concepts is a problem that pervades much of natural language processing.
  Measures of relatedness or distance are used in such applica- tions as word sense d
