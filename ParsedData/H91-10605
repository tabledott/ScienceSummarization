 set of candidate parses themselves.
  The average Crossing Parentheses rate over all our grammars was .4%, with a corresponding Recall score of 94%.
  We have agreed on three additionM categories of systematic alteration to our input parses which we believe will significantly improve the correlation between our "ideal parses", i.e.
  our individuM goals, and our standard.
  Even at the current level of fit, we feel comfortable Mlow- ing one of our number, the UPenn parse, to serve as the standard parse, since, crucially, it.
  is produced by hand.
  Our intention is to apply the current metric to more Brown Corpus data "ideally parsed" by us, and then to employ it to measure the performance of our grammars, run automatically, on a 1)enchma.rk set of sentences.
