 200 Chinese documents, subdivided into a total of 1788 segments.
    Each segment is translated by ten machine translation systems and by four human translators.
    A quarter of the machine-translated segments are scored by human evaluators on a one-to-five scale along two dimensions: adequacy and fluency.
    We use only adequacy scores, which measure how well content is preserved in the translation.
    To investigate the effect of paraphrase quality on automatic evaluation, we consider two alternative paraphrasing resources: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Brown clustering (Brown et al., 1992).
    These techniques are widely used in NLP applications, including language modeling, information extraction, and dialogue processing (Haghighi et al., 2005; Serafin and Eugenio, 2004; Miller et al., 2004).
    Both techniques are based on distributional similarity.
    The Brown clustering is computed by considering mutual information between adjacent words.
    LSA is a dimensionality reduction technique th
