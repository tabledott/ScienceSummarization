ment, the machine translationresult on MT03 indicates a slight degradation (al though it is not statistically significant).
			The prime reason for this is that features extracted from the alignments are aggregated over the training corpusand this process helps good alignments to have significantly better counts than errors in alignment.
			Align ing rare words correctly should help performance but since their count is low it is not reflected in bleu scores.
	
	
			This paper presented a word aligner trained on anno tated data.
			While the performance of the aligner isshown to be significantly better than other unsuper vised algorithms, the utility of these alignments in machine translation is still an open subject although gains are shown in two of the test sets.
			Since featuresare extracted from a parallel corpus, most of the in formation relating to the specific sentence alignment is lost in the aggregation of features across sentences.
			Improvements in capturing sentence context could allow the machi
