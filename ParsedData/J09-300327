 subjective expressions they contain.
    It is interesting to compare that distribution with the distribution of sentences with respect to the instances they contain of clues from the lexicon.
    We find that there are more sentences with two or more clue instances (62%) than sentences with two or more subjective expressions (48%).
    More importantly, many more sentences have mixtures of positive and negative clue instances than actually have mixtures of positive and negative subjective expressions.
    Only 880 sentences have a mixture of both positive and negative subjective expressions, whereas 3,234 sentences have a mixture of positive and negative clue instances.
    Thus, a large number of positive and negative instances are either neutral in context, or they are combining to form more complex polarity expressions.
    Either way, this provides strong evidence of the need to be able to disambiguate the contextual polarity of subjectivity and sentiment clues.
