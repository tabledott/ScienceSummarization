of-the-art levels for all cases.
  
  
    We have demonstrated, at least for one problem, that a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFGHR) can be used effectively for information extraction.
    A single model proved capable of performing all necessary sentential processing, both syntactic and semantic.
    We were able to use the Penn TREEBANK to estimate the syntactic parameters; no additional syntactic training was required.
    The semantic training corpus was produced by students according to a simple set of guidelines.
    This simple semantic annotation was the only source of task knowledge used to configure the model.
