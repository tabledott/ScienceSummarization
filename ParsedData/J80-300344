m this step.
    For instance, the bodies of the acts INFORM(A, S. P) and INFORM(A, S, &#8212;P) are BsWA(P A Bs(P)), and BsWA(&#8212;P A Bs(&#8212;P)), respectively.
    Both of these are contradicted by part of 4.5d.
    Thus the know-negative possibility can be eliminated.
    This allows the know-positive inference to be recognized as intended, and hence leads to the indirect interpretation as an INFORM(A, S, P).
    4.5b has only a literal interpretation since both the know-positive and know-negative rules are applicable at the nested level; without a reason to favour either, the literal REQUEST(A,S,INFORMIF(S,A,Bs(P))) is preferred.
    The interpretations of 4.5c are similar to those of Examples 2 and 3.
    All the examples of indirect speech acts so far have been explained in terms of rules PI.1-PI.6, and complex inference rules derived from them.
    In this section, we give one more example relying on somewhat more specific rules.
    A full investigation of how many such specific rules are necessa
