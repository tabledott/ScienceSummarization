 , computing the most probable sentence hypothesis out of a set of K line &#955;M1rydM1 results in the following optimization problem (Och, 2003): Hence, the total scorep~qfor any candidate translation corresponds to a line in the plane with &#947; as the independent variable.
    For any particular choice of &#947;, the decoder seeks that translation which yields the largest score and therefore corresponds to the topmost line segment.
    Overall, the candidate repository Cs defines K lines where each line may be divided into at most K line segments due to possible intersections with the other K1 lines.
    The sequence of the topmost line segments constitute the upper envelope which is the pointwise maximum over all lines induced by Cs.
    The upper envelope is a convex hull and can be inscribed with a convex polygon whose edges are the segments of a piecewise linear function in &#947; (Papineni, 1999; Och, 2003): The importance of the upper envelope is that it provides a compact encoding of all possible o
