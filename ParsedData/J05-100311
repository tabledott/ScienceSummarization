    First, several of the best-performing parsers on the WSJ treebank (e.g., Ratnaparkhi 1997; Charniak 1997, 2000; Collins 1997, 1999; Henderson 2003) are cases of history-based models.
    Many systems applied to part-of-speech tagging, speech recognition, and other language or speech tasks also fall into this class of model.
    Second, a particular history-based model (that of Collins [1999]) is used as the initial model for our approach.
    Finally, it is important to describe history-based models&#8212;and to explain their limitations&#8212;to motivate our departure from them.
    Parsing can be framed as a supervised learning task, to induce a function f : X--+Y given training examples (xi, yi), where xi Z X, yi Z Y.
    We define GEN(x)&#206;Y to be the set of candidates for a given input x.
    In the parsing problem x is a sentence, and GEN(x) is a set of candidate trees for that sentence.
    A particular characteristic of the problem is the complexity of GEN(x) : GEN(x) can be very large, an
