ltering of NULL nodes.
			All the nodes are classified directly as NULL or one of the arguments using the classifiertrained in step 2 above.
			We observe no significant per formance improvement even if we filter the most likely NULL nodes in a first pass.
			For our experiments, we used TinySVM2 along with YamCha3 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000) (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) as the SVM training and test software.
			The system uses a polynomial kernel with degree 2; the cost per unit violation of the margin, C=1; and, tolerance of the termination criterion, e=0.001.
	
	
			Table 1 shows the baseline performance numbers on the three tasks mentioned earlier; these results are based onsyntactic features computed from hand-corrected Tree Bank (hence LDC hand-corrected) parses.For the argument identification and the combined iden tification and classification tasks, we report the precision (P), recall (R) and the F14 scores, and for the argument classification task we report the classification accuracy (A).
