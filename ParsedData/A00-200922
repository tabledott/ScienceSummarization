    A number of issues have arisen in the course of this work that merit further investigation.
    The simplicity of the contextual representation can lead to large numbers of parameters in the Naive Bayesian model when using wide windows of context.
    Some combination of stop-lists and stemming could reduce the numbers of parameters and thus improve the overall quality of the parameter estimates made from the training data.
    In addition to simple co&#8212;occurrence features, the use of collocation features seems promising.
    These are distinct from co&#8212;occurrences in that they are words that occur in close proximity to the ambiguous word and do so to a degree that is judged statistically significant.
    One limitation of the majority vote in this paper is that there is no mechanism for dealing with outcomes where no sense gets a majority of the votes.
    This did not arise in this study but will certainly occur as Naive Bayesian ensembles are applied to larger sets of data.
