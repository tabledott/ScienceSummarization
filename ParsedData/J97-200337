ach q', when combined with the residual weight of q minus the output weight C72 (q2, a).
    Finally, 62(q2, a) is enqueued in Q iff it is a new subset.
    We denote by n1 (t) the destination state of a transition t E Ei.
    Hence n1 (t) q' , if t = (q, a, x, q') E Ei.
    The sets r(q2, a), of(q2, a), and v(q2, a) used in the algorithm are defined by: (q2, a) denotes the set of pairs (q, x), elements of the subset q2, having transitions labeled with the input a.
    7(q2, a) denotes the set of triples (q, x, t) where (q, x) is a pair in q2 such that q admits a transition with input label a. v(q2, a) is the set of states q' that can be reached by transitions labeled with a from the states of the subset q2.
    The algorithm is illustrated in Figures 11 and 12.
    Notice that the input ab admits several outputs in pi: {1 + 1 = 2,1 + 3 = 4,3 + 3 = 6,3 + 5 -= 8}.
    Only one of these outputs (2, the smallest) is kept in the determinized transducer /12, since in the tropical semiring one is only interested in
