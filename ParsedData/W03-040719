elected subsets showed a preference for a large proportion of the cache.
    This led us to propose a naive co-training approach, which significantly reduced the computational cost without a significant performance penalty.
    We also showed that naive co-training was unable to improve the performance of the taggers when they had already been trained on large amounts of manually annotated data.
    It is possible that agreement-based co-training, using more careful selection, would result in an improvement.
    We leave these experiments to future work, but note that there is a large computational cost associated with such experiments.
    The performance of the bootstrapped taggers is still a long way behind a tagger trained on a large amount of manually annotated data.
    This finding is in accord with earlier work on bootstrapping taggers using EM (Elworthy, 1994; Merialdo, 1994).
    An interesting question would be to determine the minimum number of manually labelled examples that need to be used to se
