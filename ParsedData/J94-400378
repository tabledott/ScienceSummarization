se, and very large bilingual corpora are not usually available.
    From a theoretical point of view, the difference between the two methods can be made clear if we assume that the bilingual lexicon contains exactly all the different translations of a word which occur in a bilingual corpus.
    For a given set of senses that need to be disambiguated, our method requires a bilingual corpus of size k, in which each sense occurs at least once, in order to establish its mapping to a target word.
    In addition, a larger monolingual corpus, of size n, is required, to provide enough training examples of typical contexts for each sense.
    On the other hand, using a bilingual corpus for training the disambiguation model would require a bilingual corpus of size n, which is significantly larger than k. The savings in resources is achieved since the mapping between the languages is done at the level of single words.
    The larger amount of information about word combinations, on the other hand, is acquired from an u
