    Even for the relatively simple case of dialogue act tagging, a disagreement between an accept and a reject interpretation of an utterance is clearly more serious than a disagreement between an info-request and a check.
    For tasks such as anaphora resolution, where reliability is determined by measuring agreement on sets (coreference chains), allowing for degrees of disagreement becomes essential (see Section 4.4).
    Under such circumstances, &#960; and &#954; are not very useful.
    In this section we discuss two coefficients that make it possible to differentiate between types of disagreements: &#945; (Krippendorff 1980, 2004a), which is a coefficient defined in a general way that is ap
