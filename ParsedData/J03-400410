ces between that work and ours are that we acquire adjective as well as verb models, and also that our models are with respect to verb and adjective classes, rather than forms.
    We acquire models for classes because we are using the models for WSD, whereas Li and Abe used them for structural disambiguation.
    We define a TCM as follows.
    Let NC be the set of noun synsets (noun classes) in WordNet: NC = {nc E WordNet}, and NS be the set of noun senses 3 in Wordnet: NS = {ns E WordNet}.
    A TCM is a set of noun classes that partition NS disjointly.
    We use P to refer to such a set of classes in a TCM.
    A TCM is defined by P and a probability distribution: The probability distribution is conditioned by the grammatical context.
    In this work, the probability distribution associated with a TCM is conditioned on a verb class (vc) and either the subject or direct-object relation, or an adjective class (ac) and the adjective&#8211;noun relation.
    Let VC be the set of verb synsets (verb classes)
