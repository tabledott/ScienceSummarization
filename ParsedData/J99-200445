statistical techniques.
    By associating rich descriptions (supertags) that impose complex constraints in a local context, we have been able to use local computational models for effective supertag disambiguation.
    A trigram supertag disambiguation model, trained on 1,000,000 (word, supertag) pairs of the Wall Street Journal corpus, performs at an accuracy level of 92.2%.
    After disambiguation, we have effectively completed the parse of the sentence, creating an almost parse, in that the parser need only combine the selected structures to arrive at a parse for the sentence.
    We have presented a lightweight dependency analyzer (LDA) that takes the output of the supertagger and uses the dependency requirements of the supertags to produce a dependency linkage for a sentence.
    This method can also serve to parse sentence fragments in cases where the supertag sequence after disambiguation may not combine to form a single structure.
    This approach is applicable to all lexicalized grammar parsers.
