  The maximum depth of the noun hierarchy is 16 nodes.
  The nine types of relations defined on the noun subnetwork, in addition to the synonymy relation that is implicit in each node are: the hyponymy (IS-A) relation, 1 We began this work with WordNet 1.5, and stayed with this version despite newer releases in order to maintain strict comparability.
  Our experiments were complete before WordNet 2.0 was released.
  2 It seems to have been tacitly assumed by these researchers that results would generalize to the network hierarchies of other parts of speech.
  Nonetheless, Resnik and Diab (2000) caution that the properties of verbs and nouns might be different enough that they should be treated as separate problems, and recent research by Banerjee and Pedersen (2003) supports this assumption: they found that in a word-sense disambiguation task, their gloss-overlap measure of semantic relatedness (see Section 6.1 below) performed far worse on verbs (and slightly worse on adjectives) than it did on no
