    In the training phase of our experiment, we gathered statistics on the occurrence of function tags in sections 2-21 of the Penn treebank.
    Specifically, for every constituent in the treebank, we recorded the presence of its function tags (or lack thereof) along with its conditioning information.
    From this we calculated the empirical probabilities of each function tag referenced in section 2 of this paper.
    Values of A were determined using EM on the development corpus (treebank section 24).
    To test, then, we simply took the output of our parser on
