greater than one) or a single source word may produce zero, one, or two target words, as described in Berger et al. (1996), or both.
    Zero target words are generated if f is aligned to the &#8220;null&#8221; word e0.
    Generating a single target word e is the regular case.
    Two target words (e',e'') may be generated.
    The costs for generating the target word e' are given by its fertility &#966;(0  |e') and the language model probability; no lexicon probability is used.
    During the experiments, we restrict ourselves to triples of target words (e, e', e'') actually seen in the training data.
    This approach is used for the French-to-English translation experiments presented in this article.
    Another approach for mapping a single source language word to several target language words involves preprocessing by the word-joining algorithm given in Tillmann (2001), which is similar to the approach presented in Och, Tillmann, and Ney (1999).
    Target words are joined during a training phase, and s
