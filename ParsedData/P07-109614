 Hypothesis scores and action scores are calculated with the updated weight vector w. A special aspect of Algorithm 2 is that we maintain two scores: the score of the action represents the confidence for the next move, and the score of the hypothesis represents the overall quality of a partial result.
    The selection for the next action directly depends on the score of the action, but not on the score of the hypothesis.
    On the other hand, the score of the hypothesis is used to maintain top partial results for each span.
    We briefly describe the soundness of the Guided Learning Algorithm in terms of two aspects.
    First, in Algorithm 2 weight update is activated whenever there exists an incorrect state s, the action score of whose top hypothesis s.T is higher than that of any state in each span.
    We demote this action and promote the gold standard action on the same span.
