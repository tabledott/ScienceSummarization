8850 types) of verb-noun pairs participating in the grammatical relations of intransitive and transitive verbs and their subject- and object-fillers.
    The data were gathered from the maximal-probability parses the head-lexicalized Fig.
    2 shows an induced semantic class out of a model with 35 classes.
    At the top are listed the 20 most probable nouns in the p(n5) distribution and their probabilities, and at left are the 30 most probable verbs in the p(v15) distribution.
    5 is the class index.
    Those verb-noun pairs which were seen in the training data appear with a dot in the class matrix.
    Verbs with suffix .as : s indicate the subject slot of an active intransitive.
    Similarily .aso: s denotes the subject slot of an active transitive, and .aso: o denotes the object slot of an active transitive.
    Thus v in the above discussion actually consists of a combination of a verb with a subcat frame slot as : s, aso : s, or aso : o.
    Induced classes often have a basis in lexical semantics;
