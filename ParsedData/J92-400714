nterpretation and natural language generation require discourse models that include both the informational and the intentional relations between consecutive discourse elements.
    RST includes relations of both types, but commits to discourse analyses in which a single relation holds between each pair of elements.
    One might imagine modifying RST to include multi-relation definitions, i.e., definitions that ascribe both an intentional and an informational relation to consecutive discourse elements.
    Such an approach was suggested by Hovy (1991), who augmented rhetorical relation definitions to include a &amp;quot;results&amp;quot; field.
    Although Hovy did not cleanly separate intentional from informational level relations, a version of his approach might be developed in which definitions are given only for informational (or, alternatively, intentional) level relations, and the results field of each definition is used to specify an associated intentional (informational) relation.
    However, this a
