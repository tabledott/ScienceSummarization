entences of the document, we additionally prefer sentences that first match on longer words, and second, occur earlier in the document.
    In this section, we describe extensions to the extraction approach described above.
    In the next section we will discuss the performance benefits of these extensions.
    The most straightforward extension is to remove function or stop words, such as the, of, a, etc. from the word sets, reasoning that they offer little semantic information and only muddle the signal from the more contentful words.
    Similarly, one can use stemming to remove inflectional affixes from the words: such normalization might increase the signal from contentful words.
    For example, the intersection between (ib) and (2b) would include give if inflection were removed from gave and giving.
    We used a stemmer described by Abney (1997).
    A different type of extension is suggested by the fact that who questions are likely to be answered with words that denote people or organizations.
