a distance &gt; 2k from the actual boundary between the first and second reference segments.
    The penalty is large because the metric catches both the false negative and the false positive errors.
    The segmentations assigned by Algorithms A-0 and A-2 are treated as discussed earlier in conjunction with Problem 1: the one assigned by Algorithm A-0 has a false negative and thus incurs a penalty of k, and the one assigned by Algorithm A-2 has a false positive, and thus incurs a penalty of &lt; k. Finally, consider the segmentations assigned by Algorithms A-1 and A-3, and suppose that both contain an incorrect boundary some small distance e from the actual one.
    Then the penalty for Algorithm A-1 is e, while the penalty for Algorithm A-3 is 2e.
    This should not be the case; Algorithm A-1 should be penalized more than Algorithm A-3, since a near-miss error is better than a pure false positive, even if it is close to the boundary.
    Pk is nonintuitive because it measures the probability that two sente
