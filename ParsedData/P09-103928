    The overall parsing runtime becomes polynomial with respect to the length of the sentence.
    The last column of Table 1 compares the accuracy of this approximate method with the exact one.
    We observe that there is not a substantial drop in accuracy; on the other hand, we observed a considerable speed-up with respect to exact inference, particularly for long sentences.
    The average runtime (across all languages) is 0.632 seconds per sentence, which is in line with existing higher-order parsers and is much faster than the runtimes reported by Riedel and Clarke (2006).
  
  
    We presented new dependency parsers based on concise ILP formulations.
    We have shown how non-local output features can be incorporated, while keeping only a polynomial number of constraints.
    These features can act as soft constraints whose penalty values are automatically learned from data; in addition, our model is also compatible with expert knowledge in the form of hard constraints.
