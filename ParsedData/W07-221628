 G(0) xprovides some Hamiltonian directed path in G. The latter search problem is FNP-hard, and is unlikely to be solved in polynomial time.
    Furthermore, quantity Zx provides the count of the Hamiltonian directed paths in G, and for each i E V , the expectation ((0, i)1)x provides the count of the Hamiltonian directed paths in G starting from node i.
    Both these counting problems are #P-hard, and very unlikely to have polynomial time solutions.
    This result helps to relate the hardness of datadriven models to the commonly known hardness results in the grammar-driven literature given by Neuhaus and B&#168;oker (1997).
    In that work, an arity constraint is included in their minimal grammar.
    In general, we would like to say that every dependency decision is dependent on every other edge in a graph.
    However, modeling dependency parsing in such a manner would be a computational nightmare.
    Instead, we would like to make a Markov assumption over the edges of the tree, in a similar way that a
