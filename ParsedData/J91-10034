 I know, the first system to recognize examples of metaphor and metonymy.
    To my knowledge, there is only one other working program that might be said to recognize instances of metaphor (Martin 1988; 1990) and two systems that appear to recognize cases of metonymy, TEAM (Grosz et al. 1987) and TACITUS (Hobbs and Martin 1987).
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 surveys general issues and approaches in metaphor and metonymy, notably the distinctive characteristics of metaphor and metonymy, the relationship between metaphor and metonymy, and the relationship between literalness and nonliteralness.
    Section 3 presents the met* method, concentrating on the basic topology of the met* method algorithm.
    Section 4 shows details of representations and processes used in CS.
    Section 5 gives examples of the meta5 program analyzing simple metaphors and metonymies.
    Descriptions get progressively more detailed from Section 2 through to Section 5.
    Sections 6 and 7 describe s
