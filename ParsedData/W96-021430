P model has perhaps the best reported parsing accuracy; previously the full DOP model had not been replicated due to the difficulty and computational complexity of the existing algorithms.
    We have also shown that previous results were partially due to an unlikely choice of test data, and partially due to the heavy cleaning of the data, which reduced the difficulty of the task.
    Of course, this research raises as many questions as it answers.
    Were previous results due only to the choice of test data, or are the differences in implementation partly responsible?
    In that case, there is significant future work required to understand which differences account for Bod's exceptional performance.
    This will be complicated by the fact that sufficient details of Bod's implementation are not available.
    This research also shows the importance of testing on more than one small test set, as well as the importance of not making cross-corpus comparisons; if a new corpus is required, then previous algorit
