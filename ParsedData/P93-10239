data that indicate that two adjectives are unrelated.
    First, we extract adjective-noun pairs that occur in a modification relation in order to identify the distribution of nouns an adjective modifies and, ultimately, determine which adjectives it is related to.
    This is based on the expectation that adjectives describing the same property tend to modify approximately the same set of nouns.
    For example, temperature is normally defined for physical objects and we can expect to find that adjectives conveying different values of temperature will all modify physical objects.
    Therefore, our algorithm finds the distribution of nouns that each adjective modifies and categorizes adjectives as similar if they have similar distributions.
    Second, we use adjective-adjective pairs occurring as pre-modifiers within the same NP as a strong indication that the two adjectives do not belong in the same group.
    There are three cases: The use of multiple types of linguistic data, in Note that sequences such
