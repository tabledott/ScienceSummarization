es that were approximately twice as long as Agent B's, they had no way of determining whether Agent A's higher transaction success or Agent B's efficiency was more critical to performance.
    In addition to agent factors such as dialogue strategy, task factors such as database size and environmental factors such as background noise may also be relevant predictors of performance.
    These approaches are also limited in that they currently do not calculate performance over subdialogues as well as whole dialogues, correlate performance with an external validation criterion, or normalize performance for task complexity.
    This paper describes PARADISE, a general framework for evaluating spoken dialogue agents that addresses these limitations.
    PARADISE supports comparisons among dialogue strategies by providing a task representation that decouples what an agent needs to achieve in terms of the task requirements from how the agent carries out the task via dialogue.
    PARADISE uses a decision-theoretic fra
