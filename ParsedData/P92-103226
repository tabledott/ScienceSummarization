9 polysemous words: antenna, campaign, deposit, drum, hull, interior, knife, landscape, and marine.
    The results of the experiment are shown below in Table 3.
    With the exception of judge 2, all of the judges agreed with the majority opinion in all but one or two of the 82 cases.
    The agreement rate was 96.8%, averaged over all judges, or 99.1%, averaged over the four best judges.
    In either case, the agreement rate is well above the previously described ceiling.
    Incidentally, the experiment did, in fact, confirm the hypothesis that multiple uses of a polysemous word will generally take on the same sense within a discourse.
    Of the 82 judgments, 54 were selected from the same discourse and were judged to have the same sense by the majority in 96.9% of the cases.
    (The remaining 28 of the 82 judgments were used as a control to force the judges to say that some pairs were different.)
    Note that the tendency for multiple uses of a polysemous word to have the same sense is extremely stron
