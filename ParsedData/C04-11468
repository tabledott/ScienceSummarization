mmonality of A and B and the information needed to fully describe what A and B are.?
			The final three measures are settings in the additive MI-based Co-occurrence Retrieval Model (AMCRM) (Weeds and Weir, 2003; Weeds, 2003).
			We can measure the precisionand the recall of a potential neighbour?s re trieval of the co-occurrences of the target word,where the sets of required and retrieved co occurrences (F (w1) and F (w2) respectively) are those co-occurrences for which MI is positive.
			Neighbours with both high precision and high recall retrieval can be obtained by computing Measure Function cosine simcm(w2, w1) = ? c P (c|w1).P (c|w2) ??
