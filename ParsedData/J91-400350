ing or backgrounding of a nominal's qualia is very similar to argument structure-changing operations for verbs.
    That is, in 55(a), paint applies to the formal role of the door, while in 55(b), through will apply to the constitutive interpretation of the same NP.
    The ambiguity with such nouns is a logical one, one that is intimately linked to the semantic representation of the object itself.
    The qualia structure, then, is a way of capturing this logical polysemy.
    In conclusion, it should be pointed out that the entire lexicon is organized around such logical ambiguities, which Pustejovsky and Anick (1988) call Lexical Conceptual Paradigms.
    Pustejovsky (forthcoming) distinguishes the following systems and the paradigms that lexical items fall into: Example 57 Such paradigms provide a means for accounting for the systematic ambiguity that may exist for a lexical item.
    For example, a noun behaving according to paradigm 57(a) 24 There are many such classes of nominals, both two-dimensional
