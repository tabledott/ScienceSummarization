are likely to go unobserved in a small annotated training corpus.
    For example, a clustering mechanism may choose to place AT&amp;T in the same cluster as other company names based on contextual similarity.
    Then, even if the word AT&amp;T was not previously annotated as a company, it may nonetheless be possible to infer that AT&amp;T indeed is a company because it occupies a cluster that is populated mostly by other company names.
    Likewise, cluster membership can be used to exploit information from neighboring words.
    For example, if the word reported has previously been observed to follow person names, but the word announced has not yet been seen, it may be possible to guess that the word preceding announced is a person based on the fact that reported and announced occupy the same cluster.
    A practical obstacle to using clusters for this purpose is selecting an appropriate level of granularity: too small, and the clusters provide insufficient generalization; too large, and they inappropriate
