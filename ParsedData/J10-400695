y Turney and collaborators contains 374 multiple-choice questions from the SAT college entrance exam.
    Each question includes one target (ostrich&#8211;bird) and five candidate analogies (lion&#8211;cat, goose&#8211;flock, ewe&#8211;sheep, cub&#8211;bear, primate&#8211;monkey).
    The data set is dominated by noun&#8211;noun pairs, but all other combinations are also attested (noun&#8211;verb, verb&#8211;adjective, verb&#8211;verb, etc.)
    The task is to choose the candidate pair most analogous to the target (lion&#8211;cat in the previous example).
    This is essentially the same task as the TOEFL, but applied to word pairs instead of words.
    As in the TOEFL, we pick the candidate with the highest cosine with the target as the right analogy.

    TypeDM is again emerging as the best among our models.
