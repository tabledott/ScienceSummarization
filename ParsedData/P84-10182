e no longer differentiated and linguistics shades off into psychology and philosophy.
    The higher levels are also the ones whose theoretical underpinnings are less well known and system designers therefore often tie the legs together somewhere lower down, constructing a more or less ad hoc bridge, pivot, or transfer component.
    We connot be sure that the classical design is the right design, or the best design, for a translating machine.
    But it does have several strong points.
    Since the structure of the components is grounded in linguistic theory, it is possible to divide each of these components into two parts: a formal description of the relevant facts about the language, and an interpreter of the formalism.
    The formal description is data whereas the interpreter is program.
    The formal description should ideally serve the needs of synthesis and analysis indifferently.
    On the other hand we would expect different interpreters to be required in the two legs of the machine.
    We expec
