cerns for the simplification task in Sec- tion 6.
  2 The Basics of Simplification Text simplification uses the f~ct that complex texts typically contains complex syntax, some of which may be particular to specific domain of dis- course, such as newswire texts.
  We assume that the simplification system will process one sentence at a time.
  Interactions across sentences will not bc considered.
  Wc also assume that sentences have to be maximally simplified.
  2o simplify sentences, we nced to know where we can split them.
  We define articulation-points to be those points at which sentences may be log- ically split.
  Possible articulation points include the beginnings and ends of phrases, punctuation marks, subordinating and coordinating conjunc- tions, and relative pronouns.
  These articulation points are gcneral, and should apply to arbitrary English texts.
  These may, however, be augmented with domain-specific articulation points.
  We can use these articulation-points to define a set of rules which ma
