e table.
    The parse table is a nondeterministic finite-state automaton so it is possible to apply Markov modeling techniques to the parse table (in a way analogous to their application to lexical tagging or CFGs).
    Each row of the parse table corresponds to the possible transitions out of the state represented by that row, and each transition is associated with a particular lookahead item and a parse action.
    Nondeterminism arises when more than one action, and hence transition, is possible given a particular lookahead item.
    The most straightforward technique for associating probabilities with the parse table is to assign a probability to each action in the action part of the table (e.g.
    Wright 1990).5 If probabilities are associated directly with the parse table rather than derived from a probabilistic CFG or equivalent global pairing of probabilities to rules, then the resulting probabilistic model will be more sensitive to parse context.
