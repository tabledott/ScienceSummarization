 similar and the problem is to form a grouping that puts the most similar items together, allowing the use of conjunction and ellipsis to delete repetitive material.
    For summarizing multiple news articles, the task is almost the opposite; we need to find the differences from one article to the next, identifying how the reported facts have changed.
    Thus, the main problem was the identification of summarization strategies, which indicate how information is linked together to form a concise and cohesive summary.
    As we have found in other work (Robin 1994), what information is included is often dependent on the language available to make concise additions.
    Thus, using a corpus summary was critical to identifying the different summaries possible.
    We have developed a set of heuristics derived from the corpora that decide what types of simple sentences constitute a summary, in what order they need to be listed, as well as the ways in which simple sentences are combined into more complex ones.
