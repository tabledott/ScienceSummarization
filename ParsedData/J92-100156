neither especially general nor specific and that fails to match the input is just &#8212;1 times the positive specificity of the concept.
    The strategy of favoring the most specific information has several advantages.
    This approach best addresses the concerns of an expanding knowledge base where one must be concerned not only with competition between preferences but also with the inevitable gaps in knowledge.
    Generally, the more specific information there is, the more complete, and hence more trustworthy, the information is.
    Thus, when there is a clear semantic distinction between the senses and the system has the information necessary to identify it, a clear distinction usually emerges in the ratings.
    When there is no strong semantic distinction, or there is very little information, preference scores are usually very close, so that the parser must fall back on syntactic preferences, such as Right Association.
    This result provides a simple, sensible means of balancing syntactic and sema
