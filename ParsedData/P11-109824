    Once documents are labeled with templates, we next extract entities into the template slots.
    Extraction occurs in the trigger sentences from the previous section.
    The extraction process is two-fold: Take the following MUC-4 sentence as an example: The two bombs were planted with the exclusive purpose of intimidating the owners of...
    The verb plant is in our learned bombing cluster, so step (1) will extract its passive subject bombs and map it to the correct instrument role (see figure 2).
    The human target, owners, is missed because intimidate was not learned.
    However, if owner is in the selectional preferences of the learned &#8216;human target&#8217; role, step (2) correctly extracts it into that role.
    These are two different, but complementary, views of semantic roles.
    The first is that a role is defined by the set of syntactic relations that describe it.
    Thus, we find all role relations and save their arguments (pattern extraction).
    The second view is that a role is
