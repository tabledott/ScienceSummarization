    We approach the problem of classifying references by representing each reference with a wordpresence vector derived from a window of text surrounding the reference.8 In the training set, we classify each reference connecting two speakers with a positive or negative label depending on whether the two voted the same way on the bill under discussion9.
    These labels are then used to train an SVM classifier, the output of which is subsequently used to create weights on agreement links in the test set as follows.
    Let d(r) denote the distance from the vector representing reference r to the agreement-detector SVM&#8217;s decision plane, and let u, be the standard deviation of d(r) over all references in the debate in question.
    We then define the strength agr of the agreement link corresponding to the reference as: agr(r) def = { 0 d(r) &lt; Bagr; &#945; &#183; d(r)/4u, Bagr &lt; d(r) &lt; 4u,; &#945; d(r) &gt; 4u, The free parameter &#945; specifies the relative importance of th
