this increases the likelihood that the English and German words are in corresponding order.
    Word a in the English matrix is then the translation of word a in the German matrix.
  
  
    A simulation experiment was conducted in order to see whether the above assumptions concerning the similarity of co-occurrence patterns actually hold.
    In this experiment, for an equivalent English and German vocabulary two co-occurrence matrices were computed and then compared.
    As the English vocabulary a list of 100 words was used, which had been suggested by Kent &amp; Rosanoff (1910) for association experiments.
    The German vocabulary consisted of one by one translations of these words as chosen by Russell (1970).
    The word co-occurrences were computed on the basis of an English corpus of 33 and a German corpus of 46 million words.
    The English corpus consists of the Brown Corpus, texts from the Wall Street Journal, Grolier 's Electronic Encyclopedia and scientific abstracts from different fields.
