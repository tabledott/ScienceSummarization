    The combination of the suggested methods for improving translation quality in frameworks with scarce resources has been successfully tested: We were able to reduce the amount of bilingual training data to less than 10% of the original corpus, while losing only 1.6% in translation quality.
    The improvement of the translation results is demonstrated on two German-English corpora taken from the Uerbmobil task and the Nespole! task.
  
  
    In statistical machine translation, correspondences between the words in the source and the target language are learned from parallel corpora, and often little or no linguistic knowledge is used to structure the underlying models.
    In particular, existing statistical systems for machine translation often treat different inflectedforms of the same lemma as if they were independent ofone another.
    The bilingual training data can be better exploited by explicitly taking into account the interdependencies of related inflected forms.
    We propose the con
