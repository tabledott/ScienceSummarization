ass based upon an incidental feature).
    As an illustration of this last condition, neither Galileo Probe nor gray plane is a valid entry, the former because it denotes an individual and the latter because it is a class of planes based upon an incidental feature (color).
    In the interests of generating as many valid entries as possible, we allowed for the inclusion in noun compounds of words tagged as adjectives or cardinality words.
    In certain occasions (e.g. four-wheel drive truck or nuclear bomb) this is necessary to avoid losing key parts of the compound.
    Most common adjectives are dropped in our compound noun analysis, since they occur with a wide variety of heads.
    We determined three ways to evaluate the output of the algorithm for usefulness.
    The first is the ratio of valid entries to total entries produced.
    R&amp;S reported a ratio of .17 valid to total entries for both the vehicle and weapon categories (see table 2).
    On the same corpus, our algorithm yielded a ratio of .3
