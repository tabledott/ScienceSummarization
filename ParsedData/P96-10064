    For instance, given the sentence &amp;quot;A reduction of principal and interest is one way the problem may be solved.&amp;quot;, since the word &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; appears as a noun in this sentence, LEXAS will only consider the noun senses of &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; but not its verb senses.
    That is, LEXAS is only concerned with disambiguating senses of a word in a given POS.
    Making such an assumption is reasonable since POS taggers that can achieve accuracy of 96% are readily available to assign POS to unrestricted English sentences (Brill, 1992; Cutting et al., 1992).

    These are words that are not morphologically inflected, such as &amp;quot;interest&amp;quot; (as opposed to the plural form &amp;quot;interests&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;fall&amp;quot; (as opposed to the other inflected forms like &amp;quot;fell&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;fallen&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;falling&amp;quot;,
