odel trained on 2.3 billion words of English.
    As development data for the SPMT systems, we used the sentences in the 2002 NIST development corpus that are shorter than 20 words; we made this choice in order to finish all experiments in time for this submission.
    The PBMT system used all sentences in the 2002 NIST corpus for development.
    As test data, we used the 2003 NIST test set.
    Table 1 shows the number of string-to-string or tree-to-string rules extracted by each system and the performance on both the subset of sentences in the test corpus that were shorter than 20 words and the entire test corpus.
    The performance is measured using the Bleu metric (Papineni et al., 2002) on lowercased, tokenized outputs/references.
    The results show that the SPMT models clearly outperform the phrase-based systems &#8211; the 95% confidence intervals computed via bootstrap resampling in all cases are around 1 Bleu point.
    The results also show that the simple system combination procedure that we ha
