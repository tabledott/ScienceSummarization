iments (Rubenstein 1981) showing that with appropriate selection of the threshold, the algorithm misses very few translations, that this rate of failure can be reduced even more by using different thresholds at each level, and that the missed translations are in general the less interesting ones, so that the rejection of some of the valid (according to the Dice coefficient) translations most likely leads to an increase of Champollion's performance.
    The exhaustive algorithm described above suffers from two disadvantages: First, the only guaranteed correct value of m is the number of words Q in the target language that have been selected in Stage 1 as viable candidate translations and pass the Dice coefficient test as single words (see Section 5.1).
    This set of words typically contains 100-120 words, so enumerating all its subsets is impractical.
    But even if we artificially impose some lower ceiling for m&#8212;say three times the length of the source language collocation&#8212;we run into the secon
