e).
    Similarly to the sentence ordering task, our training data includes pairs of summaries (xij,xik) of the same document(s) di, where xij is more coherent than xik.
    An optimal learner should return a ranking r&#8727; that orders the summaries according to their coherence.
    As in Experiment 1 we adopt an optimization approach and follow the training regime put forward by Joachims (2002).
    Data.
    Our evaluation was based on materials from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC 2003), which include multi-document summaries produced by human writers and by automatic summarization systems.
    In order to learn a ranking, we require a set of summaries, each of which has been rated in terms of coherence.
    One stumbling block to performing this kind of evaluation is the coherence ratings themselves, which are not routinely provided by DUC summary evaluators.
    In DUC 2003, the quality of automatically generated summaries was assessed along several dimensions ranging from grammatically, to
