cluded the data of subjects who had participated more than once in the same experiment, based on their demographic data and on their Internet connection data, which is logged by WebExp.
    3.2.2 Results and Discussion.
    The experimental data were normalized by dividing each numerical judgment by the modulus value that the subject had assigned to the reference sentence.
    This operation creates a common scale for all subjects.
    Then the data were transformed by taking the decadic logarithm.
    This transformation ensures that the judgments are normally distributed and is standard practice for magnitude estimation data (Bard, Robertson, and Sorace 1996; Cowart 1997; Stevens 1975).
    All further analyses were conducted on the normalized, log-transformed judgments.
    Table 10 shows the descriptive statistics for all six judgment experiments: the original experiments by Lapata, McDonald, and Keller (1999) and Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001) for adjective-noun bigrams, and our new ones for noun-no
