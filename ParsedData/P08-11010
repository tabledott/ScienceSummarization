  Joint Word Segmentation and POS Tagging Using a Single Perceptron
  
    Chinese word segmentation is a preliminary step.
    To avoid error propagation and improve segmentation by utilizing segmentation and tagging can be performed simultaneously.
    A challenge for this joint approach is the large combined search space, which makes efficient decoding very hard.
    Recent research has explored integration of segmentation and tagging, by decoding under restricted versions of the full combined search space.
    In this paper, propose a joint segmentation and tagging model that does not impose any hard constraints on the interaction between word and Fast decoding is achieved by using a novel multiple-beam search algorithm.
    The system uses a discriminative statistical model, trained using the generalized perceptron algorithm.
    The joint model gives an error reduction in segmentation accuracy of an error reduction in tagging acof compared to the traditional pipeline approach.
