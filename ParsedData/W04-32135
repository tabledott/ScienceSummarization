he approach highlights an intermediate step of determining the set of possible roles for each argument.
    Because we need to constrain the role set as much as possible, and cannot draw on extensive training data, this latter step takes on greater significance in our work.
    We first describe the lexicon that specifies the syntactic arguments and possible roles for the verbs, and then discuss our process of argument and role set identification.
    In semantic role labelling, a lexicon is used which lists the possible roles for each syntactic argument of each predicate.
    Supervised approaches to this task have thus far used the predicate lexicon of FrameNet, or the verb lexicon of PropBank, since each has an associated labelled corpus for training.
    We instead make use of VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000), a manually developed hierarchical verb lexicon based on the verb classification of Levin (1993).
    For each of 191 verb classes, including around 3000 verbs in total, VerbNet specifies the syntactic
