y distributions at the RBC, and frequently the UBC, are not sufficiently distinctive.
    The polysemy of the verbs may provide another explanation for the large quantity of false positives.
    The scFs and data of different senses should not ideally be combined, at least not for coarse grained sense distinctions.
    We tested the false positive and true negative candidates to see if there was a relationship between the polysemy of a verb and its misclassification.
    The number of senses (according to WordNet) was used to indicate the polysemy of a verb.
    The Mann Whitney U test was performed on the verbs found to be true negative and false positive using the RBC.
    A significant relationship was not found between participation and misclassification.
    Both groups had an average of 5 senses per verb.
    This is not to say that distinguishing verb senses would not improve performance, provided that there was sufficient data.
    However, verb polysemy does not appear to be a major source of error,
