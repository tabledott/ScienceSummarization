    The translation tasks range from easy (es &#8594; fr) to very hard (de &#8594; en).
    In all cases triangulation resulted in an improvement in translation quality, with the highest gains observed for the most difficult tasks (to and from German).
    For these tasks the standard systems have poor coverage (due in part to the sizeable vocabulary of German phrases) and therefore the gain can be largely explained by the additional coverage afforded by the triangulated phrase-tables.
    To test whether triangulation can also improve performance of larger corpora we ran six separate translation tasks on the full Europarl corpus.
    The results are presented in Table 3, for a single triangulation language used alone (triang) or uniformly interpolated with the standard phrase-table (interp).
    These results show that triangulation can produce high quality translations on its own, which is noteworthy, as it allows for SMT between a much larger set of language pairs.
