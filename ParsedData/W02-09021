rdering during the translation process.
    The statistical models are trained on parallel corpora: large amounts of text in one language along with their translation in another.
    Various parallel texts have recently become available, mostly from government sources such as parliament proceedings (the Canadian Hansard, the minutes of the European parliament1) or law texts (from Hong Kong).
    Still, for most language pairs, parallel texts are hard to come by.
    This is clearly the case for low-density languages such as Tamil, Swahili, or Tetun.
    Furthermore, texts derived from parliament speeches may not be appropriate for a particular targeted domain.
    Specific parallel texts can be constructed by hand for the purpose of training an SMT system, but this is a very costly endeavor.
    On the other hand, the digital revolution and the wide-spread use of the World Wide Web have proliferated vast amounts of monolingual corpora.
    Publishing text in one language is a much more natural human activity
