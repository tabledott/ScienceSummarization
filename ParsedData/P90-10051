 explicitly.
    We have developed a. parsing method in which an intermediate parsing result is represented as a data structure called a constraint network.
    Every solution that satisfies all the constraints simultaneously corresponds to an individual parse tree.
    No explicit parse trees are generated until ultimately necessary.
    Parsing and successive disambiguation are performed by adding new constraints to the constraint network.
    Newly added constraints are efficiently propagated over the network by Constraint Propagation (Waltz 1975, Montanan i 1976) to remove inconsistent values.
    In this paper, we present the basic ideas of a formal grammatical theory called Constraint Dependency Grammar (CDG for short) that makes this parsing technique possible_ CDG has a reasonable time bound in its parsing, while its weak generative capacity is strictly greater than that of Context Free Grammar (CFG).
    We give the definition of CDG in the next section.
    Then, in Section 3, we describe the parsin
