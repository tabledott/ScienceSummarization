ugh the learning process.
    The heuristic process gives the incorrect translation spade with 61% probability, while the statistical learning approach gives cat with 95% probability.
    While such examples of improvement are encouraging, the trend of spurious determinism overwhelms this benefit by introducing errors in four related ways, each of which will be explored in turn.
    The first effect follows from our observation in section 3.2 that many phrase pairs are unusable due to vanishingly small probabilities.
    Some of the entries that are made unusable by re-estimation are helpful at decoding time, evidenced by the fact that pruning the set of OEM&#8217;s low-scoring learned phrases from the original heuristic table reduces BLEU score by 0.02 for 25k training sentences (below the score for OEM).
    The second effect is more subtle.
    Consider the sentence in figure 4, which to a first approximation can be translated as a series of cognates, as demonstrated by the decoding that follows from the H
