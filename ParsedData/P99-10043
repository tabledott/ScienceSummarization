hese empirical results indicate that investigating different similarity measures can lead to improved natural language processing.
    On the other hand, while there have been many similarity measures proposed and analyzed in the information retrieval literature (Jones and Furnas, 1987), there has been some doubt expressed in that community that the choice of similarity metric has any practical impact: Several authors have pointed out that the difference in retrieval performance achieved by different measures of association is insignificant, providing that these are appropriately normalised.
    (van Rijsbergen, 1979, pg.
    38) But no contradiction arises because, as van Rijsbergen continues, &amp;quot;one would expect this since most measures incorporate the same information&amp;quot;.
    In the language-modeling domain, there is currently no agreed-upon best similarity metric because there is no agreement on what the &amp;quot;same information&amp;quot; &#8212; the key data that a similarity function sho
