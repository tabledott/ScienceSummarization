s using the BBN parser and analyzed the results.
    For this analysis, we used 72 headlines produced by a third participant.1 The parsing results included 957 noun phrases (NP) and 315 clauses (S).
    We calculated percentages based on headline-level, NP-level, and Sentence-level structures in the parsing results.
    That is, we counted: Figure 3 summarizes the results of this automatic analysis.
    In our initial human inspection, we considered each of these categories to be reasonable candidates for deletion in our parse tree and this automatic analysis indicates that we have made reasonable choices for deletion, with the possible exception of trailing PPs, which show up in over half of the human-generated headlines.
    This suggests that we should proceed with caution with respect to the deletion of trailing PPs; thus we consider this to be an option only if no other is available.
