tion proceeds as follows: recent discourse referent of each equivalence class.
    The salience weight of each candidate is calculated and included in the list.
    The salience weight of a candidate can be modified in several ways: a.
    If a candidate follows the pronoun, its salience weight is reduced substantially (i.e., cataphora is strongly penalized). b.
    If a candidate fills the same slot as the pronoun, its weight is increased slightly (i.e., parallelism of grammatical roles is rewarded).
    It is important to note that, unlike the salience factors described in Section 2.1.4, these modifications of the salience weights of candidates are local to the the resolution of a particular pronoun. are determined.
    The possible sg (singular) and pl (plural) genders are determined; either of these can be a disjunction or nil.
    Pronominal forms in many languages are ambiguous as to number and gender; such ambiguities are taken into account by RAP's morphological filter and by the algorithm as a whole.
