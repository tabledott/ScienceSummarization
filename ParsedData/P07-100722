dicts the WSJ predominant sense for 6 nouns.
    Hence, the algorithm is able to predict the correct predominant sense for 18 out of 21 nouns overall, representing an accuracy of 86%.
    Figure 4 plots the curve a-estPred, which is similar to a-truePred, except that the predominant sense is now estimated by the EM-based algorithm.
    Employing count-merging with a-estPred produces the curve a-c-estPred.
    For comparison, the curves r, a, and a-truePred are also plotted.
    The results show that a-estPred performs consistently better than a, and a-c-estPred in turn performs better than aestPred.
    Hence, employing the predicted predominant sense and count-merging, we further improve the effectiveness of the active learning-based adaptation process.
    With reference to Figure 4, the WSD accuracies of the r and a curves before and after adaptation are 43.7% and 78.4% respectively.
    Starting from the mid-point 61.1% accuracy, which represents a 50% accuracy increase from 43.7%, we show in Table 2 the
