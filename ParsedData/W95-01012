raining corpus.
    If no prior knowledge is available, probabilities are initially either assigned randomly or evenly distributed.
    Although less accurate than the taggers built using manually annotated corpora, the fact that they can be trained using only a dictionary listing the allowable parts of speech for each word and not needing a manually tagged corpus is a huge advantage in many situations.
    Although a number of manually tagged corpora are available (eg.
    [Francis and Kucera, 1982; Marcus et al., 1993]), training on a corpus of one type and then applying the tagger to a corpus of a different type usually results in a tagger with low accuracy [Weischedel et al., 1993].
    Therefore, if tagged text is needed in training, this would require manually tagging text each time the tagger is to be applied to a new language, and even when being applied to a new type of text.
    In [Brill, 1992; Brill, 1994], a rule-based part of speech tagger is described which achieves highly competitive performan
