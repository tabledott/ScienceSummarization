ion operation by its effect on substrings is related to the work of Rounds (1985).
    Although embedding this version of LCFRS's in the framework of ILFP developed by Rounds (1985) is straightforward, our motivation was to capture properties shared by a family of grammatical systems and generalize them defining a class of related formalisms.
    This class of formalisms have the properties that their derivation trees are local sets, and manipulate objects, using a finite number of composition operations that use a finite number of symbols.
    With the additional assumptions, inspired by Rounds (1985), we can show that members of this class can be recognized in polynomial time.
    We use Alternating Turing Machines (Chandra, Kozen, and Stockmeyer, 1981) to show that polynomial time recognition is possible for the languages discussed in Section 4.3.
    An ATM has two types of states, existential and universal.
    In an existential state an ATM behaves like a nondeterministic TM, accepting if one of the app
