related to ours, concentrating on methods for incorporating joint information and for increasing robustness to parser error.
  
  
    Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) propose a method to model global dependencies by including a probability distribution over multi-sets of semantic role labels given a predicate.
    In this way the model can consider the assignment of all nodes in the parse tree and evaluate whether the set of realized semantic roles is likely.
    If a necessary role is missing or if an unusual set of arguments is assigned by the local model, this additional factor can correct some of the mistakes.
    The distribution over label multi-sets is estimated using interpolation of a relative frequency and a back-off distribution.
    The back-off distribution assumes each argument label is present or absent independently of the other labels, namely, it assumes a Bernoulli Naive Bayes model.
    The most likely assignment of labels according to such a joint model is found approximately using re-scoring o
