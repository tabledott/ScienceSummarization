  Soft Syntactic Constraints For Word Alignment Through Discriminative Training
  
    Word alignment methods can gain valuable guidance by ensuring that their alignments maintain cohesion with respect to the phrases specified by a monolingual dependency tree.
    However, this hard constraint can also rule out correct alignments, and its utility decreases as alignment models become more complex.
    We use a publicly available structured output SVM to create a max-margin syntactic aligner with a soft cohesion constraint.
    The resulting aligner is the first, to our knowledge, to use a discriminative learning method to train an ITG bitext parser.
  
  
    Given a parallel sentence pair, or bitext, bilingual word alignment finds word-to-word connections across languages.
    Originally introduced as a byproduct of training statistical translation models in (Brown et al., 1993), word alignment has become the first step in training most statistical translation systems, and alignments are useful to a host of
