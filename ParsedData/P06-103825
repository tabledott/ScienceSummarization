vercome the relative poorness of WordNet; (3) Recall: the number of words present in both C and WN divided by the number of (single) words in WN; (4) The number of correctly discovered words (New) that are not in WN.
    The Table also shows the number of WN words (:WN), in order to get a feeling by how much WN could be improved here.
    For each subject, we show the average over the 10 randomly selected pairs.
    Table 2 also shows the average of each measure over the subjects, and the two precision measures when computed on the total set of WN words.
    The (uncorrected) precision is the only metric given in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), who reported 82% (for the BNC.)
    Our method gives 90.47% for this metric on the same corpus.
    Our human-evaluated and WordNet-based results are better than the baseline and previous work respectively.
    Both are also of good standalone quality.
    Clearly, evaluation methodology for lexical acquisition tasks should be improved, which is an interesting research dire
