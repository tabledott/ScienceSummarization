ensity (7-19%) are so small that we cannot rely on each single appearance of the atom in the polar context.
    One possible approach is to set the threshold values for frequency in a polar context, max(p(a), n(a)) and for the ratio of appearances in polar contexts among the total appearances, max(p(a),n(a)) f(a) .
    However, the optimum threshold values should depend on the corpus and the initial lexicon.
    In order to set general criteria, here we assume that a true positive polar atom a should have higher p(a) f(a) than its average i.e. coherent density, cd(d, L+a), and also have higher p(a) than its average i.e. coherent precision, cp(d, L+a) and these criteria should be met with 90% confidence, where L+a is the initial lexicon with a added.
    Assuming the binomial distribution, a candidate polar atom is adopted as a positive polar atom7 if both (17) and (18) are satisfied$. where We can assume cd(d, L+a) ^_ cd(d, L), and cp(d, L+a) ^_ cp(d, L) when L is large.
    We compute the confidence interval
