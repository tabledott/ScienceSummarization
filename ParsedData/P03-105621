 or German (and also as with Chinese and English suffixes such as '/-ify) there is no ambiguity.
    But the sparse morphology of English and Chinese means that frequently there is noun/verb ambiguity at the word level.
    For English, most cases of this ambiguity can be resolved by the linguist on the basis of paradigmatic substitution in static context: whether an instance of the word raise, for example, is a noun or a verb can be quickly determined by checking whether raised can be substituted in the same context.
    Chinese, on the other hand, has no morphological paradigms, so any test to determine the part of speech must be made with syntagmatic substitution: whether the word can take an adverbial modifier or a prenominal modifier, for example.
    In both languages, there are borderline cases, but they are handled differently by the respective treebanks.
    In English, gerunds (VBG) have both nominal and verbal properties.
    In the English Treebank, they have a single POS tag, but their distributi
