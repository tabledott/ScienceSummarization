 and each other frontier node n?.
			For example, the span of VP[4-5] either precedes or follows, but never overlaps the span of any node n?
			on any graph frontier.
			This property does not hold for nodes outside of F . For instance, PP[4-5] and VBG[4] are two nodes of the same graph frontier, but they cannot be ordered because of their overlapping spans.
			The purpose of xRs rules in this framework is to order constituents along sensible frontiers in G, and all frontiers containing undefined orderings,as between PP[4-5] and VBG[4], must be disre garded during rule extraction.
			To ensure that xRs rules are prevented from attempting to re-orderany such pair of constituents, these rules are de signed in such a way that variables in their lhs can only match nodes of the frontier set.
			Rules that satisfy this property are said to be induced by G.2For example, rule (d) in Table 1 is valid accord ing to GHKM, since the spans corresponding to 1Note that we use a slightly different terminology.
