 L1 has a set of names, and one finds a document in L2 containing a set of names that look as if they could be transliterations of the names in the L1 document, then this should boost one&#8217;s confidence that the two sets of names are indeed transliterations of each other.
    We will demonstrate that this intuition is correct.
  
  
    In previous work on Chinese named-entity transliteration &#8212; e.g.
    (Meng et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2004), the problem has been cast as the problem of producing, for a given Chinese name, an English equivalent such as one might need in a machine translation system.
    For example, for the nameI-A*&#65533;&#65533;wei wei-lian-mu-si, one would like to arrive at the English name V(enus) Williams.
    Common approaches include sourcechannel methods, following (Knight and Graehl, 1998) or maximum-entropy models.
    Comparable corpora have been studied extensively in the literature (e.g.,(Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Franz et al., 1998; Ballesteros a
