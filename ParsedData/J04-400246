nguage word position j.
    In the following, we develop various heuristic functions r(Z) of increasing complexity.
    The simplest realization of a heuristic function r(Z) takes into account only the prior probability of an alignment template instantiation: The language model can be incorporated by considering that for each target word there exists an optimal language model probability: Here, we assume a trigram language model.
    In general, it is necessary to maximize over all possible different language model histories.
    We can also combine the language model and the lexicon model into one heuristic function: To include the phrase alignment probability in the heuristic function, we compute the minimum sum of all jump widths that is needed to complete the translation.
    This sum can be computed efficiently using the algorithm shown in Figure 8.
    Then, an admissible heuristic function for the jump width is obtained by Combining all the heuristic functions for the various models, we obtain as final
