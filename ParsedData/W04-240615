ery other vector to one of the K clusters whose centroid is closest to that vector.
    After all vectors are assigned, it recomputes the cluster centroids by averaging all of the vectors assigned to that cluster.
    This repeats until convergence, that is until no vector changes its cluster across iterations and the centroids stabilize.
    In similarity space, each instance can be viewed as a node of a fully connected weighted graph whose edges indicate the similarity between the instances they connect.
    K-means will first select K random nodes that represent the centroids of the initial K clusters.
    It will then assign every other node I to one of the K clusters such that the edge joining I and the centroid of that cluster has maximum weight among the edges joining I to all centroids.
    It is generally believed that the quality of clustering by partitional algorithms is inferior to that of the agglomerative methods.
    However, a recent study (Zhao and Karypis, 2002) has suggested that these conc
