    Appendix B: An Alternative Method for LogLoss In this appendix we sketch an alternative approach for feature selection in LogLoss that is potentially an efficient method, at the cost of introducing an approximation in the feature selection method.
    Until now, we have defined BestLoss&#240;k, &#175;a&#222; to be the minimum of the loss given that the kth feature is updated an optimal amount: BestLoss&#240;k, &#175;a&#222; 1/4 min LogLoss&#240;Upd&#240;&#175;a,k, d&#222;&#222; d In this section we sketch a different approach, based on results from Collins, Schapire, and Singer (2002), which leads to an algorithm very similar to that for ExpLoss in Figures 3 and 4.
    Take the following definitions (note the similarity to the definitions in equations (13), (14), (15), and (16), with only the definitions for Wk+ and Wk~ being altered): Note that the ExpLoss computations can be recovered by replacing qi,j in equation (B.1) with qi,j 1/4 emi,j&#240;&#175;a&#222;.
