	Using String-Kernels For Learning Semantic Parsers
		We present a new approach for mappingnatural language sentences to their formal meaning representations using string kernel-based classifiers.
		Our system learns these classifiers for every production in theformal language grammar.
		Meaning representations for novel natural language sen tences are obtained by finding the most probable semantic parse using these stringclassifiers.
		Our experiments on two real world data sets show that this approachcompares favorably to other existing sys tems and is particularly robust to noise.
	
	
			Computational systems that learn to transform natural language sentences into formal meaning rep resentations have important practical applicationsin enabling user-friendly natural language com munication with computers.
			However, most of the research in natural language processing (NLP) has been focused on lower-level tasks like syntactic parsing, word-sense disambiguation, information extraction etc. In this paper, we
