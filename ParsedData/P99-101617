    Ideally, a useful hierarchy should allow for multiple senses of a word, and this is an area which can be explored in future work.
    However, domain-specific text tends to greatly constrain which senses of a word will appear, and if the learned hierarchy is intended for use with the same type of text from which it was learned, it is possible that this would be of limited benefit.
    We used parsed text for these experiments because we believed we would get better results and the parsed data was readily available.
    However, it would be interesting to see if parsing is necessary or if we can get equivalent or nearly-equivalent results doing some simpler text processing, as suggested in Ahlswede and Evens (1988).
    Both Hearst (1992) and Riloff and Shepherd (1997) use unparsed text.
  
  
    Pereira et al. (1993) used clustering to build an unlabeled hierarchy of nouns.
    Their hierarchy is constructed top-down, rather than bottom-up, with nouns being allowed membership in mul
