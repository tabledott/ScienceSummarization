roviding an effective solution to the problem of assigning directions to the entailment relations (especially in the complex CLTE scenario, where entailment relations are multi-directional).
    Thanks to the contiguity between CLTE, TE and SMT, the proposed task provides an interesting scenario to approach the issues outlined above from different perspectives, and large room for mutual improvement.
  
  
    Given a pair of topically related text fragments (T1 and T2) in different languages, the CLTE task consists of automatically annotating it with one of the following entailment judgments (see Figure 1 for Spanish/English examples of each judgment): In this task, both T1 and T2 are assumed to be true statements.
    Although contradiction is relevant from an application-oriented perspective, contradictory pairs are not present in the dataset created for the first round of the task.
  
  
    Four CLTE corpora have been created for the following language combinations: Spanish/English (SP-EN), Italian/Englis
