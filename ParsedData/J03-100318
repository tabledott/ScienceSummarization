 G' iff there exists a bijection 7r: VH &#8594; VG, such that for all vertices v,w E VH and all l E L: (v, l, w) E EH &#65533;* (7r.v,l, 7r.w) E EG In words: The bijective function 7r maps all the vertices in H to corresponding vertices in G' in such a way that any edge with label l between vertices v and w in H is matched with an edge with the same label between the G' counterparts of v and w (i.e., 7r.v and 7r.w, respectively).
    When H is isomorphic to some subgraph of G by an isomorphism 7r, we write H C,r G. Given a graph H and a vertex v in H, and a graph G and a vertex w in G, we define that the pair (v, H) refers to the pair (w, G) iff H is connected and H C,r G and 7r.v = w. Furthermore, (v, H) uniquely refers to (w, G) (i.e., (v, H) is distinguishing) iff (v, H) refers to (w, G) and there is no vertex w' in G different from w such that (v, H) refers to (w', G).
    The problem considered in this article can now be formalized as follows: Given a graph G and a vertex w in G, find a pair (v, H) such
