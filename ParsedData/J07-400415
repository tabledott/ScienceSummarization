feature appears in a syntactic analysis.1 Abney calls the feature functions frequency functions and, like Abney, we will not always distinguish between a feature and its corresponding frequency function.
    There are practical difficulties with Abney&#8217;s proposal, in that finding the maximumlikelihood solution during estimation involves calculating expectations of feature values, which are sums over the complete space of possible analyses.
    Abney suggests a Metropolis-Hastings sampling procedure for calculating the expectations, but does not experiment with an implementation.
    Johnson et al. (1999) propose an alternative solution, which is to maximize the conditional likelihood function.
    In this case the likelihood function is the product of the conditional probabilities of the syntactic analyses in the data, each probability conditioned on the respective sentence.
    The advantage of this method is that calculating the conditional feature expectations only requires a sum over the syntactic an
