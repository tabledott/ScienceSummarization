    Whether for interesting subclasses of, grammars or specific grammars of interest, it is still important to determine how efficient parsing can be.
    A basic step in that direction is to estimate the cost added by unification to the operation of combining (reducing or expanding) a nonterminal in a derivation with a nonterminal in a grammar rule.
    Because definite clauses are only semidecidable, general proof procedures may not terminate for some sets of definite clauses.
    However, the specialized proof procedures we have derived from parsing algorithms are stable: if a set of definite clauses G is the translation of a context-free grammar, the procedure will always terminate (in success or failure) when to proving any start goal for G. More interesting in this context is the notion of strong stability, which depends on the following notion or offline parsability.
    A DCG is offline-parsable if its context-free skeleton is not infinitely ambiguous.
