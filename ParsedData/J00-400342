his type, or searches for indirect meronymy relations, yielded extremely low recall and precision at a very high computational cost; both types of search were dropped at the begirming of the tests we ran to process the corpus consulting WordNet (Poesio, Vieira, and Teufel 1997).
    The results of our tests with WordNet are presented in Section 5.4. that refer back to entities introduced by proper names (such as Pinkerton Inc .
