from the graphs and explained in the same way.
  In each dataset, the upper portions of the two graphs are identical: namely, the sets of pairs affording the highest and second-highest values of the two measures (relHS ?
  150, simLC &gt; 4).
  This happens because these sets are composed of WordNet synonym and parent-child pairs, respectively.11 Further down the Y-axis, we find that for the Miller?Charles data, the two graphs still follow each other quite closely in the middle region (2.4?3.2 for simLC and 90?100 for relHS).
  For the larger set of Rubenstein and Goodenough?s, however, differences appear.
  The pair automobile?cushion (#22), for instance, is ranked even with magician?oracle (#37) by the Hirst?St-Onge measure but far below both magician?oracle (#37) and bird?crane (#42) by Leacock?Chodorow (and, in fact, by all the other measures).
  The cause of such a high ranking in the former case is the following meronymic connection in WordNet: automobile/.
