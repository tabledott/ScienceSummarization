rocessing of structured templates (Paice and Jones, 1993), sentence compression (Hori et al., 2002; Knight and Marcu, 2001; Grefenstette, 1998, Luhn, 1958), and generation of abstracts from multiple sources (Radev and McKeown, 1998).
    We focus instead on the construction of headline-style abstracts from a single story.
    Headline generation can be viewed as analogous to statistical machine translation, where a concise document is generated from a verbose one using a Noisy Channel Model and the Viterbi search to select the most likely summarization.
    This approach has been explored in (Zajic et al., 2002) and (Banko et al., 2000).
    The approach we use in Hedge is most similar to that of (Knight and Marcu, 2001), where a single sentence is shortened using statistical compression.
    As in this work, we select headline words from story words in the order that they appear in the story&#8212;in particular, the first sentence of the story.
    However, we use linguistically motivated heuristics for shor
