stems generate concise summaries of news articles, answer fact-based questions, and recognize complex semantic and dialogue structure.
    But the challenges that lie ahead are still similar to the challenge that the field has faced since Winograd (1972): moving away from carefully hand-crafted, domaindependent systems toward robustness and domain independence.
    This goal is not as far away as it once was, thanks to the development of large semantic databases such as WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) and progress in domain-independent machine learning algorithms.
    Current information extraction and dialogue understanding systems, however, are still based on domain-specific frame-and-slot templates.
    Systems for booking airplane information use domain-specific frames with slots like ORIG CITY, DEST CITY, or DEPART TIME (Stallard 2000).
    Systems for studying mergers and acquisitions use slots like PRODUCTS, RELATIONSHIP, JOINT VENTURE COMPANY, and AMOUNT (Hobbs et al. 1997).
