n the nth test, the nth group is used as the testing data.
    Table 4 shows the detailed results for the cross validation tests, each row representing one test.
    As can be seen from the table, the joint model outperforms the baseline system in each test.
    Table 5 shows the overall accuracies of the baseline and joint systems, and compares them to the relevant models in the literature.
    The accuracy of each model is shown in a row, where &#8220;Ng&#8221; represents the models from Ng and Low (2004) and &#8220;Shi&#8221; represents the models from Shi and Wang (2007).
    Each accuracy measure is shown in a column, including the segmentation F-score (SF), the overall tagging F-score (TF) and the tagging accuracy by characters (TA).
    As can be seen from the table, our joint model achieved the largest improvement over the baseline, reducing the segmentation error by 14.58% and the overall tagging error by 12.18%.
    The overall tagging accuracy of our joint model was comparable to but less than the
