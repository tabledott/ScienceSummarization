age model re-ranking had virtually no influence, and resulted in a slight dip in accuracy to 71.7% In this experimental condition paraphrases were extracted from a set of automatic alignments produced by running Giza++ over a set of 1,036,000 GermanEnglish sentence pairs (roughly 28,000,000 words in each language).
    When the single best paraphrase (irrespective of context) was used in place of the original phrase in the evaluation sentence the accuracy reached 48.9% which is quite low compared to the 74.9% of the manually aligned set.
    As with the manual alignments it seems that we are selecting phrases which have the correct meaning but are not grammatical in context.
    Indeed our judges thought the meaning of the paraphrases to be correct in 64.5% of cases.
    Using a language model to select the best paraphrase given the context reduces the number of ungrammatical examples and gives an improvement in quality from 48.9% to 55.3% correct.
    These results suggest two things: that improving the qual
