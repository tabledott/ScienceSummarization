On one view, the rule only restricts the insertion of singleton strings and thus pairs such as (cd, cbbd) and (cd, ceed) would be included in the relation.
    This view is modeled by using the Dom(r U {E: c}) expression.
    On another view, the rule requires that lexically adjacent c and d must be separated by exactly one b on the surface, so that (cd, cbbd) and (cd, ceed) would be excluded in addition to (cd, ced) and (cd, cd).
    We can model this second interpretation by using 0* instead of Dom(r U { E:E}).
    The relation then restricts the surface realization of any number of introduced O's.
    It is not clear which of these interpretations leads to a more convenient formalism, but each of them can be modeled with regular devices.
    Karttunen and Beesley (1992, p. 22) discuss a somewhat different peculiarity that shows up in the analysis of epenthesis rules where one context is omitted (or equivalently, one context includes the pair E: c).
    The rule requires that a b corresponding to nothing in
