P1 is due to the following two reasons: domain dependence and insufficient sense coverage.
    Domain Dependence The accuracy figure of M1 for each noun is obtained by training a WSD classifier on the manually sense-tagged training data (with lumped senses) provided by SENSEVAL-2 organizers, and testing on the corresponding official test data (also with lumped senses), both of which come from similar domains.
    In contrast, the P1 score of each noun is obtained by training the WSD classifier on a mixture of six parallel corpora, and tested on the official SENSEVAL-2 test set, and hence the training and test data come from dissimilar domains in this case.
    Moreover, from the &#8220;docsrc&#8221; field (which records the document id that each training or test example originates) of the official SENSEVAL-2 training and test examples, we realized that there are many cases when some of the examples from a document are used as training examples, while the rest of the examples from the same document are used as
