    The parameters of Model 1 for a given pair of languages are normally estimated using EM, taking as training data a corpus of paired sentences of the two languages, such that each pair consists of sentence in one language and a possible translation in the other language.
    The training is normally initialized by setting all translation probability distributions to the uniform distribution over the target language vocabulary.
  
  
    Model 1 clearly has many shortcomings as a model of translation.
    Some of these are structural limitations, and cannot be remedied without making the model significantly more complicated.
    Some of the major structural limitations include: selected to generate the target word for a given position is independent of which or how many other target words the same source word is selected to generate.
    These limitations of Model 1 are all well known, they have been addressed in other word-alignment models, and we will not discuss them further here.
