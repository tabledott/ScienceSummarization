gorithm achieves 92% correct disambiguation, which is nearly 13% higher than achieved in our implementation.
    However, Yarowsky tested his implementation on a restricted vocabulary of 12 words, the majority of which were nouns, and used Roget large categories as senses.
    The baseline performance for this corpus is 66.5%, considerably higher than the 30.9% computed for the corpus used in our experiments.
    Another possible reason for the difference in results is the fact that Yarowsky used smoothing algorithms to avoid problems with the probability estimates caused by data sparseness.
    We did not employ these procedures and used simple corpus frequency counts when calculating the probabilities (see Section 4.5).
    It is not possible to say for sure that the differences between implementations did not lead to the differences in results, but it seems likely that the difference in the semantic granularity of LDOCE subject codes and Roget categories was an important factor.
