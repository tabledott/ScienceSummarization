pot phrasal constructions from this list.
    We have already looked at recognition of verb and particle constructions in the WSJ identified purely on syntactic grounds using the parses provided with the WSJ Penn Treebank 2 (Marcus et al., 1995) as a gold standard.
    The results for identifying verb and particle tokens are reported in table 1, both with and without the ANLT phrasal list (ANLT phr).
    We also give results for comparison obtained on the same data for another wide coverage parser, (MINIPAR (Lin, 1998b)).
    2 In the RASP parser grammatical relation output we identify phrasal verbs as being a verb modified by a particle (tagged RP) under the ncmod (non-clausal modifier) relation.
    It is quite possible that some particle tags have been given erroneously and that some genuine particles are not recognised as such by the parser, or are not attached to the verb by the parser.
    We only look at tokens in isolation and therefore do not collate evidence to look for syntactic evidence of particl
