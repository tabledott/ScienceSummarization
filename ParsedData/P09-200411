 each explicit relation and report results on ten-fold cross-validation over sections 2-22 of the PDTB using a Naive Bayes classifier4.
    Annotators were allowed to provide two senses for a given connective; in these cases, we consider either sense to be correct5.
    Contingency and Temporal are the senses most often annotated together.
    The connectives most often doubly annotated in the PDTB are when (205/989), and (183/2999), and as (180/743).
    Results are shown in Table 4.
    The sense classification accuracy using just the connective is already quite high, 93.67%.
    Incorporating the syntactic features raises performance to 94.15% accuracy.
    While the improvement is not huge, note that we seem to be approaching a performance ceiling.
    The human inter-annotator agreement on the top level sense class was also 94%, suggesting further improvements may not be possible.
    We provide some examples to give a sense of the type of errors that still occur.
