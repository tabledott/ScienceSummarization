] and the span of another entity is [82, e2], and Si &lt; 82, then el &lt; 82.
    Repeat Template (RT): If multiple entities in the same document are repetitions of the same name, their labels tend to have the same value (i.e. most of them are protein names, or most of them are not protein names).
    Later we discuss situations in which repetitions of the same protein name are not tagged as proteins, and design an approach to handle this.
    Acronym Template (AT): It is common convention that a protein is first introduced by its long name, immediately followed by its short-form (acronym) in parentheses.
    The definition of a candidate extraction from Section 3 leads to many overlapping entities.
    For example, 'glutathione S - transferase' is a base NP, and it generates five candidate extractions: 'glutathione', 'glutathione S', 'glutathione S - transferase', 'S - transferase', and 'transferase'.
    If 'gintathione S - transferase' has label-value 1, because the other four entities overlap with it, th
