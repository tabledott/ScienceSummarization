ord-based model.
    However, sub-words do not necessarily contain full word information.
    Moreover, sub-word extraction is performed separately from feature extraction.
    Another difference from our model is the rule-based submodel, which uses a dictionary-based forward maximum match method described by Sproat et al. (1996).
  
  
    Two sets of experiments were conducted.
    The first, used for development, was based on the part of Chinese Treebank 4 that is not in Chinese Treebank 3 (since CTB3 was used as part of the first bakeoff).
    This corpus contains 240K characters (150K words and 4798 sentences).
    80% of the sentences (3813) were randomly chosen for training and the rest (985 sentences) were used as development testing data.
    The accuracies and learning curves for the non-averaged and averaged perceptron were compared.
    The influence of particular features and the agenda size were also studied.
    The second set of experiments used training and testing sets from the first and sec
