  Translating Collocations For Bilingual Lexicons: A Statistical Approach
  
    Collocations are notoriously difficult for non-native speakers to translate, primarily because they are opaque and cannot be translated on a word-by-word basis.
    We describe a program named given a pair of parallel corpora in two different languages and a list of collocations in one of them, automatically produces their translations.
    Our goal is to provide a tool for compiling bilingual lexical information above the word level in multiple languages, for different domains.
    The algorithm we use is based on statistical methods and produces p-word translations of collocations in which not be the same.
    For example, .
