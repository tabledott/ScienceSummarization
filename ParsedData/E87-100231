n particular, do well to employ finite-state devices wherever possible.
    They are theoretically appealing because they are computational weak and best understood from a mathematical point of view.
    They are computationally appealing because they make for simple, elegant, and highly efficient implementaions.
    In this paper, I hope I have shown how they can be applied to a problem in nonconcatenative morphology which seems initially to require heavier machinary.
  
  
    In the last few years, so called finite-state morphology, in general, and two-level morphology in particular, have become widely accepted as paradigms for the computational treatment of morphology.
    Finite-state morphology appeals to the notion of a finite-state transducer, which is simply a classical finite-state automaton whose transitions are labeled with pairs, rather than with single symbols.
    The automaton operates on a pair of tapes and advances over a given transition if the current symbols on the tapes match the pair on
