.
    The basic idea of this method is to apply a maximum-likelihood approach to the joint probability of the parallel training corpus.
    The resulting optimization criterion for the bilingual word classes is similar to the one used in monolingual maximumlikelihood word clustering.
    5.
    We count all phrase-pairs of the training corpus which are consistent with the alignment matrix determined in step 2.
    A phrase-pair is consistent with the alignment if the words within the source phrase are only aligned to words within the target phrase.
    Thus we obtain a count n(z) of how often an alignment template occurred in the aligned training corpus.
    The probability of using an alignment template needed by Eq.
    (5) is estimated by relative frequency: Fig.
    3 shows some of the extracted alignment templates.
    The extraction algorithm does not perform a selection of good or bad alignment templates - it simply extracts all possible alignment templates.
    For decoding we use the following search
