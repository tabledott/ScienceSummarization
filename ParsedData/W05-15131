 the idea of greedily pursuing a single path, following parsing decisions made by a classifier.
    Despite their greedy nature, these parsers achieve high accuracy in determining dependencies.
    Although state-of-the-art statistical parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000) are more accurate, the simplicity and efficiency of deterministic parsers make them attractive in a number of situations requiring fast, light-weight parsing, or parsing of large amounts of data.
    However, dependency analyses lack important information contained in constituent structures.
    For example, the tree-path feature has been shown to be valuable in semantic role labeling (Gildea and Palmer, 2002).
    We present a parser that shares much of the simplicity and efficiency of the deterministic dependency parsers, but produces both dependency and constituent structures simultaneously.
    Like the parser of Nivre and Scholz (2004), it uses the basic shift-reduce stack-based parsing algorithm, and runs in linear time.
