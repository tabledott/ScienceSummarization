best performance was obtained for a model that uses sister-head dependencies for all categories.
    This model achieves up to 74% recall and precision, thus outperforming the unlexicalized baseline model.
    It can be hypothesized that this finding carries over to other treebanks that are annotated with flat structures.
    Such annotation schemes are often used for languages that (unlike English) have a free or semi-free wordorder.
    Testing our sister-head model on these languages is a topic for future research.
