 McKee define each of their classes according to a single argument structure, we demonstrate the usefulness of syntactic features that capture relations across different argument structures of a single verb.
    Furthermore, while Aone and McKee, and others, look at relative frequency of subcategorization frames (as with our TRANS feature), or relative frequency of a property of NPs within a particular grammatical function (as with our ANIM feature), we also look at the paradigmatic relations across a text between thematic arguments in different alternations (with our CAUS feature).
    McCarthy (2000) shows that a method very similar to ours can be used for identifying alternations.
    Her qualitative results confirm, however, what was argued in Section 2 above: counts that tap directly into the thematic assignments are necessary to fully identify a diathesis alternation.
    In fact, on close inspection, McCarthy's method does not distinguish between the induced-action alternation (which the unergatives ex
