r syntactic parsing and Moschitti (2004) for semantic role labeling.
    Generally, we can represent a parse tree T by a vector of integer counts of each sub-tree type (regardless of its ancestors): &#966;(T) = (# subtree1(T), ..., # subtreei(T), ..., # subtreen(T) ) where # subtreei(T) is the occurrence number of the ith sub-tree type (subtreei) in T. Since the number of different sub-trees is exponential with the parse tree size, it is computationally infeasible to directly use the feature vector&#966;(T) .
    To solve this computational issue, Collins and Duffy (2001) proposed the following parse tree kernel to calculate the dot product between the above high dimensional vectors implicitly. where N1 and N2 are the sets of nodes in trees T1 and T2, respectively, and ( ) I subtree i n is a function that is 1 iff the subtreei occurs with root at node n and zero otherwise, and &#8710;(n1,n2) is the number of the common subtrees rooted at n1 and n2, i.e.
    &#8710;(n1, n2) = &#8721;i Isubtreei (n1 ) &#8901; I
