on alternative composition methods evaluated on a shared semantic space, exploring parameters pertaining to the construction of the semantic space is not one of our priorities, although we cannot of course exclude that the nature of the underlying semantic space affects different composition methods differently.
    In the proposed adjective-specific linear map (alm) method, an AN is generated by multiplying an adjective weight matrix with a noun (column) vector.
    The j weights in the i-th row of the matrix are the coefficients of a linear regression predicting the values of the i-th dimension of the AN vector as a linear combination of the j dimensions of the component noun.
    The linear regression coefficients are estimated separately for each of the 36 tested adjectives from the corpus-observed noun-AN pairs containing that adjective (observed adjective vectors are not used).
    Since we are working in the 300-dimensional right singular vector space, for each adjective we have 300 regression problems
