ed optimizations and performing experiments with stochastic cost functions, there are three other lines for future research we would like to mention.
    The first concerns the construction of scene graphs.
    How should the decision be made as to which aspects of a scene to represent in the graph?
    Naturally, the algorithm can only refer to entities that are modeled in the scene graph, but representing every possible object in a single graph will lead to an explosion of edges and vertices.
    Perhaps some notion of focus of attention can be used to restrict the scene graph.
    It would also be interesting to look for automatic methods for the construction of scene graphs.
    We might use computer vision algorithms (see, e.g., Faugeras [1993]), which are often graph-based themselves, for this purpose.
    For example, Bauckhage et al. (1999) describe an assembly system in which computer vision is used to convert a workspace with various building blocks into a labeled directed scene graph.
    Note that
