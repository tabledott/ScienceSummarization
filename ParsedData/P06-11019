Applying these two independence assumptions we may express the conditional probability of our evidence given the taxonomy: Within our model we define the goal of taxonomy induction to be to find the taxonomy T&#65533; that maximizes the conditional probability of our observations E given the relationships of T, i.e., to find We propose a search algorithm for finding T&#65533; for the case of hyponym acquisition.
    We assume we begin with some initial (possibly empty) taxonomy T. We restrict our consideration of possible new taxonomies to those created by the single operation ADD-RELATION(Rij, T), which adds the single relation Rij to T. We define the multiplicative change OT(Rij) to the conditional probability P(E|T) given the addition of a single relation Rij: Here k is the inverse odds of the prior on the event Rij E T; we consider this to be a constant independent of i, j, and the taxonomy T. To enforce the taxonomic constraints in T, for each application of the ADD-RELATION operator we must add all new
