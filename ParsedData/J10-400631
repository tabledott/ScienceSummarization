 with the string sets forming the triples, and whose entries are the tuple weights.
    Given the toy weighted tuple structure in Table 1, the object in Table 2 is the corresponding labeled third-order tensor.
    Matricization rearranges a higher order tensor into a matrix (Kolda 2006; Kolda and Bader 2009).
    The simplest case is mode-n matricization, which arranges the mode-n fibers to be the columns of the resulting Dn x Dj matrix (where Dn is the dimensionality of the n-th index, Dj is the product of the dimensionalities of the other indices).
    Mode-n matricization of a third-order tensor can be intuitively understood as the process of making vertical, horizontal, or depth-wise slices of a three-way object like the tensor in Table 2, and arranging these slices sequentially to obtain a matrix (a two-way object).
    Matricization unfolds the tensor into a matrix with the n-th index indexing the rows of the matrix and a column for each pair of elements from the other two tensor indices.
