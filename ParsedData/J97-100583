hieved at the expense of the other metrics.
    Using the terminology of Figure 8, since the algorithm never predicts the class boundary, it is necessarily the case that a = 0, b = 0, recall = 0, and precision is undefined (&amp;quot;-&amp;quot; in Table 11).
    In addition, for T = 7, 2 of the 5 test sets happen to contain no boundaries; for these cases c -= 0 and thus the value of recall is also sometimes undefined.
    The problem of unbalanced data is not unique to the boundary classification task.
    Current work in machine learning is exploring ways to induce patterns relevant to the minority class, for example, by allowing users to explicitly specify different penalties for false positive and false negative errors (Lewis and Catlett 1994).
    (In contrast, C4.5 assumes that both types of errors are penalized equally.)
    Other researchers (e.g., Hirschberg [19911) have proposed sampling the majority class examples in a training set in order to produce a more balanced training sample. potheses using
