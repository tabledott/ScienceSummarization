n, as performed in A* fashion.
    This price is paid for the robustness that is obtained by using very flexible language and translation models.
    The language model allows sentences of arbitrary order and the translation model allows arbitrary word-order permutation.
    The models employ no structural constraints, relying instead on probability parameters to assign low probabilities to implausible sentences.
    This exhaustive space, together with massive number of parameters, permits greater modeling accuracy.
    But while accuracy is enhanced, translation efficiency suffers due to the lack of structure in the hypothesis space.
    The translation channel is characterized by two sets of parameters: translation and alignment probabilities.'
    The translation probabilities describe lexical substitution, while alignment probabilities describe word-order permutation.
    The key problem is that the formulation of alignment probabilities a(il j, V, T) permits the Chinese word in position j of a length-T
