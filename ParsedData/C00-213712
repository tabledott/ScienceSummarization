ave the same standard eviation (call this com- mon value s).
  The denominator estimates ,s using a weighte(1 average of 81 and s2.
  The weighting is b~sed on nl and r7,2.
  From Harnett (1982, Scc.
  8.7), the denominator Sd ~- nl  + n2 - 2 711 -b r~,2 ) i7,177,2 When nl = n2 (call this common value n), ~1 and s2 will be given equal weight, and Sd siml)li- fie.s to ~ + ,s~)/n.
  Making the substitut ion described above of si v/57 tbr si leads to an Sd of 949 s 2 the fbrm had earlier for the -t-, 2, we us ing independence assumption.
  Another test that both makes this assulnt)- tion and uses a tbrm of equation 1 is a test tbr binonlial data (Harnett, 1982, Sec.
  8.1.1) which uses the "taet" that binomial distributions tend to approximate normal distributions.
  In this test, the zis being compared are the fraction of the items of interest that are recovered by the ith technique.
  In this test, the denomina- tor sd of equation 1also has a complicated fbrm, both due to the reasons mentioned for the t, test
