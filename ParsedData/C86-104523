 confirms this hypothesis, the incremental {nstantiation f valency lists could be performed through sets of finite state machines.
			193 In Steedman's (1985) categorial grammars, long-distance dependencies are endcoded in the funct ion-argument structure of categories, The categories that form the path between filler and gap in a derivation tree all carry a valency slot for the filler.
			This uniform encoding of both subeategorization and long-distance dependencies in the argument structure of categories seems at first glance superior to the HPSG or PATR approaches to long-distance dependencies, in which the two types of information are marked in different feature sets.
			However, it turns out that the Steedman grammars have to mark the long-distance valency slots in order to dist inguish them from other valency slots.
			There could still be a justif ication for encoding the two types of dependencies in the same argument stack.
			One might loose important nesting information by separat ing the two types
