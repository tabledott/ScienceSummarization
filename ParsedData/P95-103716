ation of the sentence is shown in Figure 3.
    The nodes are constructed bottom-up from left-to-right, with the constraint that no constituent node is constructed until all of its children have been constructed.
    The order in which the nodes of the example sentence are constructed is indicated in the figure.
    Each code used by the PC is listed SPATTER consists of three main decision-tree models: a part-of-speech tagging model, a nodeextension model, and a node-labeling model.
    Each of these decision-tree models are grown using the following questions, where X is one of word, tag, label, or extension, and Y is either left and right: For each of the nodes listed above, the decision tree could also ask about the number of children and span of the node.
    For the tagging model, the values of the previous two words and their tags are also asked, since they might differ from the head words of the previous two constituents.
    The training algorithm proceeds as follows.
