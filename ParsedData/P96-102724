th the same semantics is put on the agenda when the quickly edge is move to the chart.
    Assuming that adverbs modify verb phrases and not sentences, there will be no interactions when the John ran edge is moved to the chart.
    When the edge for ran fast is moved, the possibility arises of creating the phrase ran fast quickly as well as ran fast fast.
    Both are rejected, however, on the grounds that they would involve using a predicate from the original semantic specification more than once.
    This would be similar to allowing a given word to be covered by overlapping phrases in free word-order parsing.
    We proposed eliminating this by means of a bit vector and the same technique applies here.
    The fruitful interactions that occur here are between ran fast and ran quickly on the one hand, and John on the other.
    Both give sentences whose semantics subsumes the entire input.
    Several things are noteworthy about the process just outlined.
    Points 4 and 5 are serious flaws in our scheme f
