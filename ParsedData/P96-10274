generally be possible to reduce 200 logical expressions to a canonical form but this does not mean that we should expect our generator to be compromised, or even greatly delayed, by trivial distinctions.
    Considerations of this kind were, in part, responsible for the recent resurgence of interest in &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; representations of logform (Copestake 996) and for the representations used for transfer in Shake-and-Bake translation (Whitelock, 1992).
    They have made semantic formalisms like those now usually associated with Davison (Davidson, 1980, Parsons, 1990) attractive in artificial intelligence for many years (Hobbs 1985, Kay, 1970).
    Operationally, the attraction is that the notations can be analyzed largely as free word-order languages in the manner outlined above.
    Consider the expression (I) (1) r: run(r), past(r), fast(r), argl(r, j), name(j, John) which we will take as a representation of the logical form of sentences ran fast ran quickly. consists of a distinguished index (r)
