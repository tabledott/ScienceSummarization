hat out of the 1051 paraphrase pairs that were extracted from more than one sentence group by the syntax-based algorithm, 62.3% were also extracted by the co-training algorithm; and out of the 2934 paraphrase pairs from the results of co-training algorithm, 33.4% were also extracted by the syntax-based algorithm.
    This shows that in spite of the very different cues the two different algorithms rely on, they do discover a lot of common pairs.
    In order to (roughly) estimate the recall (of lexical synonyms) of our algorithm, we use the synonymy relation in WordNet to extract all the synonym pairs present in our corpus.
    This extraction process yields the list of all WordNet-consistent synonym pairs that are present in our data.
    (Note that some of the pairs identified as synonyms by WordNet, like &#8220;follow/be&#8221;, are not really synonyms in the contexts defined in our data set, which may lead to artificial deflation of our recall estimate.)
    Once we have the list of WordNet-consistent para
