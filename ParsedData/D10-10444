imple and effective alternative to setting weights discriminatively to maximize a metric such as BLEU.
    A similar maximumlikelihood approach was used by Foster and Kuhn (2007), but for language models only.
    For comparison to information-retrieval inspired baselines, eg (L&#168;u et al., 2007), we select sentences from OUT using language model perplexities from IN.
    This is a straightforward technique that is arguably better suited to the adaptation task than the standard method of treating representative IN sentences as queries, then pooling the match results.
    The paper is structured as follows.
    Section 2 describes our baseline techniques for SMT adaptation, and section 3 describes the instance-weighting approach.
    Experiments are presented in section 4.
    Section 5 covers relevant previous work on SMT adaptation, and section 6 concludes.
  
  
    Standard SMT systems have a hierarchical parameter structure: top-level log-linear weights are used to combine a small set of complex featur
