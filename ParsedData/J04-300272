ilarity (Lin 1998) to identify adjectival and verbal clues of subjectivity.
    Table 9 summarizes the results of testing all of the above types of PSEs.
    All show increased precision in the evaluations.
    Together, they show consistency in performance.
    In almost all cases they perform better or worse on the same data sets, despite the fact that different kinds of data and procedures are used to learn them.
    In addition, PSEs learned using expression-level subjective-element data have precisions higher than baseline on document-level opinion piece data, and vice versa.
    Having a large stable of PSEs, it was important to disambiguate whether or not PSE instances are subjective in the contexts in which they appear.
    We discovered that the density of other potentially subjective expressions in the surrounding context is important.
    If a clue is surrounded by a sufficient number of other clues, then it is more likely to be subjective than if there were not.
