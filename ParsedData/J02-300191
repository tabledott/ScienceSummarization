dest: an automatic procedure for identifying semantic roles in text.
    We aim to use abstract roles as a means of generalizing from limited training data in various semantic domains.
    We see this effort as consistent with various theoretical accounts of the underlying mechanisms of argument linking, since the various theories all postulate some sort of generalization between the roles of specific predicates.
    To this end, we developed a correspondence from frame-specific roles to a set of abstract thematic roles.
    For each frame, an abstract thematic role was assigned to each frame element in the frame&#8217;s definition.
    Since there is no canonical set of abstract semantic roles, we decided upon the list shown in Table 17.
    We are interested in adjuncts as well as arguments, leading to roles such as DEGREE not found in many theories of verb-argument linking.
    The difficulty of fitting many relations into standard categories such as AGENT and PATIENT led us to include other roles such as
