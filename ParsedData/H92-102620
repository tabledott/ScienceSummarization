resolves ambiguities.
  138 Figure 3 shows an example of the representation of a history in HBG for the prepositional phrase "with a list."
  In this example, the immediate parent of the N1 node is the NBAR4 node and the functional parent of N1 is the PP1 node.
  Resu l ts We compared the performance of HBG to the "broad- coverage" probabilistic ontext-free grammar, P-CFG.
  The any-consisgen$ rate of the grammar is 90% on test sentences of 7 to 17 words.
  The Vigerbi rate of P-CFG is 60% on the same test corpus of 760 sentences used in our experiments.
  On the same test sentences, the HBC model has a Viterbi rate of 75%.
  This is a reduction of 37% in error rate.
  Accuracy P-CFG 59.8% HBG 74.6% Error Reduction 36.8% Figure 4: Parsing accuracy: P-CFG vs. HBG In developing HBG, we experimented with similar mod- els of varying complexity.
  One discovery made during this experimentation is that models which incorporated more context than HBG performed slightly worse than HBG.
  This suggests that the curren
