    In general, the machine learning results have slightly greater variation around the average.
    The performance of the learned decision trees averaged over the 5 test narratives is shown in Table 9.
    Comparison of Tables 8 and 9 shows that, as with the error analysis results (and as expected), average performance is worse when applied to the testing rather than the training data, particularly with respect to precision.
    However, the best machine learning performance is an improvement over our previous best results (EA in Table 7).
    For T = 3, &amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot; is comparable to EA while &amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot; is better.
    For T = 4, EA is better than &amp;quot;Learning 1&amp;quot;, but &amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot; is better still.
    However, as with the training data, EA has somewhat less variation around the average.
    We also use the resampling method of cross-validation (Weiss and Kulikowski 1991) to estimate performance, which averages results over multipl
