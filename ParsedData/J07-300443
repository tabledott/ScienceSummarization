ee grammar, they are generally trained and tested on a version of the Treebank in which these null elements and indices are deleted or ignored, or, in the case of Collin&#8217;s (1999) Model 3, only partially captured.
    Non-local dependencies are therefore difficult to recover from their output.
    In CCG, long-range dependencies are represented without null elements or traces, and coindexation is restricted to arguments of the same lexical functor category.
    Although this mechanism is less expressive than the potentially unrestricted coindexation used in the Treebank, it allows parsers to recover non-anaphoric long-range dependencies directly, without the need for further postprocessing or trace insertion.
    Passive.
    In the Treebank, the surface subject of a passive sentence is coindexed with a &#8727; null element in direct object position: Our translation algorithm uses the presence of the &#8727; null element to identify passive mode, but ignores it otherwise, assigning the CCG category S[pss
