2; nc'}).
    This ensures that the total frequency credit at any P across the hyponym hierarchy equals the credit for the conditioning vc.
    This will be the sum of the frequency credit for all verbs that are direct members or troponyms of the vc, divided by the number of other senses of each of these verbs: TCMs for the direct-object slot of two verb classes that include the verb seize.
    To ensure that the TCM covers all NS in WordNet, we modify Li and Abe&#8217;s original scheme by creating hyponym leaf classes below all WordNet&#8217;s internal classes in the hyponym hierarchy.
    Each leaf holds the ns previously held at the internal class.
    Figure 4 shows portions of two TCMs.
    The TCMs are similar, as they both contain the verb seize, but the TCM for the class that includes clutch has a higher probability for the entity noun class compared to the class that also includes assume and usurp.
    This example includes only top-level WordNet classes, although the TCM may use more specific noun c
