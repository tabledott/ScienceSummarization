    This more local approach has a number of advantages over computing a global analysis.
    First, as just noted it is much more efficient to compute these partial analyses rather than to compute global analyses of the entire sentence.
    Second, there are rare cases in which the same substring functions as both repair and reparandum (i.e., the repair string is itself repaired again).
    A single global analysis would not be able to capture this (since the TAG channel model does not permit the same substring to be both a reparandum and a repair), but we combine these overlapping repair substring analyses in a post-processing operation to yield an analysis of the whole sentence.
    (We do insist that the reparandum and interregnum of a repair do not overlap with those of any other repairs in the same analysis).
  
  
    This section describes how we evaluate our noisy model.
    As mentioned earlier, following Charniak and Johnson (2001) our test data consisted of all Penn III Switchboard tree-bank s
