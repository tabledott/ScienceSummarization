absolute boundary positions: Each antecedent was associated with the position of its first or last word in the dialogue, and agreement was calculated using &#945; with the interval distance metric.
    This gave us &#945; values of 0.998 for the beginnings of the antecedent-evoking area and 0.999 for the ends.
    This is because expected disagreement is exceptionally low: Coders tend to mark discourse antecedents close to the referring expression, so the average distance between antecedents of the same expression is smaller than the size of the dialogue by a few orders of magnitude.
    The second method associated each antecedent with the position of its first or last word relative to the beginning of the anaphoric expression.
    This time we found extremely low values of &#945; = 0.167 for beginnings of antecedents and 0.122 for ends&#8212; barely in the positive side.
    This shows that agreement among coders is not dramatically better than what would be expected if they just marked discourse antecedent
