    By allowing edges to exist between nodes of all the languages if they are aligned, the pivot can now even be a set of nodes rather than a single node in another language.
    For example, one could easily find the following path in such a graph: ate lunch &#8594; a&#223;en zu ittag (German) &#8594; aten een hapje (Dutch) &#8594; had a bite In general, each edge is associated with a weight corresponding to the bilingual phrase translation probability.
    Random walks are then sampled from the graph in such a way that only paths of high probability end up contributing to the extracted paraphrases.
    Obviously, the alignment errors discussed in the context of simple pivoting will also have an adverse effect on this approach.
    In order to prevent this, the authors add special feature nodes to the graph in addition to regular nodes.
    These feature nodes represent domain-specific knowledge of what would make good paraphrases.
    For example, nodes representing syntactic equivalence classes of t
