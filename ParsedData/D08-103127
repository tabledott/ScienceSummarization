, we believe it provides a realistic measure for the performance of the end-to-end system and focuses the evaluation on the coreference component.
    The results of our end-to-end coreference system are shown in Table 7.
  
  
    We described and evaluated a state-of-the-art coreference system based on a pairwise model and strong features.
    While previous work showed the impact of complex models on a weak pairwise baseline, the applicability and impact of such models on a strong baseline system such as ours remains uncertain.
    We also studied and demonstrated the relative value of various types of features, showing in particular the importance of distance and apposition features, and showing which features impact precision or recall more.
    Finally, we showed an end-to-end system capable of determining coreference in a plain text document.
