    Other guidelines or books on abstracting (ANSI, 1997; Cremmins, 1982) do not discuss the issue.
    Our cut and paste based summarization is a computational model; we make no claim that humans use the same cut and paste operations.
    We manually analyzed 30 articles and their corresponding human-written summaries; the articles and their summaries come from different domains ( 15 general news reports, 5 from the medical domain, 10 from the legal domain) and the summaries were written by professionals from different organizations.
    We found that reusing article text for summarization is almost universal in the corpus we studied.
    We defined six operations that can be used alone, sequentially, or simultane
