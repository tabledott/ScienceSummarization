se.7 After the head child is attached to a node, the node&#8217;s lexical head is identified and that word is added to the set of features input directly to the node&#8217;s subsequent history representations.
    This adds an inductive bias towards treating the lexical head as important for post-head parsing decisions.
    The results show that this inductive bias does improve performance, but not enough to compensate for the degradation caused by having to learn to identify head children.
    The lack of a large improvement suggests that the SSN-Freq 200 model already learns the significance of lexical heads, but perhaps a different method for incorporating the bias towards con7If a node&#8217;s head child is a word, then that word is the node&#8217;s lexical head.
    If a node&#8217;s head child is a nonterminal, then the lexical head of the head child is the node&#8217;s lexical head. ditioning on lexical heads could improve performance a little.
    The third model (head word and child) extends the head
