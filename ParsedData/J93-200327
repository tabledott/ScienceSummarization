ts arguments are the same and equal to zero otherwise.
    This partial derivative will be zero provided that Superficially, Equation (10) looks like a solution to the extremum problem, but it is not because the translation probabilities appear on both sides of the equal sign.
    Nonetheless, it suggests an iterative procedure for finding a solution: given an initial guess for the translation probabilities, we can evaluate the right-hand side of Equation (10) and use the result as a new estimate for t(f le).
    (Here and elsewhere, the Lagrange multipliers simply serve as a reminder that we need to normalize the translation probabilities so that they satisfy Equation (7).)
    This process, when applied repeatedly, is called the EM algorithm.
    That it converges to a stationary point of h in situations like this was first shown by Baum (1972) and later by others (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977).
    With the aid of Equation (5), we can reexpress Equation (10) as number of times e connects to f in a We ca
