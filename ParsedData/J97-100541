 the small number of subjects.
    Since, as noted above, we would expect reliability to be much higher if there were seven subjects, we believe that values above .5 for N = 4 subjects indicate reproducibility.
    On average a = .58 and the spread is low (a = .09).
    3.2.4 Percent Agreement.
    Both significance and reliability can stand alone as evaluation metrics, unlike percent agreement.
    However, we also report percent agreement in order to compare results with other studies.
    As defined in Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992), percent agreement is the ratio of observed agreements with the majority opinion to possible agreements with the majority opinion.
    As detailed in Passonneau and Litman (1996), the average percent agreement for our subjects on all 20 narratives is 89% (max.
    = 92%; min .
    = 82%).
    On average, percent agreement is highest on nonboundaries (91%; max.
    95%; min = 84%) and lowest on boundaries (73%; max.
    = 80%; min.
    =- 60%), reflecting the fact that nonbou
