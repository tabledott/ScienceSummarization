d &#8220;Microsoft&#8221; is above the threshold.
    Similarly, we can find &#8220;price&#8221; as the extended targets for &#8220;iPhone&#8221; from &#8220;the price of iPhone&#8221; and &#8220;LoveGame&#8221; for &#8220;Lady Gaga&#8221; from &#8220;LoveGame by Lady Gaga&#8221;.
    Target-dependent sentiment classification needs to distinguish the expressions describing the target from other expressions.
    In this paper, we rely on the syntactic parse tree to satisfy this need.
    Specifically, for any word stem wi in a tweet which has one of the following relations with the given target T or any from the extended target set, we generate corresponding target-dependent features with the following rules: &#8226; wi is a transitive verb and T (or any of the extended target) is its object; we generate a feature wi _arg2.
    &#8220;arg&#8221; is short for &#8220;argument&#8221;.
    For example, for the target iPhone in &#8220;I love iPhone&#8221;, we generate &#8220;love_arg2&#8221; as a feature. has T (or
