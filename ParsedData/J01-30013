 WSD systems that base results on a limited number of words, for example Yarowsky (1995) and Schtitze (1992) who quoted results for 12 words, and a second group, including Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993) and Bruce and Wiebe (1994), who gave results for just one, namely interest.
    But limiting the vocabulary on which a system is evaluated can have two serious drawbacks.
    First, the words used were not chosen by frequency-based sampling techniques and so we have no way of knowing whether or not they are special cases, a point emphasised by Kilgarriff (1997).
    Secondly, there is no guarantee that the techniques employed will be applicable when a larger vocabulary is tackled.
    However it is likely that mark-up for a restricted vocabulary can be carried out more rapidly since the subject has to learn the possible senses of fewer words.
    Among the researchers mentioned above, one must distinguish between, on the one hand, supervised approaches that are inherently limited in performance to the wo
