ior polarity is to automatically acquire the polarity of words or phrases for listing in a lexicon.
    Our work on recognizing contextual polarity begins with a lexicon of words with established prior polarities and then disambiguates in the corpus the polarity being expressed by the phrases in which instances of those words appear.
    To make the relationship between that task and ours clearer, some word lists that are used to evaluate methods for recognizing prior polarity (positive and negative word lists from the General Inquirer [Stone et al. 1966] and lists of positive and negative adjectives created for evaluation by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown [1997]) are included in the prior-polarity lexicon used in our experiments.
    For the most part, the features explored in this work differ from the ones used to identify prior polarity with just a few exceptions.
    Using a feature to capture conjunctions between clue instances was motivated in part by the work of Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997).
