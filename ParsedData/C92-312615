he probability of Ti is given by P(T i) = P( (t l l r%.r3t lm) u .... ~ (tglc3...r~tknvJ k ~p In shortened form: P(Ti) = P (u  (el tlxl) p=l q=l Tile events tpq are no__L mutually exclusive, since conslructions can overlap, and can include other constructions.
  The formula for tim joint probability of events E i is given by: n n P(,3 E i) = 11 lOSilEi_l.,.hl) i=l i=l Tile formula for the probability of combination of events E i (that are not independent) is given by (see e.g.
  [Harris 1966]): k P(L/ Ei) = X P(Ei) - X l(ldi1~Li2) + X P(hit,~Ei2~Ei3) i=l i i1&lt;i2 i1&lt;i2.~i3 - .... +/- P (E I~E2~ ... c~lS k) We will use Bayes decomposition formula to derive the conditional probability of "1) given s. Let 7/~ and Tj be parses of s; the conditional probability of T i given s, is illen given by: P(Ti)P(sFI" i) P(r)P(srl~) V(7)ts)  .
  P(s) z~j P(Tj)P(slTj) Since P(slTj) is 1 for all j, we may write P(T) P(Tils ) .
