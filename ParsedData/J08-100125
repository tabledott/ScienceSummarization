    In previous implementations of entity-based models, classes of coreferent nouns have been extracted manually (Miltsakaki and Kukich 2000; Karamanis et al. 2004; Poesio et al.
    2004), but this is not an option for our model.
    An obvious solution for identifying entity classes is to employ an automatic coreference resolution tool that determines which noun phrases refer to the same entity in a document.
    Current approaches recast coreference resolution as a classification task.
    A pair of NPs is classified as coreferring or not based on constraints that are learned from an annotated corpus.
    A separate clustering mechanism then coordinates the possibly contradictory pairwise classifications and constructs a partition on the set of NPs.
    In our experiments, we employ Ng and Cardie&#8217;s (2002) coreference resolution system.
    The system decides whether two NPs are coreferent by exploiting a wealth of lexical, grammatical, semantic, and positional features.
    It is trained on the
