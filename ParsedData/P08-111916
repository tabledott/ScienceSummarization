 and used as the seed for the next bootstrapping iteration.
    We experimented with three scoring functions for selecting nodes.
    The In-Degree (inD) score for vertex v is the sum of the weights of all incoming edges (u, v), where u is a trusted class member.
    Intuitively, this captures the popularity of v among instances that have already been identified as good instances.
    The Best Edge (BE) score for vertex v is the maximum edge weight among the incoming edges (u, v), where u is a trusted class member.
    The Key Player Problem (KPP) measure is used in social network analysis (Borgatti and Everett, 2006) to identify nodes whose removal would result in a residual network of minimum cohesion.
    A node receives a high value if it is highly connected and relatively close to most other nodes in the graph.
    The KPP score for vertex v is computed as: where d(u, v) is the shortest path between two vertices, where u is a trusted node.
    For tie-breaking, the distances are multiplied by the weight
