  Speed And Accuracy In Shallow And Deep Stochastic Parsing
  
    This paper reports some experiments that compare the accuracy and performance of two stochastic parsing systems.
    The currently popular Collins parser is a shallow parser whose output contains more detailed semanticallyrelevant information than other such parsers.
    The XLE parser is a deep-parsing system that couples a Lexical Functional Grammar to a loglinear disambiguation component and provides much richer representations theory.
    We measured the accuracy of both systems against a gold standard of the PARC 700 dependency bank, and also measured their processing times.
    We found the deep-parsing system to be more accurate than the Collins parser with only a reduction in parsing
  
  
    In applications that are sensitive to the meanings expressed by natural language sentences, it has become common in recent years simply to incorporate publicly available statistical parsers.
    A state-of-the-art statistical parsing system that
