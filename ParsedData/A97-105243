ger acquisition corpus, and extensions to the system to deal with nominal and adjectival predicates would improve accuracy still further.
    Nevertheless, this experiment demonstrates that lexicalizing a grammar/parser with subcategorization frequencies can appreciably improve the accuracy of parse ranking.
  
  
    Brent's (1993) approach to acquiring subcategorization is based on a philosophy of only exploiting unambiguous and determinate information in unanalysed corpora.
    He defines a number of lexical patterns (mostly involving closed class items, such as pronouns) which reliably cue one of five subcategorization classes.
    Brent does not report comprehensive results, but for one class, sentential complement verbs, he achieves 96% precision and 76% recall at classifying individual tokens of 63 distinct verbs as exemplars or non-exemplars of this class.
    He does not attempt to rank different classes for a given verb.
