speech processing tools (such as named entity recognizers, speech recognizers, morphological analyzers, etc.).
    These upstream processes tend to generate multiple, erroneous hypotheses with varying confidence.
    Current MT systems are designed to process only one input hypothesis, making them vulnerable to errors in the input.
    In experiments with confusion networks, we have focused so far on the speech translation case, where the input is generated by a speech recognizer.
    Namely, our goal is to improve performance of spoken language translation by better integrating speech recognition and machine translation models.
    Translation from speech input is considered more difficult than translation from text for several reasons.
    Spoken language has many styles and genres, such as, formal read speech, unplanned speeches, interviews, spontaneous conversations; it produces less controlled language, presenting more relaxed syntax and spontaneous speech phenomena.
    Finally, translation of spoken la
