  Class-Based Probability Estimation Using A Semantic Hierarchy
  
    This article concerns the estimation of a particular kind of probability, namely, the probability of a noun sense appearing as a particular argument of a predicate.
    In order to overcome the accompanying sparse-data problem, the proposal here is to define the probabilities in terms of senses from a semantic hierarchy and exploit the fact that the senses can be grouped into classes consisting of semantically similar senses.
    There is a particular focus on the problem of how to determine a suitable class for a given sense, or, alternatively, how to determine a suitable level of generalization in the hierarchy.
    A procedure is developed that uses a chi-square test to determine a suitable level of generalization.
    In order to test the performance of the estimation method, a pseudo-disambiguation task is used, together with two alternative estimation methods.
    Each method uses a different generalization procedure; the first alte
