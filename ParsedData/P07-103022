ames of hotels and lounges) and another three were not interesting.
    Apparently, the requirement that half the constellations appear in a relation limited the number of viable relations since many constellations are quite obscure.
    The six interesting relations are shown in Table 3 along with precision and coverage.
  
  
    In this paper we have addressed a novel type of problem: given a specific concept, discover in fully unsupervised fashion, a range of relations in which it participates.
    This can be extremely useful for studying and researching a particular concept or field of study.
    As others have shown as well, two concept words can be sufficient to generate almost the entire class to which the words belong when the class is welldefined.
    With the method presented in this paper, using no further user-provided information, we can, for a given concept, automatically generate a diverse collection of binary relations on this concept.
    These relations need not be pre-specified in any way
