ency format required the definition of a head table.
    Fortunately, in contrast to the Penn Treebank for which the head table is based on POS22 we could use the grammatical functions annotated in these treebanks.
    Therefore, head rules are often of the form: the head child of a VP/clause is the child with the HD/predicator/hd/Head function.
    The DEPREL value for a token is the function of the biggest constituent of which this token is the lexical head.
    If the constituent comprising the complete sentence did not have a function, we gave its lexical head token the DEPREL &#8220;ROOT&#8221;.
    For the Chinese treebank, most functions are not grammatical functions (such as &#8220;subject&#8221;, &#8220;object&#8221;) but semantic roles (such as &#8220;agent&#8221;, &#8220;theme&#8221;).
    For the Portuguese treebank, the conversion was complicated by the fact that a detailed specification existed which tokens should be the head of which other tokens, e.g. the finite verb must be the head of the su
