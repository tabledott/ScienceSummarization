 morphological properties when available.
    The benefit of each of these is shown in Table 2.
    These results report the average labeled and unlabeled precision for the 10 languages with the smallest training sets.
    This allowed us to train new models quickly.
    Table 2 shows that each component of our system does not change performance significantly (rows 24 versus row 1).
    However, if we only allow projective parses, do not use morphological features and label edges with a simple atomic classifier, the overall drop in performance becomes significant (row 5 versus row 1).
    Allowing non-projective parses helped with freer word order languages like Dutch (78.8%/74.7% to 83.6%/79.2%, unlabeled/labeled accuracy).
    Including rich morphology features naturally helped with highly inflected languages, in particular Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, Slovene and to a lesser extent Dutch and Portuguese.
    Derived morphological features improved accuracy in all these languages by 1-3% absolute.
