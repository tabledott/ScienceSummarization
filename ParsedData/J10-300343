(of 11 sentences) that contains sentences longer than 45 words is discarded.
    Next, each sentence in each of the groups is parsed.
    All the parse trees are then iteratively merged into a shared forest.
    The merging algorithm proceeds top-down and continues to recursively merge constituent nodes that are expanded identically.
    It stops upon reaching the leaves or upon encountering the same constituent node expanded using different grammar rules.
    Figure 5(a) shows how the merging algorithm would work on two simple parse trees.
    In the figure, it is apparent that the leaves of the forest encode paraphrasing information.
    However, the merging only allows identical constituents to be considered as paraphrases.
    In addition, keyword-based heuristics need to be employed to prevent inaccurate merging of constituent nodes due to, say, alternations of active and passive voices among the The merging algorithm.
