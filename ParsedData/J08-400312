ency structures for sentences solely from an annotated corpus, as in the work of Eisner (1996), Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), Nivre, Hall, and Nilsson (2004), and McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira (2005), among others.
    One potential advantage of such models is that they are easily ported to any domain or language in which annotated resources exist.
    In this kind of framework the syntactic structure of a sentence is modeled by a dependency graph, which represents each word and its syntactic dependents through labeled directed arcs.
    This is exemplified in Figure 1, for a Czech sentence taken from the Prague Dependency graph for an English sentence from the Penn Treebank.
    Dependency Treebank (Haji&#711;c et al. 2001; B&#168;ohmov&#180;a et al.
    2003), and in Figure 2, for an English sentence taken from the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993; Marcus et al. 1994).1 An artificial word ROOT has been inserted at the beginning of each sentence, serving as the unique root of the grap
