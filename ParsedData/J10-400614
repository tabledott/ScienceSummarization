 While some of the ad hoc models that were developed to tackle specific tasks do outperform our most successful DM implementation, the latter is never too far from the top, without any task-specific tuning.
    We think that the advantage of having a general model that does not need to be retrained for each new task outweighs the (often minor) performance advantage of the task-specific models.
    The article is structured as follows.
    After framing our proposal within the general debate on co-occurrence modeling in distributional semantics (Section 2), we introduce the DM framework in Section 3 and compare it to other unified approaches in Section 4.
    Section 5 pertains to the specific implementations of the DM framework we will test experimentally.
    The experiments are reported in Section 6.
    Section 7 concludes by summarizing what we have achieved, and discussing the implications of these results for corpus-based distributional semantics.
