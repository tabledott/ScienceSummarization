, but does not allow marking an utterance as both an acknowledgment and a statement; a choice has to be made.
    This tagset results in overall agreement of K = 0.80.
    Interestingly, subsequent developments of SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL backtracked on some of these decisions.
    For instance, the ICSI-MRDA tagset developed for the annotation of the ICSI Meeting Recorder corpus reintroduces some of the DAMSL ideas, in that annotators are allowed to assign multiple SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL labels to utterances (Shriberg et al. 2004).
    Shriberg et al. achieved a comparable reliability to that obtained with SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL, but only when using a tagset of just five &#8220;class-maps&#8221;.
    Shriberg et al. (2004) also introduced a hierarchical organization of tags to improve reliability.
    The dimensions of the DAMSL scheme can be viewed as &#8220;superclasses&#8221; of dialogue acts which share some aspect of their meaning.
    For instance, the dimension of Influencing-Addressee-Future-Action (IAFA) includes th
