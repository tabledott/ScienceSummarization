 subcategorized arguments.
    Additionally, clausal complements such as those introduced by that function both as an argument and as a marker that this is the final argument. conjunction, the scope of which is ambiguous, or a relative clause, since there will be a gap somewhere within it which would give a wrong observation).
    However, there are many other things that the parser does wrong or does not notice (such as reduced relatives).
    One could continue to refine the parser (up to the limits of what can be recognized by a finite state device), but the strategy has been to stick with something simple that works a reasonable percentage of the time and then to filter its results to determine what subcategorizations verbs actually have.
    Note that the parser does not distinguish between arguments and adjuncts.12 Thus the frame it reports will generally contain too many things.
    Indicative results of the parser can be observed in Fig.
