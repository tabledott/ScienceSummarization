c configurations) cannot be guaranteed to match and yield an interpretation.
    These requirements immediately suggest that approaches that recover only lexical tags (e.g. de Rose 1988) or a syntactic analysis that is the 'closest fit' to some previously defined set of possible analyses (e.g.
    Sampson, Haigh, and Atwell 1989), are inadequate (taken alone).
    Pioneering approaches to corpus analysis proceeded on the assumption that computationally tractable generative grammars of sufficiently general coverage could not be developed (see, for example, papers in Garside, Leech, and Sampson 1987).
    However, the development of wide-coverage declarative and computationally tractable grammars makes this assumption questionable.
    For example, the ANLT word and sentence grammar (Grover et al. 1989; Carroll and Grover 1989) consists of an English lexicon of approximately 40,000 lexemes and a 'compiled' fixed-arity term unification grammar containing around 700 phrase structure rules.
