rom the fact (observed by Vijay-Shanker (1992)) that adjoining is an overly restricted way of combining structures.
    We illustrate the problem by considering Kashmiri drawing on Bhatt (1994).
    Whextraction in Kashmiri proceeds as in English, except that the wh-word ends up in sentence-second position, with a topic from the matrix clause in sentence-initial position.
    This is illustrated in (2a) for a simple clause and in (2b) for a complex clause.
    Since the moved element does not appear in sentence-initial position, the TAG analysis of English wit-extraction of Kroch (1987; 1989) (in which the matrix clause is adjoined into the embedded clause) cannot be transferred, and in fact no linguistically plausible TAG analysis appears to be available.
    In the past, variants of TAG have been developed to extend the range of possible analyses.
    In Multi-Component TAG (MCTAG) (Joshi, 1987), trees are grouped into sets which must be adjoined together (multicomponent adjunction).
    However, MCTAG lack
