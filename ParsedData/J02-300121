    The system will be extended in later sections.
    We first describe in detail the sentence- and constituent-level features on which our system is based and then use these features to calculate probabilities for predicting frame element labels in Section 4.2.
    In this section we give results for a system that labels roles using the human-annotated boundaries for the frame elements within the sentence; we return to the question of automatically identifying the boundaries in Section 5.
    Our system is a statistical one, based on training a classifier on a labeled training set and testing on a held-out portion of the data.
    The system is trained by first using an automatic syntactic parser to analyze the 36,995 training sentences, matching annotated frame elements to parse constituents and extracting various features from the string of words and the pa
