rouped together into clusters.
    In this paper, we use Ward's and McQuitty's methods to form clusters of observations, where each observation is represented by a row in a dissimilarity matrix.
    In Ward's method, the internal variance of a cluster is the sum of squared distances between each observation in the cluster and the mean observation for that cluster (i.e., the average of all the observations in the cluster).
    At each step in Ward's method, a new cluster, CKL, with the smallest possible internal variance, is created by merging the two clusters, CK and CL, that have the minimum variance between them.
    The variance between CK and CL is computed as follows: where TK is the mean observation for cluster CK) NK is the number of observations in CK, and Tr, and NL are defined similarly for CL.
    Implicit in Ward's method is the assumption that the sample comes from a mixture of normal distributions.
    While NLP data is typically not well characterized by a normal distribution (see, e.g.
