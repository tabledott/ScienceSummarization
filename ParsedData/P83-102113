or our purposes.
    For example, given the program At this point, all further steps are blocked, so the computation terminates.
    Earley Deduction generalizes Earley parsing in a direct and natural way.
    Instantiation is analogous to the &amp;quot;predictor&amp;quot; operation of Earley's algorithm, while reduction corresponds to the &amp;quot;scanner&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;completer&amp;quot; operations.
    The &amp;quot;scanner&amp;quot; operation amounts to reduction with an input unit clause representing a terminal symbol occurrence, while the &amp;quot;completer&amp;quot; operation amounts to reduction with a derived unit clause representing a nonterminal symbol occurrence.
  
  
    Chart parsing (Kay, 1980) and other tabular parsing algorithms (Aho and Ullman, 1972; Graham et al., 1980) are usually presented in terms of certain (abstract) data structures that keep a record of the alternatives being explored by the parser.
    Looking at parsing procedures as proof procedures has the following a
