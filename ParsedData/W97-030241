arameter over a sequence of values.
    The results are in Figure 11.
    As can be seen, entropy is significantly smoother than precision and recall for both size test corpora.
    Our second goal was to check that the prior probability is indeed helpful.
    We ran two experiments, one with the prior and one without.
    Since the experiments without the prior were much worse than those with it, all other beam thresholding experiments included the prior.
    The results, shown in Figure 12, indicate that the prior is a critical component.
    This experiment was run on 200 sentences of test data.
    Notice that as the time increases, the data tends to approach an asymptote, as shown in the left hand graph of Figure 12.
    In order to make these small asymptotic changes more clear, we wished to expand the scale towards the asymptote.
    The right hand graph was plotted with this expanded scale, based on log(entropy &#8212; asymptote), a slight variation on a normal log scale.
    We use this scale in all
