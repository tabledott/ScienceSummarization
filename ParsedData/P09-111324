rds between the director and the film: Back Street is a 1932 film made by Universal Pictures, directed by John M. Stahl, and produced by Carl Laemmle Jr. Sentences like this have very long (and thus rare) lexical features, but relatively short dependency paths.
    Syntactic features can more easily abstract from the syntactic modifiers that comprise the extraneous parts of these strings.
    Our results thus suggest that syntactic features are indeed useful in distantly supervised information extraction, and that the benefit of syntax occurs in cases where the individual patterns are particularly ambiguous, and where they are nearby in the dependency structure but distant in terms of words.
    It remains for future work to see whether simpler, chunk-based syntactic features might be able to capture enough of this gain without the overhead of full parsing, and whether coreference resolution could improve performance.
