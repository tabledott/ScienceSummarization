tors, Palmer concludes that the learning technique works well.
    Hockenmaier and Brew investigate how performance is influenced by different rule templates and corpus size.
    They use three rule templates: simple bigram rules, trigram rules, and more elaborate rules.
    Their experiments indicate that training data size has the most significant influence on performance.
    Good performance can be acquired using simple rules only if the training corpus is large enough.
    Lee, Ng, and Lu (1999) have recently introduced a new segmentation method for a Chinese spell-checking application.
    Using a dictionary with single-character word occurrence frequencies, this scheme first divides text into sentences, then into phrases, and finally into words using a small number of word combinations that are conditioned on a heuristic to avoid delay during spell-checking.
    When compared with forward maximum matching, the new method resolves more than 10% more ambiguities, but enjoys no obvious speed advantage.
