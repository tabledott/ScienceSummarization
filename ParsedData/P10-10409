 2009), PCFG parsing (Candito &amp; Crabb&#180;e, 2009), dependency parsing (Koo et al., 2008; Suzuki et al., 2009), and semantic dependency parsing (Zhao et al., 2009).
    Martin et al. (1998) presents algorithms for inducing hierarchical clusterings based upon word bigram and trigram statistics.
    Ushioda (1996) presents an extension to the Brown clustering algorithm, and learn hierarchical clusterings of words as well as phrases, which they apply to POS tagging.
    Lin and Wu (2009) present a K-means-like non-hierarchical clustering algorithm for phrases, which uses MapReduce.
    HMMs can be used to induce a soft clustering, specifically a multinomial distribution over possible clusters (hidden states).
    Li and McCallum (2005) use an HMM-LDA model to improve POS tagging and Chinese Word Segmentation.
    Huang and Yates (2009) induce a fully-connected HMM, which emits a multinomial distribution over possible vocabulary words.
    They perform hard clustering using the Viterbi algorithm.
