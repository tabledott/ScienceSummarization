  Limitations of "Kimmo" systems The advent of two-level morphology (Koskenniemi [1], Karttunen [2], Antworth [3], Ritchie et al.
  [4]) has made it relatively easy to develop adequate morphological (or at least morphographical) descriptions for natural languages, clearly superior to earlier "cut-and-paste" approaches tomor- phology.
  Most of the existing "Kimmo" systems developed within this paradigm consist of ?
  linked lexicons stored as annotated letter trees ?
  morphological information on the leaf nodes of trees ?
  transducers that encode morphological alternations An analysis of an inflected word form is produced by mapping the input form to a sequence of lexical forms through the transducers and by composing some out- put from the annotations on the leaf nodes of the lexical paths that were traversed.
