tation of phonological constraints that supports efficient generation and recognition by a single simple interpreter.
  
  
    Ordered sets of context-sensitive rewriting rules have traditionally been used to describe the pronunciation changes that occur when sounds appear in different phonological and morphological contexts.
    Intuitively, these phenomena ought to be cognitively and computationally simpler than the variations and correspondences that appear in natural language syntax and semantics, yet the formal structure of such rules seems to require a complicated interpreter and an extraordinarily large number of processing steps.
    In this paper, we show that any such rule defines a regular relation on strings if its non-contextual part is not allowed to apply to its own output, and thus it can be modeled by a symmetric finite-state transducer.
    Furthermore, since regular relations are closed under serial composition, a finite set of rules applying to each other's output in an ordered sequence a
