nstraint in a grammar is better explained with an example.
    From the sentences The mouse squeaks.
    The cat likes fish.
    The cat chased the mouse. the grammar of Figure 8.1 can derive the following string, which violates the complex-NP constraint: * The mouse that the cat that chased likes fish squeaks.
    The derivation of this ungrammatical string can be better understood if we compare it with a sentence outside the fragment: The mouse, that the cat which chased it likes fish, squeaks. where the pronoun 'it' takes the place of the incorrect trace.
    The derivation graph for that un-English string is shown in Figure 9.1.
    In the graph, (*) and (**) mark two nested applications of the rule for `rel marker'.
    The string is un-English because the higher 'relative' (marked (+) in the graph) binds a trace occurring inside a sentence which is part of the subordinated 'noun phrase' (+ +).
    Now, using the bracketing constraint one can neatly express the complex-NP constraint.
    It is only neces
