unsupervised learning of gender information, there is a growing arsenal of learning techniques to be applied to statistical problems.
    Consider again the three high-salience words to which our unsupervised learning program assigned incorrect gender: &amp;quot;husband&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;wife&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;years.&amp;quot; We suspect that had our pronoun-assignment method been able to use the topic information used in the complete method, these might well have been decided correctly.
    That is, we suspect that &amp;quot;husband&amp;quot;, for example, was decided incorrectly because the topic of the article was the woman, there was a mention of her &amp;quot;husband,&amp;quot; but the article kept on talking about the woman and used the pronoun &amp;quot;she.&amp;quot; While our simple program got confused, a program using better statistics might not have.
    This too is a topic for future research.
