sification and employ an ensemble of Na?ve Bayesian Classifiers constructed with the EM Algorithm.
			We will use ?EM-NBC-Ensemble?
			to denote this method, hereafter.
			In the second method, we view the problem as that of calculating similarities between context vectors and use TF-IDF vectors also constructed with the EM Algorithm.
			We will use ?EM-TF-IDF?
			to denote this method.
			Experimental results indicate that our method is very effective, and the coverage and top 3 accuracy of translation at the final stage are 91.4% and 79.8%, respectively.
			The results are significantly better than those of the baseline methods relying on existing technologies.
			The higher performance of our method can be attributed to the enormity of the web data used and the employment of the EM Algorithm.
	
	
			2.1 Translation with Non-parallel.
			Corpora A straightforward approach to word or phrase translation is to perform the task by using parallel bilingual corpora (e.g., Brown et al 1993).
