y either do not occur or infrequently occur in the corpus or they occur in contexts that vary a great deal from other set elements.
    Figure 4 illustrates this behavior by plotting for each seed set size the rate of increase in discovery of new correct instances (i.e., not found in smaller seed set sizes).
    We see that most gold standard instances are discovered with the first 5-10 seeds.
    After the 30th seed is introduced, no new correct instances are found.
    An important finding is that the error rate does not increase with increased seed set size (see Figure 5).
    This study shows that only few seeds (10-20) yield best performance and that adding more seeds beyond this does not on average affect performance in a positive or negative way.
  
  
    We proposed a highly scalable term similarity algorithm, implemented in the MapReduce framework, and deployed over a 200 billion word crawl of the Web.
    The pairwise similarity between 500 million terms was computed in 50 hours using 200 quad-core
