  This node is a leaf and the attached tag probability vector (which is not shown in lib.
  3) is returned.
  The suffix lexicon was automatically built from the training corpus.
  First, a sujJiz tree wits constructed from the suffices of length 5 of sill words wliich were annotated with an open class l)art-of-speecli s. Then tag frequencies were cotlnted for all suffices and stored at the corresponding tree nodes.
  In the next step, an information measure I(S) was calculated for each node of the tree: I(S) = - ~ P(posiS ) tomd(p,&gt;,qS) (7) po* IIere, S is the suffix which corresponds to the current node and P(poslS ) is the probability of tag pos given a word with suff ix S. Using this information measure, the suffix tree has been pruned.
  For each leaf, the weighted information gain G(aS) was calculated: a(aS) = V(aS) (S(S) - S(&lt;,S)), (8) where S is the suffix of the parent node, aS is the suffix of the current node a
