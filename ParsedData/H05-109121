for each sentence, there is onlyone (shortest) path between any two entities in a de pendency tree.
			5.3 Experimental Results.
			A recent approach to extracting relations is described in (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).
			The au thors use a generalized version of the tree kernel from (Zelenko et al, 2003) to compute a kernel over 729 relation examples, where a relation example consists of the smallest dependency tree containing the two entities of the relation.
			Precision and recall values are reported for the task of extracting the 5 top-levelrelations in the ACE corpus under two different sce narios: ? [S1] This is the classic setting: one multi-classSVM is learned to discriminate among the 5 top level classes, plus one more class for the no-relation cases.?
			[S2] Because of the highly skewed data distribution, the recall of the SVM approach in the first sce nario is very low.
			In (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) the authors propose doing relation extraction in twosteps: first, one binary SVM is trained
