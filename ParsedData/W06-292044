ures, which are not yet routinely part of treebanking efforts.
    In this respect, it would be interesting to repeat experiments with the recently released new version of the TIGER treebank which now contains this information.
    One line of research that does not require additional annotation effort is defining or improving the mapping from coarse-grained to finegrained PoS tags.34 Another is harvesting and using large-scale distributional data from the internet.
    We also hope that by combining parsers we can achieve even better performance, which in turn would facilitate the semi-automatic enlargement of existing treebanks and possibly the detection of remaining errors.
    This would create a positive feedback loop.
    Finally one must not forget that almost all of the LEMMA, (C)POSTAG and FEATS values and even part of the FORM column (the multiword tokens used in many data sets and basically all tokenization for Chinese and Japanese, where words are normally not delimited by spaces) have been manual
