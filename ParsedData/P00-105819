ependent on the embedded verb as well as the relative pronoun.
    The smoothing method described above would have to be modified to account for multiple anchors.
    In summary, we have argued that TAG provides a cleaner way of looking at statistical parsing than lexicalized PCFG does, and demonstrated that in practice it performs in the same range.
    Moreover, the greater flexibility of TAG suggests some potential improvements which would be cumbersome to implement using a lexicalized CFG.
    Further research will show whether these advantages turn out to be significant in practice.
