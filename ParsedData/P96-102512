ech recognition (Jelinek 90), where there are trigram, bigram and unigram estimates.
    (Jelinek 90) describes a deleted interpolation method which combines these estimates to give a 'smooth' estimate, and the model uses a variation of this idea: (Jelinek 90) describes how to find A values in (15) and (16) which maximise the likelihood of held-out data.
    We have taken a simpler approach, namely: These A values have the desired property of increasing as the denominator of the more 'specific' estimator increases.
    We think that a proper implementation of deleted interpolation is likely to improve results, although basing estimates on co-occurrence counts alone has the advantage of reduced training times.
    The overall model would be simpler if we could do without the baseNP model and frame everything in terms of dependencies.
    However the baseNP model is needed for two reasons.
    First, while adjacency between words is a good indicator of whether there is some relationship between them, this indic
