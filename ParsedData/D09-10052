    Goodman (1999) describes many useful semirings (e.g., Viterbi, inside, and Viterbin-best).
    While most of these semirings are used in &#8220;testing&#8221; (i.e., decoding), we are mainly interested in the semirings that are useful for &#8220;training&#8221; (i.e., parameter estimation).
    The expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002), originally proposed for finite-state machines, is one such &#8220;training&#8221; semiring, and can be used to compute feature expectations for the Estep of the EM algorithm, or gradients of the likelihood function for gradient descent.
    In this paper, we apply the expectation semiring (Eisner, 2002) to a hypergraph (or packed forest) rather than just a lattice.
    We then propose a novel second-order expectation semiring, nicknamed the &#8220;variance semiring.&#8221; The original first-order expectation semiring allows us to efficiently compute a vector of firstorder statistics (expectations; first derivatives
