th a resource-rich language.
    This scenario is applicable to a large set of languages and has been considered by a number of authors in the past (Alshawi et al., 2000; Xi and Hwa, 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009).

    (2009) study related but different multilingual grammar and tagger induction tasks, where it is assumed that no labeled data at all is available.
    Our work is closest to that of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001), but differs in two important ways.
    First, we use a novel graph-based framework for projecting syntactic information across language boundaries.
    To this end, we construct a bilingual graph over word types to establish a connection between the two languages (&#167;3), and then use graph label propagation to project syntactic information from English to the foreign language (&#167;4).
    Second, we treat the projected labels as features in an unsupervised model (&#167;5), rather than using them directly for supervised training.
