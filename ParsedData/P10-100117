21; the modifier indices into grandparent indices, exploits the structural asymmetry.
    As a final note, the parsing algorithms described in this section fall into the category of projective dependency parsers, which forbid crossing dependencies.
    If crossing dependencies are allowed, it is possible to parse a first-order factorization by finding the maximum directed spanning tree (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967; McDonald et al., 2005b).
    Unfortunately, designing efficient higherorder non-projective parsers is likely to be challenging, based on recent hardness results (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; McDonald and Satta, 2007).
  
  
    We briefly outline a few extensions to our algorithms; we hope to explore these in future work.
    Many statistical modeling techniques are based on partition functions and marginals&#8212;summations over the set of possible trees y(x).
    Straightforward adaptations of the inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979) to our dynamic-programming structures would suffice to co
