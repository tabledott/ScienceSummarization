    In general, the rationale for the development of ILP formulations is to incorporate non-local features or global constraints, which are often difficult to handle with traditional algorithms.
    ILP formulations focus more on the modeling of problems, rather than algorithm design.
    While solving an ILP is NP-hard in general, fast solvers are available today that make it a practical solution for many NLP problems.
    This paper presents new, concise ILP formulations for projective and non-projective dependency parsing.
    We believe that our formulations can pave the way for efficient exploitation of global features and constraints in parsing applications, leading to more powerful models.
    Riedel and Clarke (2006) cast dependency parsing as
