ntities, including setting the current entity Zi,j to z.
    A similar equation holds for sampling a new entity.
    Note that, as discussed below, this full product can be truncated as an approximation.
    This model gives a 71.5 Fi on our development data.
    Table 1 shows the posterior distribution of the mention type given the salience feature.
    This model fixes many anaphora errors and in particular fixes the second anaphora error in figure 2(c).
    One advantage of a fully generative approach is that we can allow entities to be shared between documents in a principled way, giving us the capacity to do cross-document coreference.
    Moreover, sharing across documents pools information about the properties of an entity across documents.
    We can easily link entities across a corpus by assuming that the pool of entities is global, with global mixing weights Qo drawn from a DP prior with concentration parameter 'y.
    Each document uses the same global entities, but each has a documentspecific dis
