nd that all brackets introduced at the top are removed at the bottom.
    Thus the composite relation is regular and also belongs to the same-length subclass, so that the result of intersecting it with the same-length regular relations for other rules will be regular.
    A surface coercion rule of the form imposes a requirement on the paired substrings that come between all members of the A and p relations.
    If the lexical side of such a paired substring belongs to the domain of T, then the surface side must be such that the intervening pair belongs to T. To formalize this interpretation, we first describe the set of string pairs that fail to meet the conditions.
    The complement of this set is then the appropriate relation.
    The relationT.- = 71-* &#8212; T is the set of string pairs in 7r* that are not in T, because either their lexical string is not in the domain of T or 7- associates that lexical string with different surface strings.
    Id(Dom(T)) o f- is the subset of these whose lexical strin
