r&amp;quot;) whose arguments have been directly realized in previous utterances (e.g., a house) as occurs in the sequence, (19) a.
    The house appeared to have been burgled. b.
    The door was ajar. c. The furniture was in disarray.
    In this segment, the house referred to in (19a) is an element of the Cf(19a).
    This house is the Cb(19b); it is realized but not directly realized in (19b).
    Because the house is the Cb, the Cf (19b) includes it as well as the door that is directly realized in the utterance.
    The Cb(19c) is thus again &amp;quot;house.&amp;quot; We assume here that the door ranks above the house in Cf (19b).
    For example, if (19b) is followed by a sentence with 'it' in the subject position, then 'it' is more likely to refer to the door.'
    This is consistent with the ranking of the door ahead of the house in Cf (19b).
    However, continuity of the house as a potential Cb for (19c) is reflected in the discourse segment being interpreted to be &amp;quot;about&amp;quot; the house
