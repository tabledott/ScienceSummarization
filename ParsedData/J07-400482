    For words seen less than k times, an alternative based on the word&#8217;s POS tag is used: The tagger can only assign categories which have been seen with the POS tag in the data.
    We have found the tag dictionary to be beneficial in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.
    A value of k = 20 was used in the experiments described in this article.
    The lexical category set used by the supertagger is described in Clark and Curran (2004a) and Curran, Clark, and Vadas (2006).
    It includes all lexical catgeories which appear at least 10 times in Sections 02&#8211;21 of CCGbank, resulting in a set of 425 categories.
    The Clark and Curran paper shows this set to have very high coverage on unseen data.
    The accuracy of the supertagger on Section 00 of CCGbank is 92.6%, with a sentence accuracy of 36.8%.
    Sentence accuracy is the percentage of sentences whose words are all tagged correctly.
    These figures include punctuation marks, for which the lexical category is simply the punctuation ma
