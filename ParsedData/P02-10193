 using a log linear model.
    A requirement for our model is the availability of a letter-to-phone model that can generate pronunciations for misspellings.
    We build a letter-to-phone model automatically from a dictionary.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the Brill and Moore model and briefly describes how we use it to build our error models.
    Section 3 presents our letter-to-phone model, which is the result of a series of improvements on a previously proposed N-gram letter-tophone model (Fisher, 1999).
    Section 4 describes the training and test phases of our algorithm in more detail and reports on experiments comparing the new model to the Brill and Moore model.
    Section 6 contains conclusions and ideas for future work.
  
  
    Many statistical spelling correction methods can be viewed as instances of the noisy channel model.
    The misspelling of a word is viewed as the result of corruption of the intended word as it passes through a noisy communication
