 empty.
    So U(r) = {x} U u&#8222;.
    (If x does not occur in r, a similar argument shows that U(r) = u,.)
    Let r' = pull(r, false) and s = subst(x,t,a).
    By the induction hypothesis, U(r') = fx1 U ur.
    Since s does not include t (which binds x) but does include x, U(s) = 1x1 U u.
    In forming the quantified wff /3 = q(x, , s), the unbound variables in g consist of those in and those in s except for x, that is Vacuous quantified variables can be divided similarly into v. (those bound vacuously in r) and v, (those bound vacuously outside of t in a).
    Again, v = v, U v,.
    Trivially, V(r) = v&#8222;.
    By induction, V(I) = v, also.
    Since s does not include t, V(s) = v,.
    V(I3) = V(r) U V(s) = v unless the quantification of x in 13 is vacuous.
    Since x is guaranteed to occur in s (as it replaces t in s), the quantification is clearly not vacuous.
    So v(0) = v. apply-terms(a,b): This follows straightforwardly from the previous subproof for apply and the induction hypothesis for
