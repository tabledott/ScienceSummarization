ufficient to align topics between languages in non-comparable corpora.
    Additionally, PLTM can support the creation of bilingual lexica for low resource language pairs, providing candidate translations for more computationally intense alignment processes without the sentence-aligned translations typically used in such tasks.
    When applied to comparable document collections such as Wikipedia, PLTM supports data-driven analysis of differences and similarities across all languages for readers who understand any one language.
