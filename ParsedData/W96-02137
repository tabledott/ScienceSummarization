e many smoothing algorithms which use techniques more rigorous than a simple count cutoff, they have not yet been investigated in conjunction with this tagger.
  
  
    The test corpus is tagged one sentence at a time.
    The testing procedure requires a search to enumerate the candidate tag sequences for the sentence, and the tag sequence with the highest probability is chosen as the answer.
    The search algorithm, essentially a &amp;quot;beam search&amp;quot;, uses the conditional tag probability and maintains, as it sees a new word, the N highest probability tag sequence candidates up to that point in the sentence.
    Given a sentence {wl.
    &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; w,}, a tag sequence candidate {ti .
    &#8226; &#8226; tn} has conditional probability: In addition the search procedure optionally consults a Tag Dictionary, which, for each known word, lists the tags that it has appeared with in the training set.
    If the Tag Dictionary is in effect, the search procedure, for known words, generates o
