dorow (1998) and Wu &amp; Palmer (1994) are computed in the same way as for WordNet.
    Path search takes place as a depth-limited search of maximum depth of 4 for a least common subsumer.
    We noticed that limiting the search improves the results as it yields a better correlation of the relatedness scores with human judgements (Strube &amp; Ponzetto, 2006).
    This is due to the high regions of the Wikipedia category tree being too strongly connected.
    In addition, we use the measure from Resnik (1995), which is computed using an intrinsic information content measure relying on the hierarchical structure of the category tree (Seco et al., 2004).
    Given PREi/j and the lists of categories CREi/j they belong to, we factorise over all possible category pairs.
    That is, we take the cross product of each antecedent and anaphor category to form pairs of &#8216;Wikipedia synsets&#8217;.
    For each measure WIKI RELATEDNESS, we compute the relatedness score for all category pairs, and create the followi
