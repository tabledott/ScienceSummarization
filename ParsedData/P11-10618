ent similarity functions to define the edge weights among the foreign vertices and between vertices from different languages.
    Our monolingual similarity function (for connecting pairs of foreign trigram types) is the same as the one used by Subramanya et al. (2010).
    We briefly review it here for completeness.
    We define a symmetric similarity function K(uZ7 uj) over two foreign language vertices uZ7 uj E Vf based on the co-occurrence statistics of the nine feature concepts given in Table 1.
    Each feature concept is akin to a random variable and its occurrence in the text corresponds to a particular instantiation of that random variable.
    For each trigram type x2 x3 x4 in a sequence x1 x2 x3 x4 x5, we count how many times that trigram type co-occurs with the different instantiations of each concept, and compute the point-wise mutual information (PMI) between the two.5 The similarity between two trigram types is given by summing over the PMI values over feature instantiations that they have in
