 In the interests of testing consistency, Table 8 shows the results of assessing the adjective and verb features generated from opinion piece data (ADJpses and VERBpses in Table 7) on the subjective-element data.
    The left side of the table gives baseline figures for each set of subjective-element annotations.
    The right side of the table gives the average frequencies and increases in precision over baseline for the ADJpses and VERBpses sets on the subjective-element data.
    The baseline figures in the table are the frequencies and precisions of the sets of adjectives and verbs that appear at least once in a subjective element.
    Since these sets include words that appear just once in the corpus (and thus have 100% precision), the baseline precision is a challenging one.
    Testing the VERBpses and ADJpses on the subjective-element data reveals some interesting consistencies for these subjectivity clues.
    The precision increases of the VERBpses on the subjective-element data are comparable to th
