nsistent with the word alignment are used (Section 3.1).
    Note that phrase translation with a lexical weight is a special case of the alignment template model [Och et al., 1999] with one word class for each word.
    Our simplification has the advantage that the lexical weights can be factored into the phrase translation table beforehand, speeding up decoding.
    In contrast to the beam search decoder for the alignment template model, our decoder is able to search all possible phrase segmentations of the input sentence, instead of choosing one segmentation before decoding.
    Recall from Section 3.1 that we learn phrase pairs from word alignments generated by Giza++.
    The IBM Models that this toolkit implements only allow at most one English word to be aligned with a foreign word.
    We remedy this problem with a heuristic approach.
    First, we align a parallel corpus bidirectionally &#8211; foreign to English and English to foreign.
    This gives us two word alignments that we try to reconcile.
