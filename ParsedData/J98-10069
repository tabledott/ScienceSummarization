mong word senses.
    For each type of local-context evidence found in the corpus, a log-likelihood ratio is constructed, indicating the strength of the evidence for one form of the homograph versus the other.
    These ratios are then arranged in a sorted decision list with the largest values (strongest evidence) first.
    A decision is made for a test sentence by scanning down the decision list until a match is found.
    Thus, only the single best piece of evidence is used.
    The classifier was tested on disambiguating the homographs that result from accent removal in Spanish and French (e.g., seria, seria).
    In tests with the number of training examples ranging from a few hundred to several thousand, overall accuracy was high, above 90%.
    Clearly, sense identification is an active area of research, and considerable ingenuity is apparent.
    But despite the promising results reported in this literature, the reality is that there still are no large-scale, operational systems for tagging the senses
