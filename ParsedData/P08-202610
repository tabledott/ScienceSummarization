 attempted.
    Furthermore, the resulting parser is of interest in its own right, being as it is the most accurate biomedical parser yet developed.
    This parser is available on the web.4 Finally, there is no reason to believe that 84.3% is an upper bound on what can be achieved with current techniques.
    Lease and Charniak (2005) achieve their results using small amounts of hand-annotated biomedical part-ofspeech-tagged data and also explore other possible sources or information.
    It is reasonable to assume that its use would result in further improvement.
