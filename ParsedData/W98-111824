y guess that we tagged them less carefully than the rest of the data which was tagged by BBN and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).
    MENE has also been run against all-uppercase data.
    On this we achieved an F-measure of 88.19 for the MENE-only system and 91.38 for the MENE + Proteus system.
    The latter figure matches the best currently published result (Bikel et al., 1997) on within-domain all-caps data.
    On the other hand, we scored lower on all-caps than BBN's Identifinder in the MUC-7 formal evaluation for reasons which are probably similar to the ones discussed in section 9 in the comparison of our mixed case performances (Miller et al., 1998) (Borthwick et al., 1998).
    We have put very little effort into optimizing MENE on this type of corpus and believe that there is room for improvement here.
    In another experiment, we stripped out all features other than the lexical features and still achieved an F-measure of 88.13.
    Since these features do not rely on any ext
