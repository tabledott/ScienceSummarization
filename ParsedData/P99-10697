ructure is also used as a feature.
    We also use a number of features identifying syntactic structures that seem particularly important in these corpora, such as a feature identifying NPs that are dates (it seems that date interpretations of NPs are preferred).
    We would have liked to have included features concerning specific lexical items (to capture head-to-head dependencies), but we felt that our corpora were so small that the associated parameters could not be accurately estimated.
  
  
    Suppose = wi, , wr, is a training corpus of n syntactic analyses.
    Letting f3(c75) = f3 POI the log likelihood of the corpus CZ) and its derivatives are: where E0 (f') is the expected value of h under the distribution determined by the parameters 0.
    The maximum-likelihood estimates are the 0 which maximize log 14 (iv).
    The chief difficulty in finding the maximum-likelihood estimates is calculating E9 (f), which involves summing over the space of well-formed syntactic structures a There seems to be no
