to-interlingua divergence: one from the surface structure and one to the surface structure.
  (The terms language-to-language nd language-to-interlingua are taken from Dorr and Voss 1993a.)
  At first glance, it might seem odd to introduce the notion of a language-to-interlingua divergence for cases that do not exhibit a language-to-language divergence.
  However, it is clearly the case that language-to-language divergences--a special case of language-to-interlingua divergences--do exist regardless of the translation approach adopted.
  Thus, we can view divergences more generally as a consequence of the internal mapping between the surface structure and the interlingual representation rather than as an external distinction that shows up on the surface.
  The result is that the interlingua ppears to have been simplified to the extent hat it accommodates constructions in one language (without any special information) more readily than it accommodates the corresponding construction i another language.
