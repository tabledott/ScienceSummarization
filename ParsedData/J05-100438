re stored in a stand-off notation, referring to nodes within the Penn Treebank without actually replicating any of the lexical material or structure of that corpus.
  The process of annotation was a two-pass, blind procedure followed by an adjudication phase to resolve differences between the two initial passes.
  Both role labeling decisions and the choice of frameset were adjudicated.
  The annotators themselves were drawn from a variety of backgrounds, from undergraduates to holders of doctorates, including linguists, computer scientists, and others.
  Undergraduates have the advantage of being inexpensive but tend to work for only a few months each, so they require frequent training.
  Linguists make the best overall judgments although several of our nonlinguist annotators also had excellent skills.
  The learning curve for the annotation task tended to be very steep, with most annotators becoming comfortable with the process within three days of work.
  This contrasts favorably with syntactic annotation,
