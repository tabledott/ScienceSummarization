ned on one million words, only the first 82 transformations are needed.
    To see whether lexicalized transformations were contributing to the transformationbased tagger accuracy rate, we first trained the tagger using the nonlexical transformation template subset, then ran exactly the same test.
    Accuracy of that tagger was 97.0%.
    Adding lexicalized transformations resulted in a 6.7% decrease in the error rate (see table 1).16 We found it a bit surprising that the addition of lexicalized transformations did not result in a much greater improvement in performance.
    When transformations are allowed to make reference to words and word pairs, some relevant information is probably missed due to sparse data.
    We are currently exploring the possibility of incorporating word classes into the rule-based learner, in hopes of overcoming this problem.
    The idea is quite simple.
    Given any source of word class information, such as WordNet (Miller 1990), the learner is extended such that a rule is allo
