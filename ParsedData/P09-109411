 details of the corpora, methods, and score functions are presented in (Zhao et al., 2008a).
    In our experiments, PT-1 is the largest, which contains 3,041,822 pairs of paraphrase phrases.
    PT-2 and PT-3 contain 92,358, and 17,668 pairs of paraphrase phrases, respectively.
    Paraphrase patterns (PT-4): Paraphrase patterns are also extracted from Corp-1.
    We applied the approach proposed in (Zhao et al., 2008b).
    Its basic assumption is that if two English patterns e1 and e2 are aligned with the same foreign pattern f, then e1 and e2 are possible paraphrases.
    One can refer to (Zhao et al., 2008b) for the details.
    PT-4 contains 1,018,371 pairs of paraphrase patterns.
    Paraphrase collocations (PT-5): Collocations4 can cover long distance dependencies in sentences.
    Thus paraphrase collocations are useful for SPG.
    We extract collocations from a monolingual corpus and use a binary classifier to recognize if any two collocations are paraphrases.
    Due to the space limit, we cannot
