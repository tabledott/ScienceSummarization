  the constituent being predicted?
  If the immediate parent of a constituent has a different syntactic type from that of the constituent, hen the immediate parent is also the functional parent; otherwise, the functional parent is the functional parent of the immediate parent?
  The distinc- tion between functional parents and immediate parents arises primarily to cope with unit productions?
  When unit productions of the form XP2 ~ XP1 occur, the im- mediate parent of XP1 is XP2.
  But, in general, the con- stituent XP2 does not contain enough useful information for ambiguity resolution.
  In particular, when consider- ing only immediate parents, unit rules such as NP2 -+ NP1 prevent he probabilistic model from allowing the NP1 constituent to interact with the VP rule which is the functional parent of NP1.
  When the two parents are identical as it often hap- pens, the duplicate information will be ignored.
  How- ever, when they differ, the decision tree will select that parental context which best
