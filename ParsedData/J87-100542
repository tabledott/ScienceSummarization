    For the induction step for Theorem 1, we assume the induction hypotheses that the six conditions hold for all a such that p(a) &lt; n and prove the conditions for p(a) = n, for n&gt;0.
    The conditions are proved sequentially.
    In particular, earlier conditions for the case p(a) = n are used in the proofs of later ones.
    (Since there is no use of later conditions in earlier ones, this does not introduce any circularity in the proof.)
    Condition 1: We must show that pull-opaque-args(a) terminates with result (3 such that p(13) &lt; p(a).
    If a is not a wff, then the condition holds vacuously, so we assume that a = f(cei, ,a,).
    By definition of p, (The inequality is necessary because p(f3) may be zero.)
    Now /3, is either a, or pull(a,false).
    In the first case, p(1t) &lt; p(a,) trivially.
    In the second case, since a, is a subexpression of a, by Lemma 2 we have that p(a,) &lt; p(a) and we can use the induction hypothesis to show the termination of the call to pull.
