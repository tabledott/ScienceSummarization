 re- latedness.
  Given a measure of relatedness, how can we tell whether it is a good one or a poor one?
  Given two measures, how can we tell whether one is bet- ter than the other, and under what conditions it is better?
  And what is it that makes some measures better than others?
  Our purpose in this paper is to compare the performance of a number of measures of semantic relatedness that have been proposed for use in applications in natural language processing and information retrieval.
