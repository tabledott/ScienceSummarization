    The Good Grief decoding algorithm predicts a set of ranks &#8211; one for each aspect &#8211; which maximally satisfy the preferences of the individual rankers and the agreement model.
    For example, if the agreement model predicts consensus but the individual rankers select ranks (5, 5, 4), then the decoder decides whether to trust the the third ranker, or alter its prediction and output (5, 5, 5) to be consistent with the agreement prediction.
    To obtain a model well-suited for this decoding, we also develop a joint training method that conjoins the training of multiple aspect models.
    We demonstrate that the agreement-based joint model is more expressive than individual ranking models.
    That is, every training set that can be perfectly ranked by individual ranking models for each aspect can also be perfectly ranked with our joint model.
    In addition, we give a simple example of a training set which cannot be perfectly ranked witho
