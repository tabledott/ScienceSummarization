or the Chinese sentence) with node-to-node alignment relative to the two English trees.
    We will introduce such a loss function in the next section.
    We did not perform experiments involving this class of loss functions, but mention them for completeness in the hierarchy of loss functions.
    The third class of loss functions uses information from word strings, alignments and parse-trees in both languages, and can be described by .
    We will now describe one such loss function using the example in Figures 1 and 2.
    Figure 3 shows a treeto-tree mapping between the source (Chinese) parse-tree and parse-trees of its reference translation and two competing hypothesis (English) translations. the first two months of this year guangdong &#8217;s high&#8722;tech products 3.76 billion US dollars jin&#8722;nian qian liangyue guangdong gao xinjishu chanpin chukou sanqidianliuyi meiyuan the first two months of this year guangdong exported high&#8722;tech products 3.76 billion US dollars We first assume that a
