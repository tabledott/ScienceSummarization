ver words i and j now that such evidence has been revealed to concern only the specific senses k and l.
  
  
    We demonstrate the ability of our model to use evidence from multiple relations to extend WordNet with novel noun hyponyms.
    While in principle we could use any number of relations, for simplicity we consider two primary sources of evidence: the probability of two words in WordNet being in a hypernym relation, and the probability of two words in WordNet being in a coordinate relation.
    In sections 3.1 and 3.2 we describe the construction of our hypernym and coordinate classifiers, respectively; in section 3.3 we outline the efficient algorithm we use to perform local search over hyponym-extended WordNets; and in section 3.4 we give an example of the implicit structure-based word sense disambiguation performed within our framework.
    Our classifier for the hypernym relation is derived from the &#8220;hypernym-only&#8221; classifier described in (Snow et al., 2005).
