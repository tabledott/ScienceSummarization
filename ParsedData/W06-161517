    Applying this projection to a word gives a real value on the horizontal dashed line axis.
    The words below the horizontal axis occur only in the WSJ.
    The words above the axis occur only in MEDLINE.
    The verticle line in the middle represents the value zero.
    Ticks to the left or right indicate relative positive or negative values for a word under this projection.
    This projection discriminates between nouns (negative) and adjectives (positive).
    A tagger which gives high positive weight to the features induced by applying this projection will be able to discriminate among the associated classes of biomedical words, even when it has never observed the words explicitly in the WSJ source training set.
  
  
    All the results we present in this section use the MIRA tagger from Section 5.3.
    The ASO and structural correspondence results also use projection features learned using ASO and SCL.
    Section 7.1 presents results comparing structural correspondence learning with the supervis
