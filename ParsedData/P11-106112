 bilingual graph described in the previous section, we can use label propagation to project the English POS labels to the foreign language.
    We use label propagation in two stages to generate soft labels on all the vertices in the graph.
    In the first stage, we run a single step of label propagation, which transfers the label distributions from the English vertices to the connected foreign language vertices (say, Vf&#65533;) at the periphery of the graph.
    Note that because we extracted only high-confidence alignments, many foreign vertices will not be connected to any English vertices.
    This stage of label propagation results in a tag distribution ri over labels y, which encodes the proportion of times the middle word of ui E Vf aligns to English words vy tagged with label y: The second stage consists of running traditional label propagation to propagate labels from these peripheral vertices Vf&#65533; to all foreign language vertices in the graph, optimizing the following objective: 5 POS Induct
