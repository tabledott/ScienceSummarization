ble Chinese sentiment corpora.
    The challenge before us is how to leverage rich English corpora for Chinese sentiment classification.
    In this study, we focus on the problem of cross-lingual sentiment classification, which leverages only English training data for supervised sentiment classification of Chinese product reviews, without using any Chinese resources.
    Note that the above problem is not only defined for Chinese sentiment classification, but also for various sentiment analysis tasks in other different languages.
    Though pilot studies have been performed to make use of English corpora for subjectivity classification in other languages (Mihalcea et al., 2007; Banea et al., 2008), the methods are very straightforward by directly employing an inductive classifier (e.g.
    SVM, NB), and the classification performance is far from satisfactory because of the language gap between the original language and the translated language.
    In this study, we propose a co-training approach to improving
