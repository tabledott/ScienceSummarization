s no w' E G\W such that (v, H) refers to (w', G).
    Observe that the singular case defined in Section 4 is obtained by restricting W to singleton sets.
    In this way, the basic algorithm can generate both singular and plural distinguishing descriptions.
    5.3.2 Context and Salience.
    An object that has been mentioned in recent context is linguistically salient and hence can often be referred to using fewer properties; an animal that is first described as &#8220;the large black dog with the hanging ears&#8221; may subsequently be referred to using an anaphoric description such as &#8220;the dog.&#8221; Krahmer and Theune (2002) model this phenomenon by assigning salience weights (sws) to objects.
    For this purpose they use a version of centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) augmented with a recency effect essentially due to Haji&#728;cov&#180;a (1993).
    Krahmer and Theune then define the set of distractors as the set of objects with a salience weight higher than or equal to that of
