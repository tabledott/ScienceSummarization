  This is a precishm inetrie that assesses feature quality: if inslances of &lt;"7 appear, how likely is the son- tence to be subjective?
  The last two colunuls contrast the observed conditional probability with the a priori prob- ability of subjective sentellees (i.e., chalice; sixth col- ulnn) and with the probability assigned by the baseline all-adjectives model (i.e., the lirst row in the table; sev- enth colunm).
  The nlost striking aspect of these results is lhat all sets involviug dynamic adiectives positive or negative po- larity, or gradability are better predictors of sul~jective sentenccs than the class of adjectives as a whole, lqve of the sets are at least 25 points better (LI4, LI6, L21, L23, and L24); four others are at least 20 points better (L2, L9, L13, and 1,15); and live others are at least 15
