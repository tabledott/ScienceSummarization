, we have been more interested in the second use: establishing a group of examples for which we had an approximate ground truth.
  Rather than tag- ging each instance of a polysemous word one-by-one, we can select discourses with large numbers of the polyse- mous word of interest and tag all of the instances in one fell swoop.
  Admittedly, this procedure will introduce a small error rate since the one-sense-per-discourse ten- dency is not quite perfect, but thus far, the error rate has not been much of a problem.
  This procedure has enabled us to tag a much larger test set than we would have been able to do otherwise.
  Having tagged as many words as we have (all instances of 97 words in the Groliers Encyclopedia), we are now in a position to question some widely held assumptions about the distribution of polysemy.
  In particular, it is commonly believed that most words are highly polyse- mous, but in fact, most words (both by token and by type) have only one sense, as indicated in Table 5 below.
  Even fo
