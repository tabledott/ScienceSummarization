ing observed the given context, it is possible to deduce that the observed POS tag is the only possible tag in this context.
			These considerations motivate an HMM tagging approach which decomposes the POS tags into a set of simple attributes, and uses decision trees toestimate the probability of each attribute.
			Decision trees are ideal for this task because the iden tification of relevant attribute combinations is at the heart of this method.
			The backoff smoothing methods of traditional n-gram POS taggers require an ordering of the reduced contexts which is not available, here.
			Discriminatively trained taggers, on the other hand, have difficulties to handle the huge number of features which are active at the same time if any possible combination of context attributes defines a separate feature.
	
	
			Decision trees (Breiman et al, 1984; Quinlan,1993) are normally used as classifiers, i.e. they assign classes to objects which are represented as at tribute vectors.
			The non-terminal nodes are labe
