  The most frequent open-class tags of this tag set are shown in Table 1.
    Word-frequency distribution was estimated from the Brown Corpus, which reflects multidomain language use.
    As usual, we separated the test sample from the training sample.
    Here we followed the suggestion that the unknown words actually are quite similar to words that occur only once (hapax words) in the corpus (Dermatas and Kokkinakis 1995; Baayen and Sproat 1995).
    We put all the hapax words from the Brown Corpus that were found in the cELEx-derived lexicon into the test collection (test lexicon) and all other words from the cELEx-derived lexicon into the training lexicon.
    In the test lexicon, we also included the hapax words not found in the cELEx-derived lexicon, assigning them the POS-tags they had in the Brown Corpus.
    Then we filtered out words shorter than four characters, nonwords such as numbers or alpha-numerals, which usually are handled at the tokenization phase, and all closed-class words,' which we ass
