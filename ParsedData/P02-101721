 replace tagged input with lexical input.
    However, we address here the more serious criticism: that our results stem from clues latent in the treebank tagging information which are conceptually posterior to knowledge of structure.
    For instance, some treebank tag distinctions, such as particle (RP) vs. preposition (IN) or predeterminer (PDT) vs. determiner (DT) or adjective (JJ), could be said to import into the tagset distinctions that can only be made syntactically.
    To show results from a complete grammar induction system, we also did experiments starting with a clustering of the words in the treebank.
    We used basically the baseline method of word type clustering in (Sch&#168;utze, 1995) (which is close to the methods of (Finch, 1993)).
    For (all-lowercased) word types in the Penn treebank, a 1000 element vector was made by counting how often each co-occurred with each of the 500 most common words immediately to the left or right in Treebank text and additional 1994&#8211;96 WSJ newswire.
