d types characterized by monolingual feature vectors, such as context counts, orthographic substrings, and so on (section 5).
    We define a generative model over (1) a source lexicon, (2) a target lexicon, and (3) a matching between them (section 2).
    Our model is based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA)1 and explains matched word pairs via vectors in a common latent space.
    Inference in the model is done using an EM-style algorithm (section 3).
    Somewhat surprisingly, we show that it is possible to learn or extend a translation lexicon using monolingual corpora alone, in a variety of languages and using a variety of corpora, even in the absence of orthographic features.
    As might be expected, the task is harder when no seed lexicon is provided, when the languages are strongly divergent, or when the monolingual corpora are from different domains.
    Nonetheless, even in the more difficult cases, a sizable set of high-precision translations can be extracted.
    As an example of the perform
