17;s preference for lexicalized rules over un-lexicalized rules and 2) the average tree depth in a rule to balance the usage of hierarchical rules and flat rules.
    Note that we do not distinguish between larger (taller) and shorter source side tree sequences, i.e. we let these rules compete directly with each other.
  
  
    Rules are extracted from word-aligned, bi-parsed sentence pairs &lt; T (fJ ), T (e; ), A &gt; , which are classified into two categories: 2) Extracting abstract rules from extracted initial rules with the help of sub initial rules.
    It is straightforward to extract initial rules.
    We first generate all fully lexicalized source and target tree sequences using a dynamic programming algorithm and then iterate over all generated source and target tree sequence pairs &lt; TS f j TS e i &gt; .
    If leaf nodes of TS(f jj2 ) and TS(e1) .
    We then derive abstract rules from initial rules by removing one or more of its sub initial rules.
    The abstract rule extraction algorithm pre
