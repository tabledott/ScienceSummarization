in machine translation in the case of the very closely related languages (Czech/Slovak).
    Covington (1998) uses an algorithm based on heuristic orthographic changes to find cognate words for purposes of historical comparison.
    Perhaps the most comprehensive study of word alignment via string transduction methods was pioneered by Knight and Graehl (1998).
    While restricted to single language transliteration, it very effectively used intermediary phonological models to bridge direct lexical borrowing across distant languages.
    8 Conclusion The experiments reported in this paper extend prior research in a number of directions.
    The novel probabilistic paradigm for inducing translation lexicons for words from unaligned word lists is introduced.
    The set of languages on which we demonstrate these methods is broader than previously examined.
    Finally, the use of multiple bridge languages and of the high degree of intra-family language similarity for dictionary induction is new.
