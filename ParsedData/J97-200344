    We have: Vw E A, 62(i2,w) = {(q0, c(qo,w)), &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , (qm, c(q,n,w))1 .
    Since A is infinite, and since in each weighted subset there exists a null residual output, there exist io, 0 &lt; io &lt;m, such that c(q,,&#8222;w) = 0 for an infinite number of strings w E A.
    Without loss of generality we can assume that io =- 0.
    Let B C A be the infinite set of strings w for which c(q0,w) = 0.
    Since the number of subsets {(go, c(go, w)), &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; (qm, c(gm, w))}, w E B, is infinite, there exists], 0 &lt;j &lt; m, such that c(qj,w) be distinct for an infinite number of strings w E B.
    Without loss of generality we can assume j = 1.
    Let C C B be an infinite set of strings w with c(qi,w) all distinct.
    Define R(qo, qi) to be the finite set of differences of the weights of paths leading to go and gi labeled with the same string w, &lt; IwIIQiI2-1: We will show that {c(gi, w): w E C} C R(q0, qi).
    This will yield a contra
