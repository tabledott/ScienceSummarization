0 and y = 0.5, based on experimentation performed in early 2004.
    In the latest release, we tuned these parameters to optimize correlation with human judgments based on more extensive experimentation, as reported in section 4.
  
  
    We have recently expanded the implementation of METEOR to support evaluation of translations in Spanish, French and German, in addition to English.
    Two main language-specific issues required adaptation within the metric: (1) language-specific wordmatching modules; and (2) language-specific parameter tuning.
    The word-matching component within the English version of METEOR uses stemming and synonymy modules in constructing a word-to-word alignment between translation and reference.
    The resources used for stemming and synonymy detection for English are the Porter Stemmer (Porter, 2001) and English WordNet (Miller and Fellbaum, 2007).
    In order to construct instances of METEOR for Spanish, French and German, we created new languagespecific &#8220;stemming&#8221;
