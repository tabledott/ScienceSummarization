    For the feat+tfidf system, accuracy at the twoclass disambiguation was above 80% for 25 out of the 28 pairs.
    Without these pairs, the average twoclass disambiguation performance over the remaining pairs is 90%.
    In two of the problematic cases, the contexts of the names are easily confusable, as the individuals share the same profession and many of the same keywords.
    More complete biographic profiles and different clustering biases would be helpful in fully partitioning these cases.
    However, in practice these pseudoname pair situations may be more difficult than expected for naturally occurring name pairs.
    In many occupations that are typically newsworthy (such as actors, authors, musicians, politicians, etc.
    ), there may be a tendency for individuals to avoid using identical names (or entering the field entirely) to minimize confusion.
    When people with identical names do indeed share the same field one would expect a greater effort to providing disambiguating contextual fe
