e expressing the semantic roles: examples include noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), and clause (S).
    Phrase types were derived automatically from parse trees generated by the parser, as shown in Figure 1.
    The parse constituent spanning each set of words annotated as an argument was found, and the constituent's nonterminal label was taken as the phrase type.
    As an example of how this feature is useful, in communication frames, the SpEAKER is likely to appear as a noun phrase, Topic as a prepositional phrase or noun phrase, and MEDiUM as a prepositional phrase, as in: &amp;quot;We talked about the proposal over the phone.&amp;quot; When no parse constituent was found with boundaries matching those of an argument during testing, the largest constituent beginning at the argument's left boundary and lying entirely within the element was used to calculate the features.
    Parse Tree Path: This feature is designed to capture the syntactic relation of a constituent to the predicate.
