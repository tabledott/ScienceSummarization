  One makes tile latter test, by seeing if tile as- sumption that the ratios for the two techniques are the same (the null hypothesis) leads to a sta- tistically significant result when using a X 2 dis- tribution with one degree of freedom.
  A 2 x 2 ta- ble has 4 cells.
  The top 2 cells are filled with the R and S of one technique and the bottom 2 cells get the R and S of the other technique.
  In this test, the valuc in each cell is assumed to have a Poisson distribution.
  When the cell values are not too small, these Poisson distributions are approximately Normal (Gaussiml).
  As a result, when the cell values are independent, smnming tlle normalized squares of the difference between each cell and its expected value leads to a X 2 distribution (Box el; al., 1978, Sec.
  How well does this test work in our experi- ments?
  Precision is a non-linear time(ion of two random wuiables R and S, so we did not try to estimate the correlation coefficient ]or precision.
  However, we can easily estimate the co
