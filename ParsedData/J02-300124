 23 in the Appendix provides a listing of Penn Treebank&#8217;s part-of-speech tags and constituent labels.)
    We used Collins&#8217; (1997) statistical parser trained on examples from the Penn Treebank to generate parses of the same format for the sentences in our data.
    Phrase types were derived automatically from parse trees generated by the parser, as shown in Figure 2.
    Given the automatically generated parse tree, the constituent spanning the same set of words as each annotated frame element was found, and the constituent&#8217;s nonterminal label was taken as the phrase type.
    In cases in which more than one constituent matches because of a unary production in the parse tree, the higher constituent was chosen.
    A sample sentence with parser output (above) and FrameNet annotation (below).
    Parse constituents corresponding to frame elements are highlighted.
    The matching was performed by calculating the starting and ending word positions for each constituent in the parse tree, as well
