etter: v. The i-th element of a vector v is indicated by vi.
    Matrices are secondorder tensors, and are indicated with bold capital letters: A.
    The entry (i, j) in the i-th row and j-th column of a matrix A is denoted by aij.
    An array with three indices is a thirdorder (or three-way) tensor.
    The element (i, j, k) of a third-order tensor X is denoted by xijk.
    A convenient way to display third-order tensors is via nested tables such as Table 2, where the first index is in the header column, the second index in the first header row, and the third index in the second header row.
    The entry x321 of the tensor in the table is 7.0 and the entry x112 is 85.3.
    An index has dimensionality I if it ranges over the integers from 1 to I.
    The dimensionality of a third-order tensor is the product of the dimensionalities of its indices I x J x K. For example, the third-order tensor in Table 2 has dimensionality 3 x 2 x 3.
    If we fix the integer i as the value of the first index of a matrix A a
