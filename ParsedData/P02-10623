another contribution is to show that a new algorithm, the voted perceptron, gives very credible results on a natural language task.
    It is an extremely simple algorithm to implement, and is very fast to train (the testing phase is slower, but by no means sluggish).
    It should be a viable alternative to methods such as the boosting or Markov Random Field algorithms described in previous work.
  
  
    Over a period of a year or so we have had over one million words of named-entity data annotated.
    The data is drawn from web pages, the aim being to support a question-answering system over web data.
    A number of categories are annotated: the usual people, organization and location categories, as well as less frequent categories such as brand-names, scientific terms, event titles (such as concerts) and so on.
    From this data we created a training set of 53,609 sentences (1,047,491 words), and a test set of 14,717 sentences (291,898 words).
    The task we consider is to recover named-entity bounda
