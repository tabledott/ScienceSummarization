SJ-all, which is the complete Section 23 (the de facto standard test set for English parsing), and WSJ-small, which is the first 400 sentences of Section 23 and which is roughly comparable in size to the Chinese test set.
    Furthermore, when testing on WSJ-small, we trained on a subset of our English training data roughly equivalent in size to our Chinese training set (Sections 02 and 03 of the Penn Treebank); we have indicated models trained on all English training with &amp;quot;-all&amp;quot;, and models trained with the reduced English training set with &amp;quot;-small&amp;quot;.
    Therefore, by comparing the WSJ-small results with the Chinese results, one can reasonably gauge the performance gap between English parsing on the Penn Treebank and Chinese parsing on the Chinese Treebank.
    The reader will note that the modified BBN model does significantly poorer than (Chiang, 2000) on Chinese.
    While more investigation is required, we suspect part of the difference may be due to the fact that curr
