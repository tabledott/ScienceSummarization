    Test and training materials were derived from the Brown corpus of American English, all of which has been parsed and manually verified by the Penn Treebank project (Marcus et al., 1993) and parts of which have been manually sense-tagged by the WordNet group (Miller et al., 1993).
    A parsed, sense-tagged corpus was obtained by merging the WordNet sense-tagged corpus (approximately 200,000 words of source text from the Brown corpus, distributed across genres) with the corresponding Penn Treebank parses.3 The rest of the Brown corpus (approximately 800,000 words of source text) remained as a parsed, but not sensetagged, training set.
    The test set for the verb-object relationship was constructed by first training a selectional preference model on the training corpus, using the Treebank's tgrep utility to extract verb-object pairs from parse trees.
