e quality of alignments plays an important role.
    If we compare the three kinds of alignments available for the Hansard corpus, we see that much more complex transformation rules are extracted from noisy GIZA++ alignments.
    It also appears that the language difference produces quite contrasting results.
    Rules acquired for the English-Chinese pair have, on average, many more nodes.
    Note that the language difference in terms of syntax might be wider than what the plot seems to indicate, since word alignments computed for the Hansard corpus are likely to be more errorful than the ones for FBIS because the training data used to induce the latter is more than ten times larger than for the former.
    In Figure 10, we show the explanatory power of our model at the node level.
    At each node of the frontier set, we determine whether it is possible to extract a rule that doesn&#8217;t exceed a given limit k on its size.
    The plotted values represent the percentage of frontier set internal nodes tha
