 (al, an).
    In 1991, two teams of researchers independently discovered that sentences from bitexts involving clean translations can be aligned with high accuracy just by matching sentence sequences with similar lengths (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991a).
    Both teams approached the alignment problem via maximum-likelihood estimation, but using different models.
    Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) formulated the problem as a hidden Markov model (HMM), based on a two-stage generative process.
    Stage one generated some number of aligned segment pairs; stage two decided how many segments from each half of the bitext to put in each aligned segment pair.
    Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) took advantage of various lexical &amp;quot;anchors&amp;quot; in the bitext that they were experimenting with.
    These anchors were also generated by the HMM, according to their respective probability functions.
    All the hidden variables were estimated using the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin
