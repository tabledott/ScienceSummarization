ecognition word error rate of 31% the degradation of about 20% by speech input can be expected.
    The average translation time on an Alpha workstation for a single sentence is about one second for the alignment template appreach and 30 seconds for the single-word based search procedure.
    Within the Verbmobil project other translation modules based on rule-based, examplebased and dialogue-act-based translation are used.
    We are not able to present results with these methods using our test corpus.
    But in the current Verbmobil prototype the preliminary evaluations show that the statistical methods produce comparable or better results than other systems.
    An advantage of the systhat it is robust and always produces a translation result even if the input of the speech recognizer is quite incorrect.
    5 Summary We have described two approaches to perform statistical machine translation which extend the baseline alignment models.
    The single-word 27 based approach allows for the the possibility o
