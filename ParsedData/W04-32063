mplexity of required auxiliary inputs, thus enabling to apply the methods at larger scales, and generalizing the types of structures that can be acquired.
    The algorithms described in this paper were applied for acquiring entailment relations for verb-based expressions.
    They successfully discovered several relations on average per each randomly selected expression.
  
  
    This section provides a qualitative view of prior work, emphasizing the perspective of aiming at a full-scale paraphrase resource.
    As there are still no standard benchmarks, current quantitative results are not comparable in a consistent way.
    The major idea in paraphrase acquisition is often to find linguistic structures, here termed templates, that share the same anchors.
    Anchors are lexical elements describing the context of a sentence.
    Templates that are extracted from different sentences and connect the same anchors in these sentences, are assumed to paraphrase each other.
    For example, the sentences &#8220;Y
