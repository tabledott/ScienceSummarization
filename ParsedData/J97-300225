v both derive from the node q. Denote the nonterminal label on q by f(q).
    Then for any node q = (s, t, u, v), define as the maximum probability of any derivation from i that successfully parses both es t and cu v. Then the best parse of the sentence pair has probability 60,T,o,v(S).
    The algorithm computes 60,T,o,v(S) using the following recurrences.
    Note that we generalize argmax to the case where maximization ranges over multiple indices, by making it vector-valued.
    Also note that [] and 0 are simply constants, written mnemonically.
    The condition (S - s)(t - S) + (U - u)(v - U) 0 is a way to specify that the substring in one, but not both, languages may be split into an empty string f and the substring itself; this ensures tha t the recursion terminates, but permits words that have no match in the other language to map to an &#8364; instead.
  
  
    Initialize by setting the root of the parse tree to qi = (0, T, 0, V) and its nonterminal label to t(qi) = S. The remaining descendants in
