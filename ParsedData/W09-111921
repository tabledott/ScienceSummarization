    To further improve the coverage, we have extracted 16 gazetteers from Wikipedia, which collectively contain over 1.5M entities.
    Overall, we have 30 gazetteers (available for download with the system), and matches against each one are weighted as a separate feature in the system (this allows us to trust each gazetteer to a different degree).
    We also note that we have developed a technique for injecting non-exact string matching to gazetteers, which has marginally improved the performance, but is not covered in the paper due to space limitations.
    In the rest of this section, we discuss the construction of gazetteers from Wikipedia.
    Wikipedia is an open, collaborative encyclopedia with several attractive properties.
    (1) It is kept updated manually by it collaborators, hence new entities are constantly added to it.
    (2) Wikipedia contains redirection pages, mapping several variations of spelling of the same name to one canonical entry.
    For example, Suker is redirected t
