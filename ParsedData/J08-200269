wever, according to this method (due to the argmax operation) we are choosing a single parse and a complete semantic frame derived from that parse.
    Other methods are able to derive different arguments of the semantic frame from different syntactic annotations which may make them more robust (M`arquez et al. 2005; Pradhan, Ward et al.
    2005; Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih 2005).
    Figure 16 shows summary results for the test set when using the top ten parses and the joint model.
    The weighting parameter for the parser probabilities was R = 1.
    We did not experiment extensively with different values of R. Preliminary experiments showed that considering 15 parses was a bit better, and considering the top 20 was a bit worse.
    The CoNLL 2005 data is derived from Propbank version I, which is the first official release in 2005, whereas the results we have been reporting in the previous sections used the pre-final February 2004 data.
    Using the CoNLL 2005 evaluation standard ensures that results obtai
