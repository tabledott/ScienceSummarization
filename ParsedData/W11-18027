 and Positive regulation events are not as frequent as in other sections, Negative regulation is relatively much more frequent.
    It may agree with an intuition that experimental devices, which will be explained in Methods sections, often consists of artificial processes that are designed to cause a negative regulatory effect, e.g. mutation, addition of inhibitor proteins, etc.
    This observation suggests a different event annotation scheme, or a different event extraction strategy would be required for Methods sections.
  
  
    In total, 15 teams submitted final results.
    All 15 teams participated in the mandatory Task 1, four teams in Task 2, and two teams in Task 3.
    Only one team, UTurku, completed all the three tasks.
    Table 4 shows the profile of the teams, excepting three who chose to remain anonymous.
    A brief examination on the team organization (the People column) suggests the importance of a computer science background, C and BI, to perform the GE task, which agrees with the same
