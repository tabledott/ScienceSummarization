 sentences.3 A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed pair of sentences, based on the ratio of lengths of the two sentences (in characters) and the variance of this ratio.
    This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework in order to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.
    The fol3 We will have little to say about how sentence boundaries are identified.
    Identifying sentence boundaries is not always as easy as it might appear for reasons described in Liberman and Church (in press).
    It would be much easier if periods were always used to mark sentence boundaries; but unfortunately, many periods have other purposes.
    In the Brown Corpus, for example, only 90% of the periods are used to mark sentence boundaries; the remaining 10% appear in numerical expressions, abbreviations, and so forth.
    In the Wall Street Journal, there is even more discussion of dollar amounts and percentages, as well as more use of abbreviated titles such as Mr.; consequently, on
