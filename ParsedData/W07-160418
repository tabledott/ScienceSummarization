.
    Then, if there is no determiner in the phrase, the target word is deemed an extraneous preposition error.
    Repeated Prepositions These are cases such as people can find friends with with the same interests where a preposition occurs twice in a row.
    Repeated prepositions were easily screened by checking if the same lexical item and POS tag were used for both words.
    These filters address two types of extraneous preposition errors, but there are many other types (for example, subcategorization errors, or errors with prepositions inserted incorrectly in the beginning of a sentence initial phrase).
    Even though these filters cover just one quarter of the 142 extraneous errors, they did improve precision from 0.778 to 0.796, and recall from 0.259 to 0.304 (comparing to Rater 1).
  
  
    We have presented a combined machine learning and rule-based approach that detects preposition errors in ESL essays with precision of 0.80 or higher (0.796 with the ME classifier and Extraneous Preposition filt
