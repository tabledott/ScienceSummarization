itterSA(cleaning), and other classifiertrained from the original data, TwitterSA(no cleaning).
			For the polarity detection task, we built a few classifiers to compare theirperformances: TwitterSA(single) and Twit terSA(weights) are two classifiers we trained using combined data from the 3 sources.
			The only difference is TwitterSA(weights) uses the modification of weighting the priorpolarity of the words based on the training data.
			TwitterSA(voting) and TwitterSA(maxconf) combine classification out puts from 3 classifiers respectively trained from each source.
			TwitterSA(voting) usesmajority voting to combine them and TwitterSA(maxconf) picks the one with maxi mum confidence score.We use Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005) to create the classifiers.
			We tried different learning al gorithms available on Weka and SVM obtainedthe best results for Unigrams and TwitterSA.
			Experimental results reported in this section are ob tained using SVM.
