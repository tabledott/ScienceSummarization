  Log-Linear Models For Word Alignment
  
    We present a framework for word alignment based on log-linear models.
    All knowledge sources are treated as feature functions, which depend on the source langauge sentence, the target language sentence and possible additional variables.
    Log-linear models allow statistical alignment models to be easily extended by incorporating syntactic information.
    In this paper, we use IBM Model 3 alignment probabilities, POS correspondence, and bilingual dictionary coverage as features.
    Our experiments show that log-linear models significantly outperform IBM translation models.
  
  
    Word alignment, which can be defined as an object for indicating the corresponding words in a parallel text, was first introduced as an intermediate result of statistical translation models (Brown et al., 1993).
    In statistical machine translation, word alignment plays a crucial role as word-aligned corpora have been found to be an excellent source of translation-related know
