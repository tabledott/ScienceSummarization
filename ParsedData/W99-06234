 reason, na&#239;ve Bayes classifiers are well-matched to this problem.
    In Equations 1 through 3 we develop the model for constructing our parse using na&#239;ve Bayes classification.
    C is the union of the sets of constituents suggested by the parsers. r(c) is a binary function returning t (for true) precisely when the constituent c E C should be included in the hypothesis.
    Mi(c) is a binary function returning t when parser i (from among the k parsers) suggests constituent c should be in the parse.
    The hypothesized parse is then the set of constituents that are likely (P &gt; 0.5) to be in the parse according to this model.
    The estimation of the probabilities in the model is carried out as shown in Equation 4.
    Here NO counts the number of hypothesized constituents in the development set that match the binary predicate specified as an argument.
    Under certain conditions the constituent voting and na&#239;ve Bayes constituent combination techniques are guaranteed to produce sets of co
