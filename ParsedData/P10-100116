 of grandparent-index augmentation has proven fruitful, as it allows us to parse expressive third-order factorizations while retaining an efficient O(n4) runtime.
    In fact, our thirdorder parsing algorithms are &#8220;optimally&#8221; efficient in an asymptotic sense.
    Since each third-order part is composed of four separate indices, there are 0(n4) distinct parts.
    Any third-order parsing algorithm must at least consider the score of each part, hence third-order parsing is Q(n4) and it follows that the asymptotic complexity of Models 1 and 2 cannot be improved.
    The key to the efficiency of our approach is a fundamental asymmetry in the structure of a directed tree: a head can have any number of modifiers, while a modifier always has exactly one head.
    Factorizations like that of Carreras (2007) obtain grandchild parts by augmenting spans with the indices of modifiers, leading to limitations on the grandchildren that can participate in the factorization.
