to the phrase-based SMT framework.
			Furthermore, rather than using a single word based WSD approach to augment a phrase-based SMT model as we did in Carpuat et al (2006) to improve BLEU and NISTscores, here the WSD training and predictions operate on full multi-word phrasal units, resulting in significantly more reliable and consistent gains as eva luted by many other translation accuracy metrics as well.
			Specifically: ? Instead of using a Senseval system, we redefinethe WSD task to be exactly the same as lexi cal choice task faced by the multi-word phrasal translation disambiguation task faced by the phrase-based SMT system.
			Instead of using predefined senses drawn from manually constructed sense inventories such asHowNet (Dong, 1998), our WSD for SMT sys tem directly disambiguates between all phrasaltranslation candidates seen during SMT train ing.
			Instead of learning from manually annotated training data, our WSD system is trained on the same corpora as the SMT system.
			However, despite these
