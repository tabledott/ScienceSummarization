03), and Swedish (Nilsson et al., 2005).
    Japanese (Kawata and Bartels, 2000), despite a very high accuracy, is different in that attachment score drops from 98% to 85%, as we go from length 1 to 2, which may have something to do with the data consisting of transcribed speech with very short utterances.
    A second observation is that a high proportion of non-projective structures leads to fragmentation in the parser output, reflected in lower precision for roots.
    This is noticeable for German (Brants et al., 2002) and Portuguese (Afonso et al., 2002), which still have high overall accuracy thanks to very high attachment scores, but much more conspicuous for Czech (B&#168;ohmov&#180;a et al., 2003), Dutch (van der Beek et al., 2002) and Slovene (D&#711;zeroski et al., 2006), where root precision drops more drastically to about 69%, 71% and 41%, respectively, and root recall is also affected negatively.
    On the other hand, all three languages behave like high-accuracy languages with respect to attac
