at which it was adjoined, instead of labelling edges with addresses.
    The following rule corresponds to the above derivation, where 71, , 7k are derived from the auxiliary trees , , fik, respectively. for all addresses n in some elementary tree at which 7' can be adjoined.
    If 7' is an initial tree we do not include an address on the left-hand side.
    There has been recent interest in the application of Indexed Grammars (IG's) to natural languages.
    Gazdar (1985) considers a number of linguistic analyses which IG's (but not CFG's) can make, for example, the Norwedish example shown in Figure 1.
    The work of Rounds (1969) shows that the path sets of trees derived by IG's (like those of TAG's) are context-free languages.
    Trees derived by IG's exhibit a property that is not exhibited by the trees sets derived by TAG's or CFG's.
    Informally, two or more paths can be dependent on each other: for example, they could be required to be of equal length as in the trees in Figure 4. generates such a
