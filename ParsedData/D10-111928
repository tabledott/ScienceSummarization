kip words, UBL-s achieves the highest recall of all reported systems for all evaluation conditions.
    However, UBL achieves much higher precision and better overall F1 scores, which are generally comparable to the best performing systems.
    The comparison to the CCG induction techniques of ZC05 and ZC07 (Table 3) is particularly striking.
    These approaches used language-specific templates to propose new lexical items and also required as input a set of hand-engineered lexical entries to model phenomena such as quantification and determiners.
    However, the use of higher-order unification allows UBL to achieve comparable performance while automatically inducing these types of entries.
    For a more qualitative evaluation, Table 4 shows a selection of lexical items learned with high weights for the lambda-calculus meaning representations.
    Nouns such as &#8220;state&#8221; or &#8220;estado&#8221; are consistently learned across languages with the category S|NP, which stands in for the more conventi
