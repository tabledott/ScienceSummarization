ord forms is augmented by the disambiguating analyzer.
    This can be useful for choosing the correct translation of ambiguous words.
    Of course, these disambiguation clues result in an enlarged vocabulary.
    The vocabulary of the new representation of the German part of the Verbmobil corpus, for example, in which full word forms are replaced by base form plus morphological and syntactic tags (lemmatag representation), is one and a half times as large as the vocabulary of the original corpus.
    On the other hand, the information in the lemma-tag representation can be accessed gradually and ultimately reduced: For example, certain instances of words can be considered equivalent.
    This fact is used to better exploit the bilingual training data along two directions: detecting and omitting unimportant information (see Section 2.4) and constructing hierarchical translation models (see Section 4).
    To summarize, the lemma-tag representation of a corpus has the following main advantages: It makes conte
