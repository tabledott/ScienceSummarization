or this distribution.
    We compute the average frequency for the distribution of labels: ft and the standard deviation a-t. We finally apply a filtering method similar to (C2).
    Let t be a possible label.
    We keep t if and only if it satisfies inequality (4b) similar to (4a) given before: A collocation is thus accepted if and only if it has a label g satisfying inequality (4b), and g U.
    Similarly, a collocation is rejected if no label satisfies inequality (4b) or if U satisfies it.
    Figure 10 shows part of the output of Step 3.3 for w = &amp;quot;rose&amp;quot; and w, = &amp;quot;prices.&amp;quot; As shown in the figure, SV labels are a large majority.
    Thus, we would label the relation price-rose as an SV relation.
    An example output of this stage is given in Figure 11.
    The bigrams labeled U were rejected at this stage.
    Stage 3 thus produces very useful results.
    It filters out collocations and rejects more than half of them, thus improving the quality of the results.
