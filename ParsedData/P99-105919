    But instead of full constituents&#8212;strings xd,y e d, &#8212;it uses only half-constituents like xdi and The other halves of these constituents can be attached later, because to find an accepting path for (zi, Zr) in a split head automaton, one can separately find the half-path before the flip state (which accepts zr) and the half-path after the flip state (which accepts zi).
    These two halfpaths can subsequently be joined into an accepting path if they have the same flip state s, i.e., one path starts where the other ends.
    Annotating our left half-constituents with s makes this check possible.
  
  
    We have formally described, and given faster parsing algorithms for, three practical grammatical rewriting systems that capture dependencies between pairs of words.
    All three systems admit naive 0(n5) algorithms.
    We give the first 0(n4) results for the natural formalism of bilexical context-free grammar, and for Alshawi's (1996) head automaton grammars.
    For the usual case, split he
