thout additional resources (lemmatizers and lexicons).
    For unlimited resources, ProAlign.RE.1 has the best performance.
    For English-French, Ralign.EF.1 has the best performance for limited resources, while ProAlign.EF.1 has again the largest number of top ranked figures for unlimited resources.
    To make a cross-language comparison, we paid particular attention to the evaluation of the Sure alignments, since these were collected in a similar fashion (an agreement had to be achieved between two different annotators).
    The results obtained for the English-French Sure alignments are significantly higher (80.54% best Fmeasure) than those for Romanian-English Sure alignments (71.14% best F-measure).
    Similarly, AER for English-French (5.71% highest error reduction) is clearly better than the AER for Romanian-English (28.86% highest error reduction).
    This difference in performance between the two data sets is not a surprise.
    As expected, word alignment, like many other NLP tasks (Banko and B
