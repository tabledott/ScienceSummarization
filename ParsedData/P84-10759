for encoding much more complex linguistic phenomena can be found in Shieber et at.
    184 Augmented phrase-structure grammars such as PATRII ran in fart be quite powerful.
    The ability to encode unbounded amounts of information in the augmentations (which PATIt-ll obviously allows) gives this formalism the power of a Turing machine.
    As a linguistic theory, this much power might be considered disadvantageous; as a computer language, however, such power is clearly desirable. since the intent of the language is to enable the modeling of many kinds of linguistic analyses from a range of theories.
    As such, PATR-H is a tool, not a result.
    Nevertheless, a good case could be made for maintaining at lea.st the decidability of determining whether a string is admitted by a PATR-II grammar.
    This property can be ensured by requiring the context-free skeleton to have the property of off-line parsability [Pereira, 83), which was used originally in the definition of LFG to maintain the decidability of tha
