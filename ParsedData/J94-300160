nt that such a rule performs is modeled by a relation Replace initially defined as follows: The final asterisk allows for repetitions of the basic 0 x 0 mapping, and Id(E*) allows identical corresponding substrings to come between successive applications of the rule.
    The 0 x '0 replacement is optional to allow for the possibilities that the rule itself may be optional or that there may be no eligible instances of 0 in the input string.
    Replace is the set of pairs of strings that are identical except for possible replacements of substrings belonging to 0 by substrings belonging to 0.
    This set clearly contains all the pairs that satisfy the rule, though perhaps other pairs as well.
    The problem now is to impose restrictions on this mapping so that it occurs in the proper contexts and in accordance with the parameters specified for the rule.
    We do this in a series of approximations.
    As a first step, we might be tempted simply to add the context restrictions as necessary conditions of the 0
