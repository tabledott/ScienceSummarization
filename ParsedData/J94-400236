 to tune the algorithm, almost all cases of intersentential anaphora involved an antecedent in the immediately preceding sentence.
    Moreover, the progressive decline in the salience values of antecedent candidates in previous sentences ensures that a candidate appearing in a sentence which is more than one sentence prior to the current one will be selected only if no candidates exist in either the current or the preceding sentence.
    As such cases are relatively rare in the type of text we studied, we limited our test set to textual units containing the current and the preceding sentence. list (in most cases, it was considerably larger).17 The test set contains 345 sentence pairs with a total of 360 pronoun occurrences.
    The results of the blind test for RAP and RAPSTAT are as follows.'
    When we further analyzed the results of the blind test, we found that RAPSTAT's success depends in large part on its use of salience information.
    If RAPSTAT's statistically based lexical preference scores are u
