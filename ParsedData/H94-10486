e can associate a bit string with every word in the vocabulary.
  Then, by querying the value of certain bit positions we can con- stmct binary questions.
  For example, we can ask whether about a bit position for any of the four head words, e.g., Bi t  5 of P repos i t ion  == i.
  We discuss be- low a richer set of these questions.
  Features comprised solely of questions about class bits are denoted as "class" features, and features containing questions about both class bits and words are denoted as "mixed" features 1.
  Before discussing, feature selection and construction, we give a brief overview of the mutual information clustering of words.
  Mutual Information Bits Mutual information clustering, as described in [10], creates a a class "tree" for a given vocab- ulary.
  Initially, we take the C most frequent words (usually 1000) and assign each one to its own class.
  We then take the (C + 1)st word, assign it to its own class, and merge the pair of classes that minimize the loss of average mutual inf
