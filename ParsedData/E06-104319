sented later in this section.)
    As can be seen, the informed baseline, , shows a large improvement over the random baseline ( error reduction).
    This shows that one can get relatively good performance by treating verb+noun idiomatic combinations as collocations. performs as well as the informed baseline ( error reduction).
    This result shows that, as hypothesized, lexical fixedness is a reasonably good predictor of idiomaticity.
    Nonetheless, the performance signifies a need for improvement.
    Possibly the most beneficial enhancement would be a change in the way we acquire the similar nouns for a target noun.
    The best performance (shown in boldface) belongs to , with error reduction over the random baseline, and error reduction over the informed baseline.
    These results demonstrate that syntactic fixedness is a good indicator of idiomaticity, better than a simple measure of collocation ( ), or a measure of lexical fixedness.
    These results further suggest that looking into deep linguis
