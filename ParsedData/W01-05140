  Latent Semantic Analysis For Text Segmentation
  
    This paper describes a method for linear text segmentation that is more accurate or at least as accurate as state-of-the-art methods (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001; Choi, 2000a).
    Inter-sentence similarity is estimated by latent semantic analysis (LSA).
    Boundary locations are discovered by divisive clustering.
    Test results show LSA is a more accurate similarity measure than the
  
  
    The aim of linear text segmentation is to partition a document into blocks, such that each segment is coherent and consecutive segments are about different topics.
    This procedure is useful in information retrieval (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Reynar, 1999), summarisation (Reynar, 1998), text understanding, anaphora resolution (Kozima, 1993), language modelling (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Beeferman et al., 1997) and text navigation (Choi, 2000b).
    This paper presents a new algorithm for segmenting written text.
    The method builds on
