ome extensions to metaphor interpretation in CS and compare the met* method against other approaches to metaphor and metonymy, especially computational ones.
    A glossary of key terms is provided at the very end of the paper.
    Metonymy and metaphor are so poorly understood that widely divergent views exist about them and their relationship to each other.
    This section reviews research on metaphor (2.1), metonymy (2.2), the relationship between them (2.3), and the more general relationship between literalness and nonliteralness (2.4).
    Four views of metaphor are critically discussed: the comparison view, the interactive view, the selection restriction violation view, and the conventional metaphor view.
    Computational examples of each kind are included by Gentner, Indurkhya, Hobbs, Wilks, and Martin.
    Space does not permit discussion of other AT work on metaphor by, e.g., Russell (1976) and Weiner (1984; 1985). a metaphor is a comparison in which one term (the tenor or subject of the comparison
