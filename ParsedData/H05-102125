nd also ensures that the output sequences are validpermutations of input phrase sequences; we empha size again that the probability distribution induced over reordered phrase sequences is not degenerate.Our reordering models do resemble those of (Till mann, 2004; Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) in that we 167 treat the reordering as a sequence of jumps relativeto the original phrase sequence, and that the likelihood of the reordering is assigned through phrase pair specific parameterized models.
			We note thatour implementation allows phrase reordering beyond simply a 1-phrase window, as was done by Till mann.
			More importantly, our model implements a generative model of phrase reordering which can be incorporated directly into a generative model of theoverall translation process.
			This allows us to per form ?embedded?
			EM-style parameter estimation, in which the parameters of the phrase reordering model are estimated using statistics gathered under the complete model that will actually be used in translatio
