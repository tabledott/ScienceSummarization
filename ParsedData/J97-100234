    Coders generally become more consistent with experience. level of coding most useful for work in other domains.
    To test how well the scheme would transfer, it was applied by two of the coders from the main move reliability study to a transcribed conversation between a hi-fi sales assistant and a married couple intending to purchase an amplifier.
    Dialogue openings and closings were omitted since they are well understood but do not correspond to categories in the classification scheme.
    The coders reached K = .95 (N = 819, k = 2) on the move segmentation task, using word boundaries as possible move boundaries, and K = .81 (N = 80, k = 2) for move classification.
    These results are in line with those from the main trial.
    The coders recommended adding a new move category specifically for when one conversant completes or echoes an utterance begun by another conversant.
    Neither of the coders used INSTRUCT, READY, or CHECK moves for this dialogue.
