ith taga when it should have been tagged with tagb in the patch corpus.
    Next, for each error triple, it is determined which instantiation of a template from the prespecified set of pdtch templates results in the greatest error reduction.
    Currently, the patch templates are: Change tag a to tag b when: 8.
    The previous word is (is not) capitalized.
    For each error triple &lt; taga,tagb, number &gt; and patch, we compute the reduction in error which results from applying the patch to remedy the mistagging of a word as taga when it should have been tagged tagb.
    We then compute the number of new errors caused by applying the patch; that is, the number of times the patch results in a word being tagged as tagb when it should be tagged taga.
    The net improvement is calculated by subtracting the latter value from the former.
    For example, when the initial tagger tags the patch corpus, it mistags 159 words as verbs when they should be nouns.
    If the patch change the tag from verb to noun if o
