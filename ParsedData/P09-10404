algorithm that only combines adjacent substructures but derives non-projective trees by reordering the input words.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
    In Section 2, we define the formal representations needed and introduce the framework of transitionbased dependency parsing.
    In Section 3, we first define a minimal transition system and explain how it can be used to perform projective dependency parsing in linear time; we then extend the system with a single transition for swapping the order of words in the input and demonstrate that the extended system can be used to parse unrestricted dependency trees with a time complexity that is quadratic in the worst case but still linear in the best case.
    In Section 4, we present experiments indicating that the expected running time of the new system on naturally occurring data is in fact linear and that the system achieves state-ofthe-art parsing accuracy.
    We discuss related work in Section 5 and conclude in Section 6.
