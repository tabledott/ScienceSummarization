exical information is used, correct alignments receive vastly greater probabilities than incorrect alignments.
    Consequently, thresholding is generally very aggressive and our search beam in the dynamic programming array is narrow.
    However, when there is a large deletion in one of the parallel corpora, consistent lexical correspondences disappear so no one alignment has a much higher probability than the others and our search beam becomes wide.
    When the search beam reaches a certain width, we take this to indicate the beginning of a deletion.
    To identify the end of a deletion, we search linearly through both corpora simultaneously.
    All occurrences of words whose frequency is below a certain value are recorded in a hash table.
    Whenever we notice the occurrence of a rare word in one corpus and its translation in the other, we take this as a candidate location for the end of the deletion.
    For each candidate location, we examine the forty sentences following the occurrence of the rare w
