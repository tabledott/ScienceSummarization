    The pattern table for each of these question types was constructed using Algorithm 1.
    Some of the patterns obtained along with their precision are as follows For each question type, we extracted the corresponding questions from the TREC-10 set.
    These questions were run through the testing phase of the algorithm.
    Two sets of experiments were performed.
    In the first case, the TREC corpus was used as the input source and IR was performed by the IR component of our QA system (Lin, 2002).
    In the second case, the web was the input source and the IR was performed by the AltaVista search engine.
    Results of the experiments, measured by Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) score (Voorhees, 01), are:
  
  
    The results indicate that the system performs better on the Web data than on the TREC corpus.
    The abundance of data on the web makes it easier for the system to locate answers with high precision scores (the system finds many examples of correct answers among th
