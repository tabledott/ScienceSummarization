ocesses.
    We believe that semantics can add domination predicates, but cannot construct new nodes.)
    As an example of the kind of operation that is ruled out by Dtheory, let us return to our assertion above that the preposition &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; cannot always be part of the idiomatic verb &amp;quot;make a mess&amp;quot;.
    Consider (9) above.
    In this sentence, the analysis will include some assertions that &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; is dominated by a PP, which itself is dominated by COMP.
    But if an assertion is then added to this description asserting that &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; is also dominated by a verb node, then there is no consistent interpretation of this structure at all, since the COMP cannot dominate the verb node and the verb node cannot dominate the COMP.
    Put more simply, there is no way something can merely be &amp;quot;lowered&amp;quot; from a COMP node into the verb.
    Another possibility similarly ruled out by D-theory is that in sentences like (6.1) there is initially a
