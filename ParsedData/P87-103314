herefore, it is useful to examine the complexity of each of the three steps independently.
    Let n represent the total number of symbols in the combined description f A g, and d represent the total number of disjuncts (in both top-level and embedded disjunctions) contained in f A g. Step /.
    This step performs the unification of two DG structures.
    Ait-Kaci [1] has shown how this operation can be performed in almost linear time by the UNION/FIND algorithm.
    Its time complexity has an upper bound of 0(n log n).
    Since an unknown amount of a description may be contained in the definite component, this step of the algorithm also requires 0(n log it) time.
    Step 2.
    For this step we examine the complexity of the function CHECK-INDEF.
    There are two nested loops in CHECK-INDEF, each of which may be executed at most once for each disjunct in the description.
    The inner loop checks the compatibility of two DG structures, which requires no more time than unification.
    Thus, in the worst c
