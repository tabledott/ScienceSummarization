ative corpus with given reference translations and a set of different candidate translations for each input sentence .
    In the extreme case, for , Eq.
    7 converges to the unsmoothed criterion of Eq.
    5 (except in the case of ties).
    Note, that the resulting objective function might still have local optima, which makes the optimization hard compared to using the objective function of Eq.
    4 which does not have different local optima.
    The use of this type of smoothed error count is a common approach in the speech community (Juang et al., 1995; Schl&#168;uter and Ney, 2001).
    Figure 1 shows the actual shape of the smoothed and the unsmoothed error count for two parameters in our translation system.
    We see that the unsmoothed error count has many different local optima and is very unstable.
    The smoothed error count is much more stable and has fewer local optima.
    But (5) as we show in Section 7, the performance on our task obtained with the smoothed error count does not differ sig
