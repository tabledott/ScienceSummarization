is not comprehensive, as about 31% of the synsets are simply labeled with &#8220;factotum&#8221;, indicating that the synset does not belong to a specific domain.
    225 nouns have at least one synset labeled with the listed domain labels.
    In our experiments, 4 out of these 25 nouns have an accuracy of more than 90% before adaptation (i.e., training on just the BC examples) and accuracy improvement is less than 1% after all the available WSJ adaptation examples are added as additional training data.
    To obtain a clearer picture of the adaptation process, we discard these 4 nouns, leaving a set of data, and the rest of the WSJ examples are designated as in-domain adaptation data.
    The row 21 nouns in Table 1 shows some information about these 21 nouns.
    For instance, these nouns have an average of 6.7 senses in BC and 6.8 senses in WSJ.
    This is slightly higher than the 5.8 senses per verb in (Chen et al., 2006), where the experiments were conducted using coarse-grained evaluation.
