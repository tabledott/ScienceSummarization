own which sanctions the move that will be made to advance from that position to the next.
    No such frame is given for the last configuration for the obvious reason that this represents the end of the process.
    The move from (a) to (b) is sanctioned by a frame in which the root consonant is ignored.
    There must be a &amp;quot;V&amp;quot; on the template tape and an &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; in the current position of the vocalism.
    However, the vocalism tape will not move when the automata move to their next states.
    Finally, there will be an &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; on the tape containing the surface form.
    In summary, given that the prosodie template calls for a vowel, the next vowel in the vocalism has been copied to the surface.
    Nondeterministically, the device predicts that this same contribution from the vocalism will also be required to fill a later position.
    The move from (b) to (c) is sanctioned by a frame in which the vocalism is ignored.
    The template requires a consonant and t
