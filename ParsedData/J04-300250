4: For each data set, for each precision interval whose lower bound is at least 10 percentage points higher than the baseline for that data set, the top two (T, W) pairs yielding the highest frequencies in that interval are chosen.
    Among the five data sets, a total of 45 parameter pairs were so selected.
    This exercise was completed once, without experimenting with different parameter settings.
    In this section, density is exploited to find subjective instances of automatically identified PSEs.
    The process is shown in Figure 4.
    There are only two differences between the algorithms in Figures 3 and 4.
    First, in Figure 3, density is defined in terms of the number of subjective elements nearby.
    However, subjective-element annotations are not available in test data.
    Thus in Figure 4, density is defined in terms of the Algorithm for calculating density in opinion piece (OP) data number of other PSE instances nearby, where PSEinsts consists of all instances of the automatically identif
