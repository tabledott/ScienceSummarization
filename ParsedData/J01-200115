hod is quite good as a heuristic for finding a good set of candidate morphemes, comparable in quality to the mutual informationbased heuristic that I have used, and which I describe below.
    It has the same problem that good heuristics frequently have: it has many inaccuracies, and it does not lend itself to a next step, a qualitatively more reliable approximation of the correct solution.'
    Hafer and Weiss (1974) explore in detail various ways of clarifying and improving on Harris's algorithm while remaining faithful to the original intent.
    A brief summary does not do justice to their fascinating discussion, but for our purposes, their results confirm the character of the Harrisian test as heuristic: with Harris's proposal, a quantitative measure is proposed (and Hafer and Weiss develop a range of 15 different measures, all of them rooted in Harris's proposal), and best results for morphological analysis are obtained in some cases by seeking a local maximum of prefix conditional entropy, in others by
