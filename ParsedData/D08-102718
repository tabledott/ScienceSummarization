e noun &#8220;president&#8221; for the three senses given in SemEval.
    As shown in Figure 5, performing simple majority voting (with random tie-breaking) over annotators results in a rapid accuracy plateau at a very high rate of 0.994 accuracy.
    In fact, further analysis reveals that there was only a single disagreement between the averaged non-expert vote and the gold standard; on inspection it was observed that the annotators voted strongly against the original gold label (9-to-1 against), and that it was in fact found to be an error in the original gold standard annotation.6 After correcting this error, the non-expert accuracy rate is 100% on the 177 examples in this task.
    This is a specific example where non-expert annotations can be used to correct expert annotations.
    Since expert ITA was not reported per word on this dataset, we compare instead to the performance of the best automatic system performance for disambiguating &#8220;president&#8221; in SemEval Task 17 (Cai et al., 2007), with
