 of operators to composemore complex features, such as conjunctive (n grams) and relational features, as in (Cumby and Roth, 2000; Roth and Yih, 2001).
			A simple script that describes the ?types?
			of features used, (e.g., conjunction of two consecutive words and their postags) is written and the features themselves are ex tracted in a data driven way.
			Only ?active?
			features are listed in our representation so that despite the large number of potential features, the size of each example is small.
			Among the 6 primitive feature types, pos tags, chunks and head chunks are syntactic features while named entities and semantically related words are semantic features.
			Pos tags are extracted using a SNoW-based pos tagger (Even-Zohar and Roth, 2001).
			Chunks are extracted using a previously learned classifier (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001; Li and Roth, 2001).
			The named entity classifier isalso learned and makes use of the same technol ogy developed for the chunker (Roth et al, 2002).The ?related word?
