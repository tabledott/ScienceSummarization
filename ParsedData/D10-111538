small, large).
    We cluster with the CLUTO toolkit (Karypis, 2003), using the repeated bisections with global optimization method, accepting all of CLUTO&#8217;s default values for this choice.
    Cluster quality is evaluated by percentage purity (Zhao and Karypis, 2003).
    If nir is the number of items from the i-th true (gold standard) class assigned to the r-th cluster, n is the total number of items and k the number of clusters, then: Purity = n &#65533;r&#8212;1rmax(nir).
    We calculate i empirical 95% confidence intervals around purity by a heuristic bootstrap procedure based on 10K resamplings of the data set (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994).
    The random baseline distribution is obtained by 10K random assignments of adjectives to the clusters, under the constraint that no cluster is empty.
    Table 5 shows that all methods are significantly better than chance.
    Our two &#8220;indirect&#8221; representations achieve similar performance, and they are (slightly) better than the traditional metho
