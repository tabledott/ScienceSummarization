    Coherence was indirectly evaluated by noting the number of sentences indicating an awkward time sequence, suggesting a wrong cause&#8211;effect relationship, or being semantically incongruent with their neighboring sentences.8 Unfortunately, the observed coherence violations were not fine-grained enough to be of use in our rating experiments.
    In the majority of cases DUC evaluators noted either 0 or 1 violations; however, without judging the coherence of the summary as a whole, we cannot know whether a single violation disrupts coherence severely or not.
    We therefore obtained judgments for automatically generated summaries from human subjects.9 We randomly selected 16 input document clusters and five systems that had produced summaries for these sets, along with reference summaries composed by humans.
    Coherence ratings were collected during an elicitation study by 177 unpaid volunteers, all native speakers of English.
    The study was conducted rem
