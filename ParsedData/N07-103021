 its assignments.
    Thus, highly improbable links are still heavily penalized and are not chosen as coreferential.
    The JOINT-ILP system demonstrates the benefit ILP&#8217;s ability to support joint task formulations.
    It produces significantly better f-scores by regaining some of the ground on precision lost by COREFILP.
    The most likely source of the improved precision of JOINT-ILP is that weights corresponding to the anaphoricity probabilities and constraints (8) and (10) reduce the number of occurrences of nonanaphors being assigned antecedents.
    There are also improvements in recall over COREF-ILP for NPAPER and NWIRE.
    A possible source of this difference is constraint (9), which ensures that mentions which are considered anaphoric must have at least one antecedent.
    Compared to COREF-PAIRWISE, JOINT-ILP dramatically improves recall with relatively small losses in precision, providing overall f-score gains of 5.3%, 4.9%, and 3.7% on the three datasets.
