appropriate place (as determined by the contents of the first 2k work tapes) on the input tape.
    In addition to the tapes required to store the indices, M requires one work tape for splitting the substrings.
    Thus, the ATM has no more than 6km&amp;quot; + 1 work tapes, where km&amp;quot; is the maximum number of substrings spanned by a derived structure.
    Since the work tapes store integers (which can be written in binary) that never exceed the size of the input, no configuration has space exceeding 0(log n).
    Thus, M works in logspace and recognition can be done on a deterministic TM in polynomial tape.
  
  
    We have studied the structural descriptions (tree sets) that can be assigned by various grammatical systems, and classified these formalisms on the basis of two features: path complexity; and path independence.
    We contrasted formalisms such as CFG's, HG's, TAG's and MCTAG's, with formalisms such as IG's and unificational systems such as LFG's and FUG's.
    We address the question of
