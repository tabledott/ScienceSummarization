the Cb.
    Thus an utterance may be associated with any number of Cfs, one of which may be the Cb.
    These Cfs are given a default expected Cb order, that is, &amp;quot;how much each center is expected to be the next Cb&amp;quot;.
    I regard Cb to be optional for an utterance.5 It comes into exsistence by way of a Cb-establishment process, that is, the process in which a previous non-Cb becomes the new Cb in discourse.
    Sidner's (1981, 1983) immediate focus and potential foci in local focusing correspond to Cb and Cfs, respectively.
    The difference is that Sidner uses two immediate foci (Discourse Focus and Actor Focus) while centering uses only one (Cb) (see Grosz et. al.
    1983 for discussion).
    Various factors --syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic-are combined for the identification of the Cb.
    One of them is the use of pronominal expressions, as expressed in the
