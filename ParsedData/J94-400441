 1: [T(X,) X ([T(W) W], [T(R) R ([T(Z) * Z])] [r(Q,) Q])] RLCS 2: [r(x,) X ([r(w,) W], [r(R) * R ([r(z) Z])] [T(Q) Q])] Translation: [Y-MAX [Y-MAX [r(x,) X ([T(W) [Y-MAX [Y-MAX W [X-MAX X Z]] Q] W], [T(Z) Z] [T(Q) Q])] W [X-MAX X [ ... R Z]]] Q] Note that the logical argument R is associated with a * marker in the RLCS of the target language, but not in the RLCS of the source language.
  This forces the target language syntactic structure to realize a phrase R that dominates Z; in contrast, no such dominating phrase occurs in the source-language structure.
  4.5 Conflational Divergence Conflational divergence is another case in which the "~"  correspondence is changed.
  In particular, conflational divergence is characterized by the suppression of a CLCS constituent (or the inverse of this process).
  The constituent generally occurs in logical argument or logical modifier position; thus, the "4=&gt;" correspondence of either step 3 or step 4 of the ~?T4 is changed, depending on which position is conflated.
