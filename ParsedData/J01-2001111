  Indeed, so prevalent in these calculations is the formula where the numerator is a count in Si, and the denominator a count of the same variable in S2; if no confusion would result, we write Ax.36 Let us review the terms listed in (7)-(11).
    W is a measure of the change in the number of total words due to the proposed modification (the difference between the Si and S2 analyses); an increase in the total number of words results in a slightly negative value.
    In the text above, I indicated that we could, by judicious choice of word count distribution, keep Wi = W2; I have included the more general case in (7)-(11) where the two may be different.
    INs and WC are similar measures in the change of words that have morphologically simple, and morphologically complex, stems, respectively.
    They measure the global effects of the typically small changes brought about by a hypothetical change in morphological model.
    In the derivation of each formula, we consider first the case of those morphemes that a
