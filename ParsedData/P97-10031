atistical grammar.
    A PCFG can be lexicalised by associating a headword with each non-terminal in a parse tree; thus far, (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94) and (Collins 96), which both make heavy use of lexical information, have reported the best statistical parsing performance on Wall Street Journal text.
    Neither of these models is generative, instead they both estimate 'P(T 1 S) directly.
    This paper proposes three new parsing models.
    Model 1 is essentially a generative version of the model described in (Collins 96).
    In Model 2, we extend the parser to make the complement/adjunct distinction by adding probabilities over subcategorisation frames for head-words.
    In Model 3 we give a probabilistic treatment of wh-movement, which is derived from the analysis given in Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al. 95).
    The work makes two advances over previous models: First, Model 1 performs significantly better than (Collins 96), and Models 2 and 3 give further improvements &#8212;
