al number of transitions of length two (i.e., 75)).
    Each text can thus be viewed as a distribution defined over transition types.
    We believe that considering all entity transitions may uncover new patterns relevant for coherence assessment.
    We further refine our analysis by taking into account the salience of discourse entities.
    Centering and other discourse theories conjecture that the way an entity is introduced and mentioned depends on its global role in a given discourse.
    Therefore, we discriminate between transitions of salient entities and the rest, collecting statistics for each group separately.
    We identify salient entities based on their Table 3: Example of a feature-vector document representation using all transitions of length two given syntactic categories: S, O, X, and &#8211;. frequency,1 following the widely accepted view that the occurrence frequency of an entity correlates with its discourse prominence (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Grosz et al., 1995).
