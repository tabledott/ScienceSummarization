    A complete set of TPCs for a particular bitext is the true bitext map (TBM).
    The purpose of a bitext mapping algorithm is to produce bitext maps that are the best possible approximations of each bitext's TBM.
  
  
    Early bitext mapping algorithms focused on finding corresponding sentences (Debili and Sammouda 1992; Kay and Roscheisen 1993).
    Although sentence maps are too coarse for some bitext applications (Melamed 1996a; Macklovitch 1996), sentences were a relatively easy starting point, because their order rarely changes during translation.
    Therefore, most sentence mapping algorithms ignore the possibility of crossing correspondences and aim to produce only an alignment.
    Given parallel texts U and V. an alignment is a segmentation of U and V into n segments each, so that for each i,1 &lt; i &lt; n, u, and v, are mutual translations.
    An aligned segment pair a, is an ordered pair (ui, vi).
    Thus, an alignment A can also be defined as a sequence of aligned segments: Aa-7
