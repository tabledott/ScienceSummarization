n additonal reserved nonterminal ROOT, whose sole dependent is the head of the sentence.
    This simplifies the notation, math, and the evaluation metric.
    A dependency analysis will always consist of exactly as many dependencies as there are words in the sentence.
    For example, in the dependency structure of figure 1(b), the dependencies are {(ROOT, fell), (fell, payrolls), (fell, in), (in, September), (payrolls, Factory)}.
    The quality of a hypothesized dependency structure can hence be evaluated by accuracy as compared to a gold-standard dependency structure, by reporting the percentage of dependencies shared between the two analyses.
    In the next section, we discuss several models of dependency structure, and throughout this paper we report the accuracy of various methods at recovering gold-standard dependency parses from various corpora, detailed here.
