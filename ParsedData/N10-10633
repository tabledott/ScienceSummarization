 similar.
    Typically, some pruning is done to reduce the number of sentence pairs that need to be classified.
    While these methods have been applied to news corpora and web pages, very little attention has been given to Wikipedia as a source of parallel sentences.
    This is surprising, given that Wikipedia contains annotated article alignments, and much work has been done on extracting bilingual lexicons on this dataset.
    Adafre and de Rijke (2006) extracted similar sentences from Wikipedia article pairs, but only evaluated precision on a small number of extracted sentences.
    In this paper, we more thoroughly investigate Wikipedia&#8217;s viability as a comparable corpus, and describe novel methods for parallel sentence extraction.
    Section 2 describes the multilingual resources available in Wikipedia.
    Section 3 gives further background on previous methods for parallel sentence extraction on comparable corpora, and describes our approach, which finds a global sentence alignment between tw
