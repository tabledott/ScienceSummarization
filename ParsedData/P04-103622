ation evidence in a parsed corpus, whereas we use parsed data to find distributionally similar words (nearest neighbours) to the target word which reflect the different senses of the word and have associated distributional similarity scores which can be used for ranking the senses according to prevalence.
    There has been some related work on using automatic thesauruses for discovering word senses from corpora Pantel and Lin (2002).
    In this work the lists of neighbours are themselves clustered to bring out the various senses of the word.
    They evaluate using the lin measure described above in section 2.2 to determine the precision and recall of these discovered classes with respect to WordNet synsets.
    This method obtains precision of 61% and recall 51%.
    If WordNet sense distinctions are not ultimately required then discovering the senses directly from the neighbours list is useful because sense distinctions discovered are relevant to the corpus data and new senses can be found.
