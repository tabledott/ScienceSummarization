    All our dictionaries are automatically learned from parallel data; thus, we can create dictionaries of various coverage by learning them from parallel corpora of different sizes.
    We use five dictionaries, learned from five initial out-of-domain parallel corpora, whose sizes are 100k, 1M, 10M, 50M, and 95M tokens, as measured on the English side.
    Since we want to use the classifier to extract sentence pairs from our in-domain comparable corpus, we test it on instances generated from an in-domain parallel corpus.
    In order to measure the effect of the domain difference, we use two training sets: one generated from an in-domain parallel corpus and another one from an out-ofdomain parallel corpus.
    In summary, for each language pair, we use the following corpora: Precision and recall of the Arabic-English classifiers.
    From each initial, out-of-domain corpus, we learn a dictionary.
    We then take the classifier training and test corpora and, using the method described in th
