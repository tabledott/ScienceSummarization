anslation scheme that incorporates reordering must necessarily balance model complexity against the ability to realize the model without approximation.In this paper our goal is to formulate models of lo cal phrase reordering in such a way that they can be embedded inside a generative phrase-based model ?

			of translation (Kumar et al, 2005).
			Although thismodel of reordering is somewhat limited and can not capture all possible phrase movement, it forms a proper parameterized probability distribution over reorderings of phrase sequences.
			We show that with this model it is possible to perform Maximum APosteriori (MAP) decoding (with pruning) and Ex pectation Maximization (EM) style re-estimation of model parameters over large bitext collections.
			We now discuss prior work on word and phrase reordering in translation.
			We focus on SMT systemsthat do not require phrases to form syntactic con stituents.
