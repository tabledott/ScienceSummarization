alysis and subsequent algorithm refinements made use of our original Chinese-English data set, we created a new test set based on 88 new Chinese sentences from the Penn Chinese Treebank, already manually translated into English as part of the NIST MT evaluation preview.5 These sentences averaged 19.0 words in length.
    As described above, parses ort the English side were created semi-automatically, and word alignments were acquired manually.
    However, in order to reduce our reliance ort linguistically sophisticated human annotators for Chinese syntax, we adopted art alternative strategy for obtaining the gold standard: we automatically converted the Treebank's constituency parses of the Chinese sentences into syntactic dependency representations, using art algorithm similar to the one described in Section 2 of the paper by Xia and Palmer (2001).6 The recall and precision figures for the new experiment are summarized in Table 2.
