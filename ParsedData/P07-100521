nces.
    These figures show that having more, and higher-quality proposed translations contributed to the set of 374 sentences being better translations than their respective original translations from Hiero.
    Table 3 gives a detailed breakdown of these figures according to the number of words in each proposed translation.
    For instance, over all the test sentences, the WSD module gave 7087 translations of single-word length, and 77.31% of these translations match their respective reference sentences.
    We note that although the proportion of matching 2word translations is slightly lower for the set of 374 sentences, the proportion increases for translations having more words.
    After the experiments in Section 6 were completed, we visually inspected the translation output of Hiero and Hiero+WSD to categorize the ways in which integrating WSD contributes to better translations.
    The first way in which WSD helps is when it enables the integrated Hiero+WSD system to output extra appropriate Englis
