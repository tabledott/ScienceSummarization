  Unsupervised Learning of Narrative Schemas and their Participants
  
    We describe an unsupervised system for learncoherent sequences or sets events whose arguments are filled with participant semantic roles defined over words jury, Unlike most previous work in event structure or semantic role learning, our system does not use supervised techniques, hand-built knowledge, or predefined classes of events or roles.
    Our unsupervised learning algorithm uses coreferring arguments in chains of verbs to learn both rich narrative event structure and argument roles.
    By jointly addressing both tasks, we improve on previous results in narrative/frame learning and induce rich frame-specific semantic roles.
  
  
    This paper describes a new approach to event semantics that jointly learns event relations and their participants from unlabeled corpora.
    The early years of natural language processing (NLP) took a &#8220;top-down&#8221; approach to language understanding, using representations like scripts (S
