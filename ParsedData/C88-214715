he fact that only appropriate trees get adjoined is a corollary of the fact that only trees consistent with these declarations are acceptable trees in FTAG.
  As a result, in a FTAG, constraints are dynamically instantiated and are not pre-slpecified as in a TAG.
  This can be advmltageous and useful for economy of grammar specification.
  For example, consider the derivation of the sentence What do you think Mary thought John saw In the TAG formalism, we are forced to replicate some auxiliary trees.
  Consider the auxiliary tree fll in the TAG fragment in Figure 7.
  Since the intermediate phrase what Mary thought John saw is not a complete sentence, we will have to use OA constraints at the root of the auxiliary tree ill.
  However, tlfis root node should not have OA constraints when it is used in some other context; as in the case of the derivation of Mary thought John saw Peter We will need another auxiliary tree, fs, with exactly the same tree struc- ture as fll except that the root of/32 will not have a
