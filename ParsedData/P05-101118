n Treebank have been reported for Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Clark and Curran, 2004b) and Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan et al., 2004).
    They developed log-linear models on a packed representation of parse forests, which is similar to our representation.
    Although HPSG exploits further complicated feature constraints and requires high computational cost, our work has proved that log-linear models can be applied to HPSG parsing and attain accurate and wide-coverage parsing.
    Clark and Curran (2004a) described a method of reducing the cost of parsing a training treebank in the context of CCG parsing.
    They first assigned to each word a small number of supertags, which correspond to lexical entries in our case, and parsed supertagged sentences.
    Since they did not mention the probabilities of supertags, their method corresponds to our &#8220;filtering only&#8221; method.
    However, they also applied the same supertagger in a parsing stage, and this seemed to be crucial for h
