e markers top devalue transition matrix values when retrieving a value from the matrix, @ results in the value being halved, % in the value being divided by eight (Marshall (1983), p. 149).
    Thus, the independent probability of each possible tag for a given word influences the choice of an optimal path.
    Such probabilities will be referred to as Relative Tag Probabilities, or RTPs.
    Other features have been added to the basic algorithm.
    For example, a good deal of suffix analysis is used in initial tagging.
    Also, the program filters its output, considering itself to have failed if the optimal tag assignment for a span is not &amp;quot;more than 90% probable&amp;quot;.
    In such cases it reorders tags rather than actually disambiguating.
    On long spans this criterion is effectively more stringent than on short spans.
    A more significant addition to the algorithm is that a number of tag triples associated with a scaling factor have been introduced which may either upgrade or downgrade v
