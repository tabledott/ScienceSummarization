 than the probability of the highest probability completed parse.
    Using these two search modes, SPATTER guarantees that it will find the highest probability parse.
    The only limitation of this search technique is that, for sentences which are modeled poorly, the search might exhaust the available memory before completing both phases.
    However, these search errors conveniently occur on sentences which SPATTER is likely to get wrong anyway, so there isn't much performance lossed due to the search errors.
    Experimentally, the search algorithm guarantees the highest probability parse is found for over 96% of the sentences parsed.
  
  
    In the absence of an NL system, SPATTER can be evaluated by comparing its top-ranking parse with the treebank analysis for each test sentence.
    The parser was applied to two different domains, IBM Computer Manuals and the Wall Street Journal.
    The first experiment uses the IBM Computer Manuals domain, which consists of sentences extracted from IBM computer ma
