ord features similar to the ones used in Weischedel et al. (1993), such as capitalization, hyphenation, and endings of words, for estimating the word emit probability of unknown words.
    6.5.1 Experiments and Results.
    We tested the performance of the trigram model on various domains such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), the IBM Manual corpus and the ATIS corpus.
    For the IBM Manual corpus and the ATIS domains, a supertag annotated corpus was collected using the parses of the XTAG system (Doran et al. 1994) and selecting the correct analysis for each sentence.
    The corpus was then randomly split into training and test material.
    Supertag performance is measured as the percentage of words that are correctly supertagged by a model when compared with the key for the words in the test corpus. data, from the XTAG parses and from the conversion of the Penn Treebank parses to evaluate the performance of the trigram model.
    Table 5 shows the performance on the two sets of data.
