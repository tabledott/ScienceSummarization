 genuine.
    Therefore the continued growth of the grammar is not as rapid as Figure 5 might indicate.
    Moreover, our extraction heuristics evidently have room to improve.
    The majority of trees resulting from deficiencies in the heuristics involved complicated coordination structures, which is not surprising, since coordination has always been problematic for TAG.
    To see what the impact of this failure to converge is, we ran the grammar extractor on some held-out data (section 00).
    Out of 45082 tree tokens, 107 tree templates, or 0.2%, had not been seen in training.
    This amounts to about one unseen tree template every 20 sentences.
    When we consider lexicalized trees, this figure of course rises: out of the same 45082 tree tokens, 1828 lexicalized trees, or 4%, had not been seen in training.
    So the coverage of the grammar is quite good.
    Note that even in cases where the parser encounters a sentence for which the (fallible) extraction heuristics would have produced an unseen tree
