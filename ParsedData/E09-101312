atures as word-like elements.
    In other words, we could simply assume that the contexts we wish to model are the union of all our features.
    Although straightforward, this solution is undesirable.
    It merges the distributions of distinct feature categories into a single one, and is therefore conceptually incorrect, and can affect the performance of the model.
    For instance, parts-ofspeech (which have few values, and therefore high probability), would share a distribution with words (which are much sparser).
    Layers containing more elements (e.g.
    10 word window) would overwhelm rectangles represent different sources (layers) of information.
    All layers share the same, instancespecific, sense distribution (0), but each have their own (multinomial) sense-feature distribution (&#65533;).
    Shaded nodes represent observed features f; these can be words, parts of speech, collocations or dependencies. unconditional joint distribution P(s) of the unobserved variables (provided certain criteria
