    6.1.1 Effect of Alignment Template Length.
    Table 3 shows the effect of constraining the maximum length of the alignment templates in the source language.
    Typically, it is necessary to restrict the alignment template length to keep memory requirements low.
    We see that using alignment templates with only one or two words in the source languages results in very bad translation quality.
    Yet using alignment templates with lengths as small as three words yields optimal results. algorithm misses the most probable translation and produces a translation which is less probable.
    As we typically cannot efficiently compute the probability of the optimal translation, we cannot efficiently compute the number of search errors.
    Yet we can compute a lower bound on the number of search errors by comparing the translation found under specific pruning thresholds with the best translation that we have found using very conservative pruning thresholds.
