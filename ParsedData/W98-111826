 formal run can be found in (Borthwick et al., 1998).
  
  
    M.E. has been successfully applied to many other tasks in computational linguistics.
    Some recent work for which there are solid comparable benchmarks is the work of Adwait Ratnaparkhi at the University of Pennsylvania.
    He has achieved state-of-the art results by applying M.E. to parsing (Ratnaparkhi, 1997a), part-of-speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and sentence-boundary detection (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997).
    Other recent work has applied M.E. to language modeling (Rosenfeld, 1994), machine translation (Berger et al., 1996), and reference resolution (Kehler, 1997).
    M.E. was first applied to named entity recognition at the MUC-7 conference by (Borthwick et al., 1998) and (Mikheev and Grover, 1998).
    Note that part-of-speech tagging is, in many ways, a very similar task to that of named-entity recognition.
    Ratnaparkhi's tagger is similar to MENE, in that his features look at the surrounding two-word lexical context, but
