es based on statistical methods for retrieving and identifying collocations from large textual corpora.
    These techniques produce a wide range of collocations and are based on some original filtering methods that allow the production of richer and higher-precision output.
    These techniques have been implemented and resulted in a tool, techniques are described and some results are presented on a 10 corpus of stock market news reports.
    A lexicographic evaluation of a retrieval tool has been made, and the estimated precision of 80%.
