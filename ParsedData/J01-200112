 n + 1st letter given the first n letters (or the mirror-image measure).
    This was first proposed by Zellig Harris (1955, 1967), and further developed by others, notably by Hafer and Weiss (1974).
    The second approach seeks to identify bigrams (and trigrams) that have a high likelihood of being morpheme internal, a view pursued in work discussed below by Klenk, Langer, and others.
    The third approach focuses on the discovery of patterns (we might say, of rules) of phonological relationships between pairs of related words.
    The fourth approach, which includes that used in this paper, is top-down, and seeks an analysis that is globally most concise.
    In this section, we shall review some of the work that has pursued these approaches&#8212;briefly, necessarily.'
    While not all of the approaches discussed here use no prior language-particular knowledge (which is the goal of the present system), I exclude from discussions those systems that are based essentially on a prior human-designed analysis
