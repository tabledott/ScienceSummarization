    In this paper, we have described a new approach for learning a grammar to automatically parse text.
    The method can be used to obtain high parsing accuracy with a very small training set.
    Instead of learning a traditional grammar, an ordered set of structural transformations is learned that can be applied to the output of a very naive parser to obtain binary-branching trees with unlabelled nonterminals.
    Experiments have shown that these parses conform with high accuracy to the structural descriptions specified in a manually annotated corpus.
    Unlike other recent attempts at automatic grammar induction that rely heavily on statistics both in training and in the resulting grammar, our learner is only very weakly statistical.
    For training, only integers are needed and the only mathematical operations carried out are integer addition and integer comparison.
    The resulting grammar is completely symbolic.
    Unlike learners based on the inside-outside a
