sed to construct a shared parse forest.
			Fi- nally, a parse tree retriever is used to enumer- ate the parse trees.
			The key idea of the parsing algorithm was presented in (tin, 199:1).
			This paper presents some implementation details and experimental results.
	
	
			The parser in PIHNCIPAR is based on a message-passing framework proposed by \],in (1993) and l,in and Ooebel (1993), which uses a network to encode the grammar.
			The nodes in tile grammar network represent grammati- cal categories (e.g., NP, Nbar, N) or subcate- gories, such as V:NP (transitive verbs that take NPs as complements).
			The links in the net- work re.present relationships bel;ween the cat- egories.
			GB-principles are implemented as lo- cal constraints attached to the nodes and 482 perco la t ion cormtra in ts attached to links in the network.
