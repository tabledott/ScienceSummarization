 of preferences over global structures, such as the similarity of syntactic/semantic structure of coordinates.
    Incorporating features for representing the similarity of global structures is difficult for feature forest models.
    Zero-pronoun resolution is also a difficult problem.
    However, we found that most were indirectly caused by errors of argument/modifier distinction in to-infinitive clauses.
    A significant portion of the errors discussed above cannot be resolved by the features we investigated in this study, and the design of other features will be necessary for improving parsing accuracy.
  
  
    The model described in this article was first published in Miyao and Tsujii (2002), and has been applied to probabilistic models for parsing with lexicalized grammars.
    Applications to CCG parsing (Clark and Curran 2003, 2004b) and LFG parsing (Kaplan et al. 2004; Riezler and Vasserman 2004) demonstrated that feature forest models attained higher accuracy than other models.
