    Only verbs are considered as predicates whereas arguments are labeled sequentially from ARG0 to ARG9.
    Also in FrameNet predicate/argument information is described but for this purpose richer semantic structures called Frames are used.
    The Frames are schematic representations of situations involving various participants, properties and roles in which a word may be typically used.
    Frame elements or semantic roles are arguments of predicates called target words.
    For example the following sentence is annotated according to the ARREST frame: [Time One Saturday night] [ Authorities police in Brooklyn ] [Target apprehended ] [Suspect sixteen teenagers].
    The roles Suspect and Authorities are specific to the frame.
    The common approach to learn the classification of predicate arguments relates to the extraction of features from the syntactic parse tree of the target sentence.
    In (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) seven different features2, which aim to capture the relation between t
