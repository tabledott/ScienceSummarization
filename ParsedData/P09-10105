l-and-error process of repeated interaction with the user.
    Reinforcement learning is applied very differently in dialogue systems compared to our setup.
    In some respects, our task is more easily amenable to reinforcement learning.
    For instance, we are not interacting with a human user, so the cost of interaction is lower.
    However, while the state space can be designed to be relatively small in the dialogue management task, our state space is determined by the underlying environment and is typically quite large.
    We address this complexity by developing a policy gradient algorithm that learns efficiently while exploring a small subset of the states.
  
  
    Our task is to learn a mapping between documents and the sequence of actions they express.
    Figure 2 shows how one example sentence is mapped to three actions.
    Mapping Text to Actions As input, we are given a document d, comprising a sequence of sentences (u1, ... , ut), where each ui is a sequence of words.
    Our goal is to ma
