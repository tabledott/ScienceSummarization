utput sentence in the target language).
    The overall architecture of the statistical translation approach is summarized in Figure 1.
    In general, as shown in this figure, there may be additional transformations to make the translation task simpler for the algorithm.
    The transformations may range from simple word categorization to more complex preprocessing steps that require some parsing of the source string.
    In this article, however, we will use only word categorization as an explicit transformation step.
    In the search procedure both the language and the translation model are applied after the text transformation steps.
    The following &#8220;types&#8221; of parameters are used for the IBM-4 translation model: Lexicon probabilities: We use the lexicon probability p(f  |e) for translating the single target word e as the single source word f. A source word f may be translated by the &#8220;null&#8221; word e0 (i.e., it does not produce any target word e).
    A translation probability p(f
