onding to one of the example pairs are non-zero.
    We then pick the most characteristic links in this subspace to represent the target role r, and look for new pairs (n, qr) in the W1W2xL subspace defined by these automatically picked links, instead of the manual ones.
    Although we stop at this point, the procedure can be seen as a DM version of popular iterative bootstrapping algorithms such as Espresso (Pantel and Pennacchiotti 2006): Start with some examples of the target relation, find links that are typical of these examples, use the links to find new examples, and so on.
    In DM, the process does not go back to a corpus to harvest new links and example pairs, but it iterates between the column and row spaces of a pre-compiled matrix (i.e, the mode-2 matricization in Table 3).
    For each of the 30 noun concepts in the Cimiano and Wenderoth gold standard, we use the noun&#8211;quale pairs pertaining to the remaining 29 concepts as training examples to select a set of 20 links that we then use in
