e seen as supertags.
    An approach that is closely related to supertagging is the reductionist approach to parsing that is being carried out under the Constraint Grammar framework (Karlsson et al. 1994; Voutilainen 1994; Tapanainen and Jarvinen 1994).
    In this framework, each word is associated with the set of possible functional tags that it may be assigned in the language.
    This constitutes the lexicon.
    The grammar consists of a set of rules that eliminate functional tags for words based on the context of a sentence.
    Parsing a sentence in this framework amounts to eliminating as many implausible functional tags as possible for each word, given the context of the sentence.
    The resultant output structure might contain significant syntactic ambiguity, which may not have been eliminated by the rule applications, thus producing almost parses.
    Thus, the reductionist approach to parsing is similar to supertagging in that both view parsing as tagging with rich descriptions.
    However, the
