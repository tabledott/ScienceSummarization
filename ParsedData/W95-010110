curacy that results from applying a transformation.
    With unsupervised learning, the learner does not have a gold standard training corpus with which accuracy can be measured.
    Instead, we can try to use information from the distribution of unambiguous words to find reliable disambiguating contexts.
    In each learning iteration, the score of a transformation is computed based on the current tagging of the training set.
    Recall that this is completely unsupervised.
    Initially, each word in the training set is tagged with all tags allowed for that word, as indicated in the dictionary.
    In later learning iterations, the training set is transformed as a result of applying previously learned transformations.
    To score the transformation: Change the tag of a word from x to Y in context C, where Y E x, we do the following.
    For each tag Z E X, where freq(Y) is the number of occurrences of words unambiguously tagged with tag Y in the corpus, freq(Z) is the number of occurrences of words unambig
