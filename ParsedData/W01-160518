    In particular, when relations are combined into the 16 rhetoricallyrelated classes discussed in Section 2.2, the November results of the annotation process are extremely good.
    The Fewer-Relations column shows the improvement in scores on assigning relations when they are grouped in this manner, with November results ranging from 0.78 to 0.82.
    In order to see how much of the improvement had to do with pre-segmenting, we asked the same three annotators to annotate five previously unseen documents in January, without reference to a pre-segmented document.
    The results of this experiment are given in the last row of Table 1, and they reflect only a small overall decline in performance from the November results.
    These scores reflect very strong agreement and represent a significant improvement over previously reported results on annotating multiple texts in the RST framework (Marcu et al., 1999).
    Table 2 reports final results for all pairs of taggers who double-annotated four or more doc
