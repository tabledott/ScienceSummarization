s are added.
    Other sorts of chunks are inserted at each subsequent step.
    Finally, the adverbial function labels are added.
    We can see that the more structure we add, the better precision and recall of the grammatical relations get: precision increases from 60.7% to 74.8%, recall from 41.3% to 67.9%.
    This in spite of the fact that the added information is not always correct, because it was predicted for the test material on the basis of the training material by the classifiers described in Section 3.1.
    As we have seen in Table 1, especially ADJP and ADVP chunks and adverbial function labels did not have very high precision and recall.
  
  
    There are three ways how two cascaded modules can interact.
    &#8226; The first module can add information on which the later module can (partially) base its decisions.
    This is the case between the adverbial functions finder and the relations finder.
    The former adds an extra informative feature to the instances of the latter (Feature 16 in
