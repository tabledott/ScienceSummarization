NP.
    We compute the CPP score for each of our six data sets based on the average resolution class performance measured on the other five data sets.
    The predicted score for each class is computed as a weighted sum of the observed scores for each resolution class (i.e. the mean for the class measured on the other five data sets) weighted by the proportion of CEs that belong to the class.
    The predicted scores are shown in Table 6 and compared with the MUC scores that are produced by RECONCILEACL09.8 Our results show that the CPP measure is a good predictor of coreference resolution performance on unseen data sets, with the exception of one outlier &#8211; the MUC6 data set.
    In fact, the correlation between predicted and observed scores is 0.731 for all data sets and 0.913 excluding MUC6.
    RECONCILEACL09&#8217;s performance on MUC6 is better than predicted due to the higher than average scores for the common noun classes.
    We attribute this to the fact that MUC6 includes annotations for neste
