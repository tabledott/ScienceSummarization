d Grammars - the Head Wrapping operation.
  A derivation from n non-terminal produces a pair (i,a1...ai...a~) (a more convenient representation for this pan is al...~ilLl+l...a~ ).
  The arrow denotes the head of the string, which in turn determines where the string is split up when wrapping operation takes place.
  For example, consider X-&gt;LL~(A,B), and let A=*whlx and B=~*uglv.Then we say, X=*whuglvx.
  We shall define some functions used in the HG formalism, which we need here.
  If A derives in 0 or more steps the headed string whx and B derives ugv, then q, q, l) i f  X -&gt; LLI(A.B) L8 a rule ~u the gTtmmmx ~hen X dsrlveu vhugvx 2) L!
