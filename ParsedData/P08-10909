gonist chain offers one perspective on a narrative, similar to the multiple perspectives on a commercial transaction event offered by buy and sell.
    A narrative chain, by definition, includes a partial ordering of events.
    Early work on scripts included ordering constraints with more complex preconditions and side effects on the sequence of events.
    This paper presents work toward a partial ordering and leaves logical constraints as future work.
    We focus on the before relation, but the model does not preclude advanced theories of temporal order.
  
  
    Our first model learns basic information about a narrative chain: the protagonist and the constituent subevents, although not their ordering.
    For this we need a metric for the relation between an event and a narrative chain.
    Pairwise relations between events are first extracted unsupervised.
    A distributional score based on how often two events share grammatical arguments (using pointwise mutual information) is used to create this pai
