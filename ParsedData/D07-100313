also be used, such as reputability of the document the answer came from, grammaticality, etc. Here, aiming for simplicity, we do not aim to use such information.
			Hence we treat p(a) as uniform over A.3 The second adjustment adds a labeled, directed dependency tree to the question and the answer.The tree is produced by a state-of-the-art depen dency parser (McDonald et al, 2005) trained on the Wall Street Journal Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
			A dependency tree on a sequence w =?w1, ..., wk?
			is a mapping of indices of words to in dices of their syntactic parents and a label for the syntactic relation, ? : {1, ..., k} ? {0, ..., k} ? L. Each word wi has a single parent, denoted w?(i).par .Cycles are not permitted.
			w0 is taken to be the invis ible ?wall?
			symbol at the left edge of the sentence; it has a single child (|{i : ?(i) = 0}| = 1).
			The label for wi is denoted ?(i).lab.
