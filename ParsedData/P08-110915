o the more elaborate, smoothed unknown word models that are common in many PCFG parsers, such as (Klein and Manning, 2003; Petrov et al., 2006).
    We preprocessed the words in the sentences to obtain two extra pieces of information.
    Firstly, each word is annotated with a distributional similarity tag, from a distributional similarity model (Clark, 2000) trained on 100 million words from the British National Corpus and English Gigaword corpus.
    Secondly, we compute a class for each word based on the unknown word model of Klein and Manning (2003); this model takes into account capitalization, digits, dashes, and other character-level features.
    The full set of features, along with an explanation of our notation, is listed in Table 1.
  
  
    For all experiments, we trained and tested on the Penn treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993).
    We used the standard splits, training on sections 2 to 21, testing on section 23 and doing development on section 22.
