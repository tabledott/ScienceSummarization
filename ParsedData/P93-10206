bjects, as well as with those produced by Morris and Hirst.
    Iwanska (1993) compares her segmentations of factual reports with segmentations produced using syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic information.
    We derive segmentations from our empirical data based on the statistical significance of the agreement among subjects, or boundary strength.
    We develop three segmentation algorithms, based on results in the discourse literature.
    We use measures from information retrieval to quantify and evaluate the correlation between the segmentations produced by our algorithms and those derived from our subjects.
  
  
    The correspondence between discourse segments and more abstract units of meaning is poorly understood (see (Moore and Pollack, 1992)).
    A number of alternative proposals have been presented which directly or indirectly relate segments to intentions (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), RST relations (Mann et al., 1992) or other semantic relations (Polanyi, 1988).
    We present initial results of a
