 of new information to spot, one has to write a new set of rules to cover the new language and to cover the new class of information.
    A finite-state pattern rule attempts to match against a sequence of tokens (words), in much the same way as a general regular expression matcher.
    In addition to these finitestate pattern approaches, a variant of Brill rules has been applied to the problem, as outlined in (Aberdeen et al., 1995).
    The atomic elements of information extraction&#8212; indeed, of language as a whole&#8212;could be considered the who, where, when and how much in a sentence.
    A name-finder performs what is known as surface- or lightweight-parsing, delimiting sequences of tokens that answer these important questions.
    It can be used as the first step in a chain of processors: a next level of processing could relate two or more named entities, or perhaps even give semantics to that relationship using a verb.
    In this way, further processing could discover the &amp;quot;what&amp;quot
