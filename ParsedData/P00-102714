lignment confidence, and filtering out a &#8212;x /3 changes without a minimum level of support to help reduce noise.
    The final stem-change probabilities then are an interpolation with the trained model Pi and the initial baseline (P0) model described in Section 6.1: P( c &#8212;x 13 I root, suffix, POS) = Ai P0( a &#8212;x /3 I suffix) + (1 &#8212; Ai) Pi( a &#8212;x /3 I root, suffix, POS) The Levenshtein distance models are reestimated as observed in Section 5, while the context similarity model can be improved through better self-learned lemmatization of the modelled context words.
    7 Lemma Alignment by Model Combination and the Pigeonhole Principle As shown empirically below, no single model is sufficiently effective on its own.
    We applied traditional classifier combination techniques to merge the four models' scores, scaling each to achieve compatible dynamic range.
    The Frequency, Levenshtein and Context similarity models retain equal relative weight as training proceeds, while the Morpho
