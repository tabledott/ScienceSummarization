    In our model, each word-feature consists of several sub-features, which can be classified into internal sub-features and external sub-features.
    The internal sub-features are found within the word and/or word string itself to capture internal evidence while external sub-features are derived within the context to capture external evidence.
    Our model captures three types of internal sub-features: 1) 1 f : simple deterministic internal feature of the words, such as capitalization and digitalization; 2) f 2: internal semantic feature of important triggers; 3) f 3: internal gazetteer feature. f is the basic sub-feature exploited in this model, as shown in Table 2 with the descending order of priority.
    For example, in the case of non-disjoint feature classes such as ContainsDigitAndAlpha and ContainsDigitAndDash, the former will take precedence.
    The first eleven features arise from the need to distinguish and annotate monetary amounts, percentages, times and dates.
    The rest of the features
