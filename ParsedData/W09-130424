    However, gold standard results show that if the hedge cues are identified, then the system is portable.
    Table 9 shows the PCS results per hedge cue.
    The cues that get better scores in the clinical and papers subcorpora are cues that appear in the abstracts subcorpus and get a good score.
    Cues that occur in the clinical subcorpus and do not occur in the abstracts (training) subcorpus, get 0.00 score or close to 0.00, whereas cues that appear in both subcorpora tend to get a similar or better score in the clinical subcorpus.
    This is a trend that we also observed in the negation scope finding system.
    As with that system, we also observed that the papers subcorpus tends to get lower scores than the abstracts subcorpus.
    The results of the system based on gold standard hedge cues showed that the system can be applied to negation scope finding and hedge scope finding, but these results show that the results of the second phase of the system depend on the results of the first p
