tors made by PLSR is considerably closer than those produced by the additive and multiplicative models, cf.
    Table 1.
    We also computed in detail which of the three predicted composed vectors was closest to the corresponding observation.
    To this effect we extracted the 10 nearest neighbours for each A-N pair in the test set using the whole compositionality subspace (all the predicted and the original vectors).
    In 94 cases out of 380, the PLSR intended prediction was the nearest neighbour.
    Cumulatively, PLSR&#8217;s predictions were in the top-10 nearest neighbour list in 219 out of 380 cases (57.6%).
    The other models&#8217; performance in this test was negligible, cf.
    Table 2.
    Overall, 223 items in the test set had at least one predicted vector in the top-10 list; of these, 219 (98%) were generated by PLSR and the remaining 4 (1%) by the multiplicative model.
    Since the main use of DSMs is to extract similar vectors from a multidimensional space (representing related documents
