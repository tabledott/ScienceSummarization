and suffixes from the table, (ii) further segment each matching prefix/suffix at each character position, and (iii) enumerate all prefix*-stem-suffix* sequences derivable from (i) and (ii).
    Table 3 shows all of its possible segmentations of the token &#65166;&#1607;&#1585;&#65198;&#1570;&#1575;&#1608; (wAkrrhA; 'and I repeat it'),4 where 0 indicates the null prefix/suffix and the Seg Score is the language model probabilities of each segmentation S1 ... S12.
    For this token, there are two matching prefixes #&#1608;(w#) and #&#1575;&#1608;(wA#) from the prefix table, and two matching suffixes &#1575;+(+A) and &#65166;&#1607;+(+hA) from the suffix table.
    S1, S2, &amp; S3 are the segmentations given the null prefix 0 and suffixes 0, +A, +hA.
    S4, S5, &amp; S6 are the segmentations given the prefix w# and suffixes 0, +A, +hA.
    S7, S8, &amp; S9 are the segmentations given the prefix wA# and suffixes 0, +A, +hA.
    S10, S11, &amp; S12 are the segmentations given the prefix sequence w# A# derived fr
