 apparent cases of syntactic optionality (Paola Merlo, personal communication).
  
  
    If taxonomic classes were labeled explicitly in a training corpus, estimation of probabilities in the model would be fairly straightforward.
    But since text corpora contain words, not classes, it is necessary to treat each occurrence of a word in an argument position as if it might represent any of the conceptual classes to which it belongs, and assign frequency counts accordingly.
    At present, this is done by distributing the &amp;quot;credit&amp;quot; for an observation uniformly across all the conceptual classes containing an observed argument.
    Formally, given a predicate-argument relationship R (for example, the verb-object relationship), a predicate p, and a conceptual class c, where countR(p, w) is the number of times word w was observed as the argument of p with respect to R, and classes(w) is the number of taxonomic classes to which w belongs.
    Given the frequencies, probabilities are currently estim
