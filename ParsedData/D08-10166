 when writing and drawing factor functions, and when computing their degree.
    In this treatment, these observed variables are not specified by A, but instead are absorbed into the very definition of Fm.
    In defining a factor Fm, we often define the circumstances under which it fires.
    These are the only circumstances that allow Fm(A) =&#65533; 1.
    When Fm does not fire, Fm(A) = 1 and does not affect the product in equation (1).
    A hard factor Fm fires only on parses A that violate some specified condition.
    It has value 0 on those parses, acting as a hard constraint to rule them out.
    TREE.
    A hard global constraint on all the Lij variables at once.
    It requires that exactly n of these variables be true, and that the corresponding links form a directed tree rooted at position 0.
    PTREE.
    This stronger version of TREE requires further that the tree be projective.
    That is, it prohibits Lij and LH from both being true if i &#8212;* j crosses k &#8212;* E. (These links are sai
