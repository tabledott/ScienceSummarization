tional rather than joint probabilities, and with a mean-field approximation and other additional modifications that improve efficiency specifically for a sequence model.
    In comparison with traditional approaches, automated feature induction offers both improved accuracy and significant reduction in feature count; it enables the use of richer, higherorder Markov models, and offers more freedom to liberally guess about which atomic features may be relevant to a task.
    Feature induction methods still require the user to create the building-block atomic features.
    Lexicon membership tests are particularly powerful features in natural language tasks.
    The question is where to get lexicons that are relevant for the particular task at hand?
    This paper describes WebListing, a method that obtains seeds for the lexicons from the labeled data, then uses the Web, HTML formatting regularities and a search engine service to significantly augment those lexicons.
    For example, based on the appearance of A
