s (one billion tokens) of unlabeled data to explore the performance improvement with respect to the unlabeled data size.
    In addition, we investigate the performance improvement for &#8216;unseen data&#8217; from the viewpoint of unlabeled data coverage.
    Finally, we compare our results with those provided by the best current systems.
    The contributions of this paper are threefold.
    First, we present a simple, scalable, but powerful task-independent model for semi-supervised sequential labeling and segmentation.
    Second, we report the best current results for the widely used test collections described above.
    Third, we confirm that the use of more unlabeled data in SSL can really lead to further improvements.
  
  
    We design our model for SSL as a natural semisupervised extension of conventional supervised conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001).
    As our approach for incorporating unlabeled data, we basically follow the idea proposed in (Suzuki et al., 2007).
