is a segmentation of the Segment boundaries form a grid over the bitext space.
    Each cell in the grid represents the product of two segments, one from each half of the bitext.
    A point of correspondence inside cell (X,y) indicates that some token in segment X corresponds with some token in segment y; i.e., the segments X and y correspond.
    So, for example, segment E corresponds with segment d. The aligned blocks are outlined with solid lines. two texts such that the nth segment of one text is the translation of the nth segment of the other&amp;quot; (Simard, Foster, and Isabelle 1992, 68).
    For example, given the token correspondences in Figure 10, the segment (G,H) should be aligned with the segment (e,f).
    If segments (Xi, &#8226; &#8226; ,X) align with segments (y1, .. &#8226; , yn ), then (0(1, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; ,X,), (y1, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; is an aligned block.
    In geometric terms, aligned blocks are rectangular regions of the bitext space, such that the sides of the rectangl
