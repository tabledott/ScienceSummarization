t is considered small by NLP standards.
    Many of the available corpora contain over 1 million words.
    As the size of the corpus increases, so does the number of rules and the additional memory space required. state change per sample.
    In other words, at most one rule is allowed to apply to each sample.
    This mode of application is similar to that of a decision list (Rivest, 1987), where an sample is modified by the first rule that applies to it, and not modified again thereafter.
    In general, this assumption will hold for problems which have high initial accuracy and where state changes are infrequent.
    The ICA system was designed and tested on the task of part-of-speech tagging, achieving an impressive reduction in training time while suffering only a small decrease in accuracy.
    The experiments presented in Section 4 include ICA in the training time and performance comparisons&#65533;.
    Samuel (1998) proposed a Monte Carlo approach to transformation-based learning, in which only a fr
