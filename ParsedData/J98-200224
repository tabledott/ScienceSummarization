    , ml, MLE estimates parameter P. which maximizes the likelihood with respect to the data; that is: It is easy to see that P also satisfies: = arg E _ log P( (14) This is nothing but the MDL estimate in this case, since - log P(xi) is the data description length.
    When the estimation problem involves model selection, i.e., the choice of a tree cut in the present context, MDL's behavior significantly deviates from that of MLE.
    This is because MDL insists on minimizing the sum total of the data description length and the model description length, while MLE is still equivalent to minimizing the data description length only.
    So, for our problem of estimating a tree cut model, MDL tends to select a model that is reasonably simple yet fits the data quite well, whereas the model selected by MLE will be a word-based model (or a tree cut model equivalent to the word-based moder), as it will always manage to fit the data.
    In statistical terms, the superiority of MDL as an estimation method is relat
