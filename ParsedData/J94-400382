y these models.
    21 Once the important information sources for sense selection have been identified, it is possible that different decision algorithms would achieve comparable results.
    The differences between various disambiguation methods correlate with the difference in information sources, in particular, whether they use local or global context.
    When local context is used, only few syntactically related informants may provide reliable information about the selection.
    It is therefore reasonable to base the selection on only one, the most informative informant, and it is also important to test the statistical significance of that informant.
    The problem of parameter explosion is less severe, and the number of parameters is comparable to that of a bi-gram language model (and even smaller).
    When using the global context, on the other hand, the number of potential parameters is significantly larger, but each of them is usually less informative.
    It is therefore important to take into ac
