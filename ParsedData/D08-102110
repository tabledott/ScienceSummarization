example of the refined paraphrases for equal when it occurs as an adjective or adjectival phrase.
    Note that most of the paraphrases that were possible under the baseline model (Table 1) are now excluded.
    We no longer get the noun equality, the verb equals, the adverb equally, the determier the or the NP equal rights.
    The paraphrases seem to be higher quality, especially if one considers their fidelity when they replace the original phrase in the context of some sentence.
    We tested the rate of paraphrases that were suband super-strings when we constrain paraphrases based on non-terminal nodes in parse trees.
    The percent of the best paraphrases being substrings dropped from 73% to 24%, and the overall percent of paraphrases subsuming or being subsumed by the original phrase dropped from 34% to 12%.
    However, the number of phrases for which we were able to generated paraphrases dropped from 400,000 to 90,000, since we limited ourselves to phrases that were valid syntactic constituents.
