rsers from multiple source languages we can further reduce errors by 16% over the directly transferred English baseline.
    This is consistent with previous work on multilingual part-of-speech (Snyder et al., 2009) and grammar (Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein, 2010; Cohen and Smith, 2009) induction, that shows that adding languages leads to improvements.
    We present a comprehensive set of experiments on eight Indo-European languages for which a significant amount of parallel data exists.
    We make no language specific enhancements in our experiments.
    We report results for sentences of all lengths, as well as with gold and automatically induced part-of-speech tags.
    We also report results on sentences of length 10 or less with gold part-of-speech tags to compare with previous work.
    Our results consistently outperform the previous state-of-the-art across all languages and training configurations.
  
  
    In this paper we focus on transferring dependency parsers between languages.
