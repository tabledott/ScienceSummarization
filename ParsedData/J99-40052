d transformed.
    We then instantiate the model through training on a database of sample structures and transformations.
    Recently, Brown et al. (1993) built a source-channel model of translation between English and French.
    They assumed that English strings are produced according to some stochastic process (source model) and transformed stochastically into French strings (channel model).
    To translate French to English, it is necessary to find an English source string that is likely according to the models.
    With a nod to its cryptographic antecedents, this kind of translation is called decoding.
    This paper looks at decoding complexity.
  
  
    The prototype source-channel application in natural language is part-of-speech tagging (Church 1988).
    We review it here for purposes of comparison with machine translation.
    Source strings comprise sequences of part-of-speech tags like noun, verb, etc.
    A simple source model assigns a probability to a tag sequence ti tm based on the probab
