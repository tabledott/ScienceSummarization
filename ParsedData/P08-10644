tures prediction, given a source parse tree.
    Huang et al. (2006) study a TSG-based tree-to-string alignment model.
    Liu et al. (2006) propose a tree-to-string model.
    Zhang et al. (2007b) present a STSG-based tree-to-tree translation model.
    Bod (2007) reports that the unsupervised STSG-based translation model performs much better than the supervised one.
    The motivation behind all these work is to exploit linguistically syntactic structure features to model the translation process.
    However, most of them fail to utilize non-syntactic phrases well that are proven useful in the phrase-based methods (Koehn et al., 2003).
    The formally syntax-based model for SMT was first advocated by Wu (1997).
    Xiong et al. (2006) propose a MaxEnt-based reordering model for BTG (Wu, 1997) while Setiawan et al.
    (2007) propose a function word-based reordering model for BTG.
    Chiang (2005)&#8217;s hierarchal phrase-based model achieves significant performance improvement.
    However, no further si
