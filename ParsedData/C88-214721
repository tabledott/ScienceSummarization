eh pl represents a path of the form li,1 : li,z .
  : li,m re- ispectivel~y.
  This formula is interpreted as Pt .
  = p,, and is used to iexpress reentrancy.
  Our representation f feature structures imilar to the I/-K logies :representation f feature structures and differs only in the clause for reen- ]traney.
  Given that we want to represent the grammar itself in our cMcu- lus, we call not represent reentrancy by a finite set of paths.
  For example, suppose we wish to mate that agreement features of a verb matches with ,that of its subject (note in a TAG the verb and its subject are in the same elementary tree), tile two paths to be identified can not be stated until we obtain the final derived tree.
  To avoid this problem, we use a set of equations to specify the reentrancy.
  The set of equations have the form given by xi = ei for 1 &lt; i &lt; n, where ~1,... ,xn are variables, el , .
  ,en !are formulae which could involve these variables.
