esults are essentially based on the output of sentence parsing, which is a deep processing of text.
    So their approaches are vulnerable to errors in parsing.
    Collins et al. (1997) addressed a simplified task within a confined context in a target sentence.
    Zelenko et al. (2003) described a recursive kernel based on shallow parse trees to detect personaffiliation and organization-location relations, in which a relation example is the least common subtree containing two entity nodes.
    The kernel matches nodes starting from the roots of two subtrees and going recursively to the leaves.
    For each pair of nodes, a subsequence kernel on their child nodes is invoked, which matches either contiguous or non-contiguous subsequences of node.
    Compared with full parsing, shallow parsing is more reliable.
    But this model is based solely on the output of shallow parsing so it is still vulnerable to irrecoverable parsing errors.
    In their experiments, incorrectly parsed sentences were eliminated.
