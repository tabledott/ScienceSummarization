senses for word w): Patwardhan et al. (2003) convert this distance metric into a similarity measure by taking its multiplicative inverse.
    Their implementation was used in the experiments described later.
    As mentioned above, the second part of a pattern element-filler pair can be either a lexical item or a semantic category, such as company.
    The identifiers used to denote these categories, i.e.
    COMPANY, do not appear in WordNet and so it is not possible to directly compare their similarity with other lexical items.
    To avoid this problem these tokens are manually mapped onto the most appropriate node in the WordNet hierarchy which is then used for similarity calculations.
    This mapping process is not particularly time-consuming since the number of named entity types with which a corpus is annotated is usually quite small.
    For example, in the experiments described in this paper just seven semantic classes were sufficient to annotate the corpus.
    This pattern similarity measure can b
