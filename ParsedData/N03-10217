-L2MTG(2).
    R2D2A is with &amp;quot;seed&amp;quot; items, illustrated in Figure 2.
    A one-dimensional seed is put in the chart for every word in every component of the input.
    After initialization, the parser can translational equivalence between seeds components by firing Y inference rules: &#8212;1 &#8212;1 hi i2 inference rules infer rules.
    Each two-dimensional instantiation expresses the equivalence of two word tokens, at positions and in their respective components.
    One-dimensional Y inferences assert that a word vanishes in translation.

    A bottom-up synchronous parser composes multi-dimensional items until it infers an item that covers the multitext space spanned by the input multitext.
    The items composed by synchronous parsers are called
