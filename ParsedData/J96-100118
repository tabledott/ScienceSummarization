    The constraint is between the verb and its object and any number of words may occur between these two elements (e.g., You will be setting a gorgeously decorated and lavishly appointed table designed for a king).
    Collocations also include rigid groups of words that do not change from one context to another, such as compounds, as in Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
    To understand the difficulties that collocations pose for translation, consider sentences (le) and (10 in Figure 1.
    Although these sentences are relatively simple, automatically translating (le) as (10 involves several problems.
