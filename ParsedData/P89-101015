association ratio can also be used to search for interesting lexico-syntactic relationships between verbs and typical arguments/adjuncts.
    The proposed association ratio can be viewed as a formalization of Sinclair's argument: &amp;quot;How common are the phrasal verbs with set?
    Set is particularly rich in making combinations with words like about. in. up, out. on, off, and these words are themselves very common.
    How likely is set off to occur?
    Both are frequent words; (set occurs approximately 250 times in a million words and) off occurs approximately 556 times in a million words... [The question we are asking can be roughly rephrased as follows: how likely is off to occur immediately after set?
    ...
    This is 0.00025 x0.00055 [P(s) P(y)], which gives us the tiny figure of 0.0000001375 ...
    The assumption behind this calculation is that the words are distributed at random in a text [at chance, in our terminology).
    It is obvious to a linguist that this is not so, and a rough measure
