system that we developed (Section 6), review other systems that perform similar tasks (Section 7), and present our conclusions and indicate future work (Section 8).
  
  
    As mentioned above, the architecture of our system is motivated by the results concerning definite description use in our corpus, discussed in Poesio and Vieira (1998).
    In this section we briefly review the results presented in that paper.
    2 in fact, it is precisely because we are interested in identifying the types of commonsense reasoning actually used in language processing that we focused on definite descriptions rather than on other types of anaphoric expressions (such as pronouns and ellipsis) that can be processed much more effectively on the basis of syntactic information alone (Lappin and Leass 1994; Hardt 1997).
