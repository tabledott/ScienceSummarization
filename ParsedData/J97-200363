e interesting applications in speech recognition, some of which we briefly point out below.
    String-to-weight transducers are found at several stages of speech recognition.
    Phone lattices, language models, and word lattices are typically represented by such transducers.
    Weights in these graphs correspond to negative logarithms of probabilities.
    They are added along a path.
    For a given string, there might be many different paths in a transducer.
    Only the minimum of the total weights of these paths is considered relevant.
    Thus, the main operations involved in the interpretation of these transducers are addition and min, namely those of the tropical semiring.
    Thus, the algorithms we defined in the previous sections apply to speech recognition.
    The domain of the speech recognition systems above signal processing can be represented by a composition of finite-state transducers outputting weights, or both strings and weights (Pereira and Riley 1996; Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1996):
