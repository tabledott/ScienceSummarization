irst is the grandparent of the second.
    And in pure dependency parsing without nonterminal symbols, every reduction requires that one of the tokens reduced is the head of the other(s).
    This holds necessarily, regardless of the algorithm used, and is the reason why it is impossible to achieve strict incrementality in dependency parsing as defined here.
    However, it is worth noting that (2&#8211;3), which are the mirror images of (6&#8211;7) can be parsed incrementally, even though they contain adjacent tokens that are not linked by a single arc.
    The reason is that in (2&#8211;3) the reduction of the first two tokens makes the third token adjacent to the first.
    Thus, the defining characteristic of the problematic structures is that precisely the leftmost tokens are not linked directly.
    The case of (1) is different in that here the problem is caused by the strict bottom-up strategy, which requires each token to have found all its dependents before it is combined with its head.
    For left-
