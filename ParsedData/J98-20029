    In generalizing a given noun n to a noun class, this method selects the noun class C having the maximum A(C I v, r), among all super classes of n in a given thesaurus.
    This method is based on an interesting intuition, but its interpretation as a method of estimation is not clear.
    We propose a class-based generalization method whose performance as a method of estimation is guaranteed to be near optimal.
    We define the class-based model as a model that consists of a partition of the set fsf of nouns, and a parameter associated with each member of the partition.
    Here, a partition F of .AT is any collection of mutually disjoint subsets of .N that exhaustively cover N'.
    The parameters specify the conditional probability P(C I v, r) for each class Within a given class C, it is assumed that each noun is generated with equal probability, namely Here, we assume that a word belongs to a single class.
    In practice, however, many words have sense ambiguity and a word can belong to several
