span can be resolved during decoding rather than when constructing the system.

    Arabic morphological variation.
    Arabic orthography is problematic for lexical and phrase-based MT approaches since a large class of functional elements (prepositions, pronouns, tense markers, conjunctions, definiteness markers) are attached to their host stems.
    Thus, while the training data may provide good evidence for the translation of a particular stem by itself, the same stem may not be attested when attached to a particular conjunction.
    The general solution taken is to take the best possible morphological analysis of the text (it is often ambiguous whether a piece of a word is part of the stem or merely a neighboring functional element), and then make a subset of the bound functional elements in the language into freestanding tokens.
