pnik, 1995; Vapnik, 1998) and Boosting(Freund and Schapire, 1996) have been proposed.
    These techniques take a strategy that maximizes the margin between critical samples and the separating hyperplane.
    In particular, SVMs achieve high generalization even with training data of a very high dimension.
    Furthermore, by introducing the Kernel function, SVMs handle non-linear feature spaces, and carry out the training considering combinations of more than one feature.
    In the field of natural language processing, SVMs are applied to text categorization and syntactic dependency structure analysis, and are reported to have achieved higher accuracy than previous approaches.
    (Joachims, 1998; Taira and Haruno, 1999; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000a).
    In this paper, we apply Support Vector Machines to the chunking task.
    In addition, in order to achieve higher accuracy, we apply weighted voting of 8 SVM-based systems which are trained using distinct chunk representations.
    For the weighted voting syst
