  An Algebra For Semantic Construction In Constraint-Based Grammars
  
    We develop a framework for formalizing semantic construction within grammars expressed in typed feature struclogics, including The approach provides an alternative to the lambda calculus; it maintains much of the desirable flexibility of unificationbased approaches to composition, while constraining the allowable operations in order to capture basic generalizations and improve maintainability.
  
  
    Some constraint-based grammar formalisms incorporate both syntactic and semantic representations within the same structure.
    For instance, Figure 1 shows representations of typed feature structures (TFSs) for Kim, sleeps and the phrase Kim sleeps, in an HPSG-like representation, loosely based on Sag and Wasow (1999).
    The semantic representation expressed is intended to be equivalent to r name(x, Kim) &#8743; sleep(e, x).1 Note: A similar approach has been used in a large number of implemented grammars (see Shieber (1986) for a f
