ng sequence of words, there is considerable ambiguity in the placement of boundaries.
    Interpreting a text as a sequence of words is beneficial for some information retrieval and storage tasks: for example, full-text search, word-based compression, and key phrase extraction.
    We describe a scheme that infers appropriate positions for word boundaries using an adaptive language model that is standard in text compression.
    It is trained on a corpus of presegmented text, and when applied to new text, interpolates word boundaries so as to maximize the compression obtained.
    This simple and general method performs well with respect to specialized schemes for Chinese language segmentation.
  
  
    Languages such as Chinese and Japanese are written without using any spaces or other word delimiters (except for punctuation marks)&#8212;indeed, the Western notion of a word boundary is literally alien (Wu 1998).
    Nevertheless, words are present in these languages, and Chinese words often comprise several
