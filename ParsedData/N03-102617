nd Marcu (2000), which were provided to us by Daniel Marcu.
    These data consist of pairs of sentences and their condensed versions that have been extracted from computer-news articles and abstracts of the Ziff-Davis corpus.
    Out of these data, we parsed and manually disambiguated 500 sentence pairs.
    These included a set of 32 sentence pairs that were used for testing purposes in Knight and Marcu (2000).
    In order to control for the small corpus size of this test set, we randomly extracted an additional 32 sentence pairs from the 500 parsed and disambiguated examples as a second test set.
    The rest of the 436 randomly selected sentence pairs were used to create training data.
    For the purpose of discriminative training, a gold-standard of transferred f-structures was created from the transfer output and the manually selected f-structures for the condensed strings.
    This was done automatically by selecting for each example the transferred f-structure that best matched the fstructure annota
