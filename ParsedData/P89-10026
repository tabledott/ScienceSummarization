)/loves(john, mary)&#8212;in the course of which the variable NP will become bound so that the generation from np/NP will terminate.
    Wedekind (1988) achieves this goal by expanding first nodes that are connected, that is, whose semantics is instantiated.
    Since the NP is not connected in this sense, but the VP is, the latter will be expanded first.
    In essence, the technique is a kind of goal freezing (Colmerauer, 1982) or implicit wail declaration (Naish, 1986).
    For cases in which the a priori ordering of goals is insufficient, Dymetman and Isabelle also introduce goal freezing to control expansion.
    Although vastly superior to the naive top-down algorithm, even this sort of amended top-down approach to generation based on goal freezing under one guise or another fails to terminate with certain linguistically plausible analyses.
    For example, the &amp;quot;complements&amp;quot; rule given by Shieber (1985a, pages 77-78) in the PATR-II formalism can be encoded as the DCG-style rule:
