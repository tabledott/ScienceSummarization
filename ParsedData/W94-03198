eoretically motivated researchers have disagreed with.
    It furthermore examines the plausibility of these decisions from a psycholinguistic perspective, and argues that in many respects they agree with what is known about how humans generate text.
    The consensus architecture divides the generation process into multiple modules, with information flowing in a 'pipeline' fashion from one module to the next.
    By pipeline, I mean that the modules are arranged in a linear order, and each module receives information only from its predecessor (and the various linguistic and domain knowledge bases), and sends information only to its successor.
    Information does not flow 'backwards' from a module to its predecessor, and global 'blackboards' that all modules can access and modify are not used.
    I do not mean by 'pipeline' that generation must be incremental in the sense that, say, syntactic processing of the first sentence is done at the same time as semantic processing of the second; I believe most of th
