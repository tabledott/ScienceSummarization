successive levels of representation.
    With each level of representation is associated a component which transforms the representation into the next higher level.
    Each component is implemented as a separate module in Joyce. words of a sentence.
    Sister nodes are unordered with respect to each other.
    The nodes are labelled with lexemes which are annotated with features.
    Numerical arc labels represent the syntactic arguments of the governing lexeme, while ATTR represents the attributive relation.
    An example is shown in Figure 6.
    Note that the function words the, is, to are not yet represented. the written form of the English sentence.
    Morphological processing is done by a component closely based on SUTRA-S (Emele and Momma 1985).
    While linguistic realizers based on other theories coulc have been used, this MTT-based approach offers the following advantages:
  
  
    As an example, consider the sample text in Figure 4.
