only 5 seed words per category worked quite well.
    As an example, the seed word lists used in our experiments are shown below.
    Energy: fuel gas gasoline oil power Financial: bank banking currency dollar money Military: army commander infantry soldier troop Vehicle: airplane car jeep plane truck Weapon: bomb dynamite explosives gun rifle The input to our system is a text corpus and an initial set of seed words for each category.
    Ideally, the text corpus should contain many references to the category.
    Our approach is designed for domainspecific text processing, so the text corpus should be a representative sample of texts for the domain and the categories should be semantic classes associated with the domain.
    Given a text corpus and an initial seed word list for a category C, the algorithm for building a semantic lexicon is as follows: The context windows do not cut across sentence boundaries.
    Note that our context window is much narrower than those used by other researchers (Yarowsky, 19
