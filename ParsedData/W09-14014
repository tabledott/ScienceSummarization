 their importance and the number of annotated instances in the GENIA corpus.
    The selected event types all concern protein biology, implying that they take proteins as their theme.
    The first three types concern protein metabolism, i.e. protein production and breakdown.
    Phosphorylation is a representative protein modification event, and Localization and Binding are representative fundamental molecular events.
    Regulation (including its sub-types, Positive and Negative regulation) represents regulatory events and causal relations.
    The last five are universal but frequently occur on proteins.
    For the biological interpretation of the event types, readers are referred to Gene Ontology (GO) and the GENIA ontology.
    The failure of p65 translocation to the nucleus ... As shown in Table 1, the theme or themes of all events are considered primary arguments, that is, arguments that are critical to identifying the event.
    For regulation events, the entity or event stated as the cause of the re
