ns tend to be evoked simultaneously by a term.
    Observe that anger terms tend also to be evocative of disgust.

    Observe that the percentages for trust and joy are much lower.
    On the other hand, positive words evoke anticipation, joy, and trust.
    In order to analyze how often the annotators agreed with each other, for each term&#8211;emotion pair, we calculated the percentage of times the majority class has size 5 (all Turkers agree), size 4 (all but one agree), size 3, and size 2.
    Observe that for more than 50% of the terms, at least four annotators agree with each other.
    Table 5 presents these agreement values.
    Since many NLP systems may rely only on two intensity values (evocative or non-evocative), we also calculate agreement at that level (Table
