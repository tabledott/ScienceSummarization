 (si), as shown in Figure 3, where PrNB sub (s) denotes Naive Bayes&#8217; estimate of the probability that sentence s is subjective; or, we can use the weights produced by the SVM classifier instead.7 If we set all the association scores to zero, then the minimum-cut classification of the sentences is the same as that of the basic subjectivity detector.
    Alternatively, we incorporate the degree of proximity between pairs of sentences, controlled by three parameters.
    The threshold T specifies the maximum distance two sentences can be separated by and still be considered proximal.
    The and ind2(si) = 1 &#8722; ind1(si).
    Note that scaling is employed only for consistency; the algorithm itself does not require probabilities for individual scores. non-increasing function f(d) specifies how the influence of proximal sentences decays with respect to distance d; in our experiments, we tried f(d) = 1, e1&#8722;d, and 1/d2.
    The constant c controls the relative influence of the association scores: a l
