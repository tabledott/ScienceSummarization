ate a particular choice of model and training regime.
    It can be tricky and time-consuming to adapt an existing supervised NLP system to use these semi-supervised techniques.
    It is preferable to use a simple and general method to adapt existing supervised NLP systems to be semi-supervised.
    One approach that is becoming popular is to use unsupervised methods to induce word features&#8212;or to download word features that have already been induced&#8212;plug these word features into an existing system, and observe a significant increase in accuracy.
    But which word features are good for what tasks?
    Should we prefer certain word features?
    Can we combine them?
    A word representation is a mathematical object associated with each word, often a vector.
    Each dimension&#8217;s value corresponds to a feature and might even have a semantic or grammatical interpretation, so we call it a word feature.
    Conventionally, supervised lexicalized NLP approaches take a word and convert it to a sym
