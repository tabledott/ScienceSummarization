			Once a SAPT is generated, an additional step is required totranslate it into a final formal meaning representa tion (MR).
			Our approach is implemented in a system called SCISSOR (Semantic Composition that IntegratesSyntax and Semantics to get Optimal Representations).
			Training the system requires sentences an notated with both gold-standard SAPT?s and MR?s. We present experimental results on corpora for bothgeography-database querying and Robocup coaching demonstrating that SCISSOR produces more accurate semantic representations than several previ ous approaches based on symbolic learning (Tang and Mooney, 2001; Kate et al, 2005).
	
	
			We used two MRLs in our experiments: CLANG and GEOQUERY.
			They capture the meaning of linguistic utterances in their domain in a formal language.
