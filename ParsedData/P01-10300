  Fast Decoding And Optimal Decoding For Machine Translation
  
    A good decoding algorithm is critical to the success of any statistical machine translation system.
    The decoder&#8217;s job is to find the translation that is most likely according to set of previously learned parameters (and a formula for combining them).
    Since the space of possible translations is extremely large, typical decoding algorithms are only able to examine a portion of it, thus risking to miss good solutions.
    In this paper, we compare the speed and output quality of a traditional stack-based decoding algorithm with two new decoders: a fast greedy decoder and a slow but optimal decoder that treats decoding as an integer-programming optimization problem.
  
  
    A statistical MT system that translates (say) French sentences into English, is divided into three parts: (1) a language model (LM) that assigns a probability P(e) to any English string, (2) a translation model (TM) that assigns a probability P(fe) to any pair
