l benefits of human feedback still need to be investigated.
    After several iterations, the seed word list typically contains many relevant category words.
    But more importantly, the ranked list contains many additional category words, especially near the top.
    The number of iterations can make a big difference in the quality of the ranked list.
    Since new seed words are generated dynamically without manual review, the quality of the ranked list can deteriorate rapidly when too many non-category words become seed words.
    In our experiments, we found that about eight iterations usually worked well.
    The output of the system is the ranked list of nouns after the final iteration.
    The seed word list is thrown away.
    Note that the original seed words were already known to be category members, and the new seed words are already in the ranked list because that is how they were selected.2 Finally, a user must review the ranked list and identify the words that are true category members.
