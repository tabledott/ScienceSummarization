random binarybranching structure with final punctuation always attached high.
    The next stage involves learning a set of transformations that can be applied to the output of the naive parser to make these sentences better conform to the proper structure specified in the training corpus.
    The list of possible transformation types is prespecified.
    Transformations involve making a simple change triggered by a simple environment.
    In the current implementation, there are twelve allowable transformation types: To carry out a transformation by adding or deleting a parenthesis, a number of additional simple changes must take place to preserve balanced parentheses and binary branching.
    To give an example, to delete a left paren in a particular environment, the following operations take place (assuming, of course, that there is a left paren to delete): 4.
    Add a right paren to the right of the constituent immediately to the right of the deleted left paren.
    5.
    If there is no constituent imme
