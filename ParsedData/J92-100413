g by counting all pairs from the particular left-sibling to any right sibling.5 Two distinguished nodes, a [start] node and an [end] node, are included among the children of every grammar node.
    A subset of the grammar nodes are terminal nodes whose children are a list of vocabulary words.
    This process can be illustrated with the use of a simple example.6 Suppose there exists a grammar for noun phrases that can be expressed through the single compact rule form: [NP] [article] ([adjective]) ([adjective]) [noun] where the parentheses signify optional nodes.
    This grammar would be converted to a network as shown in Figure 1, which would be stored as a single grammar node with the name [NP].
    The resulting grammar could be used to parse the set of phrases shown on the left, each of which would generate the corresponding rule shown on the right.
    &amp;quot;the boy&amp;quot; [NPI = [article] [noun] &amp;quot;a beautiful town&amp;quot; [NP] = [article] [adjective] [noun] &amp;quot;a cute little baby&
