p froln given sentence patterns to sim- pler sentences patterns.
  These rules are repeat - edly applied on each sentence until they do not apply any more.
  For example, the sentence (3) with a relative clause can be simplified into two sentences (4).
  (3) Talwinder Singh, who masterminded the Kanishka crash in 198~, was killed in a fierce lwo-honr e~.connter... (4) Talwindcr Singh was killed in a .fierce two-hoar cncounler ... Talwinder Siugh masterminded the Kanishka crash in 198~.
  3 FSG based Simplification (Chandrasekar, 1994) discusses an approach that uses a FSG for text simplification as part of a machine aided translation prototype named Vaakya.
  In this approach, we consider sentences to be composed of sequence of word groups, or chunks.
  Chunk boundaries are regarded as poten- tial articulation-points.
  Chunking allows us to de- fine the syntax of a sentence and the structure of simplification rules at a coarser granularity, since we need no longer be concerned with the internal structure of
