vely labeled antecedent (Ng and Cardie, 2002b).
    This line of work has largely ignored the implicit transitivity of the decisions made, and can result in unintuitive chains such as the Smith chain just described, where each pairwise decision is sensible, but the final result is not.
    Ng and Cardie (2002a) and Ng (2004) highlight the problem of determining whether or not common noun phrases are anaphoric.
    They use two classifiers, an anaphoricity classifier, which decides if a mention should have an antecedent and a pairwise classifier similar those just discussed, which are combined in a cascaded manner.
    More recently, Denis and Baldridge (2007) utilized an integer linear programming (ILP) solver to better combine the decisions made by these two complementary classifiers, by finding the globally optimal solution according to both classifiers.
    However, when encoding constraints into their ILP solver, they did not enforce transitivity.
    The goal of the present work is simply to show that tr
