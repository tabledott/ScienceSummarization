We insert endmarkers at the beginning and end of the corpus and between sentence boundaries, and constrain the estimators to associate endmarkers with a special HMM state that never appears elsewhere in the corpus (we ignore these endmarkers during evaluation).
    This means that we can formally treat the training corpus as one long string, yet each sentence can be processed independently by a firstorder HMM.
    In more detail, the HMM is specified by a pair of multinomials &#952;t and &#966;t associated with each state t, where &#952;t specifies the distribution over states t0 following t and &#966;t specifies the distribution over words w given state t. The Bayesian model we consider here puts a fixed uniform Dirichlet prior on these multinomials.
    Because Dirichlets are conjugate to multinomials, this greatly simplifies inference.
    A multinomial &#952; is distributed according to the Dirichlet distribution Dir(&#945;) iff: In our experiments we set &#945; and &#945;0 to the uniform values (i.e., al
