rding to qi.
    Intuitively, the problem is this: The distribution qi assigns too little weight to trees x1 and x2, and too much weight to the &amp;quot;missing&amp;quot; trees; call them x5 and x6.
    Yet exactly the same rules are used in x5 and x6 as are used in x1 and x2.
    Hence there is no way to increase the weight for trees x1 and x2, improving their fit to /5, without simultaneously increasing the weight for x5 and x6, making their fit to 13 worse.
    The distribution qi is the best compromise possible.
    To say it another way, our assumption that the corpus was generated by a contextfree grammar means that any context dependencies in the corpus must be accidental, the result of sampling noise.
    There is indeed a dependency in the corpus in Figure 3: in the trees where there are two A's, the A's always rewrite the same way.
    If the corpus was generated by a stochastic context-free grammar, then this dependency is accidental.
    This does not mean that the context-free assumption is wron
