o derivations.
			The nodes of the productions which cover a marked word in the incorrect derivationbut not in the correct derivation are used to col lect negative examples.
			In the example, the node ?(TRAVERSE?traverse,[1..7])?
			will be used to collect a negative example (i.e. the words 1to 7 ??which rivers run through the states bordering?
			will be a negative example for the production TRAVERSE?traverse) because the pro duction covers the marked words ?the?, ?states?
			and ?bordering?
			in the incorrect derivation butnot in the correct derivation.
			With this as a neg ative example, hopefully in the next iteration, theprobability of this derivation will decrease significantly and drop below the probability of the cor rect derivation.
			In each iteration, the positive examples from the previous iteration are first removed so thatnew positive examples which lead to better cor rect derivations can take their place.
			However,negative examples are accumulated across iterations for better accuracy bec
