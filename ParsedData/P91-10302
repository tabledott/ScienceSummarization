al parse.
    Still, one can ask what information is relevant to determining a final parse, and it seems that in this domain structure-based disambiguation is not a very good predictor.
    A recent study of attachment of prepositional phrases in a sample of written responses to a &amp;quot;Wizard of Oz&amp;quot; travel information experiment shows that neither Right Association nor Minimal Attachment account for more than 55% of the cases (Whittemore et al. 1990).
    And experiments by Taraban and McClelland (1988) show that the structural models are not in fact good predictors of people's behavior in resolving ambiguity.
  
  
    Whittemore et al. (1990) found lexical preferences to be the key to resolving attachment ambiguity.
    Similarly, Taraban and McClelland found lexical content was key in explaining people's behavior.
    Various previous proposals for guiding attachment disambiguation by the lexical content of specific words have appeared (e.g.
    Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan 1982; Marcus 1980).
