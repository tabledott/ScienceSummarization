28 BLEU, which shows that on the sentences where all elements are in vocabulary, there MaxMatch is still significantly better than CharBased.
    Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is refuted.
    Analysis We hypothesized in Hypothesis 1 that the phrase table in a phrase-based MT system should be able to capture the meaning by building &#8220;phrases&#8221; on top of character sequences.
    Based on the experimental result in Table 1, we see that using characterbased segmentation (CharBased) actually performs reasonably well, which indicates that the phrase table does capture the meaning of character sequences to a certain extent.
    However, the results also show that there is still some benefit in having word segmentation for MT.
    We analyzed the decoded output of both systems (CharBased and MaxMatch) on the development set (MT03).
    We found that the advantage of MaxMatch over CharBased is two-fold, (i) lexical: it enhances the ability to disambiguate the case when a character has very different meaning in dif
