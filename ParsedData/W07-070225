he target shows the most improvement, especially when using targeted manual evaluation.
			How ever, this effect seems to be largely due to improvedlocal reordering.
			Reordering improvements can per haps be more reliably made using better reordering models or larger, more powerful language models.
			A further consideration is that supertags will always be limited to the few languages for which there are treebanks.
			Syntactic information represents embedded structures which are naturally incorporated intogrammar-based models.
			The ability of a flat struc tured model to leverage this information seems to be limited.
			CCG supertags?
			ability to guide translation would be enhanced if the constraints encoded in the tags were to be enforced using combinatory operators.
