ilable even in simpler sentences.
    This renders (2) syntactically ambiguous.
    The practical problem of &amp;quot;extra&amp;quot; parses in (2) becomes exponentially worse for longer strings, which can have up to a Catalan number of parses.
    An exhaustive parser serves up 252 CCG parses of (3), which must be sifted through, at considerable cost, in order to identify the two distinct meanings for further processing.'
    This paper presents a simple and flexible CCG parsing technique that prevents any such explosion of redundant CCG derivations.
    In particular, it is proved in &#167;4.2 that the method constructs exactly one syntactic structure per semantic reading&#8212;e.g., just two parses for (3).
    All other parses are suppressed by simple normal-form constraints that are enforced throughout the parsing process.
    This approach works because CCG's spurious ambiguities arise (as is shown) in only a small set of circumstances.
    Although similar work has been attempted in the past, with var
