e and the set of dependency triples extracted from (la) are shown in (lb).
    There are about 80 million dependency relationships in the parsed corpus.
    The frequency counts of dependency relationships are filtered with the loglikelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).
    We call a dependency relationship a collocation if its log-likelihood ratio is greater than a threshold (0.5).
    The number of unique collocations in the resulting database2 is about 11 million.
    Using the similarity measure proposed in (Lin, 1998), we constructed a corpus-based thesaurus3 consisting of 11839 nouns, 3639 verbs and 5658 adjective/adverbs which occurred in the corpus at least 100 times.
  
  
    We define the probability space to consist of all possible collocation triples.
    We use is ft 14I to denote the frequency count of all the collocations that match the pattern (H R M), where H and M are either words or the wild card (*) and R is either a dependency type or the wild card.
    For example, To compute the mutual infor
