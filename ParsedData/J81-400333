    David Warren and Michael McCord read drafts of this paper, and their comments led to many improvements, both in content and in form.
    The comments of the referees were also very useful.
    A British Council Fellowship partly supported my work in this subject.
    The computing facilities I used to experiment with XGs and to prepare this paper were made available by British Science Research Council grants.
