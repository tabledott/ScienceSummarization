odel: Obviously, we can perform the same step for translation models with an even richer set of hidden variables than only the alignment aJ1.
  
  
    In this section, we describe methods for learning the single-word and phrase-based translation lexica that are the basis of the machine translation system described in Section 4.
    First, we introduce the basic concepts of statistical alignment models, which are used to learn word alignment.
    Then, we describe how these alignments can be used to learn bilingual phrasal translations.
    In (statistical) alignment models Pr(f J 1,aJ 1 eI1), a &#8220;hidden&#8221; alignment a = aJ1 is introduced that describes a mapping from a source position j to a target position aj.
    The relationship between the translation model and the alignment model is given by The alignment aJ1 may contain alignments aj = 0 with the &#8220;empty&#8221; word e0 to account for source words that are not aligned with any target word.
    In general, the statistical model depends on a
