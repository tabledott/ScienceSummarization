 work is not concerned with the use of such additional knowledge. split the corpus into training, development and test data as shown in Table 6, and use the head-finding rules in Table 8 in the Appendix to turn the bracketed sentences into dependency structures.
    Most of the head-finding rules are from Sun and Jurafsky (2004), while we added rules to handle NN and FRAG, and a default rule to use the rightmost node as the head for the constituent that are not listed.
    Like Duan et al. (2007), we use gold-standard POS-tags for the input.
    The parsing accuracy is evaluated by the percentage of non-root words that have been assigned the correct head, the percentage of correctly identified root words, and the percentage of complete matches, all excluding punctuation.
    The accuracies are shown in Table 7.
    Rows &#8220;Graph [MA]&#8221;, &#8220;Transition&#8221;, &#8220;Combined [TM]&#8221; and &#8220;Combined [TMA]&#8221; show our models in the same way as for the English experiments from Section 5.2
