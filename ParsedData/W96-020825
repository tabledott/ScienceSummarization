    This paper has presented fairly comprehensive experiments comparing seven quite different empirical methods on learning to disambiguate words in context.
    Methods that employ a weighted combination of a large set of features, such as simple Bayesian and neural-network methods, were shown to perform better than alternative methods such as decision-tree, rule-based, and instancebased techniques on the problem of disambiguating the word &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; into one of six possible senses given the words that appear in the current and previous sentence as context.
    Although different learning algorithms can frequently perform quite similarly, they all have specific biases in their representation of concepts and therefore can illustrate both strengths and weaknesses in particular applications.
    Only rigorous experimental comparisons together with a qualitative analysis and explanation of their results can help determine the appropriate methods for pa
