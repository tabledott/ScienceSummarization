tandard data set, and SVMs require quadratic or more computational cost on the number of training examples.
    For the first impression, it may seems natural that higher accuracy is achieved with the probabilistic model, since all candidate dependency relations are used as training examples.
    However, the experimental results show that the cascaded chunking model performs better.
    Here we list what the most significant contributions are and how well the cascaded chunking model behaves compared with the probabilistic model.
    The probabilistic model is trained with all candidate pairs of segments in the training corpus.
    The problem of this training is that exceptional dependency relations may be used as training examples.
    For example, suppose a segment which appears to right hand side of the correct modifiee and has a similar content word, the pair with this segment becomes a negative example.
    However, this is negative because there is a better and correct candidate at a different point in
