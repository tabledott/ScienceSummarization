 for automation, at least for some classes of document.
    Nobody expects that automation will be applied in the foreseeable future for literary texts ranging over wide domains (e.g. novels).
    However, there is a mass of non-literary material in restricted domains for which automation is already a realistic aim: instructions for using equipment are a good example.
    The most direct attempt to automize multilingual document production is to replace the human translator by a machine.
