nsider the probabilities p(v  |ci, r) only.)
    Note that this procedure rests on the assumption that p(v  |c, r) is close to p(v  |c, r).
    (In fact, p(v  |c, r) is equal to p(v  |c, r) when c is a leaf node.)
    So when finding a suitable level for the estimation of p((sandwich)  |eat, obj), for example, we first assume that p(eat  |(sandwich), obj) is a good approximation of p(eat  |(sandwich), obj) and then apply the procedure to p(eat  |(sandwich), obj).
    A feature of the proposed generalization procedure is that comparing probabilities of the form p(v  |C, r), where C is a class, is closely related to comparing ratios of probabilities of the form p(C  |v,r)/p(C  |r) (for a given verb and argument position): Note that, for a given verb and argument position, p(v  |r) is constant across classes.
    Equation (10) is of interest because the ratio p(C  |v,r)/p(C  |r) can be interpreted as a measure of association between the verb v and class C. This ratio is similar to pointwise mutual information (C
