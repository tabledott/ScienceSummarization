h their particular algorithmic decisions.
    This flexibility is in sharp contrast to supervised classifiers that require their models to be retrained on labeled data, and unsupervised systems that do not offer a clear insertion point for new features.
    It can be difficult to fully understand how a system makes a single decision, but the sieve allows for flexible usage with minimal effort.
    Table 4 shows the number of incorrect pair-wise links generated by our system on the MUC6-TEST corpus.
    The table indicates that most of our errors are for nominal mentions.
    For example, the combined (precision plus recall) number of errors for proper or common noun mentions is three times larger than the number of errors made for pronominal mentions.
    The table also highlights that most of our errors are recall errors.
    There are eight times more recall errors than precision errors in our output.
    This is a consequence of our decision to prioritize highly precise features in the sieve.
    The above
