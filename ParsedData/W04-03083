combined with support vector machines, in a way that does not result in incremental processing.
    In this paper, we analyze the constraints on incrementality in deterministic dependency parsing and argue that strict incrementality is not achievable.
    We then analyze the algorithm proposed in Nivre (2003) and show that, given the previous result, this algorithm is optimal from the point of view of incrementality.
    Finally, we evaluate experimentally the degree of incrementality achieved with the algorithm in practical parsing.
  
  
    In a dependency structure, every word token is dependent on at most one other word token, usually called its head or regent, which means that the structure can be represented as a directed graph, with nodes representing word tokens and arcs representing dependency relations.
    In addition, arcs may be labeled with specific dependency types.
    Figure 1 shows a labeled dependency graph for a simple Swedish sentence, where each word of the sentence is labeled with its
