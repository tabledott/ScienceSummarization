 considerable work, and can make the resulting models quite complex.
			A second draw back of generative translation models is that, since they are learned with EM, they require extensive processing of large amounts of data to achieve good performance.
			While tools likeGIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) do make it eas ier to build on the long history of the generativeIBM approach, they also underscore how com plex high-performance generative models can, and have, become.In this paper, we present a discriminative ap proach to word alignment.
			Word alignment is cast as a maximum weighted matching problem (Cormen et al, 1990) in which each pair of words (e j , f k ) in a sentence pair (e, f) is associated with a score s jk (e, f) reflecting the desirability of the alignment of that pair.
			The alignment 73 for the sentence pair is then the highest scoring matching under some constraints, for example the requirement that matchings be one-to-one.
			This view of alignment as graph matching isnot, in itself, new: Mela
