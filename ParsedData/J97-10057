e machine learning to automatically construct segmentation algorithms from large feature sets.
    Our results suggest that it is possible to approach human levels of performance, given multiple knowledge sources.
    In Section 5, we discuss the significance of our results and briefly highlight our current directions.
  
  
    There is much debate about what to define discourse segments in terms of, and what kinds of relations to assign among segments.
    The nature of any hypothesized interaction between discourse structure and linguistic devices depends both on the model of discourse that is adopted, and on the types of linguistic devices that are investigated.
    Here we briefly review previous work on characterizing discourse segments, and on correlating discourse segments with utterance features.
    We conclude each review by summarizing the differences between our study and previous work.
    A number of alternative proposals have been presented, which relate segments to intentions (Grosz and Sidne
