generation is passed on to the next system component.
    In case of fragmentary input to the transfer component, grammaticaliy of the output is guaranteed for the separate fragments.
    In other words, strings generated from a reduced fragmentary f-structure will be as grammatical as the string that was fed into the parsing component.
    After filtering by the generator, the remaining fstructures were weighted by the stochastic disambiguation component.
    Similar to stochastic disambiguation for constraint-based parsing (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2002), an exponential (a.k.a. log-linear or maximumentropy) probability model on transferred structures is estimated from a set of training data.
    The data for estimation consists of pairs of original sentences y and goldstandard summarized f-structures s which were manually selected from the transfer output for each sentence.
    For training data I(sj, yj)Imj=1 and a set of possible summarized structures S(y) for each sentence y, the objective w
