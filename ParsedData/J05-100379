ced a new algorithm, based on boosting approaches in machine learning, for ranking problems in natural language processing.
    The approach gives a 13% relative reduction in error on parsing Wall Street Journal data.
    While in this article the experimental focus has been on parsing, many other problems in natural language processing or speech recognition can also be framed as reranking problems, so the methods described should be quite broadly applicable.
    The boosting approach to ranking has been applied to named entity segmentation (Collins 2002a) and natural language generation (Walker, Rambow, and Rogati 2001).
    The key characteristics of the approach are the use of global features and of a training criterion (optimization problem) that is discriminative and closely related to the task at hand (i.e., parse accuracy).
    In addition, the article introduced a new algorithm for the boosting approach which takes advantage of the sparse nature of the feature space in the parsing data that we use.
