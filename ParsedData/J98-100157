 seems to show that similarity-based methods perform better than class-based methods.
    Karov and Edelman (this volume) propose an extension to similarity-based methods by means of an iterative process at the learning stage, which gives results that are 92% accurate on four test words&#8212;approximately the same as the best results cited in the literature to date.
    These results are particularly impressive given that the training corpus contains only a handful of examples for each word, rather than the hundreds of examples required by most methods.
  
  
    We have already noted various problems faced in current WSD research related to specific methodologies.
    Here, we discuss issues and problems that all approaches to WSD must face and suggest some directions for further work.
    Context is the only means to identify the meaning of a polysemous word.
    Therefore, all work on sense disambiguation relies on the context of the target word to provide information to be used for its disambiguation.
