tree set.
    We focus on this difference between the tree sets of CFG's and IG's, and formalize the notion of dependence between paths in a tree set in Section 3.
    An IG can be viewed as a CFG in which each nonterminal is associated with a stack.
    Each production can push or pop symbols on the stack as can be seen in the following productions that generate tree of the form shown in Figure 4b.
    Gazdar (1985) argues that sharing of stacks can be used to give analyses for coordination.
    Analogous to the sharing of stacks in IC's, Lexical-Functional Grammar's (LFG's) use the unification of unbounded hierarchical structures.
    Unification is used in LFG's to produce structures having two dependent spines of unbounded length as in Figure 5.
    Bresnan, Kaplan, Peters, and Zaenen (1982) argue that these structures are needed to describe crossed-serial dependencies in Dutch subordinate clauses.
    Gazdar (1985) considers a restriction of IG's in which no more than one nonterminal on the right-hand-si
