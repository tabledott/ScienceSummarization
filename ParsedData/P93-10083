ion from the chart to be used for subsequent processing.
    Quantifier scoping rules are applied to this best interpretation to produce the final logical form, which is then used as input to a query-answering system.
    The following sections describe each of these components in detail, with the exception of the query-answering subsystem, which is not described in this paper.
    In our component-by-component view of Gemini, we provide detailed statistics on each component's size, speed, coverage, and accuracy.
    These numbers detail our performance on the subdomain of air-travel planning that is currently being used by the ARPA spoken language understanding community (MADCOW, 1992).
    Gemini was trained on a 5875-utterance dataset from this domain, with another 688 utterances used as a blind test (not explicitly trained on, but run multiple times) to monitor our performance on a dataset on which we did not train.
    We also report here our results on another 756-utterance fair test set that we ran onl
