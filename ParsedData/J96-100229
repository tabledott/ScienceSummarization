retend that the best model containing features S U f has the form The only parameter distinguishing models of the form (24) is a.
    Among these models, we are interested in the one that maximizes the approximate gain We will denote the gain of this model by and the optimal model by suf argmax Gs j (a) 19S,1 Despite the rather unwieldy notation, the idea is simple.
    Computing the approximate gain in likelihood from adding feature f to ps has been reduced to a simple onedimensional optimization problem over the single parameter a, which can be solved by any popular line-search technique, such as Newton's method.
    This yields a great savings in computational complexity over computing the exact gain, an n-dimensional The likelihood L(p) is a convex function of its parameters.
    If we start from a one-constraint model whose optimal parameter value is A = Ao and consider the increase in Lp(p) from adjoining a second constraint with the parameter a, the exact answer requires a search over (A, a).
