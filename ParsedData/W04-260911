We don&#8217;t consider metaphorical names (eg, &#8220;ladyfinger&#8221;), metonymies (eg, &#8220;Vietnam veteran&#8221;), proper names (eg, &#8220;John Doe&#8221;), and NPs with coordinate structures in which neither noun is the head (eg, &#8220;player-coach&#8221;).
    However, we check if the constructions are non-compositional (lexicalized) (the meaning is a matter of convention; e.g., &#8220;soap opera&#8221;, &#8220;sea lion&#8221;), but only for statistical purposes.
    Fortunately, some of these can be identified with the help of lexicons.
    In order to provide a unified approach for the detection of semantic relations at different NP levels, we analyzed the syntactic and semantic behavior of these constructions on a large open-domain corpora of examples.
    Our intention is to answer questions like: (1) What are the semantic relations encoded by the NP-level constructions?, (2) What is their distribution on a large corpus?, (3) Is there a common subset of semantic relations that can be fully par
