 Sparc 10 workstations).
    In contrast the new algorithm generally takes less than one minute&#8212;usually substantially less&#8212;with no special optimization of the code.
  
  
    We have introduced a new algorithm for the runtime optimization step in statistical machine translation systems, whose polynomial-time complexity addresses one of the primary obstacles to practicality facing statistical MT.
    The underlying model for the algorithm is a combination of the stochastic BTG and bigram models.
    The improvement in speed does not appear to impair accuracy significantly.
    We have implemented a version that accepts ITGs rather than BTGs, and plan to experiment with more heavily structured models.
    However, it is important to note that the search complexity rises exponentially rather than polynomially with the size of the grammar, just as for context-free parsing (Barton, Berwick, and Ristad, 1987).
    This is not relevant to the BTG-based model we have described since its grammar size is fi
