ion of Xtract at stage 2 was only about 40%.
    Although this would seem like a poor precision, one should compare it with the much lower rates currently in practice in lexicography.
    For compiling new entries for the OED, for example, the first stage roughly consists of reading numerous documents to identify new or interesting expressions.
    This task is performed by professional readers.
    For the OED, the readers for the American program alone produce some 10,000 expressions a month.
    These lists are then sent off to the dictionary and go through several rounds of careful analysis before actually being submitted to the dictionary.
    The ratio of proposed candidates to good candidates is usually low.
    For example, out of the 10,000 expressions proposed each month, fewer than 400 are serious candidates for the OED, which represents a current rate of 4%.
    Automatically producing lists of candidate expressions could actually be of great help to lexicographers, and even a precision of 40% wou
