is case is equal to the tree that on average contains the labeled dependencies that most systems voted for.

			The data used in the plot was the output of allcompeting systems for every language in the multilingual track.
			The plot was constructed by sorting the systems based on their average labeled accuracy scores over all languages, and then incremen tally adding each system in descending order.10 We can see that both labeled and unlabeled accuracy are significantly increased, even when just the top three systems are included.
