lass of the markable is C; else its semantic class is &amp;quot;unknown.&amp;quot; The semantic classes of markables i and j are in agreement if one is the parent of the other (e.g., chairman with semantic class &amp;quot;person&amp;quot; and Mr. Lim with semantic class &amp;quot;male&amp;quot;), or they are the same (e.g., Mr. Lim and he, both of semantic class &amp;quot;male&amp;quot;).
    The value returned for such cases is true.
    If the semantic classes of i and j are not the same (e.g., IBM with semantic class &amp;quot;organization&amp;quot; and Mr. Lim with semantic class &amp;quot;male&amp;quot;), return false.
    If either semantic class is &amp;quot;unknown,&amp;quot; then the head noun strings of both markables are compared.
    If they are the same, return true; else return unknown. on the named entity type.
    For i and j that are dates (e.g., 01-08 and Jan. 8), by using string comparison, the day, month, and year values are extracted and compared.
    If they match, then j is an alias of
