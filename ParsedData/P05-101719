Words with High Confidence We next evaluate the proposed method in terms of precision for the words that are classified with high confidence.
    We regard the absolute value of each average as a confidence measure and evaluate the top words with the highest absolute values of averages.
    The result of this experiment is shown in Figure 2, for 14 seed words as an example.
    The top 1000 words achieved more than 92% accuracy.
    This result shows that the absolute value of each average We also tested the shortest path method and the bootstrapping method on GTC and GT, and obtained low accuracies as expected in the discussion in Section 4. seeds proposed bootstrap 14 83.6 (0.8) 72.8 4 82.3 (0.9) 73.2 2 83.5 (0.7) 71.1 can work as a confidence measure of classification.
    In order to further investigate the model, we conduct experiments in restricted settings.
    We first construct a lexical network using only synonyms.
    We compare the spin model with the shortest-path method proposed by Kamps et al.
