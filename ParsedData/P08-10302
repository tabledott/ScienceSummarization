 evidence.
    As we shall describe below, we can make use of consistency at several levels: consistency of word sense across different instances of the same word in related documents, and consistency of arguments and roles across different mentions of the same or related events.
    Such methods allow us to build dynamic background knowledge as required to interpret a document and can compensate for the limited annotated training data which can be provided for each event type.
