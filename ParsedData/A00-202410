   The components in dotted lines are existing tools or resources; all the others were developed by ourselves.
  
  
    The main focus of our work is on decomposition of summaries, sentence reduction, and sentence combination.
    We also describe the sentence extraction module, although it is not the main focus of our work.
    The decomposition program, see (Jing and McKeown, 1999) for details, is used to analyze the construction of sentences in human-written abstracts.
    The results from decomposition are used to build the training and testing corpora for sentence reduction and sentence combination.
    The decomposition program answers three questions about a sentence in a human-written abstract: (1) Is the sentence constructed by cutting and pasting phrases from the input article?
    (2) If so, what phrases in the sentence come from the original article?
    (3) Where in the article do these phrases come from?
    We used a Hidden Markov Model (Baum, 1972) solution to the decomposition problem.
