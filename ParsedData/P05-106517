e the tradeoff between the two types of errors, and select the minimum cost operating point in order to get a threshold for precision and recall calculations.
    The minimum cost operating point depends on the relative costs of misses and false alarms; it is conceivable that one type of error might be more serious than the other.
    After consultation with teachers (future users of our system), we concluded that there are pros and cons to each side, so for the purpose of this analysis we weighted the two types of errors equally.
    In this work, the minimum cost operating point is selected by averaging the percentages of misses and false alarms at each point and choosing the point with the lowest average.
    Unless otherwise noted, errors reported are associated with these actual operating points, which may not lie on the convex hull of the DET curve.
    Precision and recall are often used to assess information retrieval systems, and our task is similar.
    Precision indicates the percentage of the retr
