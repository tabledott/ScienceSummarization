sed technique, by applying Bayes&#8217; theorem and conditioning on a class, as described in Section 3; the difference is in how the class is chosen.
    To investigate the results, we calculated the average number of generalized levels for each approach.
    The number of generalized levels for a concept c (relative to a verb v and argument position r) is the difference in depth between c and top(c, v, r), as explained in Section 5.
    For each test case, the number of generalized levels for both verbs, v and v', was calculated, but only for the chosen sense of n. The results are given in the third column of Table 5 and demonstrate clearly that both MDL and Assoc are generalizing to a greater extent than similarity class.
    (The fourth column gives a standard deviation figure.)
    These results suggest that MDL and Assoc are overgeneralizing, at least for the purposes of this task.
    To investigate why the value for &#945; had no impact on the results, we repeated the experiment, but with one fifth of
