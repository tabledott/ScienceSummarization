ound case, which involves creating 5582 instances of 4 morphosyntactically identical rules for classes of word forms with distinct bracketing behavior in noun&#8212;noun compounds.
    However, we would like to avoid enlarging the grammar and eventually to integrate probabilistic lexical information with probabilistic structural information in a more modular fashion.
    Probabilistic CFGs also will not model the context dependence of rule use; for example, an NP is more likely to be expanded as a pronoun in subject position than elsewhere (e.g.
    Magerman and Marcus 1991), but only one global probability can be associated with the relevant CF production.
    Thus the probabilistic CFG model predicts (incorrectly) that a) and f) will have the same probability of occurrence.
    These considerations suggest that we need a technique that allows use of a more adequate grammatical formalism than CFG and a more context-dependent probabilistic model.
    Our approach is to use the LR parsing technique as a natura
