    We have shown that a memory-based approach to large-scale tagging is feasible both in terms of accuracy (comparable to other statistical approaches), and also in terms of computational efficiency (time and space requirements) when using IGTree to compress and index the case base.
    The approach combines some of the best features of learned rule-based and statistical systems (small training corpora needed, incremental learning, understandable and explainable behavior of the system).
    More specifically, memory-based tagging with IGTrees has the following advantages.
    We have barely begun to optimise the approach: a more intelligent similarity metric would also take into account the differences in similarity between different values of the same feature.
    E.g. the similarity between the tags rb-in-nn and rb-in should be bigger than the similarity between rb-in and vb-nn.
    Apart from linguistic engineering refinements of the similarity metric, we are currently experimentin
