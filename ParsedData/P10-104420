 pair, to determine whether it is observed, or a random distractor.
    For this experiment we gathered a primary corpus by first randomly selecting 100 high-frequency relations not in the generalization corpus.
    For each relation we collected all tuples containing arguments in the vocabulary.
    We held out 500 randomly selected tuples as the test set.
    For each tuprobable values according to the multinomial distributions for each argument (Qt and -yt).
    The middle column reports a few relations whose inferred topic distributions Br assign highest probability to t. ple r(a1, a2) in the held-out set, we removed all tuples in the training set containing either of the rel-arg pairs, i.e., any tuple matching r(a1, *) or r(*, a2).
    Next we used collapsed Gibbs sampling to infer a distribution over topics, Br, for each of the relations in the primary corpus (based solely on tuples in the training set) using the topics from the generalization corpus.
