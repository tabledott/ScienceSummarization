 language sentence.
    The translation model links the source language sentence to the target language sentence.
    It can be further decomposed into alignment and lexicon model.
    The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.
    We have to maximize over all possible target language sentences.
    In this paper, we will focus on the alignment problem, i.e. the mapping between source sentence positions and target sentence positions.
    As the word order in source and target language may differ, the search algorithm has to allow certain word-reorderings.
    If arbitrary word-reorderings are allowed, the search problem is NP-hard (Knight, 1999).
    Therefore, we have to restrict the possible reorderings in some way to make the search problem feasible.
    Here, we will discuss two such constraints in detail.
    The first constraints are based on inversion transduction grammars (ITG) (Wu, 1995; Wu, 1997).
    In the following, we will
