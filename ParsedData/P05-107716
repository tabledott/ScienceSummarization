d using the traditional formula as given in equation 1.
    For this base comparison system we use the one built by Pantel and Lin (2002).
    We perform 3 kinds of evaluation: 1.
    Performance of Locality Sensitive Hash Function; 2.
    Performance of fast Hamming distance search algorithm; 3.
    Quality of final similarity lists. function To perform this evaluation, we randomly choose 100 nouns (vectors) from the web collection.
    For each noun, we calculate the cosine distance using the traditional slow method (as given by equation 1), with all other nouns in the collection.
    This process creates similarity lists for each of the 100 vectors.
    These similarity lists are cut off at a threshold of 0.15.
    These lists are considered to be the gold standard test set for our evaluation.
    For the above 100 chosen vectors, we also calculate the cosine similarity using the randomized approach as given by equation 4 and calculate the mean squared error with the gold standard test set using the follow
