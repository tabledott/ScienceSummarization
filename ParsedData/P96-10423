-understood method of stochastic part-of-speech tagging using Hidden Markov Models.
    We first review the basic approach of committeebased sample selection and its application to partof-speech tagging.
    This basic approach gives rise to a family of algorithms (including the original algorithm described in (Dagan and Engelson, 1995)) which we then describe.
    First, we describe the 'simplest' committee-based selection algorithm, which has no parameters to tune.
    We then generalize the selection scheme, allowing more options to adapt and tune the approach for specific tasks.
    The paper compares the performance of several instantiations of the general scheme, including a batch selection method similar to that of Lewis and Gale (1994).
    In particular, we found that the simplest version of the method achieves a significant reduction in annotation cost, comparable to that of other versions.
    We also evaluate the computational efficiency of the different variants, and the number of unlabeled examp
