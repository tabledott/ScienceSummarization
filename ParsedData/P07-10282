idual words (which means that different preferences will be learned for different senses of a predicate word).
    In SRL, the two most pressing issues today are (1) the development of strong semantic features to complement the current mostly syntacticallybased systems, and (2) the problem of the domain dependence (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).
    In the CoNLL-05 shared task, participating systems showed about 10 points F-score difference between in-domain and out-of-domain test data.
    Concerning (1), we focus on selectional preferences as the strongest candidate for informative semantic features.
    Concerning (2), the corpusbased similarity metrics that we use for selectional preference induction open up interesting possibilities of mixing domains.
    We evaluate the similarity-based model against Resnik's WordNet-based model as well as the EM-based clustering approach.
    In the evaluation, the similarity-model shows lower error rates than both Resnik's WordNet-based model and the EM-based clustering
