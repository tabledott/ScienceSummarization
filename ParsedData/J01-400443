de more features, 8 of which were domain specific, and 30 of which were domain independent.
    Fisher et al. (1995) adapted RESOLVE to work in MUC-6.
    The features used were slightly changed for this domain.
    Of the original 30 domain-independent features, 27 were used.
    The 8 domain-specific features were completely changed for the MUC-6 task.
    For example, JV-CHILD-i was changed to CHILD-i to decide whether i is a &amp;quot;unit&amp;quot; or a &amp;quot;subsidiary&amp;quot; of a certain parent company.
    In contrast to RESOLVE, our system makes use of a smaller set of 12 features and, as in Aone and Bennett's (1995) system, the features used are generic and applicable across domains.
    This makes our coreference engine a domain-independent module.
    Although Aone and Bennett's (1995) system also made use of decision tree learning for coreference resolution, they dealt with Japanese texts, and their evaluation focused only on noun phrases denoting organizations, whereas our evaluation, whi
