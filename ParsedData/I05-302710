			Our system used a conditional random field sequence model in conjunction with character identity features, morphological features and character reduplication features.
			We extracted our morphological information automatically to prevent overfitting Mandarin from particular Mandarin-speaking area.
			Our final system achieved a F-score of 0.947 (AS), 0.943 (HK), 0.950 (PK) and 0.964 (MSR).
