that links in the taxonomy represent uniform distances?, which is typically not true: ?there is a wide variability in the ?distance?
  covered by a single taxonomic link, particularly when certain sub- taxonomies (e.g., biological categories) are much denser than others?
  For instance, in WordNet, the link rabbit ears IS-A television antenna covers an intuitively narrow distance, whereas white elephant IS-A possession covers an intuitively wide one.
  The approaches discussed below are attempts undertaken by various researchers to overcome this problem.
  2.5.1 Sussna?s Depth-relative Scaling.
  Sussna?s (1993, 1997) approach to scaling is based on his observation that sibling-concepts deep in a taxonomy appear to be more closely related to one another than those higher up.
  His method construes each edge 3 The original ideas and definitions of Hirst and St-Onge (1998) (including those for the direction of links ?
  see below) were intended to apply to all parts of speech and the entire range of relations f
