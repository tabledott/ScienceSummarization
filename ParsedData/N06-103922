 meaningful relation.
    We are not sure how much this sort of table can affect overall IE performance.
  
  
    In this paper we proposed Preemptive Information Extraction as a new direction of IE research.
    As its key technique, we presented Unrestricted Relation Discovery that tries to find parallel correspondences between multiple entities in a document, and perform clustering using basic patterns as features.
    To increase the number of basic patterns, we used a cluster of comparable articles instead of a single document.
    We presented the implementation of our preliminary system and its outputs.
    We obtained dozens of usable tables.
    Sep. and Nov. (from Wikipedia).
    Rows with a star (*) were actually extracted.
    The number of the source articles that contained a mention of the hurricane is shown in the right column.
