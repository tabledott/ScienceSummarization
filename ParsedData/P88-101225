R).
    To solve the definite reference problem in the second sentence, we must prove the existence of a chandelier.
    Back-chaining on axiom (7), we see we need to prove the existence of a light with fixtures.
    Back-chaining from light(1) in axiom (6), we see we need to prove the existence of a room.
    We have this in room(R).
    To complete the derivation, we assume the light 1 has fixtures.
    The light is thus given by the room mentioned in the previous sentence, while the fact that it has fixtures is new information.
    We next show the use of the abduction scheme in solving internal coreference problems.
    Two problems raised by the sentence The plain was reduced by erosion to its present level. are determining what was eroding and determining what &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; refers to.
    Suppose our knowledge base consists of the following axioms: or e is an eroding of x if and only if x is a landform that decreases to some point Ion the altitude scale a (plus some other conditions).
    Our c
