ts the fact that in most of its instances the verb cut off is used to mean &#8220;forcibly isolate&#8221;.
    In order to measure this effect quantitatively, we can simply take the cosine similarities between these verbs, finding that sim(cut, cutout) = 0.433 and sim(cut, cut off) = 0.183 from which we infer directly that, relative to the sense of cut, cut out is a clearer case of a simple decomposable MWE than cut off.
    In order to get an initial feel for how well the LSA-based similarities for MWEs and their head words correlate with the WordNet-based similarities over those same word pairs, we did a linear regression and Pearson&#8217;s correlation analysis of the paired data (i.e. the pairing (simLSA(wordi, mwe), simWN(wordi, mwe)) for each WordNet similarity measure simWN).
    For both tests, values closer to 0 indicate random distribution of the data, whereas values closer to 1 indicate a strong correlation.
    The correlation results for NN compounds and verb-particles are presented in Table 3, w
