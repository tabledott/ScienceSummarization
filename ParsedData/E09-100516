 WSD, a mapping to WordNet 1.7 is required.
    Although the mapping is cited as having a correctness on the high 90s (Daude et al., 2000), it could have introduced sufficient noise to counteract the benefits of the hand-disambiguated glosses.
    Table 1 also shows the most frequent sense (MFS), as well as the best supervised systems (Snyder and Palmer, 2004; Palmer et al., 2001) that participated in each competition (SMUaw and GAMBL, respectively).
    The MFS is a baseline for supervised systems, but it is considered a difficult competitor for unsupervised systems, which rarely come close to it.
    In this case the MFS baseline was computed using previously availabel training data like SemCor.
    Our best results are close to the MFS in both Senseval-2 and Senseval-3 datasets.
    The results for the supervised system are given for reference, and we can see that the gap is relatively small, specially for Senseval3.
  
  
    In this section we will briefly describe some graph-based methods for knowledge-
