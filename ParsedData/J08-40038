e results indicate that, at least for dependency parsing, deterministic parsing is possible without a drastic loss in accuracy.
    The deterministic classifier-based approach has also been applied to phrase structure parsing (Kalt 2004; Sagae and Lavie 2005), although the accuracy for this type of representation remains a bit below the state of the art.
    In this setting, more competitive results have been achieved using probabilistic classifiers and beam search, rather than strictly deterministic search, as in the work by Ratnaparkhi (1997, 1999) and Sagae and Lavie (2006).
    A deterministic classifier-based parser consists of three essential components: a parsing algorithm, which defines the derivation of a syntactic analysis as a sequence of elementary parsing actions; a feature model, which defines a feature vector representation of the parser state at any given time; and a classifier, which maps parser states, as represented by the feature model, to parsing actions.
