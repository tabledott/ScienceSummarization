h product features and opinion expressions extractions are preprocessing steps, recall is more important.
    In order to compare with state-of-the-art results, we also evaluated the following methods.
    Table 5 shows the performances of different relation extraction methods with in-domain data.
    For each domain, we conducted 5-fold cross validation.
    Table 6 shows the performances of the extraction methods on cross-domain data.
    We use the digital camera and cell phone domain as training set.
    The other domains are used as testing set.
  
  
    Table 5 presents different methods&#8217; results in five domains.
    We observe that the three learning based methods(SVM-1, SVM-WTree, SVM-PTree) perform better than the Adjacent baseline in the first three domains.
    However, in other domains, directly adjacent method is better than the learning based methods.
    The main difference between the first three domains and the last two domains is the size of data(Table 1).
    It implies that the simp
