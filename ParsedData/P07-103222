s in DepBank unidentified.
    The numerical case is identified using two rules: the num subtype is added if any argument in a GR is assigned the lexical category N/N [num], and if any of the arguments in an ncmod is POS tagged CD. prt is added to an ncmod if the modifiee has any of the verb POS tags and if the modifier has POS tag RP.
    The final columns of Table 4 show the accuracy of the transformed gold-standard CCGbank dependencies when compared with DepBank; the simple post-processing rules have increased the F-score from 77.86% to 84.76%.
    This F-score is an upper bound on the performance of the CCG parser.
  
  
    The results in Table 4 were obtained by parsing the sentences from CCGbank corresponding to those in the 560-sentence test set used by Briscoe et al. (2006).
    We used the CCGbank sentences because these differ in some ways to the original Penn Treebank sentences (there are no quotation marks in CCGbank, for example) and the parser has been trained on CCGbank.
    Even here we exper
