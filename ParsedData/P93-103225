ince the tagger provides this kind of morphological knowledge, it would be straightforward to write a similar program that determines the arguments of a verb using any combination of word order, case marking and head agreement markers, as appropriate for the language at hand.
    Indeed, since case-marking is in some ways more reliable than word order, the results for other languages might even be better than those reported here.
  
  
    After establishing that it is desirable to be able to automatically induce the subcategorization frames of verbs, this paper examined a new technique for doing this.
    The paper showed that the technique of trying to learn from easily analyzable pieces of data is not extendable to all subcategorization frames, and, at any rate, the sparseness of appropriate cues in unrestricted texts suggests that a better strategy is to try and extract as much (noisy) information as possible from as much of the data as possible, and then to use statistical techniques to filter the result
