restrictions, verb tense and aspect, modality, intonation and pitch accent are topics for further research.
    Note that these transitions are more specific than focus movement as described in [Sid83].
    The extension we propose makes them more specific still.
    Note also that the Cb of [GJW86] corresponds roughly to Sidner's discourse focus and the Cf to her potential foci.
    The formal system of constraints and rules for centering, as we have interpreted them from [GJW86], are as follows.
    For each Un in U1, , CONTINUING... Un+i: Carl works at HP on the Natural Language We are aware that this ranking usually coincides with surface constituent order in English.
    It would be of interest to examine data from languages with relatively freer constituent order (e.g.
    German) to determine the influence of constituent order upon centering when the grammatical functions are held constant.
    In addition, languages that provide an identifiable topic function (e.g.
    Japanese) suggest that topic tak
