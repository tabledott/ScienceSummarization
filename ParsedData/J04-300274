ed to more unannotated text to identify regions containing subjective sentences.
    In addition, because the precision and frequency of the density features are stable across data sets, lower-precision but higher-frequency options are available.
    Finally, the value of the various types of PSEs was demonstrated with the task of opinion piece classification.
    Using the k-nearest-neighbor classification algorithm with leave-one-out cross-validation, a classification accuracy of 94% was achieved on a large test set, with a reduction in error of 28% from the baseline.
    Future work is required to determine how to exploit density features to improve the performance of text categorization algorithms.
    Another area of future work is searching for clues to objectivity, such as the politeness features used by Spertus (1997).
    Still another is identifying the type of a subjective expression (e.g., positive or negative evaluative), extending work such as Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) on classifying l
