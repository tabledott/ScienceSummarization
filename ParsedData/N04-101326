ach explicitly discounts4.
    For the same reasons our conversion routine does not identify the subjects of infinitival complements with particular arguments of matrix verbs.
    The Model 3 trees provide no indication of how this is to be done, and in many cases the proper assignment depends on lexical information about specific predicates (to capture, for example, the well-known contrast between promise and persuade).
    Model 3 trees also provide information about certain 4However, we did explore a few of these additional transformations and found only marginal F-score increases. long-distance dependencies, by marking with -g annotations the path between a filler and a gap and marking the gap by an explicit TRACE in the terminal string.
    The filler itself is not clearly identified, but our conversion treats all WH categories under SBAR as potential fillers and attempts to propagate them down the gap-chain to link them up to appropriate traces.
    In sum, it is not a trivial matter to convert a Model
