  Statistical Models for Unsupervised Prepositional Phrase Attachment
  
    several unsupervised statistical models for the prepositional phrase attachment task that approach the accuracy of the best supervised methods for this task.
    Our unsupervised approach uses a heuristic based on attachment proximity and trains from raw text that is annotated with only part-of-speech tags and morphological base forms, as opposed to attachment information.
    It is therefore less resource-intensive and more portable than previous corpus-based algorithm proposed for this task.
    We present results for prepositional phrase attachment in both English and Spanish.
  
  
    Prepositional phrase attachment is the task of deciding, for a given preposition in a sentence, the attachment site that corresponds to the interpretation of the sentence.
    For example, the task in the following examples is to decide whether the preposition with modifies the preceding noun phrase (with head word shirt) or the preceding verb phr
