cy trees.
    In Figure 4, we define an oracle function o for the system Su, which implements this &#8220;sort and parse&#8221; strategy and predicts the optimal transition t out of the current configuration c, given the target dependency tree G = (Vx, A) and the projective order &lt;G.
    The oracle predicts LEFT-ARCl or RIGHT-ARCl if the two top nodes on the stack should be connected by an arc and if the dependent node of this arc is already connected to all its dependents; it predicts SWAP if the two top nodes are not in projective order; and it predicts SHIFT otherwise.
    This is the oracle that has been used to generate training data for classifiers in the experimental evaluation in Section 4.
    Let us now consider the time complexity of the extended system Su = (C, Tu, cs, Ct) and let us begin by observing that 2n is still a lower bound on the number of transitions required to reach a terminal configuration.
    A sequence of 2n transitions occurs when no SWAP transitions are performed, in which ca
