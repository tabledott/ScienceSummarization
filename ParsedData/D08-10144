ysis in languages other than English.
    In general, efforts on building subjectivity analysis tools for other languages have been hampered by the high cost involved in creating corpora and lexical resources for a new language.
    To address this gap, we focus on leveraging resources already developed for one language to derive subjectivity analysis tools for a new language.
    This motivates the direction of our research, in which we use machine translation coupled with cross-lingual annotation projections to generate the resources and tools required to perform subjectivity classification in the target language.
    The work closest to ours is the one reported in (Mihalcea et al., 2007), where a bilingual lexicon and a manually translated parallel text are used to generate the resources required to build a subjectivity classifier in a new language.
    In that work, we found that the projection of annotations across parallel texts can be successfully used to build a corpus annotated for subjectivity in th
