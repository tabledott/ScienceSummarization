ttached to nodes in the tree.
    Exactly how to get from the parse tree to an appropriate meaning representation is a current research topic in our group.
    However, the method we are currently using in the ATIS domain (Seneff et al. 1991) represents our most promising approach to this problem.
    We have decided to limit semantic frame types to a small set of choices such as CLAUSE (for a sentence-level concept, such as request), PREDICATE (for a functional operation), REFERENCE (essentially proper noun), and QSET (for a set of objects).
    The process of obtaining a completed semantic frame amounts to passing frames along from node to node through the completed parse tree.
    Each node receives a frame in both a top-down and a bottom-up cycle, and modifies the frame according to specifications based on its broad-class identity (as one of noun, noun-phrase, predicate, quantifier, etc.).
    For example, a [subject] is a noun-phrase node with the label &amp;quot;topic.&amp;quot; During the top-down cycl
