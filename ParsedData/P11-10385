orm is S, the approach aims to find arg max P(S|T) by computing arg maxP(T|S)P(S), in which P(S) is usually a language model and P (T |S) is an error model.
    Brill and Moore (2000) characterise the error model by computing the product of operation probabilities on slice-by-slice string edits.
    Toutanova and Moore (2002) improve the model by incorporating pronunciation information.
    Choudhury et al. (2007) model the word-level text generation process for SMS messages, by considering graphemic/phonetic abbreviations and unintentional typos as hidden Markov model (HMM) state transitions and emissions, respectively (Rabiner, 1989).
    Cook and Stevenson (2009) expand the error model by introducing inference from different erroneous formation processes, according to the sampled error distribution.
    While the noisy channel model is appropriate for text normalisation, P(T|S), which encodes the underlying error production process, is hard to approximate accurately.
    Additionally, these methods make th
