alogical modeling approach in linguistics (Skousen, 1989; Skousen, 1992).
			In machine learning terms, it can be characterized as a lazy learning method,since it defers processing of input until needed and pro cesses input by combining stored data (Aha, 1997).
			Memory-based learning has been successfully appliedto a number of problems in natural language processing, such as grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, part of-speech tagging, prepositional-phrase attachment, and base noun phrase chunking (Daelemans et al, 2002).Most relevant in the present context is the use of memory based learning to predict the actions of a shift-reduce parser, with promising results reported in Veenstra and Daelemans (2000).
			The main reason for using memory-based learning inthe present context is the flexibility offered by similarity based extrapolation when classifying previously unseenconfigurations, since previous experiments with a proba bilistic model has shown that a fixed back-off sequence does not work well in this case (
