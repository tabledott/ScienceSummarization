d hoc or subjectively determined sets of rules and descriptions, and employed substantial exception dictionaries, this algorithm requires no human intervention for set-up; it is a systematic process.
    Third, the algorithm is quantitative and analog, rather than artificially discrete.
    The various tests and employed by earlier algorithms enforced absolute constraints on particular tags or collocations of tags.
    Here relative probabilities are weighed, and a series of very likely assignments can make possible a particular, a priori unlikely assignment with which they are associated.
    In addition to collocational probabilities, CLAWS also takes into account one other empirical quantity: Tags associated with words.
