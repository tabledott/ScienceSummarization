such as in (Hindle, 1990)).
    Conflicting data.
    In very few cases two alternatives were supported equally by the statistical data, thus preventing a selection.
    In such cases, both alternatives are valid at the independent level of the lexical relation, but may be inappropriate for the specific context.
    For instance, the two alternatives of `to take a job' or 'to take a position' appeared in one of the examples, but since the general context concerned with the position of a prime minister only the latter was appropriate.

    In another example both alternatives were appropriate also for the specific context.
    This happened with the German verb `werfen', which may be translated (among other options) as 'throw', 'cast' or 'scor
