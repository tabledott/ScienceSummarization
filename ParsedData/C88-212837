 logical forms to natural-language expressions i  in general many-to-one.
  For instance, the logical forms red(x) h ball(x) and ball(x) h red(x) might both be realized as the nominal red ball.
  However, most systems for describing the string- LF relation declaratively do so by assigning a minimal set of logical forms to each string, with each logical form standing proxy for all its logical equivalents.
  The situation is represented graphically as Figure 1.
  The problem is complicated further in that, strictly speaking, the class of equivalent logical forms from the standpoint of generation is not really closed under logical equivalence.
  Instead, what is actu- ally required is a finer-grained notion of intentional equivalence, under which, for instance, p and p A (q Y -~q) would not necessarily be inten.. tionally equivalent; hey might correspond to different uttera~aces, one about p only, the other about both p and q.
  In such a system, merely using the grammar per se to drive gener- ation (as we do he
