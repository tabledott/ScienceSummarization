the ith cut of word w, of length 1, cuts it into a stem t of length i and suffix of length 1 &#8212; i, then the probability of that cut is defined as where wj,k refers to the substring of w from the jth to the kth letter.
    Probability mass for the stem and the suffix in each such cut is then augmented by an amount equal to the frequency of word w times the probability of the cut.
    After several iterations (approximately four), estimated probabilities stabilize, and each word is analyzed on the basis of the cut with the largest probability.
    This initially plausible approach fails because it always prefers an analysis in which either the stem or (more often) the suffix consists of a single letter.
    More importantly, the probability that a sequence of one or more word-final letters is a suffix is very poorly modeled by the sequence's frequency.'
    To put the point another way, even the initial heuristic analyzing one particular word must take into account all of the other analyses in a more artic
