this reason, in all obvious cases, we substituted the &#8220;noun.Tops&#8221; label with the more specific supersense label for the noun4.
    The SEMv dataset only includes supersense labels for verbs.
    In order to avoid unwanted false negatives, that is, thousands of nouns labeled &#8220;0&#8221;, we applied the following procedure.
    Rather than using the full sentences from the SEMv dataset, from each sentence we generated the fragments including a verb but no common or proper nouns; e.g., from a sentence such as &#8220;Karns&#8217; ruling pertainedverb.stative to eight of the 10 cases.&#8221; only the fragment &#8220;pertainedverb.stative to eight of the 10&#8221; is extracted and used for training.
    Sometimes more than one label is assigned to a word, in all data-sets.
    In these cases we adopted the heuristic of only using the first label in the data as the correct synset/supersense.
    We leave the extension of the tagger to the multilabel case for future research.
    As for now, we can ex
