d, there is an overwhelming intuitive appeal to the idea that a translator proceeds by first understanding the French, and then expressing in English the meaning that he has thus grasped.
    Many people have been guided by this intuitive picture when building machine translation systems.
    From a purely formal point of view, on the other hand, Equation (2) is completely adequate.
    The conditional distribution POI e) is just an enormous table that associates a real number between zero and one with every possible pairing of a French passage and an English passage.
    With the proper choice for this distribution, translations of arbitrarily high quality can be achieved.
    Of course, to construct Pr(f le) by examining individual pairs of French and English passages one by one is out of the question.
    Even if we restrict our attention to passages no longer than a typical novel, there are just too many such pairs.
    But this is only a problem in practice, not in principle.
