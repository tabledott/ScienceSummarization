ch dealt with English texts, encompassed noun phrases of all types, not just those denoting organizations.
    In addition, Aone and Bennett evaluated their system on noun phrases that had been correctly identified, whereas we evaluated our coreference resolution engine as part of a total system that first has to identify all the candidate noun phrases and has to deal with the inevitable noisy data when mistakes occur in noun phrase identification and semantic class determination.
    The contribution of our work lies in showing that a learning approach, when evaluated on common coreference data sets, is able to achieve accuracy competitive with that of state-of-the-art systems using nonlearning approaches.
    It is also the first machine learning-based system to offer performance comparable to that of nonlearning approaches.
    Finally, the work of Cardie and Wagstaff (1999) also falls under the machine learning approach.
    However, they used unsupervised learning and their method did not require any ann
