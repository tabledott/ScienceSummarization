method that uses the cluster-based feature set (CL).
    This is in spite of the fact that the generative models within the SS-SCM approach were trained on the same unlabeled data used to induce the cluster-based features.
    Table 3 also shows the effectiveness of the twostage approach (described in Section 3.2) that integrates the SS-SCM method within a second-order parser.
    This suggests that the SS-SCM method can be effective in providing features (generative models) used within a separate learning algorithm, providing that this algorithm can make use of realvalued features.
    Figure 1 shows the dependency parsing accuracy on English as a function of the amount of unlabeled data used within the SS-SCM approach.
    (As described in Section 4.1, we have no unlabeled data other than PDT for Czech, hence this section only considers English dependency parsing.)
    We can see that performance does improve as more unlabeled data is added; this trend is seen both with and without cluster-based features.
