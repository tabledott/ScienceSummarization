quot;relative-frequencies&amp;quot; yield maximumlikelihood estimates for the 02.
    Extending a PCFG model by adding additional features not associated with productions will in general add additional dependencies, destroy the tree structure, and substantially complicate maximum likelihood estimation.
    This is the situation for a SUBG, even if the features are production occurences.
    The unification constraints create non-local dependencies among the productions and the dependency graph of a SUBG is usually not a tree.
    Consequently, maximum likelihood estimation is no longer a simple matter of computing relative frequencies.
    But the resulting estimation procedures (discussed in detail, shortly), albeit more complicated, have the virtue of applying to essentially arbitrary features&#8212;of the production or non-production type.
    That is, since estimators capable of finding maximum-likelihood parameter estimates for production features in a SUBG will also find maximum-likelihood estimates for
