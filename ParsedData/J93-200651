nother recent paper (Hindle and Rooth 1990) is directly related to our goal of inferring case frame information from examples.
    Hindle and Rooth focused only on prepositional phrase attachment using a probabilistic model, whereas our work applies to all case relations.
    Their work used an unsupervised training corpus of 13 million words to judge the strength of prepositional affinity to verbs, e.g., how likely it is for to to attach to the word go, for from to attach to the word leave, or for to to attach to the word flight.
    This lexical affinity is measured independently of the object of the preposition.
    By contrast, we are exploring induction of semantic relations from supervised training, where very little training may be available.
    Furthermore, we are looking at triples of headword (or semantic class), syntactic case, and headword (or semantic class).
    In Hindle and Rooth's test, they evaluated their probability model in the limited case of verb&#8212;noun phrase&#8212;prepositional p
