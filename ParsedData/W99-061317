nd Mitchell 98) go on to give PAC results for learning in the cotraining case.
    They also describe an application of cotraining to classifying web pages (the to feature sets are the words on the page, and other pages pointing to the page).
    The method halves the error rate in comparison to a method using the labeled examples alone.
    Limitations of (Blum and Mitchell 98): While the assumptions of (Blum and Mitchell 98) are useful in developing both theoretical results and an intuition for the problem, the assumptions are quite limited.
    In particular, it may not be possible to learn functions fi (x f2(x2,t) for i = m + 1...n: either because there is some noise in the data, or because it is just not realistic to expect to learn perfect classifiers given the features used for representation.
    It may be more realistic to replace the second criteria with a softer one, for example (Blum and Mitchell 98) suggest the alternative Alternatively, if Ii and 12 are probabilistic learners, it might make sens
