 to apply statistical estimation theory to compute the &#8220;optimal&#8221; model parameters, and to perform alignment search to compute the best word alignment.
    So far, refined statistical alignment models have in general been rarely used.
    One reason for this is the high complexity of these models, which makes them difficult to understand, implement, and tune.
    Instead, heuristic models are usually used.
    In heuristic models, the word alignments are computed by analyzing some association score metric of a link between a source language word and a target language word.
    These models are relatively easy to implement.
    In this article, we focus on consistent statistical alignment models suggested in the literature, but we also describe a heuristic association metric.
    By providing a detailed description and a systematic evaluation of these alignment models, we give the reader various criteria for deciding which model to use for a given task.
