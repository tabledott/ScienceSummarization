sees the pair N:m not followed by one of the labials p, b, m. It blocks in state 2 if it encounters the pair N:N followed by a labial on both tapes, thus providing for the situation in which the rule is not applied even though its conditions are satisfied.
    If it does not block and both tapes are eventually exhausted, it accepts them just in case it is then in one of the final states, 0 or 2, shown as double circles.
    It rejects the tapes if it ends up in the nonfinal state 1, indicating that the second tape is not a valid translation of the first one.
    We have described transducers as acceptors of pairs of tapes that stand in a certain relation.
    But they can also be interpreted asymmetrically, as functions either from more abstract to less abstract strings or the other way around.
    Either of the tapes can contain an input string, in which case the output will be written on the other.
    In each transition the machine matches the symbol specified for the input tape and writes the one for the
