the Danish (dots above the 95% line We would like measure the reliability of the conclusion that one system is better than the other, or in other words, that the difference in test scores is statistical significant.
    As in the previous section, we use a bootstrap resampling method for this: Given a small collection of translated sentences, we repeatedly (say, 1000 times) create new virtual test sets by drawing sentences with replacement from the collection.
    For each set, we compute the evaluation metric score for both systems.
    We note, which system performs better.
    If, say, one system outperforms the other system 95% of the time, we draw the conclusion that it is better with 95% statistical significance.
    We call this method paired bootstrap resampling, since we compare a pair of systems.
    We carry out experiments using this method using the BLEU score to compare the Spanish-English system with the Danish-English system.
    Results are displayed in Figure 7.
