  D,O, j] This rule corresponds to the logically valid inference consisting of in- stantiating a rule of the grammar as a conditional statement.

  3 Parameter i z ing  a Theorem-Proving Architecture This characterization f parsing as deduction should be familiar from the work of Pereira and Warren.
  As they have demonstrated, such a view of purging is applicable beyond the context-free grammars by regarding the variables in the inference rules as logical variables and using unification of B and B t to solve for the most general unifier.
  Thus, this approach is applicable to most, if not all, of the logic gra
