of the data, they reported an fscore of 79.4% using automatic parses (Charniak, 2001).
    By carefully designing features that can all be directly extracted from the treebank parse trees, our system achieved very comparable results using a Maxent classifier and a much smaller feature set: 92.95% on known constituents, 88.51% on unknown constituents and 76.21% when the Collins parser is used.
    The results on known constituents are almost identical and the larger difference when automatic parses are used could be attributed to the different parsers, as we used output from an earlier version of the Collins parser.
  
  
    This paper takes a critical look at the features used in the semantic role tagging literature and show that the information in the input, generally a syntactic parse tree, has yet to be fully exploited.
    We propose an additional set of features and our experiments show that these features lead to fairly significant improvements in the tasks we performed.
    We further show that differ
