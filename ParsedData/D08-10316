l. (2007) introduced a model that predicts whether a pair of equivalence classes should be merged, using features computed over all the mentions in both classes.
    Since the number of possible classes is exponential in the number of mentions, they use heuristics to select training examples.
    Our method does not require determining which equivalence classes should be considered as examples.
    Learning the pairwise scoring function pc is a crucial issue for the pairwise coreference model.
    We apply machine learning techniques to learn from examples a function pc that takes as input an ordered pair of mentions (a, m) such that a precedes m in the document, and produces as output a value that is interpreted as the conditional probability that m and a belong in the same equivalence class.
    The ACE training data provides the equivalence classes for mentions.
    However, for some pairs of mentions from an equivalence class, there is little or no direct evidence in the text that the mentions are corefer
