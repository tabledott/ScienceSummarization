 effectiveness of our design philosophy of using multi-sub-trees as basic translation unit in SMT.
  
  
    In this paper, we present a tree sequence alignment-based translation model to combine the strengths of phrase-based and syntax-based methods.
    The experimental results on the NIST MT2005 Chinese-English translation task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
    Our study also finds that in our model the tree sequence rules are very useful since they can model non-syntactic phrases and reorderings with rich linguistic structure features while discontinuous phrases and tree sequence rules with more than three sub-trees have less impact on performance.
    There are many interesting research topics on the tree sequence-based translation model worth exploring in the future.
    The current method extracts large amount of rules.
    Many of them are redundant, which make decoding very slow.
    Thus, effective rule optimization and pruning algorithms are highly desirable.
    Ideally, a l
