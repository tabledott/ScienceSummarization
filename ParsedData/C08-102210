, as there are two components to their model: one determining whether a preposition is needed, and the other deciding what the preposition should be.
			The figure reported here refers to the latter task,as it is the most similar to the one we are evalu ating.
			Additionally, Chodorow et al also discusssome modifications to their model which can in crease accuracy; the result noted here is the one more directly comparable to our own approach.
			5.1.1 Further discussion To fully assess the model?s performance on the L1data, it is important to consider factors such as performance on individual prepositions, the relation ship between training dataset size and accuracy, and the kinds of errors made by the model.Table 4 shows the classifier?s performance on in dividual prepositions together with the size of their training datasets.
			At first glance, a clear correlationappears between the amount of data seen in training and precision and recall, as evidenced for ex ample by of or to, for which the classifier ac
