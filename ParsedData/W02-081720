rpus will be built by trained human taggers, starting with examples extracted from the corpus mentioned in Section 3.1.
    This process will be set up independently of the Open Mind Word Expert Web interface.
    The test corpus will be released during SENSEVAL-3.
  
  
    Open Mind Word Expert pursues the potential of creating a large tagged corpus.
    WSD can also benefit in other ways from the Open Mind approach.
    We are considering using a AutoASC/GenCor type of approach to generate sense tagged data with a bootstrapping algorithm (Mihalcea, 2002a).
    Web contributors can help this process by creating the initial set of seeds, and exercising control over the quality of the automatically generated seeds.
  
  
    We would like to thank the Open Mind Word Expert contributors who are making all this work possible.
    We are also grateful to Adam Kilgarriff for valuable suggestions and interesting discussions, to Randall Davis and to the anonymous reviewers for useful comments on an earlier version
