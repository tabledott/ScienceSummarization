 of these relationship types, based on what ends up clearly being use2The percentage of the word pairs extracted that were not true NCs was about 6%; some examples are: treat migraine, ten patient, headache more.
    We do not know, however, how many NCs we missed.
    The errors occurred when the wrong label was assigned by the tagger (see Section 4). ful &#8220;downstream&#8221; in the analysis.
    The end goal is to combine these relationships in NCs with more that two constituent nouns, like in the example intranasal migraine treatment of Section 1.
  
  
    To create a collection of noun compounds, we performed searches from MedLine, which contains references and abstracts from 4300 biomedical journals.
    We used several query terms, intended to span across different subfields.
    We retained only the titles and the abstracts of the retrieved documents.
    On these titles and abstracts we ran a part-of-speech tagger (Cutting et al., 1991) and a program that extracts only sequences of units tagged a
