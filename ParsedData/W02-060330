g, even for words that are not rare.
    Linguistica, on the other hand, employs a more conservative splitting strategy, but makes incorrect segmentations for many common word forms.
    The behaviour of the methods is illustrated by example segmentations in Table 4.
    Often the Recursive MDL method produces complete and correct segmentations.
    However, both it and the Sequential ML method can produce excessive splitting, as is shown for the latter, e.g. affecti + on + at + e. In contrast, Linguistica refrains from splitting words when they should be split, e.g., the Finnish compound words in the table.
  
  
    Regarding the model, there is always room for improvement.
    In particular, the current model does In the experiments the online method with the MDL cost function and recursive splitting appeared most successful especially for Finnish, whereas for English the compared methods were rather equal in performance.
    This is likely to be partially due to the model structure of the presented method
