estimate the parameters of a model.
    Although the method described in this paper for finding a good approximation to the joint distribution of a set of discrete variables makes use of maximum likelihood models, the scope of the technique we are describing extends beyond parameter estimation to include selecting the form of the model that approximates the joint distribution.
    Several of the studies mentioned in this Section have used interest as a test case, and all of them (with the exception of Schutze [26]) considered four possible meanings for that word.
    In order to facilitate comparison of our work with previous studies, we re-estimated the parameters of our best model and tested it using data containing only the four LDOCE senses corresponding to those used by others (usages not tagged as being one of these four senses were removed from both the test and training data sets).
    The results of the modified experiment along with a summary of the published results of previous studies are presente
