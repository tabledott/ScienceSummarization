ned by a in the original expression.
    Rule expressions containing several locally occurring variables can be handled by an obvious generalization of this substitution scheme.
    If al ...an are the local variables in 6 whose values come from the finite sets V, the set of n-tuples represents the collection of all possible value instantiations of those variables.
    If we let 0[i] be the result of carrying out the substitutions indicated for all variables by some i in I, the interpretation of the entire expression is given by the formula Indeed, the input and output expressions will almost always have variables in common, because of the feature variables introduced in the initial center-expansion step.
    Variables that appear in more than one rule part clearly cannot be eliminated from each part independently, because the correlation between feature instantiations would be lost.
    A feature-matrix rule is to be interpreted as scanning in the appropriate direction along the input string until a configur
