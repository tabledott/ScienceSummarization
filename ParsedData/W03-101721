ative adjectives (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997).
    We also used the ANEW list which was constructed during psycholinguistic experiments (Bradley and Lang, 1999) and contains 1,031 words of all four open classes.
    As described in (Bradley and Lang, 1999), humans assigned valence scores to each score according to dimensions such as pleasure, arousal, and dominance; following heuristics proposed in psycholinguistics7 we obtained 284 positive and 272 negative words from the valence scores.
  
  
    Document Classification We trained our Bayes classifier for documents on 4,000 articles from the WSJ portion of our combined TREC collection, and evaluated on 4,000 other articles also from the WSJ part.
    Table 2 lists the F-measure scores (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) of our Bayesian classifier for document-level opinion/fact classification.
    The results show the classifier achieved 97% F-measure, which is comparable or higher than the 93% accuracy reported by (Wiebe et al., 2002), who
