terings of size 2-5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 are unioned to form a single large prototype set.
    In general, this approach works about as well as picking the optimal value of K, even outperforming the single best cluster size for Wikipedia.
    Finally, we also compared our method to a pure exemplar approach, averaging similarity across all occurrence pairs.4 Table 1 summarizes the results.
    The exemplar approach yields significantly higher correlation than the single prototype approach in all cases except Gigaword with tf-idf features (p &lt; 0.05).
    Furthermore, it performs significantly worse 2(Feature pruning) We find that results using tf-idf features are extremely sensitive to feature pruning while x2 features are more robust.
    In all experiments we prune tf-idf features by their overall weight, taking the top 5000.
    This setting was found to optimize the performance of the single-prototype approach. ber of clusters (log scale) for both the Wikipedia (left) and Gigaword (right) corpora.
