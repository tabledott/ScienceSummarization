ators of sense.
    He located collocations by looking at adjacent words or at the first word to the left or right in a given part of speech and found that, with binary ambiguity, a word has only one sense in a given collocation with a probability of 90-99%.1 However, he had an average of only 29% recall (i.e., the collocations were found in only 29% of the cases).
    When local information occurred it was highly reliable, but all too often, it did not occur.
    Bruce and Wiebe (1994a, 1994b) have developed a classifier that represents local context by morphology (the inflection on the target word), the syntactic category of words within a window of &#177;2 words from the target, and collocation-specific items found in the sentence.
    The collocation-specific items are those determined to be the most informative, where an item is considered informative if the model for independence between it and a sense tag provided a poor fit to the training data.
