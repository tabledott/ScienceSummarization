 best inter-lingual phrasal cohesion properties.
    The percentage for head crossings is 12.62% and that of modifier crossings is 9.22%.
    Furthermore, a grammar based on dependency structures has the advantage of being simple in formalism yet having CFG equivalent formal generative capacity (Ding and Palmer, 2004b).
    Dependency structures are inherently lexicalized as each node is one word.
    In comparison, phrasal structures (treebank style trees) have two node types: terminals store the lexical items and non-terminals store word order and phrasal scopes.
    Ding and Palmer (2004b) described one version of synchronous grammar: Synchronous Dependency Insertion Grammars.
    A Dependency Insertion Grammars (DIG) is a generative grammar formalism that captures word order phenomena within the dependency representation.
    In the scenario of two languages, the two sentences in the source and target languages can be modeled as being generated from a synchronous derivation process.
    A synchronous deri
