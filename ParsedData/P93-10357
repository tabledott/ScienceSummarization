he right paren: This results in the same structural change as deleting a left paren to the right of X in this particular structure.
    Applying the transformation add a right paren to the right of a noun to the bracketing: ( ( The ( dog barked ) ) . ) will once again result in the correct bracketing: ( ( ( The dog) barked) . )
    Learning proceeds as follows.
    Sentences in the training set are first parsed using the naive parser which assigns right linear structure to all sentences, attaching final punctuation high.
    Next, for each possible instantiation of the twelve transformation templates, that particular transformation is applied to the naively parsed sentences.
    The resulting structures are then scored using some measure of success that compares these parses to the correct structural descriptions for the sentences provided in the training corpus.
    The transformation resulting in the best scoring structures then becomes the first transformation of the ordered set of transformations that are
