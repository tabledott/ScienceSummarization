equencies of each pair are higher.
    Stage one then produces as output a simple list of adjective-adjective pairs that occurred within the same minimal NP and a table with the observed frequencies of every adjective-noun combination.
    Each row in the table contains the frequencies of modified nouns for a given adjective.
    This stage currently employs two similarity modules, each of which processes a part of the output of stage one and produces a measure of similarity for each possible pair of adjectives.
    The first module processes the adjective-noun frequency table; for each possible pair in the table we compare the two distributions of nouns.
    We use a robust non-parametric method to compute the similarity between the modified noun distributions for any two adjectives, namely Kendall's coefficient (Kendall, 1938) for two random variables with paired observations.
    In our case, the two random variables are the two adjectives we are comparing, and each paired observation is their frequency of
