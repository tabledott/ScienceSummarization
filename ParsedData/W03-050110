 step provides a grammatical headline.
    However, the parser often produces an incorrect output.
    Human inspection of our 624-sentence DUC-2003 evaluation set revealed that there were two such scenarios, illustrated by the following cases: In the first case, an S exists, but it does not conform to the requirements of step 1.
    This occurred in 2.6% of the sentences in the DUC-2003 evaluation data.
    We resolve this by selecting the lowest leftmost S, i.e., the entire string &#8220;What started as a local controversy has evolved into an international scandal&#8221; in the example above.
    In the second case, there is no S available.
    This occurred in 3.4% of the sentences in the evaluation data.
    We resolve this by selecting the root of the parse tree; this would be the entire string &#8220;Bangladesh and India signed a water sharing accord&#8221; above.
    No other parser errors were encountered in the DUC-2003 evaluation data.
    Step 2 of our algorithm eliminates low-content units.
