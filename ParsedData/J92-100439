    The CURRENT-FOCUS slot is not restricted to nodes that represent nouns.
    Some of the generators are adverbial or adjectival parts of speech (Pos).
    An absorber checks for agreement in POS before it can accept the FLOAT-OBJECT as its subparse.
    As an example, the question, &amp;quot;(How oily), do you like your salad dressing (t,)?&amp;quot; contains a Eq-subject] &amp;quot;how oily&amp;quot; that is an adjective.
    The absorber [pred-adjective] accepts the available float-object as its subparse, but only after confirming that POS is ADJECTIVE.
    The CURRENT-FOCUS has a number of other uses besides its role in movement.
    It always contains the subject whenever a verb is proposed, including verbs that are predicative objects of another verb, as in &amp;quot;I want to go to China.&amp;quot; It has also been found to be very effective for passing semantic information to be constrained by a future node, and it can play an integral role in pronoun referen
