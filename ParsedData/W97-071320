or the judges For example, we selected units 4 and 12, which represented the most important 11% of units as induced from the RS-tree btult by the first analyst However, we selected only unit 4, which represented 6% of the most important units as induced from the RS-tree built by the second analyst The reason for selecting only unit 4 for the second analyst was that units 1011, and 12 have the same score &#8212; 4 (see table 1) If we had selected units 10, 11 and 12 as well, we would have ended up selecting 22% of the units in text (1), which is farther from 11 than 6 Hence, we determined for each text the set of important units as labeled by judges and as derived from the RS-trees of those texts We calculated for each text the recall and precision of the important units derived from the RS-trees, with respect to the units labeled important by the judges The overall recall and precision was the same for both analysts 56% recall and 66% precision In contrast, the average recall and precision for the same percen
