y of class-based preferences with a little manual effort as demonstrated in Section 4.4.
    In all these cases we obtain high quality results, for example, massively outperforming Pantel et al.&#8217;s approach in the textual inference task.1
  
  
    Previous work on selectional preferences can be broken into four categories: class-based approaches (Resnik, 1996; Li and Abe, 1998; Clark and Weir, 2002; Pantel et al., 2007), similarity based approaches (Dagan et al., 1999; Erk, 2007), discriminative (Bergsma et al., 2008), and generative probabilistic models (Rooth et al., 1999).
    Class-based approaches, first proposed by Resnik (1996), are the most studied of the four.
    They make use of a pre-defined set of classes, either manually produced (e.g.
    WordNet), or automatically generated (Pantel, 2003).
    For each relation, some measure of the overlap between the classes and observed arguments is used to identify those that best describe the arguments.
    These techniques produce a human-interpreta
