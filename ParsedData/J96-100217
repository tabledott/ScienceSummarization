 To select a model from a set C of allowed probability distributions, choose the model p&#8222; E C with maximum entropy H(p): It can be shown that p, is always well-defined; that is, there is always a unique model p&#8222; with maximum entropy in any constrained set C. The maximum entropy principle presents us with a problem in constrained optimization: find the p&#8222; E C that maximizes H(p).
    In simple cases, we can find the solution to this problem analytically.
    This was true for the example presented in Section 2 when we imposed the first two constraints on p. Unfortunately, the solution to the general problem of maximum entropy cannot be written explicitly, and we need a more indirect approach.
    (The reader is invited to try to calculate the solution for the same example when the third constraint is imposed.)
    To address the general problem, we apply the method of Lagrange multipliers from the theory of constrained optimization.
    The relevant steps are outlined here; the reader is refe
