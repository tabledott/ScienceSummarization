lt language model feature, we use a standard backing-off word-based trigram language model (Ney, Generet, and Wessel 1995): The use of the language model feature in equation (18) helps take long-range dependencies better into account.
    Without this feature, we typically observe that the produced sentences tend to be too short.
    4.1.6 Conventional Lexicon.
    We also use a feature that counts how many entries of a conventional lexicon co-occur in the given sentence pair.
    Therefore, the weight for the provided conventional dictionary can be learned: The intuition is that the conventional dictionary LEX is more reliable than the automatically trained lexicon and therefore should get a larger weight.
    4.1.7 Additional Features.
    A major advantage of the log-linear modeling approach used is that we can add numerous features that deal with specific problems of the baseline statistical MT system.
    Here, we will restrict ourselves to the described set of features.
    Yet we could use grammatical
