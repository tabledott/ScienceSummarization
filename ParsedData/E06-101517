    This latter choice allows us to compare our results with previous literature work, e.g.
    (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004).
    In this section we compare our Fast Tree Kernel (FTK) approach with the Quadratic Tree Kernel (QTK) algorithm.
    The latter refers to the naive evaluation of Eq.
    1 as presented in (Collins and Duffy, 2002).
    R, i.e. f1 = 2P&#215; Figure 5 shows the learning time4 of the SVMs using QTK and FTK (over the SST structures) for the classification of one large argument (i.e.
    ARG0), according to different percentages of training data.
    We note that, with 70% of the training data, FTK is about 10 times faster than QTK.
    With all the training data FTK terminated in 6 hours whereas QTK required more than 1 week.
    The above results are quite interesting because they show that (1) we can use tree kernels with SVMs on huge training sets, e.g. on 122,774 instances and (2) the time needed to converge is approximately the one required b
