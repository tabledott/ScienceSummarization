dited data.
    Thus it appears that part of Bod's extraordinary performance can be explained by the fact that his data is much cleaner than the data used by other researchers.
    DOP does do slightly better on most measures.
    We performed a statistical analysis using a t-test on the paired differences between DOP and Pereira and Schabes performance on each run.
    On 2Ideally, we would exactly reproduce these experiments using Bod's algorithm.
    Unfortunately, it was not possible to get a full specification of the algorithm. the minimally edited ATIS data, the differences were statistically insignificant, while on Bod's data the differences were statistically significant beyond the 98'th percentile.
    Our technique for finding statistical significance is more strenuous than most: we assume that since all test sentences were parsed with the same training data, all results of a single run are correlated.
    Thus we compare paired differences of entire runs, rather than of sentences or constituents.
