concepts and their relations.
    Instead, we predict that other indicators apart from the simple words contained in the sentence could provide strong evidence for the modeling of rhetorical status.
    Also, the relatively small amount of training material we have at our disposal requires a machine learning method that makes optimal use of as many different kinds of features as possible.
    We predicted that this would increase precision and recall on the categories in which we are interested.
    The text classification experiment is still useful as it provides a nontrivial baseline for comparison with our intrinsic system evaluation presented in section 5.
    We use a naive Bayesian model as in Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen&#8217;s (1995) experiment (cf.
    Figure 9).
    Sentential features are collected for each sentence (Table 4 gives an overview of the features we used).
    Learning is supervised: In the training phase, associations between these features and human-provided target categories are learn
