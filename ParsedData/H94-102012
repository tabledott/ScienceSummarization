g; constituents marked -CLR typically correspond to Quirk et als [11] class of pred- ication adjuncts.
  At the moment, we distinguish a handful of semantic roles: direction, location, manner, purpose, and time, as well as the syntactic roles of surface subject, logi- cal subject, and (implicit in the syntactic structure) first and second verbal objects.
  NULL  ELEMENTS One important way in which the level of annotation of the current Penn Treebank exceeds that of the Lancaster project is that we have annotated nun elements in a wide range of cases.
  In the new annotation scheme, we co-index these null elements with the lexical material for which the null element stands.
  The current scheme happens to use two symbols for null elements: *T*, which marks WH-movement  and topical- ization, and * which is used for all other null elements, but this distinction is not very important.
  Co-indexing of null elements is done by suffixing an integer to non-terminal cate- gories (e.g~ NP-10, VP-25).
  This integer se
