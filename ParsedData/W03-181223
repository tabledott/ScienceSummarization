a hyponym of the constituent word.
    We test this hypothesis by ranking the constituent word&#8211; MWE pairs in decreasing order of LSA similarity, 3Recall that HSO is the only similarity measure which operates over verbs. and partitioning the ranking up into m partitions of equal size.
    We then calculate the average number of hyponyms per partition.
    If our hypothesis is correct, the earlier partitions (with higher LSA similarities) will have higher occurrences of hyponyms than the latter partitions.
    Figure 1 presents the mean hyponymy values across partitions of the NN compound data and verbparticle data, with m set to 3 in each case.
    For the NN compounds, we derive two separate rankings, based on the similarity between the head noun and NN compound (NN(head)) and the modifier noun and the NN compound (NN(mod)).
    In the case of the verb-particle data, WordNet has no classification of prepositions or particles, so we can only calculate the similarity between the head verb and verbparticle
