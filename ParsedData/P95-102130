o space limitations, in the following definitions we are forced to be somewhat imprecise when we identify a node in a derived d-tree with the node in the elementary d-trees (elementary nodes) from which it was derived.
    This is often done in TAG literature, and hopefully it will be clear what is intended.
    'We will discuss the notion of substitutability further in the next section.
    It is used to ensure the SA-tree is a tree.
    That is, an elementary structure cannot be subserted into more than one structure since this would be counter to our motivations for using subsertion for complementation. been d-sister-adjoined at some node with address n in a, in which case l will be the pair (d, n) where d E { left, right }.
    The tree set T(G) generated by G is defined as the set of trees 7 such that: 7' E Ti(G) for some i &gt; 0; 7' is rooted with the nonterminal S; the frontier of 7' is a string in Vit ; and 7 results from the removal of all d-edges from 7'.
    A d-edge is removed by merging the node
