   And subderivations headed by A1 with external nonterminals only at the leaves, internal nonterminals elsewhere, have probability 1/a1 (Goodman 1996).
    Goodman's main theorem is that this construction produces PCFG derivations isomorphic to DOP derivations with equal probability.
    This means that summing up over derivations of a tree in DOP yields the same probability as summing over all the isomorphic derivations in the PCFG.
    Note that Goodman's reduction method does still not allow for an efficient computation of the most probable parse tree of a sentence: there may still be exponentially many derivations generating the same tree.
    But Goodman shows that with his PCFG-reduction he can efficiently compute the aforementioned maximum constituents parse.
    Moreover, Goodman's PCFG reduction may also be used to estimate the most probable parse by Viterbi n-best search which computes the n most likely derivations and then sums up the probabilities of the derivations producing the same tree.
