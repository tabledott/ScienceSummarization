    Model 1: Joint Inferential Model (JIM) Given an inference rule pi =&gt; pj, our joint model defines the set of inferential SPs as the intersection of the relational SPs for pi and pj, as defined in the Joint Relational Model (JRM).
    For example, suppose relation pi = &#8220;X is charged by Y&#8221; gives the following SP scores under the JRM: and that pj = &#8220;Y announced the arrest of X&#8221; gives the following SP scores under the JRM: The intersection of the two sets of SPs forms the candidate inferential SPs for the inference pi =&gt; pj: We rank the candidate inferential SPs according to three ways to combine their relational SP scores, using the minimum, maximum, and average of the SPs.
    For example, for (Law Enforcement Agent, Person), the respective scores would be 1.45, 2.01, and 1.73.
    These different ranking strategies produced nearly identical results in our experiments, as discussed in Section 5.
