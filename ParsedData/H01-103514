  Current efforts to further improve the quality of the training data include use of iterative EM bootstrapping techniques.
  Separate pro- jection of bracketings from aligned parallel data with a 3rd lan- guage also shows promise for providing independent supervision, which can further help distinguish consensus signal from noise.
  5.3 BaseNP Projection Evaluation Because no bracketed evaluation data were available to us for French or Chinese, a third party fluent in these languages hand- bracketed a small, held-out 40-sentence evaluation set in both lan- guages, using a set of bracketing conventions that they felt were appropriate for the languages.
  Table 2 shows the performance rela- tive to these evaluation sets, as measured by exact-match bracketing precision (Pr), recall (R) and F-measure (F).
