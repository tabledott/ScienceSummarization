etransformation process is quite reliable.
    For the flattening transform the measures were greater than 97.5%, suggesting that while the error introduced by this process is noticable, the transformation/detransformation process does not introduce a very large error on its own.
    Table 1 presents an analysis of the sequences of trees produced via this detransformation process applied to the maximum-likelihood-parse trees.
    The columns of this table correspond to sequences of parse trees for section 22 of the WSJ corpus.
    The column labeled &amp;quot;22&amp;quot; describes the trees given in section 22 of the WSJ corpus, and the column labeled &amp;quot;22 Id&amp;quot; describes the maximum-likelihood-parse trees of section 22 of the WSJ corpus using the PCFG induced from those very trees.
    This is thus an example of training on the test data, and is often assumed to provide an upper bound on the performance of a learning algorithm.
    The remaining columns describe the sequences of trees produce
