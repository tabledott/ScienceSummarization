nto multiple stages, first estimating a distribution over all possible tags shift shift , and then estimating a distribution over the possible tag-word pairs given the correct tag shift shift .
    This means that only estimates for the tag-word pairs with the correct tag need to be computed.
    We also reduced the computational cost of terminal prediction by replacing the very large number of lower frequency tag-word pairs with tag-&#8220;unknown-word&#8221; pairs, which are also used for tag-word pairs which were not in the training set.
    We do not do any morphological analysis of unknown words, although we would expect some improvement in performance if we did.
    A variety of frequency thresholds were tried, as reported in section 6.
  
  
    The most novel aspect of our parsing model is the way in which the representation of the derivation history is computed.
    Choosing this representation is a challenge for any history-based statistical parser, because the history is of unbounded size.
