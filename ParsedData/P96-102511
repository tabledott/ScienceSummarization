te, or worse still it may be zero leaving the estimate undefined.
    (Collins 95) describes how a backed-off estimation strategy is used for making prepositional phrase attachment decisions.
    The idea is to back-off to estimates based on less context.
    In this case, less context means looking at the POS tags rather than the specific words.
    There are four estimates, El E2 E3 and E4) based respectively on: 1) both words and both tags; 2) cui and the two POS tags; 3) .thh, and the two POS tags; 4) the two POS tags alone. where V is the set of all words seen in training data: the other definitions of C follow similarly.
    Estimates 2 and 3 compete &#8212; for a given pair of words in test data both estimates may exist and they are equally 'specific' to the test case example.
    (Collins 95) suggests the following way of combining them, which favours the estimate appearing more often in training data: This gives three estimates: E1, E23 and E4, a similar situation to trigram language modeling for spe
