 keep C as small as possible.
    The original formulation of GIS (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) required the sum of the feature values for each event to be constant.
    Since this is not the case for many applications, the standard method is to add a &amp;quot;correction&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;slack&amp;quot;, feature to each event, defined as follows: For our tagging experiments, the use of a correction feature did not significantly affect the results.
    Moreover, we show in the Appendix, by a simple adaptation of Berger's proof for the convergence of HS (Berger, 1997), that GIS converges to the maximum likelihood model without a correction feature.1 The proof works by introducing a correction feature with fixed weight of 0 into the iis convergence proof.
    This feature does not contribute to the model and can be ignored during weight update.
    Introducing this null feature still satisfies Jensen's inequality, which is used to provide a lower bound on the change in likelihood between iterations, and t
