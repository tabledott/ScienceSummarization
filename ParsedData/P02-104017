he variance of sizeable test sets like the 500 sentence corpus.
    How many reference translations do we need?
    We simulated a single-reference test corpus by randomly selecting one of the 4 reference translations as the single reference for each of the 40 stories.
    In this way, we ensured a degree of stylistic variation.
    The systems maintain the same rank order as with multiple references.
    This outcome suggests that we may use a big test corpus with a single reference translation, provided that the translations are not all from the same translator.
  
  
    We had two groups of human judges.
    The first group, called the monolingual group, consisted of 10 native speakers of English.
    The second group, called the bilingual group, consisted of 10 native speakers of Chinese who had lived in the United States for the past several years.
    None of the human judges was a professional translator.
    The humans judged our 5 standard systems on a Chinese sentence subset extracted at random fro
