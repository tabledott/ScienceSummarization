 noun from which the adjective is derived.
    Example: &#8220;musical clock&#8221; - MAKE/PRODUCE, and &#8220;electric clock&#8221;- INSTRUMENT.
    Several learning models can be used to provide the discriminating function .
    So far we have experimented with three models: (1) semantic scattering, (2) decision trees, and (3) naive Bayes.
    The first is described below, the other two are fairly well known from the machine learning literature.
    Semantic Scattering.
    This is a new model developed by us particularly useful for the classification of compound nominals without nominalization.
    The semantic relation in this case derives from the semantics of the two noun concepts participating in these constructions as well as the surrounding context.
    Model Formulation.
    Let us define with and the sets of semantic class features (ie, function derived for each syntactic pattern.
    WordNet synsets) of the NP modifiers and, respectively NP heads (ie features 2 and 1).
    The compound nominal sem
