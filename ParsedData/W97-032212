le, as would often be the case in an unsupervised experiment, this mapping would have to be performed manually.
    The words disambiguated and their sense distributions are shown in Figure 3.
    All data, with the exception of the data for line, come from the ACL/DCI Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993).
    With the exception of line, each ambiguous word is tagged with a single sense defined in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978).
    The data for the 12 words tagged using LDOCE senses are described in more detail in (Bruce, Wiebe, and Pedersen, 1996).
    The line data comes from both the ACL/DCI WSJ corpus and the American Printing House for the Blind corpus.
    Each occurrence of line is tagged with a single sense defined in WordNet (Miller, 1995).
    This data is described in more detail in (Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees, 1993).
    Every experiment utilizes all of the sentences available for each word.
