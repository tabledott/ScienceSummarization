ns) is denumerably infinite (Kleene 1971), only termination becomes problematic: if a uniquely referring description [[P1]] n &#183; &#183; &#183; n [[Pn]] exists, then the algorithm will find one in finite time, since each of the n properties in the description will be found in finite time; if no distinguishing description exists, however, the algorithm never terminates.
    In the less likely case where the set of properties is nondenumerably infinite (i.e., it does not stand in a 1-1 relation to any set of natural numbers), completeness becomes problematic as well, since it is impossible for the algorithm to consider all properties; hence, successful combinations may be overlooked (cf.
    Kleene 1971,pages 6&#8211;8).
    Infinity of the set of distractors results in a different problem.
    The key question is whether there exists an effective procedure for removing distractors (i.e., for calculating C n [[Pi]]).
    If no such procedure exists, the Incremental Algorithm can only be applied after a prope
