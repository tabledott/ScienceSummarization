nly portion of OntoNotes that has a previously determined, widely used, standard split is the WSJ portion of the newswire data.
    For that subcorpus, we maintained the same partition.
    For all the other portions we created stratified training, development and test partitions over all the sources in OntoNotes using the procedure shown in Algorithm 1.
    The list of training, development and test document IDs can be found on the task webpage.4 This section gives details of the different annotation layers including the automatic models that were used to predict them, and describes the formats in which the data were provided to the participants.
    We will take a look at the manually annotated, or gold layers of information that were made available for the training data.
    Coreference The manual coreference annotation is stored as chains of linked mentions connecting multiple mentions of the same entity.
    Coreference is the only document-level phenomenon in OntoNotes, and the complexity of annotation
