 of the decision tasks, but rather can be learned in other contexts, or incorporated as background knowledge.
    This way, our approach allows the incorporation of constraints into decisions in a dynamic fashion and can therefore support task specific inferences.
    The significance of this is clearly shown in our experimental results.
    We develop our models in the context of natural language inferences and evaluate it here on the problem of simultaneously recognizing named entities and relations between them.
    This is the problem of recognizing the kill (KFJ, Oswald) relation in the sentence &#8220;J.
    V. Oswald was murdered at JFK after his assassin, R. U. KFJ...&#8221; This task requires making several local decisions, such as identifying named entities in the sentence, in order to support the relation identification.
    For example, it may be useful to identify that Oswald and KFJ are people, and JFK is a location.
    This, in turn, may help to identify that the kill action is described in th
