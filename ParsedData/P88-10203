vel of planning.
    The tree can be expanded in either depth-first or breadth-first fashion.
    Eventually, process bottoms out when either: (a) all input elements have been used and unsatisfied subgoals remain (in which case the structurer could request more input with desired properties from the encapsulating system); or (b) all goals are satisfied.
    If more than one plan (i.e., paragraph tree structure) is produced, the results are ordered by preferring trees with the minimum unused number of input elements and the minimum number of remaining unsatisfied subgoals.
    The best tree is then traversed in left-to-right order; leaves provide input to Penman to be generated in English and relations at branch points provide typical interclausal relation words or phrases.
    In this way the structurer performs top-down goal refinement down to the level of the input elements. and Further Work This work is also being tested in a completely separate domain: the generation of text in a multimedia system that an
