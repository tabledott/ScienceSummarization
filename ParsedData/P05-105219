    The reason we propose to use a feature-based kernel is that we can have a clear idea of what syntactic clues it represents and what kind of information it misses.
    This is important when developing or refining kernels, so that we can make them generate complementary information from different syntactic processing results.
  
  
    Experiments were carried out on the ACE RDR (Relation Detection and Recognition) task using hand-annotated entities, provided as part of the ACE evaluation.
    The ACE corpora contain documents from two sources: newswire (nwire) documents and broadcast news transcripts (bnews).
    In this section we will compare performance of different kernel setups trained with SVM, as well as different classifiers, KNN and SVM, with the same kernel setup.
    The SVM package we used is SVMlight.
    The training parameters were chosen using cross-validation.
    One-against-all classification was applied to each pair of entities in a sentence.
    When SVM predictions conflict on
