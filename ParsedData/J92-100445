is straightforward to have each node, as it occurs, or in a semantic bit specifying its case frame, and, in turn, fail if that bit has already been set.
    We have found that this strategy, in conjunction with the capability of erasing all semantic bits whenever a new clause is entered (through the meta level &amp;quot;detach&amp;quot; operation mentioned previously) serves the desired goal of eliminating the unwanted redundancies.
    Thus far, we have added all semantic filters by hand, and they are implemented in a hard-fail mode, i.e., if the semantic restrictions fail, the node dies.
    This strategy seems to be adequate for the limited domains that we have worked with thus far, but they will probably be inadequate for more complex domains.
    In principle, one could parse a large set of sentences with semantics turned off, collecting the semantic conditions that occurred at each node of interest.
    Then the system could propose to a human expert a set of filters for each node, based on its observat
