rget side of the aligned right-hand side is restricted to a Greibach Normal Form like structure: X ? ?
			?, ?b?,?
			(2) where X is a non-terminal, ? is a source side string ofarbitrary terminals and/or non-terminals.
			?b? is a corresponding target side where ?b is a string of termi nals, or a phrase, and ? is a (possibly empty) stringof non-terminals.
			defines one-to-one mapping be tween non-terminals in ? and ?.
			The use of phrase?b as a prefix maintains the strength of the phrase base framework.
			A contiguous English side with a(possibly) discontiguous foreign language side pre serves phrase-bounded local word reordering.
			At the same time, the target normalized framework stillcombines phrases hierarchically in a restricted man ner.
			2.3 Left-to-Right Target Generation.
			Decoding is performed by parsing on the source side and by combining the projected target side.
			We applied an Earley-style top-down parsing approach(Wu and Wong, 1998; Watanabe et al, 2006b; Zoll mann and Venugopal, 2006)
