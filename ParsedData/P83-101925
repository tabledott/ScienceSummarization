hown in Figure 3. where the Stack Editor conditions are again met.
    The current active node and the first element in the window are both NPs, and the active node ends with an edit signal.
    This causes the current node to be expunged, leaving only a single NP node, the one in the window.
    The final analysis of the sentence, after some more processing is the tree shown in Figure 4.
    I should reemphasize that the status of the edited elements is special.
    The copy editing rules remove a constituent, no matter how large, from the view of the parser.
    The parser continues as if those words had not been said.
    Although the expunged constituents may be available for semantic interpretation, they do not form part of the main predication.
    A somewhat different sort of self-correction, less sensitive to syntactic structure and flagged not only by the editing signal but also by a lexical item, is the restart.
    A restart triggers the expunction of all words from the edit signal back to the begi
