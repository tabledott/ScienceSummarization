e randomly chosen from a part-of-speech-tagged and lemmatized version of the BNC so that each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet (Miller et al. 1990) and was unambiguously tagged as &#8220;adjective&#8221; 98.6% of the time.
    Lapata, McDonald, and Keller used the part-of-speech-tagged version that is made available with the BNC and was tagged using CLAWS4 (Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994), a probabilistic partof-speech tagger, with error rate ranging from 3% to 4%.
    The lemmatized version of the corpus was obtained using Karp et al.&#8217;s (1992) morphological analyzer.
    The 30 adjectives ranged in BNC frequency from 1.9 to 49.1 per million words; that is, they covered the whole range from fairly infrequent to highly frequent items.
    Gsearch (Corley et al. 2001), a chart parser that detects syntactic patterns in a tagged corpus by exploiting a user-specified context-free grammar and a syntactic query, was used to extract all nouns occurring in a head-modifier relationship with
