that only finds one interpretation for an utterance that humans find ambiguous.
    The centering algorithm as defined by Brennan, Friedman and Pollard, (BFP algorithm), is derived from a set of rules and constraints put forth by Grosz, Josh i and Weinstein [GJW83, 0JW86].
    We shall not reproduce this algorithm here (See [BFP87]).
    There are two main structures in the centering algorithm, the CB, the BACKWARD LOOKING CENTER, which is what the discourse is 'about', and an ordered list, CF, of FORWARD LOOKING CENTERS, which are the discourse entities available to the next utterance for pronominalization.
    The centering framework predicts that in a local coherent stretch of dialogue, speakers will prefer to CONTINUE talking about the same discourse entity, that the CB will be the highest ranked entity of the previous utterance's forward centers that is realized in the current utterance, and that if anything is pronominalized the CB must be.
    In the centering framework, the order of the forward-center
