st average cosine (the choice with the largest value in column 1), choice (b), is the solution for this question; LRA answers the question correctly.
    For comparison, column 2 gives the cosines for the original pairs and column 3 gives the highest cosine.
    For this particular SAT question, there is one choice that has the highest cosine for all three columns, choice (b), although this is not true in general.
    Note that the gap between the first choice (b) and the second choice (d) is largest for the average cosines (column 1).
    This suggests that the average of the cosines (column 1) is better at discriminating the correct choice than either the original cosine (column 2) or the highest cosine (column 3).
