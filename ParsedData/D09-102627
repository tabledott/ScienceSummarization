sses to dominate its results, the latter assigns an equal weight to all classes, providing us complementary information.
    We ran experiments on a corpus from the Yahoo directory, modeling our experimental conditions on the ones described in (Ji et al., 2008).2 We considered documents drawn from 8 top level categories in the Yahoo directory, where each document can be placed in any number of subcategories.
    The results were mixed, with SVMs ahead on one measure: Labeled LDA beat SVMs on five out of eight datasets on MacroF1, but didn&#8217;t win on any datasets on MicroF1.
    Results are presented in Table 3.
    Because only a processed form of the documents was released, the Yahoo dataset does not lend itself well to error analysis.
    However, only 33% of the documents in each top-level category were applied to more than one sub-category, so the credit assignment machinery of L-LDA was unused for the majority of documents.
    We therefore ran an artificial second set of experiments considering only
