    A core problem in dealing with compositionality with DSMs is to account for the role of syntactic information in determining the way semantic representations are built from lexical items.
    For instance, the semantic representation assigned to The dog bites the man must be different from the one assigned to The man bites the dog, even if they contain exactly the same lexical items.
    Although it is still unclear which is the best way to compose the representation of content words in vector spaces, it is nowadays widely assumed that structured representations like those adopted by DM are in the right direction towards a solution to this issue, exactly because they allow distributional representations to become sensitive to syntactic structures (Erk and Pad&#180;o 2008).
    Compositionality and similar issues in DSMs lie beyond the scope of this paper.
    However, there is nothing in DM that prevents it from interacting
