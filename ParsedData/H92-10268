only the path from the current node to the root of the derivation along with the index of a branch (index of the child of a parent ) are examined in the decision tree model to build equivalence classes of histories.
  Other parts of the subtree are not examined in the implementation f HBG.
  Task  Domain We have chosen computer manuals as a task domain.
  We picked the most frequent 3000 words in a corpus of 600,000 words from 10 manuals as our vocabulary.
  We then extracted a few million words of sentences that are completely covered by this vocabulary from 40,000,000 words of computer manuals.
  A randomly chosen sen- tence from a sample of 5000 sentences from this corpus is: 396.
  It indicates whether a call completed suc- cessfully or if some error was detected that caused the call to fail.
  To define what we mean by a correct parse, we use a corpus of manually bracketed sentences at the University of Lancaster called the Treebank.
  The Treebank uses 17 non-terminal labels and 240 tags.
