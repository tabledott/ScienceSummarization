ernal knowledge sources and are automatically generated, this result is a strong indicator of MEN E's portability.
    The MUC-7 formal evaluation involved a shift in topic which was not communicated to the participants beforehand-the training data focused on airline disasters while the test data was on missile and rocket launches.
    MENE fared much more poorly on this data than it did on the within-domain data quoted above, achieving an F-measure of only 88.80 for the MENE + Proteus system and 84.22 for the MENE-only system.
    While 88.80 was still the fourth highest score out of the twelve participants in the evaluation, we feel that it is necessary to view this number as a cross-domain portability result rather than as an indicator of how the system can do on unseen data within its training domain.
    \Ve believe that if the system had been allowed to train on missile/rocket launch articles, its performance on these articles would have been much better.
