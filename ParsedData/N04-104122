nd extract hyponym/hypernym relationships, the utility of automatically generated clusters or manually compiled lists of terms is limited.
    Of course, it is a serious open question how many names each cluster (concept) should have, and how good each name is.
    Our method begins to address this thorny issue by quantifying the name assigned to a class and by simultaneously assigning a number that can be interpreted to reflect the strength of membership of each element to the class.
    This is potentially a significant step away from traditional all-or-nothing semantic/ontology representations to a concept representation scheme that is more nuanced and admits multiple names and graded set memberships.
