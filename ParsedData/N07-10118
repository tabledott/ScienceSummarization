) the positive example must have a higher score by a given margin, and (2) the change to A should be minimal.
    This second constraint is to reduce fluctuations in A.
    Let s+(A, xj) be the unnormalized score for the positive example and s&#8722;(A,xk) be the unnormalized score of the negative example.
    Each update solves the following 1Of the possible positive examples, we choose the one with the highest probability under the current model to guard against large fluctuations in parameter updates fc Figure 3: An example noun coreference factor graph for the First-Order Model in which factors f, model the coreference between sets of nouns, and ft enforce the transitivity among related decisions.
    Here, the additional node y123 indicates whether nouns {x1, x2, x3} are all coreferent.
    The number of y variables increases exponentially in the number of x variables.
    In this case, MIRA with a single constraint can be efficiently solved in one iteration of the Hildreth and D&#8217;Esopo method (Cens
