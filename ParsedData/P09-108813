Pnull 1 as the string probability of the non-null part of the rule: The terminal translation phrase pair distribution is a hierarchical Dirichlet Process in which each phrase are independently distributed according to DPs:4 and &#966;Fz is defined analogously.
    This prior encourages frequent phrases to participate in many different translation pairs.
    Moreover, as longer strings are likely to be less frequent in the corpus this has a tendency to discourage long translation units.
    Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling allows us to perform inference for the model described in 4.1 without restricting the infinite space of possible translation rules.
    To do this we need a method for sampling a derivation for a given sentence pair from p(d|d&#8722;).
    One possible approach would be to first build a packed chart representation of the derivation forest, calculate the inside probabilities of all cells in this chart, and then sample derivations top-down according to their inside probabilities (analogous to
