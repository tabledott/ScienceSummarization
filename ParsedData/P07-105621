n with two human-selected features (the words &#8220;excellent&#8221; and &#8220;poor&#8221;) to score features in a completely unsupervised manner.
    Then he classified documents according to various functions of these mutual information scores.

    We also note the work of Aue and Gamon (2005), who performed a number of empirical tests on domain adaptation of sentiment classifiers.
    Most of these tests were unsuccessful.
    We briefly note their results on combining a number of source domains.
    They observed that source domains closer to the target helped more.
    In preliminary experiments we confirmed these results.
    Adding more labeled data always helps, but diversifying training data does not.
