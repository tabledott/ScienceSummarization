anslation model as follows: the Tree to String model described in Section 6.2 we obtain a coverage improvement to 98% coverage from the original 30%.
    The accuracy of the tree to string model also improved with a %BLEU score of 32.0 which is the best performing single syntactic feature.
    In this section, we consider another method for carving up the full parse tree.
    However, in this method, instead of subtree-pairs we consider a decomposition of parse trees that provides each word with a fragment of the original parse tree as shown in Figure 3.
    The formalism of TreeAdjoining Grammar (TAG) provides the definition what each tree fragment should be and in addition how to decompose the original parse trees to provide the fragments.
    Each fragment is a TAG elementary tree and the composition of these TAG elementary trees in a TAG derivation tree provides the decomposition of the parse trees.
    The decomposition into TAG elementary trees is done by augmenting the parse tree for source and target
