#8220;true&#8221; proportion based on the gold dependencies (denoted as the &#8220;Gold&#8221; case in Figure 2) does not achieve optimal Table 6: Directed accuracy of our model (HDP-DEP) on sentences of length 10 or less and 20 or less from WSJ with different rulesets and with no rules, along with various baselines from the literature.
    Entries in this table are numbered for ease of reference in the text. performance.
    Thus, knowledge of the true languagespecific rule proportions is not necessary for high accuracy.
    We perform a set of additional experiments on English to gain further insight into HDP-DEP&#8217;s behavior.
    Our choice of language is motivated by the fact that a wide range of prior parsing algorithms were developed for and tested exclusively on English.
    The experiments below demonstrate that 1) universal rules alone are powerful, but languageand dataset-tailored rules can further improve performance; 2) our model learns jointly from the rules and data, outperforming a rules-on
