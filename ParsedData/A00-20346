, the slots are the direct object slot of the transitive SCF and the subject slot of the intransitive.
    For the conative, the slots are the direct object of the transitive and the PP of the up v pp SCF.
    Selectional preferences are acquired using the method devised by Li and Abe (1995).
    The preferences for a slot are represented as a tree cut model (Tcm).
    This is a set of disjoint classes that partition the leaves of the WordNet noun hypernym hierarchy.
    A conditional probability is attached to each of the classes in the set.
    To ensure the TCM covers all the word senses in WordNet, we modify Li and Abe's original scheme by creating hyponym leaf classes below all WordNet's hypernym (internal) classes.
    Each leaf holds the word senses previously held at the internal class.
    The nominal argument heads from a target slot are collected and used to populate the WordNet hierarchy with frequency information.
    The head lemmas are matched to the classes which contain them as synonyms.
