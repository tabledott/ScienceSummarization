    The first data set we use for our experiments consists of the tagged Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen corpus (LOB [Johansson 1986]).
    The corpus comprises about one million words of British English text, divided over 500 samples of 2,000 words from 15 text types.
    The tagging of the LOB corpus, which was manually checked and corrected, is generally accepted to be quite accurate.
    Here we use a slight adaptation of the tagset.

    An impression of the difficulty of the tagging task can be gained from the two baseline measurements in Table 2 (in
