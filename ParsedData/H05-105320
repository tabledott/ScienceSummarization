			It shows for example that (at least for this particular lexical sample), the predominant sense is much more dominant in a specific domain than it is in the general case, even for words which are notparticularly salient in that domain.
			Similar obser vations can be made about the average number ofencountered senses and the skew of the sense distributions.
			It also shows that although the predom inant sense is more dominant and domain-specific 8For SemCor, precision figures for the S sal words are up to 4% higher than the accuracy figures given, however they are still lower than accuracy using the domain specific corpora; we leave them out due to lack of space.
			423 senses are used more within a specific domain,there is still a need for taking local context into account when disambiguating words.
			The predomi nant sense heuristic is hard to beat for some wordswithin a domain, but others remain highly ambiguous even within a specific domain.
