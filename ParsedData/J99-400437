mputation of an infinite sum.
    We will write out this infinite sum, and discuss how to compute it exactly in all cases, except for one, where we approximate it.
    Consider the derivable items x1 ... xn, in some looping bucket B.
    If we build up derivation trees incrementally, when we begin processing bucket B, only those trees with no items from bucket B will be available, what we will call zeroth generation derivation trees.
    We can put these zeroth generation trees together to form first generation trees, headed by elements in B.
    We can combine these first generation trees with each other and with zeroth generation trees to form second generation trees, and so on.
    Formally, we define the generation of a derivation tree headed by x in bucket B to be the largest number of items in B we can encounter on a path from the root to a leaf.
    Consider the set of all trees of generation at most g headed by x.
    Call this set inner&lt;g(x,B).
    We can define the &lt;g generation value of an it
