 Section 2.5 explains how performance can be calculated for subdialogues as well as whole dialogues, while Section 2.6 summarizes the method.
    A general evaluation framework requires a task representation that decouples what an agent and user accomplish from how the task is accomplished using dialogue strategies.
    We propose that an attribute value matrix (AVM) can represent many dialogue tasks.
    This consists of the information that must be exchanged between the agent and the user during the dialogue, represented as a set of ordered pairs of attributes and their possible values.2 As a first illustrative example, consider a simplification of the train timetable domain of Dialogues 1 and 2, where the timetable only contains information about rush-hour trains between four cities, as shown in Table 1.
    This AVM consists of four attributes (abbreviations for each attribute name are also shown).3 In Table 1, these attribute-value pairs are annotated with the direction of information flow to represent w
