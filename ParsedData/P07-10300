  Fully Unsupervised Discovery of Concept-Specific Relationships by Web Mining
  
    We present a web mining method for discovering and enhancing relationships in which a specified concept (word class) participates.
    We discover a whole range of relationships focused on the given concept, rather than generic known relationships as in most previous work.
    Our method is based on clustering patterns that contain concept words and other words related to them.
    We evaluate the method on three different rich concepts and find that in each case the method generates a broad variety of relationships with good precision.
  
  
    The huge amount of information available on the web has led to a flurry of research on methods for automatic creation of structured information from large unstructured text corpora.
    The challenge is to create as much information as possible while providing as little input as possible.
    A lot of this research is based on the initial insight (Hearst, 1992) that certain lexical
