    Yet people have a very strong preference for Bill to be doing the shooting, so much so that they may even miss the second analysis.
    (To see that the dispreferred analysis is semantically quite plausible, consider Bill believed John to have been shot.)
    As evidence that structural preferences can even override semantic plausibility, take the following example (from Pinker 1994): This sentence is a garden path: The structural preference for yesterday to modify the most recent verb is so strong that it is easy to miss the (only) semantically plausible interpretation, paraphrased as Flip said yesterday that Squeaky will do the work.
    The model makes the correct predictions in these cases.
    In example (4), the statistics in Table 9 show that a PP is nine times as likely to attach low as to attach high when two verbs are candidate att
