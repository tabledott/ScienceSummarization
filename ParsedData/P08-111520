he future tense marker were segmented into tokens.
    We used the Buckwalter morphological analyzer and disambiguated the analysis using a simple unigram model trained on the Penn Arabic Treebank.
    Data and Settings.
    For these experiments we made use of the entire NIST MT08 training data, although for training of the system, we used a subsampling method proposed by Kishore Papineni that aims to include training sentences containing ngrams in the test data (personal communication).
    For all systems, we used a 5-gram English LM trained on 250M words of English training data.
    The NIST MT03 test set was used as development set for optimizing the interpolation weights using MER training (Och, 2003).
    Evaluation was carried out on the NIST 2005 and 2006 evaluation sets (MT05, MT06).
    Experimental results: Word-lattices improve translation quality.
    Results are presented in Table 5.
    Using word-lattices to combine the surface forms with morphologically segmented forms significantly improve
