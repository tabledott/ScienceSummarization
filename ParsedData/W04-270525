  We will conduct a formal evaluation of this procedure over the next month.
  
  
    We are just starting a new phase in this project: the creation of an automatic annotator.
    Using techniques similar to those described in (Meyers et al., 1998) in combination with our work on GLARF (Meyers et al., 2001a; Meyers et al., 2001b), we expect to build a hand-coded PROPBANKER a program designed to produce a PropBank/NomBank style analysis from Penn Treebank style input.
    Although the PropBanker should work with input in the form of either treebank annotation or treebankbased parser output, this project only requires application to the Penn Treebank itself.
    While previous programs with similar goals (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) were statistics-based, this tool will be based completely on hand-coded rules and lexical resources.
    Depending on its accuracy, automatically produced annotation should be useful as either a preprocessor or as an error detector.
    We expect high precision for very simple frame
