 log-linear probability mod els.
			They achieve coverage of 50.2% on section 23, as against 99% in our approach.
			(Riezler etal., 2002; Kaplan et al, 2004) describe how a care fully hand-crafted LFG is scaled to the full Penn-II treebank with log-linear based probability models.
			They achieve 79% coverage (full parse) and 21% fragement/skimmed parses.
			By the same measure,full parse coverage is around 99% for our automat ically acquired PCFG-based LFG approximations.Against the PARC 700, the hand-crafted LFG grammar reported in (Kaplan et al, 2004) achieves an f score of 79.6%.
			For the same experiment, our best automatically-induced grammar achieves an f-score of 80.24%.
	
	
			We presented and extensively evaluated a finiteapproximation of LDD resolution in automatically constructed, wide-coverage, robust, PCFG based LFG approximations, effectively turning the ?half?(or ?shallow?)-grammars presented in (Cahill et al, 2002) into ?full?
			or ?deep?
			grammars.
			In our approach, LDDs are resolved
