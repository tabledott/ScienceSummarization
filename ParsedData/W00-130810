a VBN and similarly the stem form can be either a VBP or VB.
    Hence for words that had occurred with only one of these tags in the training data the other was also included as. possible for assignment.
    The results on the test set for the Baseline model are shown in Table 3.
    This table also shows the results reported in Ratnaparkhi (1996: 142) for convenience.
    The accuracy figure for our model is higher overall but lower for unknown words.
    This may stem from the differences between the two models' feature templates, thresholds, and approximations of the expected values for the features, as discussed in the beginning of the section, or may just reflect differences in the choice of training and test sets (which are not precisely specified in Ratnaparkhi (1996)).
    The differences are not great enough to justify any definite statement about the different use of feature templates or other particularities of the model estimation.
    One conclusion that we can draw is that at present the additi
