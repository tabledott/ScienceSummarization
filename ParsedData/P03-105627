    Second, some common error types are not the result of simple and easily fixable shortcomings in independence assumptions.
    In particular, we found that coordination scoping ambiguity and N/V tag ambiguity are major sources of relatively catastrophic error for our parser.
    Interestingly, coordination scope ambiguity is recognized as perhaps the most recalcitrant problem in ETB parsing, while many cases of N/V ambiguity are particularly difficult points of linguistic analysis for Chinese, as discussed in Section 4.2.
    For the future, we believe that there is still room for considerable improvement in CTB parsing under our model.
    In addition to further PCFG refinements, tuning the dependency model may lead to improved performance.
    We found that head-dependent distances in the CTB are larger than in the ETB, consistent with the greater degree of center-embedding resulting from the mixed headedness of Chinese, and suggesting that a dependency model developed for English may not be optimal
