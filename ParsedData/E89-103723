    Allowing these different projections to simultaneously determine the surface structure seems at first blush to complicate the computational problem of generation, but a moment of reflection will show that that is not necessarily so.
    Although we have split up the different equations among several projections for conceptual clarity, computationally we can consider them to define one big attribute value structure with x and as special attributes, so the generation problem in this framework reduces to the problem of generating from attribute-value structures which are formally of the same type as f-structures (see Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988), Wedekind (1988), and Momma and Dorre (1987) for discussion).
    Differences in embedding.
    The potential of the system can also be illustrated with a case in which we find one more level of embedding in one language than we find in the other.
    This is generally the case if a modifier-head relation in the source language is reversed in
