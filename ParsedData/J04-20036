 f1J = f1 &#183; &#183; &#183; fJ.
    According to Bayes&#8217; decision rule, the optimal translation for f1J is the target string that maximizes the product of the target language model Pr(eI1) and the string translation model Pr(fJ1|eI1).
    Many existing systems for statistical machine translation (Garcia-Varea and Casacuberta 2001; Germann et al. 2001; Nie&#223;en et al.
    1998; Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999) implement models presented by Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and the target strings is described by alignments that assign target word positions to each source word position.
    The probability that a certain target language word will occur in the target string is assumed to depend basically only on the source words aligned with it.
  
  
    1.3.1 Morphology.
    Some publications have already dealt with the treatment of morphology in the framework of language modeling and speech recognition: Kanevsky, Roukos, and Sedivy (
