interest in the alignment of sentences and words in translated texts.
    Many studies show that for nicely parallel corpora high accuracy rates of up to 99% can be achieved for both sentence and word alignment (Gale &amp; Church, 1993; Kay &amp; Roscheisen, 1993).
    Of course, in practice &#8212; due to omissions, transpositions, insertions, and replacements in the process of translation &#8212; with real texts there may be all kinds of problems, and therefore robustness is still an issue (Langlais et al., 1998).
    Nevertheless, the results achieved with these algorithms have been found useful for the cornpilation of dictionaries, for checking the consistency of terminological usage in translations, for assisting the terminological work of translators and interpreters, and for example-based machine translation.
    By now, some alignment programs are offered commercially: Translation memory tools for translators, such as IBM's Translation Manager or Trados' Translator's Workbench, are bundled or can be u
