ary for discovery of noncompositional compounds for translation-related applications.
    Given a method for constructing statistical translation models, NCCs can be discovered by maximizing the models' information-theoretic predictive value over parallel data sets.
    This paper presented an efficient algorithm for such ontological discovery.
    Proper recognition of NCCs resulted in improved performance on a simple MT task.
    Lists of NCCs derived from parallel data may be useful for NLP applications that do not involve parallel data.
    Translation-oriented NCC lists can be used directly in applications that have a human in the loop, such as computer-assisted lexicography, computer-assisted language learning, and corpus linguistics.
    To the extent that translation-oriented definitions of compositionality overlap with other definitions, NCC lists derived from parallel data may benefit other applications where NCCs play a role, such as information retrieval (Evans &amp; Zhai, 1996) and language model
