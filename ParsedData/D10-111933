similar grammar induction techniques for context-dependent understanding problems, such as the one considered by Zettlemoyer &amp; Collins (2009).
    Such an approach would complement ideas for using high-order unification to model a wider range of language phenomena, such as VP ellipsis (Dalrymple et al., 1991).
