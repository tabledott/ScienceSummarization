re the same.
    This have to by the axiom z)A f ather(y, z) y) The very common problems involving reasoning about equality, which can be done efficiently, are thus translated into problems involving reasoning about the predicate rw-identical, which is very cumbersome. way to view this second solution is as a fix to the first solution.
    For &amp;quot;=1&amp;quot; we substitute the relation rw-identical, and by means of axiom schema (17), we force substitutions to propagate to the eventualities they occur in, and we force the distinction between referentially transparent and referentially opaque predicates to be made explicitly.
    It is thus an indirect way of rejecting Leibniz' Law. third solution is to say that 'the Evening Star' sentence (14) does not really refer to the Evening Star, but to some abstract entity somehow related to the Evening Star.
    That is, sentence (14) is really an example of metonymy.
    This may seem counterintuitive, and even bizarre, at first blush.
    But in fact the most
