on if there exists an allowable path connecting a synset associated with each word (for example, carrot and apple).
  A path is allowable if it contains no more than five links and conforms to one of eight patterns, the intuition behind which is that ?the longer the path and the more changes of direction, the lower the weight?.
  The details of the patterns are outside of the scope of this paper; all we need to know for the purposes of subsequent discussion is that an allowable path may include more than one link and that the directions of links on the same path may vary (among upward (hypernymy and meronymy), downward (hyponymy and holonymy) and horizontal (antonymy)).
  
  turns(c1, c2) (2) where C and k are constants (in practice, they used C = 8 and k = 1), and turns(c1, c2) is the number of times the path between c1 and c2 changes direction.
  2.5 Scaling the Network Despite its apparent simplicity, a widely acknowledged problem with the edge- counting approach is that it typically ?relies on the notion
