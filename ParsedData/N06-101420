odest, we are currently investigating alternative ways of interfacing with phrase table construction to make a larger impact on translation quality.
  
  
    Our approach is similar in spirit to co-training, where two classifiers, complementary by the virtue of having different views of the data, are trained jointly to encourage agreement (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999).
    One key difference in our work is that we rely exclusively on data likelihood to guide the two models in an unsupervised manner, rather than relying on an initial handful of labeled examples.
    The idea of exploiting agreement between two latent variable models is not new; there has been substantial previous work on leveraging the strengths of two complementary models.
    Klein and Manning (2004) combine two complementary models for grammar induction, one that models constituency and one that models dependency, in a manner broadly similar to the current work.
    Aside from investigating a different domain, one nov
