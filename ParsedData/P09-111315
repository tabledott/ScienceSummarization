   Our syntactic features are similar to those used in Snow et al. (2005).
    They consist of the conjunction of: A window node is a node connected to one of the two entities and not part of the dependency path.
    We generate one conjunctive feature for each pair of left and right window nodes, as well as features which omit one or both of them.
    Thus each syntactic row in Table 3 represents a single syntactic feature.
    Every feature contains, in addition to the content described above, named entity tags for the two entities.
    We perform named entity tagging using the Stanford four-class named entity tagger (Finkel et al., 2005).
    The tagger provides each word with a label from {person, location, organization, miscellaneous, none}.
    Rather than use each of the above features in the classifier independently, we use only conjunctive features.
    Each feature consists of the conjunction of several attributes of the sentence, plus the named entity tags.
    For two features to match, all of the
