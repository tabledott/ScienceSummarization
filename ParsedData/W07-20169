VM 89.1?1.2 Table 3: System Performance for the OntoNotes Lexical Sample task.
			Systems marked with an * were post-competition bug-fix submissions.grained senses provides consistently higher per formance than previous more fine-grained LexicalSample Tasks.
			The high scores here were foreshad owed in an evaluation involving a subset of the data last summer (Chen et al, 2006).
			Note that the best system performance is now closely approaching the ITA for this data of over 90%.
			Table 4 shows theperformance of the top 8 systems on all the indi vidual verbs and nouns in the test set.
			Owing to space constraints we have removed some lemmas that have perfect or almost perfect accuracies.
			At theright are mentioned the average, minimum and max imum performances of the teams per lemma, and atthe bottom are the average scores per lemma (with out considering the lemma frequencies) and broken down by verbs and nouns.
			A gap of about 10 points between the verb and noun performance seems to indicate that in g
