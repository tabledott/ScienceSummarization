trieved for each possible source-target pair allowed by the example.
    Adjacent source substrings are then combined to determine the lowest-cost subalignments for successively larger substrings of the bitext satisfying the constraints stated above.
    The successively larger substrings eventually span the entire source string, yielding the optimal hierarchical alignment for the bitext.
    This procedure has 0(n6) complexity in the number of words in the source (or target) sentence.
    In Alshawi and Douglas (2000) we describe a version of the alignment algorithm in which heads may have an arbitrary number of dependents, and in which the hierarchical alignments for the training corpus are refined by iterative reestimation.
    Building a head transducer involves creating appropriate head transducer states and tracing hypothesized head transducer transitions between them that are consistent with the hierarchical alignment of a bitext.
    The main transitions that are traced in our construction are those t
