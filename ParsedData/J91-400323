ded by the word.
    This type of analysis is essentially Aristotle's principle of opposition (cf.
    Lloyd 1968), and it will form the basis of one level of representation for a lexical item.
    The essential opposition denoted by a predicate forms part of what I will call the qualia structure of that lexical item.
    Briefly, the qualia structure of a word specifies four aspects of its meaning: I will call these aspects of a word's meaning its Constitutive Role, Formal Role, Telic Role, and its Agentive Role, respectively.'
    This minimal semantic distinction is given expressive force when combined with a theory of event types.
    For example, the predicate in 21a denotes the state of the door being closed.
    No opposition is expressed by this predicate.
    In 21b and 21c, however, the opposition is explicitly part of the meaning of the predicate.
    Both these predicates denote what I will call transitions.
    The intransitive use of close in 21b makes no mention of the causer, yet the transitio
