s to easily test large sets of features and study the impact of each feature ferent than the head word.
    The head words are indicated by the dashed arrows.
    The content words are indicated by the continuous arrows. on the augmented parser that outputs predicate argument structures.
    For this reason we used the C5 inductive decision tree learning algorithm (Quinlan, 2002) to implement both the classifier that identifies argument constituents and the classifier that labels arguments with their roles.
    Our model considers two sets of features: Feature Set 1 (FS1): features used in the work reported in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002) and (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) ; and Feature Set 2 (FS2): a novel set of features introduced in this paper.
    FS1 is illustrated in Figure 3 and FS2 is illustrated in Figure 4.
    In developing FS2 we used the following observations: Because most of the predicate arguments are prepositional attachments (PP) or relative clauses (SBAR), often the head word (hw) feature from F
