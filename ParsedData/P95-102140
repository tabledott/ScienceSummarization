ning the elementary structures.
    This method of arriving at SICs not only generalizes for the English and Kashmiri examples but also appears to apply to the case of long-distance scrambling and topicalization in German.
  
  
    It is straightforward to adapt the polynomial-time CKY-style recognition algorithm for a lexicalized UVG-DL of ftarnhow (199419) for DTG.
    The entries in this array recording derivations of substrings of input contain a set of elementary nodes along with a multi-set of components that must be inserted above during bottom-up recognition.
    These components are added or removed at substitution and insertion.
    The algorithm simulates traversal of a derived tree; checking for SICs and SACS can be done easily.
    Because of lexicalization, the size of these multi-sets is polynomially bounded, from which the polynomial time and space complexity of the algorithm follows.
    For practical purposes, especially for lexicalized grammars, it is preferable to incorporate some element
