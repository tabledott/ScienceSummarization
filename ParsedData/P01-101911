tifier scope by giving labels to pieces of semantic information and stating constraints between the labels.
    In MRS, labels called handles are associated with each EP.
    Scopal relationships are represented by EPs with handle-taking arguments.
    If all handle arguments are filled by handles labelling EPs, the structure is fully scoped, but in general the relationship is not directly specified in a logical form but is constrained by the grammar via additional conditions (handle constraints or hcons).4 A variety of different types of condition are possible, and the algebra developed here is neutral between them, so we will simply use relh to stand for such a constraint, intending it to be neutral between, for instance, =Q (qeq: equality modulo quantifiers) relationships used in MRS and the more usual &lt; relationships from UDRT (Reyle, 1993).
    The conditions in hcons are accumulated by append.
    To accommodate scoping in the algebra, we will make hooks and holes pairs of indices and handles.
