    Here, we refer to it as &#8216;Maximum Discriminant Functions sum&#8217; (MDF) parameter estimation.
    MDF estimation substitutes p(x, y) with discriminant functions g(x, y).
    Therefore, to estimate the parameter &#920; of JESS-CM by using MDF estimation, the following objective function is maximized with a fixed &#955;0: where p(&#920;) is a prior probability distribution of &#920;.
    Since the normalization factor does not affect the determination of y, the discriminant function of JESS-CM shown in Equation 2 is defined as g(x, y; &#955;0, &#920;) = Hc&#8712;C &#936;0 c(yc, x; &#955;0, &#920;).
    With a fixed &#955;0, the local maximum of L2(&#920;|&#955;0) around the initialized value of &#920; can be estimated by an iterative computation such as the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).
    A parameter estimation algorithm of &#955;0 and &#920; can be obtained by maximizing the objective functions L1(&#955;0|&#920;) and L2(&#920;|&#955;0) iteratively and alternately.
