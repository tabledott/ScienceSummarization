 si nor the words in Ci,n are retained.
    The union of the retained sets will be denoted RT,n, that is, the union of all sets {si} U Ci,n with precision on the training set &gt; T. In Wiebe (2000), the seeds (the sis) were extracted from the subjective-element annotations in corpus WSJ-SE.
    Specifically, the seeds were the adjectives that appear at least once in a subjective element in WSJ-SE.
    In this article, the opinion piece corpus is used to move beyond the manual annotations and small corpus of the earlier work, and a much looser criterion is used to choose the initial seeds: All of the adjectives (verbs) in the training data are used.
    The algorithm for the process is given in Figure 2.
    There is one small difference for adjectives and verbs noted in the figure, that is, the precision threshold of 0.28 for adjectives versus 0.23 for verbs.
    These thresholds were determined using validation data.
    Seeds and their clusters are assessed on a training set for many parameter settings (cl
