    Hieroglyphics remained undeciphered for centuries until the discovery of the Rosetta stone in the beginning of the 19th century in Rosetta, Egypt.
    The Rosetta stone is a tablet of black basalt containing parallel inscriptions in three different scripts: Greek and two forms of ancient Egyptian writings (demotic and hieroglyphics).
    Jean-Francois Champollion, a linguist and Egyptologist, made the assumption that these inscriptions were parallel and managed after several years of research to decipher the hieroglyphic inscriptions.
    He used his work on the Rosetta stone as a basis from which to produce the first comprehensive hieroglyphics dictionary (Budge 1989).
    In this paper, we describe a modern version of a similar approach: given a large corpus in two
