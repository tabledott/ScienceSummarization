 and efficient exploitation of the Internet Archive.
    In Section 2 we lay out the STRAND architecture, which is based on the insight that translated Web pages tend quite strongly to exhibit parallel structure, permitting them to be identified even without looking at content; we also show how we have improved STRAND&#8217;s performance by training a supervised classifier using structural parameters rather than relying on manually tuned thresholds.
    In Section 3 we present an approach to detecting translations that relies entirely on content rather than structure, demonstrating performance comparable to STRAND&#8217;s using this orthogonal source of information.
    In Section 4 we describe how we have adapted the STRAND approach to the Internet Archive, dramatically improving our ability to identify parallel Web pages on a large scale.
    Section 5 puts all the pieces together, using structural and combined content-structure matching of pages on the Internet Archive in order to obtain a sizable corpus o
