features of the transcripts of our corpus, which, as noted in Section 3, had been prepared independently of this study and without regard for intonational analysis.
    We examined transcriptions of all tokens of now in our combined sample to determine whether prosodic phrasing was reliably associated with orthographic marking.
    There were no likely orthographic clues to accent type or placement, such as capitalization, in the transcripts.
    Of all 60 instances of now that were absolutely first in their intonational phrase, 34 (56.7%) were preceded by punctuation&#8212;a comma, dash, or end punctuation&#8212;and 17 (28.3%) were first in speaker turn, and thus orthographically marked by indication of speaker name.
    So, in 51(85%) cases, first position in intonational phrase coincided with orthographic indicators in the transcript.
    No now that was not absolutely first in its intonational phrase&#8212;for example, none that was merely first in its intermediate phrase&#8212;was so marked.
