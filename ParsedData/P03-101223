 added on the &#8220;many&#8221; side are less than the probabilities of the links that would be created.
    Under the current implementation, the training corpus is one-to-one, which gives our model no opportunity to learn many-to-one alignments.
    We are pursuing methods to create an extended algorithm that can handle many-to-one alignments.
    This would involve training from an initial alignment that allows for many-to-one links, such as one of the IBM models.
    Features that are related to multiple links should be added to our set of feature types, to guide intelligent placement of such links.

    We have presented a simple, flexible, statistical model for computing the probability of an alignment given a sentence pair.
