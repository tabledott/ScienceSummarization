vice versa.
  Although the conceptual picture is 1 4 5 P~oc.
  oF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 quite straightforward, the actual com- putations to produce the structures can be resource intensive, in some cases quite impractical.
  At the last stage, when the idiosyncratic behavior of particular lexical items has been taken into account in the composition of the lexicon with the rule transducers, all morphological diacritics such as the +DPL tag for French nouns with double plurals can be el iminated because the rules that depend on them have been applied.
  In full compliance with our desiderata in Section 2, the resulting transducer maps, among other  th ings,  social-ddmocrate+masc+pl directly to sociaux-ddmocrates, and vice versa.
  Discussion Finite-state morphology tests on the ob- servation that ordinary morphological al- ternations involve regular elations.
  This is the basis of the early work by Kaplan and Kay [7] on convert ing ordered rewrite rules to a cascade of transducers and the parall
