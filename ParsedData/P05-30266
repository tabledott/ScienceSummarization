ws the algorithm to ensure that aligned words are not included in a synthetic combination more than once.
    Third, by allowing long range matches, the synthetic combination generation algorithm can consider different plausible orderings of the matched words, based on their location in the original translations.
    After the matcher has word aligned the original system translations, the decoder goes to work.
    The hypothesis generator produces synthetic combinations of words and phrases from the original translations that satisfy a set of adequacy constraints.
    The generation algorithm is an iterative process and produces these translation hypotheses incrementally.
    In each iteration, the set of existing partial hypotheses is extended by incorporating an additional word from one of the original translations.
    For each partial hypothesis, a data-structure keeps track of the words from the original translations which are accounted for by this partial hypothesis.
