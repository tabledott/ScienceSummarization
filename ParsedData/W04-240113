 be a {0,1}-variable, defined to be 1 if and only if variable u is labeled i, where u &#8712; E, i &#8712; GE or u &#8712; R, i &#8712; GR.
    For example, x{E1,21 = 1 when the label of entity E1 is 2; x{R23,31 = 0 when the label of relation R23 is not 3.
    Let x{Rij,r,Ei,e11 be a {0,1}-variable indicating whether relation Rij is assigned label r and its first argument, Ei, is assigned label e1.
    For instance, x{R12,1,E1,21 = 1 means the label of relation R12 is 1 and the label of its first argument, E1, is 2.
    Similarly, x{Rij,r,Ej,e21 = 1 indicates that Rij is assigned label r and its second argument, Ej, is assigned label e2.
    With these definitions, the optimization problem can be represented as the following ILP problem (Figure 1).
    Equations (2) and (3) require that each entity or relation variable can only be assigned one label.
    Equations (4) and (5) assure that the assignment to each entity or relation variable is consistent with the assignment to its neighboring variables.
