em&#8217;s derivations as though they had syntactic categories.
    First, Table 4 shows that the system using the tree-to-tree grammar used the glue rule much less and performed more matching substitutions.
    That is, in order to minimize errors on the tuning set, the model learned to build syntactically richer and more well-formed derivations.
    Tables 5 and 6 show how the new syntax features affected particular substitutions.
    In general we see a shift towards more matching substitutions; correct placement of punctuation is particularly emphasized.
    Several changes appear to have to do with definiteness of NPs: on the English side, adding the syntax features encourages matching substitutions of type DT \ NP-C (anarthrous NP), but discourages DT \ NP-C and NN from substituting into NP-C and vice versa.
    For example, a translation with the rewriting NP-C &#8212;* DT \ NP-C begins with &#8220;24th meeting of the Standing Committee...,&#8221; but the system using the fuzzy tree-to-tree grammar cha
