nts for t(f I e), and these are the same for Models 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  
  
    We have used a large collection of training data to estimate the parameters of the models described above.
    Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) have described an algorithm with which one can reliably extract French and English sentences that are translations of one another from parallel corpora.
    They used the algorithm to extract a large number of translations from several years of the proceedings of the Canadian parliament.
    From these translations, we have chosen as our training data those for which both the English sentence and the French sentence are 30 or fewer words in length.
    This is a collection of 1,778,620 translations.
    In an effort to eliminate some of the typographical errors that abound in the text, we have chosen as our English vocabulary all of those words that appear at least twice in English sentences in our data, and as our French vocabulary all of those words that appear at least twice in French senten
