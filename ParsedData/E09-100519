s over synsets.
    The results of various in-house made experiments replicating (Mihalcea, 2005) also confirm this observation.
    Note also that our methods are simpler than the combination strategy used in (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007), and that we did not perform any parameter tuning as they did.
    In (Navigli and Velardi, 2005) the authors develop a knowledge-based WSD method based on lexical chains called structural semantic interconnections (SSI).
    Although the system was first designed to find the meaning of the words in WordNet glosses, the authors also apply the method for labeling text sequences.
    Given a text sequence, SSI first identifies monosemous words and assigns the corresponding synset to them.
    Then, it iteratively disambiguates the rest of terms by selecting the senses that get the strongest interconnection with the synsets selected so far.
    The interconnection is calculated by searching for paths on the LKB, constrained by some hand-made rules of possible semantic patterns.
