rning is used to automatically derive anaphora resolution algorithms from automatically produced feature representations; the learned algorithms outperform a manually derived system (whose average recall and precision was 66.5% and 72.9%, respectively).
    Finally, the results of Litman (1996) show that there are many alternatives to the cue phrase algorithm used here, including some that use feature sets that can be fully coded automatically.
