  The original Levin classes constitute the first few levels in the hierarchy, with each class subsequently refined to account for further semantic and syntactic differences within a class.
  The argument list consists of thematic labels from a set of 20 such possible labels (Agent, Patient, Theme, Experiencer, etc.).
  The syntactic frames represent a mapping of the list of schematic labels to deep-syntactic arguments.
  Additional semantic information for the verbs is expressed as a set (i.e., conjunction) of semantic predicates, such as motion, contact, transfer_info.
  Currently, all Levin verb classes have been assigned thematic labels and syntactic frames, and over half the classes are completely described, including their semantic predicates.
  In many cases, the additional information that VerbNet provides for each
