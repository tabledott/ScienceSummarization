s proposed by the algorithm for two reasons.
    First, it makes the trial &amp;quot;blind,&amp;quot; that is, the judge does not know the algorithm's result when judging.
    Second, it allows comparison of results for different algorithms on a common basis.
    The program made 36 errors out of 621 total alignments (5.8%) for English-French and 19 errors out of 695 (2.7%) alignments for English-German.
    Overall, there were 55 errors out of a total of 1316 alignments (4.2%).
    The higher error rate for EnglishFrench alignments may result from the German being the original, so that the English and German differ by one translation, while the English and French differ by two translations.
    Table 6 breaks down the errors by category, illustrating that complex matches are more difficult.
    1-1 alignments are by far the easiest.
    The 2-1 alignments, which come next, have four times the error rate for 1-1.
    The 2-2 alignments are harder still, but a majority of the alignments are found.
    The 3-1
