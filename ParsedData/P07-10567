ch as prepositions and determiners, which are good indicators of parts of speech.
    This is not the case for sentiment classification, however.
    Therefore, we require that pivot features also be good predictors of the source label.
    Among those features, we then choose the ones with highest mutual information to the source label.
    Table 1 shows the set-symmetric differences between the two methods for pivot selection when adapting a classifier from books to kitchen appliances.
    We refer throughout the rest of this work to our method for selecting pivots as SCL-MI.
  
  
    We constructed a new dataset for sentiment domain adaptation by selecting Amazon product reviews for four different product types: books, DVDs, electronics and kitchen appliances.
    Each review consists of a rating (0-5 stars), a reviewer name and location, a product name, a review title and date, and the review text.
    Reviews with rating &gt; 3 were labeled positive, those with rating &lt; 3 were labeled negative, and t
