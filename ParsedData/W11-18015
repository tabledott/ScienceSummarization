ity types as well as in introducing a new event category for high-level biological processes.
    The task was implemented in collaboration with domain experts and informed by prior studies on domain information extraction requirements (Pyysalo et al., 2010; Ananiadou et al., 2011), including the support of systems such as PATRIC (http://patricbrc.org).
    The bacteria track consists of two tasks, BB and BI.
    2.4.1 Bacteria biotope task (BB) The aim of the BB task (Bossy et al., 2011) is to extract the habitats of bacteria mentioned in textbooklevel texts written for non-experts.
    The texts are Web pages about the state of the art knowledge about bacterial species.
    BB targets general relations, Localization and PartOf, and is challenging in that texts contain more coreferences than usual, habitat references are not necessarily named entities, and, unlike in other BioNLP-ST 2011 tasks, all entities need to be recognized by participants.
    BB is the first task to target phenotypic information and,
