document date being incorrect as a reference time.
    Part of speech tagging: Some errors, both in the identification of time expressions and the assignment of values, can be traced to incorrect part of speech tagging in the preprocessing; many of these errors should be easily correctable.
  
  
    A total of 44 errors were made in the identification of TIMEX expressions.
    Not yet implemented: The biggest source of errors in identifying time expressions was formats that had not yet been implemented.
    For example, one third (7 of 21, 5 of which were of type TIME) of all missed time expressions came from numeric expressions being spelled out, e.g.
    &#8220;nineteen seventynine&#8221;.
    More than two thirds (11 of 16) of the time expressions for which the program incorrectly found the boundaries of the expression (bad extent) were due to the unimplemented pattern &#8220;Friday the 13th&#8221;.
    Generalization of the existing patterns should correct these errors.
