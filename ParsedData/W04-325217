limited to keyword extraction &#8211; as our system is &#8211; but they were also allowed to perform keyword generation, which eventually results in keywords that do not explicitly appear in the text.
    For comparison purposes, we are using the results of the state-of-the-art keyword extraction system reported in (Hulth, 2003).
    Shortly, her system consists of a supervised learning scheme that attempts to learn how to best extract keywords from a document, by looking at a set of four features that are determined for each &#8220;candidate&#8221; keyword: (1) within-document frequency, (2) collection frequency, (3) relative position of the first occurrence, (4) sequence of part of speech tags.
    These features are extracted from both training and test data for all &#8220;candidate&#8221; keywords, where a candidate keyword can be: Ngrams (unigrams, bigrams, or trigrams extracted from the abstracts), NP-chunks (noun phrases), patterns (a set of part of speech patterns detected from the keywords attached t
