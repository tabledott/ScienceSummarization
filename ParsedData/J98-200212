e, bird, bug, bee, insect].
    The class of tree cut models of a fixed thesaurus tree is then obtained by restricting the partition F in the definition of a class-based model to be those partitions that are present as a cut in that thesaurus tree.
    Formally, a tree cut model M can be represented by a pair consisting of a tree cut F and a probability parameter vector 0 of the same length, that is: where F and 9 are: where C1, C2, , Ck+i is a cut in the thesaurus tree and Ek,4-11P(C,) = 1 is satisfied.
    For simplicity we sometimes write P(C,), i = 1, , (k + 1) for P(C, I v, r).
    If we use MLE for the parameter estimation, we can obtain five tree cut models from the co-occurrence data in Figure 1; Figures 4-6 show three of these.
    For example, A tree cut model with [BIRD, bug, bee, insect].
    J14= ([BIRD, bug, bee, insect], [0.8, 0, 0.2, 0]) shown in Figure 5 is one such tree cut model.
    Recall that A/I defines a conditional probability distribution I) ki(n I v, r) as follows: For any noun that
