 parser will have to compute the product of two Catalans for each way of picking i and j, which is somewhat expensive.11 Fortunately, the Catalan function has some special properties so that it is possible algebraically to remove the references to i and j.
    In the next section we show how this expression can be reformulated in terms of n, the total number of PPs.
    Some readers may have noticed that expression (24) is in convolution form.
    We will make use of this in the reformulation.
    Notice that the Catalan series is a fixed point under auto-convolution (except for a shift); that is, multiplying a Catalan power series (i.e., 1 + x + 2x2 + 5x3 + 14x4 + Catix1 ...) with itself produces another polynomial with Catalan coefficients.12 The multiplication is worked out for the first few terms.
    This property can be summarized as: (25) E Cat, xi E Cat x'1i xi = E Catn+ X where n equals i+j.
    Intuitively, this equation says that if we have two &amp;quot;every way ambiguous&amp;quot; (Catalan) cons
