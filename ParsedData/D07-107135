			We presented a new, online algorithm for learning a combinatory categorial grammar (CCG), together with parameters that define a log-linear pars ing model.
			We showed that the use of non-standardCCG combinators is highly effective for parsing sen 10Measurements on the Geo880 domain showed that in the 4 iterations, 83.3% of all parses were successful at step 1.
