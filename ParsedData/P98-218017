rel structures from the Encarta&#174; 98 text to MindNet.
    Statistics on that pass are given below: Besides our venture into additional English data, we fully intend to apply the same methodologies to text in other languages as well.
    We are currently developing NLP systems for 3 European and 3 Asian languages: French, German, and Spanish; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.
    The syntactic parsers for some of these languages are already quite advanced and have been demonstrated publicly.
    As the systems for these languages mature, we will create corresponding MindNets, beginning, as we did in English, with the processing of machine-readable reference materials and then adding information gleaned from corpora.
