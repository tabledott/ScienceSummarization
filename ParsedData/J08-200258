of the same label in a candidate argument sequence, together with the phrase types of the nodes labeled with that label.
    For example, (NP-ARG0, WHNP-ARG0) is a common pattern of this form.
    Variants of this feature template also indicate whether all repeated arguments are sisters in the parse tree, or whether all repeated arguments are adjacent in terms of word spans.
    These features can provide robustness to parser errors, making it more likely to assign the same label to adjacent phrases that may have been incorrectly split by the parser.
    In Section 5.4 we report results from the joint model and an ablation study to determine the contribution of each of the types of joint features.
    Here we describe the application in testing of a joint model for semantic role labeling, using a local model PSRL and a joint re-ranking model PrSRL.
    The local model PSRL is used to generate N non-overlapping joint assignments L1, ... , LN.
    One option is to select the best Li according to PrSRL, as in Eq
