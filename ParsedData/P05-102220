to the node&#8217;s right.
    E1 and E2 are parameters of this schema; here E1 = 1 or E1 = 2 and E2 = 1.
    Rule (271,655) The instances of this schema are local trees, annotated with varying amounts of contextual information controlled by the schema&#8217;s parameters.
    This schema was inspired by a similar schema in Collins and Koo (in submission).
    The parameters to this schema control whether nodes are annotated with their preterminal heads, their terminal heads and their ancestors&#8217; categories.
    An additional parameter controls whether the feature is specialized to embedded or non-embedded clauses, which roughly corresponds to Emonds&#8217; &#8220;nonroot&#8221; and &#8220;root&#8221; contexts (Emonds, 1976).
    NGram (54,567) The instances of this schema are E-tuples of adjacent children nodes of the same parent.
    This schema was inspired by a similar schema in Collins and Koo (in submission).
    This schema has the same parameters as the Rule schema, plus the length E of the tuples
