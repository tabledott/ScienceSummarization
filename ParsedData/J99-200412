  A more detailed discussion of LTAGs with an example and some of the key properties of elementary trees is presented in Appendix A.
  
  
    Part-of-speech disambiguation techniques (POS taggers) (Church 1988; Weischedel et al. 1993; Brill 1993) are often used prior to parsing to eliminate (or substantially reduce) the part-of-speech ambiguity The POS taggers are all local in the sense that they use information from a limited context in deciding which tag(s) to choose for each word.
    As is well known, these taggers are quite successful.
    In a lexicalized grammar such as the Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG), each lexical item is associated with at least one elementary structure (tree).
    The elementary structures of LTAG localize dependencies, including long-distance dependencies, by requiring that all and only the dependent elements be present within the same structure.
    As a result of this localization, a lexical item may be (and, in general, almost always is) associated with more than
