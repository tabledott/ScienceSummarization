lution, which has not been dealt with here.
    One possibility would be to semantically disambiguate the words in the corpora beforehand, another to look at co-occurrences between significant word sequences instead of co-occurrences between single words.
    To conclude with, let us add some speculation by mentioning that the ability to identify word translations from non-parallel texts can be seen as an indicator in favor of the associationist view of human language acquisition (see also Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997, and Wettler &amp; Rapp, 1993).
    It gives us an idea of how it is possible to derive the meaning of unknown words from texts by only presupposing a limited number of known words and then iteratively expanding this knowledge base.
    One possibility to get the process going would be to learn vocabulary lists as in school, another to simply acquire the names of items in the physical world.
