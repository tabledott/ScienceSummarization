tionary&amp;quot; (p. 335); a consideration of greater import then than now.
    The Klein and Simmons algorithm uses a palette of 30 categories, and claims an accuracy of 90% in tagging.
    The algorithm first seeks each word in dictionaries of about 400 function words, and of about 1500 words which &amp;quot;are exceptions to the computational rules used&amp;quot; (p. 339).
    The program then checks for suffixes and special characters as clues. of all, frame tests applied.
    These work on scopes bounded by unambiguous words, as do later algorithms.
    However, Klein and Simmons impose an explicit limit of three ambiguous words in a row.
    For such ambiguous words, the pair of unambiguous categories bounding it is mapped into a list.
    The list includes all known sequences of tags occurring between the particular bounding tags; all such sequences of the correct length become candidates.
    The program then matches the candidate sequences against the ambiguities remaining from earlier steps of the
