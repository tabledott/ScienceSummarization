SI, given the same input.
    The slightly superior performance on rR and rP indicates that CW leaves fewer words unclustered, which can be advantageous when using the clusters as clues in word sense disambiguation.
  
  
    Chinese Whispers, an efficient graph-clustering algorithm was presented and described in theory and practice.
    Experiments with synthetic graphs showed that for small graphs, results can be inconclusive due to its non-deterministic nature.
    But while there exist plethora of clustering approaches that can deal well with small graphs, the power of CW lies in its capability of handling very large graphs in reasonable time.
    The application field of CW rather lies in size regions, where other approaches&#8217; solutions are intractable.
    On the NLP data discussed, CW performs equally or better than other clustering algorithms.
    As CW &#8211; like other graph clustering algorithms &#8211; chooses the number of classes on its own and can handle clusters of different sizes, it is
