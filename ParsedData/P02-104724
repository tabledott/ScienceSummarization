    In our paper, we show that massive amounts of data can have a major impact on discourse processing research as well.
    Our experiments show that discourse relation classifiers that use very simple features achieve unexpectedly high levels of performance when trained on extremely large data sets.
    Developing lower-noise methods for automatically collecting training data and discovering features of higher predictive power for discourse relation classification than the features presented in this paper appear to be research avenues that are worthwhile to pursue.
    Over the last thirty years, the nature, number, and taxonomy of discourse relations have been among the most controversial issues in text/discourse linguistics.
    This paper does not settle the controversy.
    Rather, it raises some new, interesting questions because the lexical patterns learned by our algorithms can be interpreted as empirical proof of existence for discourse relations.
