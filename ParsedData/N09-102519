atures (the third- and eighth-ranked reward and twelfthranked penalty) shape the translation of shuo &#8216;said&#8217;, preferring translations with an overt complementizer that and without a comma.
    Thus these features work together to attack a frequent problem that our targetsyntax features also addressed.
    Figure 2 shows the performance of Hiero with all of its features on the tuning and test sets over time.
    The scores on the tuning set rise rapidly, and the scores on the test set also rise, but much more slowly, and there appears to be slight degradation after the 18th pass through the tuning data.
    This seems in line with the finding of Watanabe et al. (2007) that with on the order of 10,000 features, overfitting is possible, but we can still improve accuracy on new data.
    Early stopping would have given +0.2 B1.Eu over the results reported in Table 1.1
  
  
    We have described a variety of features for statistical machine translation and applied them to syntaxbased and hierarchical s
