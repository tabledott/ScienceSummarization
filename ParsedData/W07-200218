			participants are above the MFS baseline, showingthat all of them learned useful clustering informa tion.
			Note that UOY was specially affected by the original split.
			The distribution of senses in this split did not vary (cf.
			Table 2).Finally, we also studied the supervised evalua tion of several random clustering algorithms, which can attain performances close to MFS, thanks to the mapping information.
			This is due to the fact that therandom clusters would be mapped to the most fre quent senses.
