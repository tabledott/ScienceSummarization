 being rather obscure.
    Moreover, there is no longer any need to remove these readings explicitly by rules, because the global pruning removes readings which have not obtained any &amp;quot;extra evidence&amp;quot;.
    Roughly, one could say that the REMOVE rules of the Constraint Grammar are replaced by the INDEX rules.
    The overall result is that the rules in the new framework are much more careful than those of ENGCG.
    As already noted, the dependency grammar has a big advantage over ENGCG in dealing with ambiguity.
    Because the dependencies are supposed to form a tree, we can heuristically prune readings that are not likely to appear in such a tree.
    We have the following hypotheses: (1) the dependency forest is quite sparse and a whole parse tree can not always be found; (2) pruning should favour large (sub)trees; (3) unlinked readings of a word can be removed when there is a linked reading present among the alternatives; (4) unambiguous subtrees are more likely to be correct than ambiguo
