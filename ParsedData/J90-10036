n unassociated words (e.g.
    NURSE) (Meyer etal.
    1975, p. 98) Much of this psycholinguistic research is based on empirical estimates of word association norms as in Palermo and Jenkins (1964), perhaps the most influential study of its kind, though extremely small and somewhat dated.
    This study measured 200 words by asking a few thousand subjects to write down a word after each of the 200 words to be measured.
    Results are reported in tabular form, indicating which words were written down, and by how many subjects, factored by grade level and sex.
    The word doctor, for example, is reported on pp.
    98-100 to be most often associated with nurse, followed by sick, health, medicine, hospital, man, sickness, lawyer, and about 70 more words.
  
  
    We propose an alternative measure, the association ratio, for measuring word association norms, based on the information theoretic concept of mutual information.'
    The proposed measure is more objective and less costly than the subjective method e
