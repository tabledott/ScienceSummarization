ne-to-one mapping of the integers from 1 to I (the dimensionality of the index) to I distinct strings, that we call the labels of the index.
    We will refer herein to the string A uniquely associated to index element i as the label of i, their correspondence A labeled third-order tensor of dimensionality 3 x 2 x 3 representing the weighted tuple structure of Table 1. being indicated by i : A.
    A simple way to perform the mapping&#8212;the one we apply in the running example of this section&#8212;is by sorting the I items in the string set alphabetically, and mapping increasing integers from 1 to I to the sorted strings.
    A weighted tuple structure TW built from W1, L, and W2 can be represented by a labeled third-order tensor X&#955; with its three indices labeled by W1, L, and W2, respectively, and such that for each weighted tuple t E TW = ((w1,l,w2),vt) there is a tensor entry (i : w1, j : l,k : w2)= vt.
    In other terms, a weighted tuple structure corresponds to a tensor whose indices are labeled
