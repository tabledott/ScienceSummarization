s from unannotated news articles is shown in Figure 4.
    Theoretically this could be a straight pipeline, but due to the nature of the implementation we process some stages separately and combine them in the later stage.
    In the following subsection, we explain each component.
    First of all, we need a lot of news articles from multiple news sources.
    We created a simple web crawler that extract the main texts from web pages.
    We observed that the crawler can correctly take the main texts from about 90% of the pages from each news site.
    We ran the crawler every day on several news sites.
    Then we applied a simple clustering algorithm to the obtained articles in order to find a set of articles that talk about exactly the same news and form a basic cluster.
    We eliminate stop words and stem all the other words, then compute the similarity between two articles by using a bag-of-words approach.
    In news articles, a sentence that appears in the beginning of an article is usually more impo
