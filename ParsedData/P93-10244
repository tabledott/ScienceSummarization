s the relation between a transitive main verb and the head noun of its direct object.
    Our raw knowledge about the relation consists of the frequencies f&#8222; of occurrence of particular pairs (v, n) in the required configuration in a training corpus.
    Some form of text analysis is required to collect such a collection of pairs.
    The corpus used in our first experiment was derived from newswire text automatically parsed by Hindle's parser Fidditch (Hindle, 1993).
    More recently, we have constructed similar tables with the help of a statistical part-of-speech tagger (Church, 1988) and of tools for regular expression pattern matching on tagged corpora (Yarowsky, 1992).
    We have not yet compared the accuracy and coverage of the two methods, or what systematic biases they might introduce, although we took care to filter out certain systematic errors, for instance the misparsing of the subject of a complement clause as the direct object of a main verb for report verbs like &amp;quot;say&amp;quot;.
