    One-vs-all (OVA) (Rifkin and Klautau, 2004) is a common extension to the-ary case.
    Training consists of building, for each label, an SVM binary classifier distinguishing labelfrom &#8220;not-&#8221;.
    We consider the final output to be a label preference function , defined as the signed distance of (test) item to the side of the vs. not-decision plane.
    Clearly, OVA makes no explicit use of pairwise label or item relationships.
    However, it can perform well if each class exhibits sufficiently distinct language; see Section 4 for more discussion.
    Alternatively, we can take a regression perspective by assuming that the labels come from a discretization of a continuous function mapping from the or negative.
    Even though Eric Lurio uses a 5 star system, his grading is very relaxed.
    So, 2 stars can be positive.&#8221; Thus, calibration may sometimes require strong familiarity with the authors involved, as anyone who has ever needed to reconcile conflicting referee reports probab
