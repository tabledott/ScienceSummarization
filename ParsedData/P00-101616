ation of rule writing systems is therefore limited to voting or similar classifier techniques which can be applied to annotation systems as well.
    &#8226; Rule-based learning requires a larger skill set, including not only the linguistic knowledge needed for annotation, but also competence in regular expressions and an ability to grasp the complex interactions within a rule list.
    These added skill requirements naturally shrink the pool of viable participants and increases their likely cost.
    &#8226; Based on empirical observation, the performance of rule writers tend to exhibit considerably more variance, while systems trained on annotation tend to yield much more consistent results.
    &#8226; Finally, the current performance of annotation-based training is only a lower bound based on the performance of current learning algorithms.
    Since annotated data can be used by other current or future machine learning techniques, subsequent algorithmic improvements may yield performance improvements with
