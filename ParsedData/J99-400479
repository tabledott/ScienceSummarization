    In summary, the techniques of this paper will make it easier to compute outside values, easier to construct parsers that work for any w-continuous semiring, and easier to compute infinite sums in those semirings.
    In 1973, Teitelbaum wrote: We have pointed out the relevance of the theory of algebraic power series in noncommuting variables in order to minimize further piecemeal rediscovery (page 199).
    Many of the techniques needed to parse in specific semirings continue to be rediscovered, and outside formulas are derived without observation of the basic formulas given here.
    We hope this paper will bring about Teitelbaum's wish.
