an, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993).
    In this section we quote their results, providing additional evidence for the effectiveness of the TWS method.
    The major difference between the TWS method, as presented in this paper, and the variant described by Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch (1993), which we term TWS', is that the latter does not use any parsing for collecting the statistics from the corpus.
    Instead, the counts of syntactic tuples are approximated by counting co-occurrences of the given words of the tuple within a short distance in a sentence.
    The approximation takes into account the relative order between the words of the tuple, such that occurrences of a certain syntactic relation are approximated only by word co-occurrences that preserve the most frequent word order for that relation (e.g., an adjective precedes the noun it modifies).
    The TWS' method still assumes that the source sentence to be translated is being parsed, in order to identify the words that are syntactically related to
