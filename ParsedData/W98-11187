ry, they request an appropriate history view object from the history object and then query the history view object to determine whether their firing conditions are satisfied.
    Note that these history views generally hold information about a limited window around the current token.
    If the current token is denoted as wo, then our model only holds information about tokens w1 for all history views except the lexical ones.
    For these views, the window is w-2 &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; W. Future objects, on the other hand, are trivial in that their only piece of data is an integer indicating which of the 29 members of the future space they represent.
  
  
    Features are implemented as binary valued functions which query the history and future objects to determine whether or not they &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot;.
    In the following sections, we will look at each of MENE's feature classes in turn.
    While all of MENE's features have binary-valued output, the &amp;quot;binary&amp;quot; features are features
