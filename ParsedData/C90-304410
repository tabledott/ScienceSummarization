g expression is a fragment of a source (or target) word- dependency tree, and also a fragment of a translation example.
  There are two envi- ronments of a translation unit; in a source (or target) tree and in a translation exam- ple.
  The more similar these two environ- meuts are, the better.
  To calculate 1, we define the size of a trans- lation unit(TU ).
  size(TU) = the number of nodes in TU To calculate 2, we need a measure of simi- larity between two environments, i.e.
  external similarity.
  To estimate xternal similarity, we introduce a unit called restricted environment.
  A restricted environment consists of the nodes one link outside of a TU normally.
  If corre- sponding nodes are same in two environments, those environments are extended one more link outside.
  Figure 2 illustrates restricted environ- ments of a TU.
  We estimate xternal similarity as the best matching of two restricted environ- ments.
  To find the best matching, we first deter- mine the correspondences between odes in two r
