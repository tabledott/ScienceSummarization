 but at a time when the most advanced computers were of a piece with today's digital watch, any such approach was surely doomed to computational starvation.
    Today, the fruitful application of statistical methods to the study of machine translation is within the computational grasp of anyone with a well-equipped workstation.
    A string of English words, e, can be translated into a string of French words in many different ways.
    Often, knowing the broader context in which e occurs may serve to winnow the field of acceptable French translations, but even so, many acceptable translations will remain; the choice among them is largely a matter of taste.
    In statistical translation, we take the view that every French string, f, is a possible translation of e. We assign to every pair of strings (e, f) a number Pr (f le), which we interpret as the probability that a translator, when presented with e, will produce f as his translation.
    We further take the view that when a native speaker of French produc
