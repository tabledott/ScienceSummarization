ations of substitution and adjoining.
    These operations are explained below with examples.
    Each of these operations is performed with probability Pattach.
    Substitution is defined as rewriting a node in the frontier of a tree with probability Pattach which is said to be proper if: where T, 'q !
    T0 indicates that tree T0 is substituting into node 'q in tree T. An example of the operation of substitution is shown in Figure 4.
    Adjoining is defined as rewriting any internal node of a tree by another tree.
    This is a recursive rule and each adjoining operation is performed with probability Pattach which is proper if: Pattach here is the probability that T0 rewrites an internal node 'q in tree T or that no adjoining (NA) occurs at node 'q in T. The additional factor that accounts for no adjoining at a node is required for the probability to be well-formed.
    An example of the operation of adjoining is shown in Figure 5.
