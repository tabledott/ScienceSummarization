was used to estimate dependencies between all co-occuring (source word, target word) pairs.
    For each source word S, target words were ranked by their dependence with S. The top N target words in the rank-ordering for S formed the entry for S in the N-best lexicon.
    In other words, the relative magnitude of dependence between S and its candidate translations was used as a maximum likelihood estimator of the translations of S. The POS Filter is a predicate filter.
    It is based on the idea that word pairs that are good translations of each other are likely to be the same parts of speech in their respective languages.
    For example, a noun in one language is very unlikely to be translated as a verb in another language.
    Therefore, candidate translation pairs involving different parts of speech should be filtered out.
    This heuristic should not be taken too far, however, in light of the imperfection of today's tagging technology.
    For instance, particles are often confused with prepositions an
