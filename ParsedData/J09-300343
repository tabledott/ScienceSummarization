-light is used for the experiments involving binary classification (neutral&#8211;polar classification), and SVM-multiclass is used for experiments with more than two classes.
    These machine learning algorithms were chosen because they have been used successfully for a number of natural language processing tasks, and they represent several different types of learning.
    For all of the classification algorithms except for SVM, the features for a clue instance are represented as they are presented in Section 7.
    For SVM, the representations for numeric and discrete-valued features are changed.
    Numeric features, such as the count of strongsubj clue instances in a sentence, are scaled to range between 0 and 1.
    Discrete-valued features, such as the reliability class feature, are converted into multiple binary features.
    For example, the reliability class feature is represented by two binary features: one for whether the clue instance is a strongsubj clue and one for whether the clue instance is
