algorithm automatically induces the FSA in Figure 2, which represents compactly 49 distinct renderings of the same semantic meaning.
    Our FSAs capture both lexical paraphrases, such as {fighting, battle}, {died, were killed} and structural paraphrases such as {last week&#8217;s fighting, the battle of last week}.
    The contexts in which these are correct paraphrases are also conveniently captured in the representation.
    In previous work, Langkilde and Knight (1998) used word lattices for language generation, but their method involved hand-crafted rules.
    Bangalore et al. (2001) and Barzilay and Lee (2002) both applied the technique of multi-sequence alignment (MSA) to align parallel corpora and produced similar FSAs.
    For their purposes, they mainly need to ensure the correctness of consensus among different translations, so that different constituent orderings in input sentences do not pose a serious problem.
    In contrast, we want to ensure the correctness of all paths represented by the FSA
