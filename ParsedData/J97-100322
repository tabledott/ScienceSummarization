e fine-grained, hierarchical models that are concerned with utterance-level segmentation.
    Progress is being made in the automatic detection of boundaries at this level of granularity using machine learning techniques combined with a variety of well-chosen discourse cues (Litman and Passonneau 1995).
    In contrast, TextTiling has the goal of identifying major subtopic boundaries, attempting only a linear segmentation.
    We should expect to see, in grouping together paragraph-sized units instead of utterances, a decrease in the complexity of the feature set and algorithm needed.
    The work described here makes use only of lexical distribution information, in lieu of prosodic cues such as intonational pitch, pause, and duration (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996), discourse markers such as oh, well, ok, however (Schiffrin 1987; Litman and Passonneau 1995), pronoun reference resolution (Passonneau and Litman 1993; Webber 1988) and tense and aspect (Webber 1987; Hwang and Schubert 1992).
