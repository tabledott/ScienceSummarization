			MacKay (1997) and Beal (2003) describe Variational Bayesian (VB) inference for HMMs in detail, and Kurihara and Sato (2006) describe VBfor PCFGs (which only involves a minor modifica tion to the M-step of the Inside-Outside algorithm).
			Specifically, the E-step for VB inference for HMMs is the same as in EM, while theM-step is as follows: ??(`+1)y?|y = f(E[ny?,y] + ?y)/f(E[ny] + s?y) (4) ??(`+1)x|y = f(E[nx,y] + ?x)/f(E[ny] +m?x) f(v) = exp(?(v)) ?(v) = (v &gt; 7) ? g(v ? 12) : (?(v + 1)?
