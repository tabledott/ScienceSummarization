e, however, difficult to obtain in practice.
			To deal with this difficulty, a number of methods have been proposed, which make use of relatively easily obtainable non-parallel corpora (e.g., Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Diab and Finch, 2000).
			Within these methods, it is usually assumed that a number of translation candidates for a word or phrase are given (or can be easily collected) and the problem is focused on translation selection.
			All of the proposed methods manage to find out the translation(s) of a given word or phrase, on the basis of the linguistic phenomenon that the contexts of a translation tend to be similar to the contexts of the given word or phrase.
			Fung and Yee (1998), for example, proposed to represent the contexts of a word or phrase with a real-valued vector (e.g., a TF-IDF vector), in which one element corresponds to one word in the contexts.
			In translation selection, they select the translation candidates whose context vectors are the closest to that of the given word or
