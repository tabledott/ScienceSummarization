cted graphical model, with nodes corresponding directly to entity features, one node for each feature of each candidate entity in the document.
    The set of edges is created by matching clique templates against the entire set of entities d.E.
    A clique template is a procedure that finds all subsets of entities satisfying a given constraint, after which, for each entity subset, it connects a selected set of feature nodes so that they form a clique.
    Formally, there is a set of clique templates C, with each template c E C specified by: Given a set, E, of nodes, Mc(E) C 2E consists of subsets of entities whose feature nodes S, are to be connected in a clique.
    In previous applications of RMNs, the selected subsets of entities for a given template have the same size; however, our clique templates may match a variable number of entities.
    The set 5, may contain the same feature from different entities.
    Usually, for each entity in the matching set, its label is included in Sc.
    All these will b
