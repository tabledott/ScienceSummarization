e. fact, 5% of sentences in Susanne are assigned only a single analysis by the grammar.
    &#8226; many incorrect analyses will yield patterns which are unclassifiable, and are thus filtered out; &#8226; arguments of a specific verb will occur with greater frequency than adjuncts (in potential argument positions); &#8226; the patternset generator will incorrectly output for certain classes more often than others; and even a highest ranked for i is only a probabilistic cue for membership of i, so membership should only be inferred if there are enough occurrences of patterns for i in the data to outweigh the error probability for i.
    This simple automated, hybrid linguistic/statistical approach contrasts with the manual linguistic analysis of the COMLEX Syntax lexicog- (Meyers at., who propose five criteria and five heuristics for argument-hood and six criteria and two heuristics for adjunct-hood, culled mostly from the linguistics literature.
    Many of these are not exploitable automatically because they
