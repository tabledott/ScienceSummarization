d: (1) giving all dependencies the same weight; (2) giving dependencies different weights, depending only on which parser generated the dependency; and (3) giving dependencies different 2 Nivre and Scholz use memory based learning in their experiments.
    Our implementation of their parser uses support vector machines, with improved results. weights, depending on which parser generated the dependency, and the part-of-speech of the dependent word.
    Option 2 takes into consideration that parsers may have different levels of accuracy, and dependencies proposed by more accurate parsers should be counted more heavily.
    Option 3 goes a step further, attempting to capitalize on the specific strengths of the different parsers.
    The weights in option 2 are determined by computing the accuracy of each parser on the held-out set (WSJ section 00).
    The weights are simply the corresponding parser&#8217;s accuracy (number of correct dependencies divided by the total number of dependencies).
    The weights in
