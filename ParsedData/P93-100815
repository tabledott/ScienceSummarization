  The utterance parser partitions the utterance grammar into equivalence classes and considers each class according to an ordering.
    Utterance parsing terminates when all constituents satisfying the rules of the current equivalence class are built, unless there are none, in which case the next class is considered.
    The highest ranked class consists of rules to identify simple complete sentences, the next highest class consists of rules to identify simple isolated sentence fragments, and so on.
    Thus, the utterance parser allows us to enforce a very coarse form of parse preferences (for example, prefering complete sentences to sentence fragments).
    These coarse preferences could also be enforced by the parse preference component described in section 2.9, but for the sake of efficiency we choose to enforce them here.
    The utterance grammar is significantly smaller than the constituent grammar &#8212; only 37 syntactic rules and 43 semantic rules.
