irical results showing that an agreement rate between native speakers as low as 75% is common.
    Consequently, an algorithm which scores extremely well compared to one native segmentation may score dismally compared to other, equally &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; segmentations.
    We will discuss some other issues in evaluating word segmentation in Section 3.1.
    One solution to the problem of multiple correct segmentations might be to establish specific guidelines for what is and is not a word in unsegmented languages.
    Given these guidelines, all corpora could theoretically be uniformly segmented according to the same conventions, and we could directly compare existing methods on the same corpora.
    While this approach has been successful in driving progress in NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing, there are valid arguments against adopting it for word segmentation.
    For example, since word segmentation is merely a preprocessing task for a wide variety of further tasks such as par
