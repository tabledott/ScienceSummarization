 performs global inference based on their output rather than formulating a new inference procedure for solving the basic task.
    Second, the ILP approach supports inference over multiple classifiers, without having to fiddle with special parameterization.
    Third, it is much more efficient than conditional random fields, especially when long-distance features are utilized (Roth and Yih, 2005).
    Finally, it is straightforward to create categorical global constraints with ILP; this is done in a declarative manner using inequalities on the assignments to indicator variables.
    This paper focuses on the first problem, and proposes to model anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution as a joint task, wherein the decisions made by each locally trained model are mutually constrained.
    The presentation of the ILP model proceeds in two steps.
    In the first, intermediary step, we simply use ILP to find a global assignment based on decisions made by the coreference classifier alone.
