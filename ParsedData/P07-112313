tstrapping process that learns extraction patterns.
    In our experiments, however, we apply only the rule-based classification step, since the extraction step cannot be implemented without tools for syntactic parsing and information extraction not available in Romanian.
    The classifier relies on three main heuristics to label subjective and objective sentences: (1) if two or more strong subjective expressions occur in the same sentence, the sentence is labeled Subjective; (2) if no strong subjective expressions occur in a sentence, and at most two weak subjective expressions occur in the previous, current, and next sentence combined, then the sentence is labeled Objective; (3) otherwise, if none of the previous rules apply, the sentence is labeled Unknown.
    The quality of the classifier was evaluated on a Romanian gold-standard corpus annotated for subjectivity.
    Two native Romanian speakers (Rol and Roe) manually annotated the subjectivity of the sentences of five randomly selected documents (504
