    In adaptor grammars each table in the adaptor CX is labeled with a tree sampled from the base distribution HX that is shared by all customers at that table; thus the nth sample tree from the adaptor CX is the znth sample from HX.
    CRPs and PYPs differ in exactly how the sequence {zk} is generated.
    Suppose z = (z1, ... , zn) have already been generated and m = max(z).
    Then a CRP generates the next table index zn+1 according to the following distribution: where nk(z) is the number of times table k appears in z and &#945; &gt; 0 is an adjustable parameter that determines how often a new table is chosen.
    This means that if CX is a CRP adaptor then the next tree tn+1 it generates is the same as a previously generated tree t&#8242; with probability proportional to the number of times CX has generated t&#8242; before, and is a &#8220;fresh&#8221; tree t sampled from HX with probability proportional to &#945;XHX(t).
