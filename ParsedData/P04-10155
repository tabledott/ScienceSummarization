g a set of possible parse trees.
    We assume: The components GEN, 4) and &#945;&#175; define a mapping from an input x to an output F(x) through where 4)(x, y) &#183; &#945;&#175; is the inner product Es &#945;s4)s(x, y).
    The learning task is to set the parameter values &#945;&#175; using the training examples as evidence.
    The decoding algorithm is a method for searching for the arg max in Eq.
    1.
    This framework is general enough to encompass several tasks in NLP.
    In this paper we are interested in parsing, where (xi, yi), GEN, and 4) can be defined as follows: Note that the difficulty of finding the arg max in Eq.
    1 is dependent on the interaction of GEN and 4).
    In many cases GEN(x) could grow exponentially with the size of x, making brute force enumeration of the members of GEN(x) intractable.
    For example, a context-free grammar could easily produce an exponentially growing number of analyses with sentence length.
