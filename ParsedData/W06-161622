ht two key reasons why we do not see a greater improvement using our constraint-based system.
    Firstly, we cannot improve on coordinations that include words ending with &#8220;en&#8221; based on the workaround present in Section 4.4.
    This problem can only be solved by improving POS taggers for Dutch or by performing POS tagging within the dependency parsing framework.
    Secondly, our system suffers from poor next best solutions.
    That is, if the best solution violates some constraints, then we find the next best solution is typically worse than the best solution with violated constraints.
    This appears to be a consequence of inaccurate local score distributions (as opposed to inaccurate best local scores).
    For example, suppose we attach two subjects, t1 and t2, to a verb, where t1 is the actual subject while t2 is meant to be labelled as object.
    If we forbid this configuration (two subjects) and if the score of labelling t1 object is higher than that for t2 being labelled subject, then
