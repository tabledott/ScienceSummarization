this tag may have been better considered adjuncts: For TAG, Chen, Bangalore, and Vijay-Shanker (2006) show that different heuristics yield grammars that differ significantly in size, coverage, and linguistic adequacy.
    We have not attempted such an investigation.
    In a future version of CCGbank, it may be possible to follow Shen and Joshi (2005) in using the semantic roles of the Proposition Bank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005) to distinguish arguments and adjuncts.
    Particle-verb constructions are difficult to identify in the Treebank, because particles can be found as PRT, ADVP-CLR, and ADVP.
    Therefore, verbs in the CCGbank grammar do not subcategorize for particles, which are instead treated as adverbial modifiers.
    Compound nouns are often inherently ambiguous, and in most cases, the Treebank does not specify their internal structure: In order to obtain the correct analysis, manual re-annotation would be required.
    Because this was not deemed feasible within our project, compound n
