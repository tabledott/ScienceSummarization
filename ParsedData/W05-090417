ength (subtree&#8217;s depth) increases.
    While sentence-level evaluation is useful if we are interested in a confidence measure on MT outputs, corpus level evaluation is more useful for comparing MT systems and guiding their development.
    Does higher sentence-level correlation necessarily indicate higher correlation in corpus-level evaluation?
    To answer this question, we used our syntactic metrics and BLEU to evaluate all the human-scored MT systems (E9 E11 E12 E14 E15 E17 E22) in the ACL05 MT workshop test set, and computed the correlation with human overall judgments.
    The human judgments for an MT system are estimated by summing up each sentence&#8217;s human overall score.
    Table 6 shows the results indexed by different ngrams and tree depths.
    We can see that the corpus-level correlation and the sentence-level correlation don&#8217;t always correspond.
    For example, the kernel dependency subtree metric achieves a very good performance in corpuslevel evaluation, but it has a poor pe
