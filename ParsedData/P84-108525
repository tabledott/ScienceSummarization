 will assume that the material to be dealt with by the discourse grammar is a sequence consisting of clauses and operators (connectors and discourse markers).
    It is assumed that every clause carries the value it has for features such asspeaker, clause topic, propositional content (represented by a formula of a suitable logic), preposed constituents (with thematic role and semantics), tense, mood, modality.
    (The syntactic features we must include here have semantic consequences which can not always be dealt with within the meaning of the clause, since they may involve discourse issues.)
    The semantics of a dcu is built up in parallel with its syntactic analysis, bythelsame recursive mechanism.
    When clauses or dcu's are combined to form a larger dcu, their meanings are combined to form the meaning of this dcu.
    Along with registers for storing syntactic features and semantic parameters, each dcu has a register which is used to build up the logical representation of its meaning.
    Since the s
