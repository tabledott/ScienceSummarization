    These seeds are used with a large corpus to extract a new set of patterns, which are used to extract more instances, which are used to extract more patterns, in an iterative fashion.
    The resulting patterns often suffer from low precision and semantic drift.
    We propose an alternative paradigm, distant supervision, that combines some of the advantages of each of these approaches.
    Distant supervision is an extension of the paradigm used by Snow et al. (2005) for exploiting WordNet to extract hypernym (is-a) relations between entities, and is similar to the use of weakly labeled data in bioinformatics (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Morgan et al., 2004).
    Our algorithm uses Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), a large semantic database, to provide distant supervision for relation extraction.
    Freebase contains 116 milli
