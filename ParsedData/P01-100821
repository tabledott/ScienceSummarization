 example, paraphrasing rules are recorded and filtered in a similar manner as contextual rules.
    Examples of lexical and syntactic paraphrasing rules are shown in Figure 5 and in Figure 6.
    After extracted lexical and syntactic paraphrases are applied to the corpus, the contextual classifier is retrained.
    New paraphrases not only add more positive and negative instances to the contextual classifier, but also revise contextual rules for known instances based on new paraphrase information.

    The iterative process is terminated when no new paraphrases are discovered or the number of iterations exceeds a predefined threshold.
  
  
    Our algorithm produced 9483 pairs of lexical paraphrases and 25 morpho-syntactic rules.
    To evaluate the quality of produced paraphrases, we picked at rando
