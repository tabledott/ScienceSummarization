 segments the last (or first) n characters of the shorter word (W)) and stores this in the M element of the rule.
    Then it tries to segment an affix by subtracting the shorter word (WI) without the mutative ending from the longer word (W1).
    If the subtraction results in an non-empty string and the mutative segment is not duplicated in the affix, the system creates a morphological rule with the Pos-class of the shorter word (CI) as the I-class, the Pos-class of the longer word (C1) as the R-class and the segmented affix itself in the S field.
    For example: [booked (ll VBD VBN)] Vo [book (NN VB)] e[&#8212;ed +&amp;quot;&amp;quot; ?
    (NN VB) &#8212;(11 VBD VBN)] [advisable (JJ)] Vi [advise (NN VB)] el&#8212;able +&amp;quot;e&amp;quot; ?
    (NN VB) The v operator is applied to all possible pairs of lexical entries sequentially, and, if a rule produced by such an application has already been extracted from another pair, its frequency count (f) is incremented.
    Thus, prefix and suffix morphological
