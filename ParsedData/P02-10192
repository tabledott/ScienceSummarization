 size.
    However this model makes residual errors, many of which have to do with word pronunciation.
    For example, the following are triples of misspelling, correct word and (incorrect) guess that the Brill and Moore model made: edelvise edelweiss advise bouncie bouncy bounce latecks latex lacks In this work we take the approach of modeling phonetic errors explicitly by building a separate error model for phonetic errors.
    More specifically, we build two different error models using the Brill and Moore learning algorithm.
    One of them is a letter-based model which is exactly the Brill and Moore model trained on a similar dataset.
    The other is a phone-sequence-to-phone-sequence error model trained on the same data as the first model, but using the pronunciations of the correct words and the estimated pronunciations of the misspellings to learn phone-sequence-to-phone-sequence edits and estimate their probabilities.
    At classification time, Nbest list predictions of the two models are combined
