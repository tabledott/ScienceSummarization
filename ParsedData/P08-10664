stance relations between words.
    For a given sentence, each word has a parent word which it depends on, except for the root word.
    Figure 1 shows an example of a dependency tree.
    Arrows point from the child to the parent.
    In this example, the word find is the root.
    Dependency trees are simpler in form than CFG trees since there are no constituent labels.
    However, dependency relations directly model semantic structure of a sentence.
    As such, dependency trees are a desirable prior model of the target sentence.
    We restrict ourselves to the so-called well-formed target dependency structures based on the following considerations.
    In (Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005), there is no restriction on dependency treelets used in transfer rules except for the size limit.
    This may result in a high dimensionality in hypothesis representation and make it hard to employ shared structures for efficient dynamic programming.
    In (Galley et al., 2004), rules contain NT slots and c
