treebank guidelines, but performs adequately for a baseline.
    The precision is, of course, abysmal, for the same reasons the first baseline did so well; but the recall is (as one might expect) substantial.
    The performances of the two baseline measures are given in Table 1.
    In table 2, we give the results for each category.
    The first column is the with-null accuracy, and the precision and recall values given are the nonull accuracy, as noted in section 4.
    Grammatical tagging performs the best of the four categories.
    Even using the more difficult no-null accuracy measure, it has a 96% accuracy.
    This seems to reflect the fact that grammatical relations can often be guessed based on constituent labels, parts of speech, and highfrequency lexical items, largely avoiding sparsedata problems.
    Topicalisation can similarly be guessed largely on high-frequency information, and performed almost as well (93%).
    On the other hand, we have the form/function tags and the 'miscellaneous' tags
