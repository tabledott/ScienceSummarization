  An important question we need to address is what action should be taken if this is not the c~.se, i.e., if the intended referent is not in the current focus of attention.
  Unfortunately, we have very little data available ou which to bose a model of the generation of such refer- ring expressions.
  Psyclmlinguistic researchers seem to have paid relatively little attention to such eases, and the transcripts we have (to date) examined have contained relatively few instances where the intended referent was not already salient.
  ltowever, we take the view that, in the general case, a referring expression contains two kinds of informa- tion: nav igat ion  and d isc r iminat ion .
