tem includes semantic information for only one word in the sentence.
    As the coverage of our frame descriptions increases, it may be possible to do better and to model the interactions between the frames invoked by a text.
    Most of the statistics used in the system as described above are conditioned on the target word, or predicate, for which semantic roles are being identified.
    This limits the applicability of the system to words for which training data are available.
    In Section 6, we attempted to generalize across fillers for the roles of a single predicate.
    In this section, we turn to the related but somewhat more difficult question of generalizing from seen to unseen predicates.
    Many ways of attempting this generalization are possible, but the simplest is provided by the frame-semantic information of the FrameNet database.
    We can use data from target words in the same frame to predict behavior for an unseen word, or, if no data are available for the frame in question, we can use
