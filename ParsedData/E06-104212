 We make another modification to Algorithm 2 by checking that the maximum sentence similarity in line (2) is above a certain threshold for classification.
    If the similarity is above this threshold, we label a target-word sentence as literal or nonliteral.

    The features are shown in bold.

    The target set consists of sentences from the corpus containing the target word.
    The feedback sets contain sentences from the corpus containing synonyms of the target word found in WordNet (literal feedback set) and the DoKMIE (nonliteral feedback set).
    The feedback sets also contain example sentences provided in the target-word entries of these datasets.
