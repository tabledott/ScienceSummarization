e systems examined could in fact do this, but they have not bothered to do so (probably because it would not be of much benefit to the applications programs of interest).
    4.1.1 Design decision: avoid integrated architecture Many NL generation researchers have argued against dividing the generation process into modules; perhaps the best-known are Appelt [1985] and Danlos [1984].
    Others, such as Rubinoff [1992], have accepted modules but have argued that the architecture must allow feedback between later modules and earlier modules, which argues against the one-way information flow of the pipeline architecture.
    The argument against pipelines and modules is almost always some variant of 'there are linguistic phenomena that can only be properly handled by looking at constraints from different levels (intentional, semantic, syntactic, morphological), and this is difficult to do in a pipeline system.'
    To take one fairly random example, Danlos and Namer [1988] have pointed out that since the French m
