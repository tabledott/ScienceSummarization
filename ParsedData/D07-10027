			They use ASSERT (Pradhan et al, 2004), a publicly available shallow semantic parser trained on PropBank, to generate predicate-argument structures which subsequently form the basis of comparison between question and answer sentences.

			Questions are assigned semantic roles by matching their dependency relations with those attested in the FrameNet annotations.
			The assignments are used to create question reformulations which are submitted to Google for answer extraction.
			The semantic role assignment module is not probabilistic, it relies onstrict matching, and runs into severe coverage prob lems.
