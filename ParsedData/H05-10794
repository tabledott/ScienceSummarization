e suited to any particular textual en tailment recognition method?
	
	
			We use several shallow surface features to model the text, hypothesis and their relation to each other.
			Most importantly, we expect some dependencybetween surface string similarity of text and hypothesis and the existence of entailment.
			Our string sim ilarity measure uses only a form of extended wordoverlap between text and hypothesis, taking into account equality of words, synonymy and morpholog ical derivations.
			WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is usedas the knowledge source for synonymy and deriva tions.
			The exact procedure is as follows:Both text and hypothesis are tokenised and lem matised.
			A lemma l1 in the hypothesis is said to be related to a lemma l2 in the text iff l1 and l2 are equal, belong to the same WordNet synset (e.g., ?murder?
			and ?slay?), are related via WordNet derivations (e.g. ?murder?
			and ?murderer?)
			or arerelated via a combination of synonymy and deriva tions (e.g. ?murder?
			via ?murderer?
