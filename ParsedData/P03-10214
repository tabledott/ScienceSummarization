 with respect to translation quality.
    The goal of this paper is to investigate alternative training criteria and corresponding training algorithms, which are directly related to translation quality measured with automatic evaluation criteria.
    In Section 3, we review various automatic evaluation criteria used in statistical machine translation.
    In Section 4, we present two different training criteria which try to directly optimize an error count.
    In Section 5, we sketch a new training algorithm which efficiently optimizes an unsmoothed error count.
    In Section 6, we describe the used feature functions and our approach to compute the candidate translations that are the basis for our training procedure.
    In Section 7, we evaluate the different training criteria in the context of several MT experiments.
  
  
    In recent years, various methods have been proposed to automatically evaluate machine translation quality by comparing hypothesis translations with reference translations.
