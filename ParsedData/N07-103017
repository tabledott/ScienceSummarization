n identification.
    This requires labeling a set of named entities in a text with labels such as person and location, and identifying relations between them such as spouse of and work for.
    In theory, each of these tasks would likely benefit from utilizing the information produced by the other, but if done as a cascade will be subject to propogation of errors.
    Roth and Yih thus set this up as problem in which each task is performed separately; their output is used to assign costs associated with indicator variables in an objective function, which is then minimized subject to constraints that relate the two kinds of outputs.
    These constraints express qualities of what a global assignment of values for these tasks must respect, such as the fact that the arguments to the spouse of relation must be entities with person labels.
    Importantly, the ILP objective function encodes not only the best label produced by each classifier for each decision; it utilizes the probabilities (or scores) assigned to
