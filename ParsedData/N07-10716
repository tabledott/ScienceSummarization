    The aim of this paper is to learn inferential selectional preferences for filtering inference rules.
    Let pi =&gt; pj be an inference rule where p is a binary semantic relation between two entities x and y.
    Let (x, p, y) be an instance of relation p. Formal task definition: Given an inference rule pi =&gt; pj and the instance (x, pi, y), our task is to determine if (x, pj, y) is valid.
    Consider the example in Section 1 where we have the inference rule &#8220;X is charged by Y&#8221; =&gt; &#8220;Y announced the arrest of X&#8221;.
    Our task is to automatically determine that &#8220;federal prosecutors announced the arrest of Terry Nichols&#8221; (i.e., (Terry Nichols, pj, federal prosecutors)) is valid but that &#8220;CCM telemarketers announced the arrest of accounts&#8221; is invalid.
    Because the semantic relations p are binary, the selectional preferences on their two arguments may be either considered jointly or independently.
    For example, the relation p = &#8220;X is
