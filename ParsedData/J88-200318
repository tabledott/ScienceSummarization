    As a result of the coercions implicit in the last two examples, it is no longer asserted that the culminations in question ever in fact occurred, but only that the associated preparatory processes did.
    Thus there is no contradiction in continuations that explicitly deny the culmination, like: 19. a. Harry was running a mile, but he gave up after two laps. b. Harry was reaching the top when he slipped and fell to the bottom.
    The fact that, according to the present theory, progressives coerce their input to be a process so that any associated culmination is stripped away and no longer contributes to truth conditions provides a resolution of the imperfective paradox (Dowty 1979), without appealing to theory-external constructs like inertia worlds.
    A perfect, as in 20.
    Harry has reached the top is a function that requires its input category to be a culmination.
    Its result is the corresponding consequent state.
    The most obvious of these consequences for (20) is that Harry still be
