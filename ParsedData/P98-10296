aggers are.
    We define the complementary rate of taggers A and B as: ambiguity resolution over all words, including words that are unambiguous.
    Correctly tagging words that only can have one label contributes to the accuracy.
    We see in Figure 1 that when accuracy is measured on truly ambiguous words, the numbers are lower.
    In this paper we stick to the convention of giving results for all words, including unambiguous ones.
    # of errors in A only In other words, Comp(A,B) measures the percentage of time when tagger A is wrong that tagger B is correct.
    In Figure 2 we show the complementary rates between the different taggers.
    For instance, when the maximum entropy tagger is wrong, the transformationbased tagger is right 37.7% of the time, and when the transformation-based tagger is wrong, the maximum entropy tagger is right 41.7% of the time.
    The complementary rates are quite high, which is encouraging, since this sets the upper bound on how well we can do in combining the differen
