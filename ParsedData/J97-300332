seline standard, we took the ending-guessing rule set supplied with the Xerox tagger (Cutting et al. 1992).
    When we compared the Xerox ending guesser with the induced ending-guessing rule set (Ending*), we saw that its precision was about 6% poorer and, most importantly, it could handle 6% fewer unknown words.
    Finally, we measured the performance of the cascading application of the induced rule sets when the morphological guessing rules were applied before the ending-guessing rules (Prefix+Suffix4Suffixl+Ending-c*).
    We detected that the cascading application of the morphological rule sets together with the ending-guessing rules increases the overall precision of the guessing by about 8%.
    This made the improvement over the baseline Xerox guesser 13% in precision and 7% in coverage on the test sample.
  
  
    The direct evaluation phase gave us a basis for setting the threshold to produce the best-performing rule sets.
    The task of unknown-word guessing is, however, a subtask of the overall
