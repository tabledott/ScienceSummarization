inction for PP modifiers to verbs to be left undefined: This distinction was found to be very difficult for annotators.
    Second, in the surface ordering (as opposed to deep structure), adjuncts are often found closer to the head than complements, thereby yielding structures that fall outside the Chomsky adjunction schema.
    For example, a rule such as (VP &#8594; VB NP-C PP SBAR-C) is found very frequently in the Penn Treebank; SBAR complements nearly always extrapose over adjuncts.
    7.4.2 Quantifying the Coverage Problem.
    To quantify the coverage problem, rules were collected from sections 2&#8211;21 of the Penn Treebank.
    Punctuation was raised as high as possible in the tree, and the rules did not have complement markings or the distinction between base-NPs and recursive NPs.
    Under these conditions, 939,382 rule tokens were collected; there were 12,409 distinct rule types.
    We also collected the count for each rule.
    Table 10 shows some statistics for these rules.
    A majority of
