68;oder&#8217;s second problem).
    The large Schr&#168;oder numbers are just twice the Schr&#168;oder numbers.
    Schr&#168;oder remarked that the ratio between two consecutive Schr&#168;oder numbers approaches 3 + 2.\/2 = 5.8284.... A second-order recurrence for the large Schr&#168;oder numbers is: with n &gt; 2 and S0 = 1, S1 = 2.
    The Schr&#168;oder numbers have many combinatorical interpretations.
    Here, we will mention only two of them.
    The first one is another way of viewing at the ITG constraints.
    The number of permutations of the sequence 1, 2, ..., n, which avoid the subsequences (3, 1, 4, 2) and (2, 4, 1, 3), is the large Schr&#168;oder number Sn&#8722;1.
    More details on forbidden subsequences can be found in (West, 1995).
    The interesting point is that a search with the ITG constraints cannot generate a word-reordering that contains one of these two subsequences.
    In (Wu, 1997), these forbidden subsequences are called &#8217;inside-out&#8217; transpositions.
