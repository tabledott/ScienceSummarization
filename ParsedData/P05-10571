    Various methods have been proposed for finding word alignments between parallel texts.
    There are generally two categories of alignment approaches: statistical approaches and heuristic approaches.
    Statistical approaches, which depend on a set of unknown parameters that are learned from training data, try to describe the relationship between a bilingual sentence pair (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel and Ney, 1996).
    Heuristic approaches obtain word alignments by using various similarity functions between the types of the two languages (Smadja et al., 1996; Ker and Chang, 1997; Melamed, 2000).
    The central distinction between statistical and heuristic approaches is that statistical approaches are based on well-founded probabilistic models while heuristic ones are not.
    Studies reveal that statistical alignment models outperform the simple Dice coefficient (Och and Ney, 2003).
    Finding word alignments between parallel texts, however, is still far from a trivial work due to the diversity o
