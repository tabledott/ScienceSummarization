 hand-segmented into sentence-level units prior to our own work and independently of our DA labeling system (Meteer et al. 1995).
    We refer to the units of this segmentation as utterances.
    The relation between utterances and speaker turns is not one-to-one: a single turn can contain multiple utterances, and utterances can span more than one turn (e.g., in the case of backchanneling by the other speaker in midutterance).
    Each utterance unit was identified with one DA, and was annotated with a single DA label.
    The DA labeling system had special provisions for rare cases where utterances seemed to combine aspects of several DA types.
    Automatic segmentation of spontaneous speech is an open research problem in its own right (Mast et al. 1996; Stolcke and Shriberg 1996).
    A rough idea of the difficulty of the segmentation problem on this corpus and using the same definition of utterance units can be derived from a recent study (Shriberg et al. 2000).
