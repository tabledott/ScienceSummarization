    Examples like these are the basis for the first version of the Centering Constraint: (6) Centering Constraint [Japanese] (1st approximation) Two zero pronominals that retain the same Cb in adjacent utterances should share one of the following properties: SUBJECT or nonSUBJECT.12 (6) says that two zero pronominals supporting the same Cb in adjacent utterances should both be either SUBJECT or nonSUBJECT.
    In the case of discourse extension (4) above, if the Cb is still Rosa, it should be realized with a zero-subject after the sequence (2) and with a zero-object after (3).
    This is shown below: I attribute the different degree of preference between (7) and (8) to the difference in canonicality of centering.
    A Cb continued with zero-subjects as in (7) is more stable, or more canonical, than one continued with zero-objects as in (8), which is but one manifestation of the overall significance of SUBJECT in centering.13 This leads to the second approximation of the Centering Constraint: (9) Centering C
