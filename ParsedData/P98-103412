se of the previous error by (NNP NNP , NNP) on the same original NP Hot Springs: so its score is 0.
    Finally, rule (NNP NNP) receives a score of 1 for correctly identifying Palm Beach as a base NP.
    The benefit scores from evaluation on the pruning corpus are used to rank the rules in the grammar.
    With such a ranking, we can improve the rule set by discarding the worst rules.
    Thus far, we have investigated two iterative approaches for discarding rules, a thresholding approach and an incremental approach.
    We describe each, in turn, in the subsections below.
    'This same benefit measure is also used in the R&amp;M study, but it is used to rank transformations rather than to rank NP rules.
    Given a ranking on the rule set, the threshold algorithm simply discards rules whose score is less than a predefined threshold R. For all of our experiments, we set R = 1 to select rules that propose more correct bracketings than incorrect.
    The process of evaluating, ranking, and discarding rules is
