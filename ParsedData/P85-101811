 That is, the parameter determines how to split up the infinite nonterminal domain into a finite set of equivalence classes that can be used for parsing.
    By doing so, we have an optimal compromise: Whatever part of the feature structure is significant we distinguish in the equivalence classes by setting the parameter appropriately, so the information is used in parsing.
    But because there are only a finite number of equivalence classes, parsing algorithms guided in this way will terminate.
    The technique we use to form equivalence classes is restriction, which involves taking a quotient of the domain with respect to a restrictor.
    The restrictor thus serves as the sole repository of grammar-dependent information in the algorithm.
    By tuning the restrictor, the set of equivalence classes engendered can be changed, making the algorithm more or less efficient at guiding the parse.
    But independent of the restrictor, the algorithm will be correct, since it is still doing parsing over a finite d
