andard feature sets compared with the named entities in newswire articles (Nobata et al., 2000).
    Thus, we need to employ powerful machine learning techniques which can incorporate various and complex features in a consistent way.
    Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995) and Maximum Entropy (ME) method (Berger et al., 1996) are powerful learning methods that satisfy such requirements, and are applied successfully to other NLP tasks (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Nakagawa et al., 2001; Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
    In this paper, we apply Support Vector Machines to biomedical named entity recognition and train them with the GENIA corpus.
    We formulate the named entity recognition as the classification of each word with context to one of the classes that represent region and named entity&#8217;s semantic class.
    Although there is a previous work that applied SVMs to biomedical named entity task in this formulation (Yamada et al., 2000), their method to construct a classifier using SVMs, one-vs-rest, fai
