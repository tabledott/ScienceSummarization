 the overall accuracy of the system increased by more than 10%, from 65.25% to 75.38%.
    In order to provide training data that replicated the task of recognizing entailment between a question and an answer, we assembled a corpus of 5000 question-answer pairs selected from answers that our baseline Q/A system returned in response to a new set of 1000 questions selected from the TREC test sets.
    2500 positive training examples were created from answers identified by human annotators to be correct answers to a question, while 2500 negative examples were created by pairing questions with incorrect answers returned by the Q/A system.
    After training our TE system on this corpus, we performed the following four experiments: Method 1.
    In the first experiment, the ranked lists of answers produced by the Q/A system were submitted to the TE system for validation.
    Under this method, answers that were not entailed by the question were removed from consideration; the top-ranked entailed answer was then re
