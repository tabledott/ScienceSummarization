  The parent is put in A[i,j.k.l I if the left sibling is in A[i,j.k.m I and the right sibling is in A|m.p,p,l|, where k ~_ m &lt; I, m _~ p, p ~_ I.

  (b) Case 2 corresponds to the case where the right sibliog is the ancestor ,~f the foot node.
  If the left sibling is in A[i,m.m.pl and the .ght  sibling is in A(p,j,k.I I, i -- m &lt; p and p ~ j, then we put their parent in A[i,j,k,l I.
