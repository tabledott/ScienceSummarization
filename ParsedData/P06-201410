dency tree is maintained.
    Note that this will not search the exact same alignment space as a cohesion-constrained beam search; instead it uses the union of the cohesion constraint and the weaker ITG constraints (Cherry and Lin, 2006).
    Transforming this form of the cohesion constraint into a soft constraint is straight-forward.
    Instead of overriding the parser so it cannot use invalid English spans, we will note the invalid spans and assign the parser a penalty should it use them.
    The value of this penalty will be determined through discriminative training, as described in Section 4.
    Since the penalty is available within the dynamic programming algorithm, the parser will be able to incorporate it to find a globally optimal alignment.
  
  
    To discriminatively train our alignment systems, we adopt the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Structured Output (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004).
    We have selected this system for its high degree of modularity, and because it has an API freely availa
