, (Pang et al., 2002) collected reviews from a movie database and rated them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the rating (e.g., number of stars) given by the reviewer.
    It is much harder to obtain collections of individual sentences that can be easily identified as subjective or objective.
    Previous work on sentence-level subjectivity classification (Wiebe et al., 1999) used training corpora that had been manually annotated for subjectivity.
    Manually producing annotations is time consuming, so the amount of available annotated sentence data is relatively small.
    The goal of our research is to use high-precision subjectivity classifiers to automatically identify subjective and objective sentences in unannotated text corpora.
    The high-precision classifiers label a sentence as subjective or objective when they are confident about the classification, and they leave a sentence unlabeled otherwise.
    Unannotated texts are easy to come by, so even if the classifiers can label only 30% of
