  Finding Parts In Very Large Corpora
  
    We present a method for extracting parts of objects from wholes (e.g.
    &amp;quot;speedometer&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;car&amp;quot;).
    Given a very large corpus our method finds part words with 55% accuracy for the top 50 words as ranked by the system.
    The part list could be scanned by an end-user and added to an existing ontology (such as WordNet), or used as a part of a rough semantic lexicon.
  
  
    We present a method of extracting parts of objects from wholes (e.g.
    &amp;quot;speedometer&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;car&amp;quot;).
    To be more precise, given a single word denoting some entity that has recognizable parts, the system finds and rank-orders other words that may denote parts of the entity in question.
    Thus the relation found is strictly speaking between words, a relation Miller [1] calls &amp;quot;meronymy.&amp;quot; In this paper we use the more colloquial &amp;quot;part-of&amp;quot; terminology.
    We produce words with 55% a
