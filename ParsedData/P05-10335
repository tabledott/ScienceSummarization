atically from a bitext without syntactic annotation.
    It translates the above example almost exactly as we have shown, the only error being that it omits the word &#8216;that&#8217; from (6) and therefore (8).
    These hierarchical phrase pairs are formally productions of a synchronous context-free grammar (defined below).
    A move to synchronous CFG can be seen as a move towards syntax-based MT; however, we make a distinction here between formally syntax-based and linguistically syntax-based MT.
    A system like that of Yamada and Knight (2001) is both formally and linguistically syntax-based: formally because it uses synchronous CFG, linguistically because the structures it is defined over are (on the English side) informed by syntactic theory (via the Penn Treebank).
    Our system is formally syntaxbased in that it uses synchronous CFG, but not necessarily linguistically syntax-based, because it induces a grammar from a parallel text without relying on any linguistic annotations or assumptions; the
