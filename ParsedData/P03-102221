d anaphora resolution algorithm for spoken dialogue.
    For their experiments, however, they restricted anaphoric relations to those with NP-antecedents.
    Byron (2002) presented a symbolic approach which resolves pronouns with NP- and non-NPantecedents in spoken dialogue in the TRAINS domain.
    Byron extends a pronoun resolution algorithm (Tetrault, 2001) with semantic filtering, thus enabling it to resolve anaphors with non-NPantecedents as well.
    Semantic filtering relies on knowledge about semantic restrictions associated with verbs, like semantic compatibility between subject and predicative noun or predicative adjective.
    An evaluation on ten TRAINS93 dialogues with 80 3rd person pronouns and 100 demonstrative pronouns shows that semantic filtering and the implementation of different search strategies for personal and demonstrative pronouns yields a success rate of 72%.
    As Byron admits, the major limitation of her algorithm is its dependence on domain-dependent resources which cover the d
