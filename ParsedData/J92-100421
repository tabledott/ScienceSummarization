    Finally, and perhaps most importantly, probabilities are established on arcs connecting sibling pairs regardless of which rule is under construction.
    In this sense the arc probabilities behave like the familiar wordlevel bigrams of simple recognition language models (Jelinek 1976), except that they apply to siblings at multiple levels of the hierarchy.
    This makes the probabilities meaningful as a product of conditional probabilities as the parse advances to deeper levels of the parse tree and also as it returns to higher levels of the parse tree.
    This approach implies an independence assumption that claims that what can follow depends only on the left sibling and the parent.
    One negative aspect of the cross-pollination is that the system can potentially generalize to include forms that are agrammatical.
    For instance, the forms &amp;quot;Pick the box up&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Pick up the box,&amp;quot; if defined by the same LHS name, would allow the system to include rules produci
