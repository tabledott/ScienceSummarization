ing the probability threshold for frame element identification from 0.5 to 0.35 to force the nonintegrated system to return the same number of frame elements as the integrated system.
    This yields a frame element identification precision of 71.3% and recall of 67.6% and a labeled precision of 60.8% and recall of 57.6%, which is dominated by the result for the integrated system.
    The integrated system does not have a probability threshold to set; nonetheless it comes closer to identifying the correct number of frame elements (8,167) than does the independent boundary identifier when the theoretically optimal threshold of 0.5 is used with the latter.
    Recall that use of the FEG prior was motivated by the tendency of verbs to assign differing roles to the same syntactic position.
    For example, the verb open assigns different roles to the syntactic subject in He opened the door and The door opened.
    In this section we consider a different feature motivated by these problems: the syntactic subcatego
