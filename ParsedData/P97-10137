e texts.
    To better understand this problem, the corpus analysis described in section 3 was designed so as to also provide information about the types of rhetorical relations, rhetorical statuses (nucleus or satellite), and sizes of textual spans that each marker can indicate.
    We knew from the beginning that it would be impossible to predict exactly the types of relations and the sizes of the spans that a given cue marks.
    However, given that the structure that we are trying to build is highly constrained, such a prediction proved to be unnecessary: the overall constraints on the structure of discourse that we enumerated in the beginning of this section cancel out most of the configurations of elementary constraints that do not yield correct discourse trees.
    Consider, for example, the following text: (1) [Although discourse markers are ambiguous,'] [one can use them to build discourse trees for unrestricted texts:2] [this will lead to many new applications in natural language processing.3] For t
