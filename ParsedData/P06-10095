    When the source language is English, another could be assigned either index 25 or 26; in these ambiguous situations we take the first index.
    The joint probability density of the alignment, a (a vector of target indices), conditioned on the source and target sentences, e and f, is given by: where we make a first order Markov assumption over the alignment sequence.
    Here t ranges over the indices of the source sentence (f), k ranges over the model&#8217;s features, and A = {Ak} are the model parameters (weights for their corresponding features).
    The feature functions hk are predefined real-valued functions over the source and target sentences coupled with the alignment labels over adjacent times (source sentence locations), t. These feature functions are unconstrained, and may represent overlapping and non-independent features of the data.
    The distribution is globally normalised by the partition function, Z&#923;(e, f), which sums out the numerator in (1) for every possible alignment:
