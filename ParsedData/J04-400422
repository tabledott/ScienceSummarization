xt to be a word, a nonterminal label, or a parenthesis.
    This oddity entails that even some relatively short sentences get skipped because they have lots of tree structure.
    In the standard Wall Street Journal training corpus, Sections 02&#8211;21 of the Penn Treebank, there are 120 such sentences that are skipped.
    Unless there is something inherently wrong with these trees, one would predict that adding them to the training set would improve a parser&#8217;s performance.
    As it happens, there is actually a minuscule (and probably statistically insignificant) drop in performance (see Table 5) when these trees are included.
    5.3.1 The Threshold Problem.
    Collins mentions in chapter 7 of his thesis that &#8220;[a]ll words occurring less than 5 times in training data, and words in test data which have never been seen in training, are replaced with the &#8216;UNKNOWN&#8217; token (page 186).&#8221; The frequency below which words are considered unknown is often called the unknownword threshold.
