ed here was perforce trivial, for expository reasons.
    We have developed more extensive experimental grammars that can generate relative clauses with gaps and sentences with quantified NPs from quantified logical forms by using a version of Cooper storage (Cooper, 1983).
    We give an outline of our treatment of quantification in Section 6.2.
  
  
    Several properties of the algorithm are exhibited by the preceding example example.
    First, the order of processing is not left-to-right.
    The verb was generated before any of its complements.
    Because of this, the semantic information about the particle &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; was available, even though this information appears nowhere in the goal semantics.
    That is, the generator operated appropriately despite a semantically nonmonotonic grammar.
    In addition, full information about the subject, including agreement information was available before it was generated.
    Thus the nondeterminism that is an artifact of left-to-right processing,
