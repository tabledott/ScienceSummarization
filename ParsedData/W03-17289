ransition leaving a given state compete only against all other transitions in the model.
    They proposed Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) as a solution to address this problem.
    A partial solution to the LBP is to compute the probability of transitions in both directions.
    This way we can use two MEMM taggers, one of which scans the input from left to right and the other scans the input from right to left.
    This strategy has been successfully used in (Shen and Joshi, 2003).
    In that paper, pairwise voting (van Halteren et al., 1998) has been used to combine the results of two supertaggers that scan the input in the opposite directions.
    The pairwise voting is not suitable in this application because we must make sure that the LMR tags assigned to consecutive words are compatible.
    For example, an LM tag cannot immediately follow an MM.
    Pairwise voting does not use any contextual information, so it cannot prevent incompatible tags from occurring.
    Therefore, in our experiments descri
