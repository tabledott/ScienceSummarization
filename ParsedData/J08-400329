    Since a SHIFT transition decreases the length of the buffer &#946; by 1, no other transition increases the length of &#946;, and any configuration where &#946; = [ ] is terminal, the number of SHIFT transitions in C0,m is bounded by n. Moreover, since both LEFT-ARCl and RIGHT-ARCsl decrease the height of the stack by 1, only SHIFT increases the height of the stack by 1, and the initial height of the stack is 1, the combined number of instances of LEFT-ARCl and RIGHT-ARCsl in C0,m is also bounded by n. Hence, the worst case time complexity is O(n).
    &#9632; The assumption that the oracle function can be computed in constant time will be discussed at the end of Section 6.1, where we approximate oracles with treebank-induced classifiers in order to experimentally evaluate the different algorithms.
    The assumption that every transition can be performed in constant time can be justified by noting that the only operations involved are those of adding an arc to the graph, removi
