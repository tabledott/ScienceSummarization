pression 'her husband&amp;quot; in which the speaker's reference and the semantic reference are distinct.&#8226;6 (The speaker's referent is presumably the woman's lover).
    From our point of view, the importance of the case resides in its showing that Cf(S) may include more than one entity, that is realized by a single NP in S. In this case, 'her husband' contributes both the husband and the lover to Cf(6a) and Cf(7a).
    This can be seen by observing that both discourses seem equally appropriate and that the backward-looking centers of (6b) and (7b) are the husband and the lover, respectively, realized by their anaphoric elements.
    Hence, the forward-looking centers of a sentence may be related not semantically but pragmatically to the NPs that realize them.
    Hence, the importance of the referential/attributive distinction from our point of view is that it leads to cases in which the centers of a sentence may be pragmatically rather than semantically related to the noun phrases that realize them.
