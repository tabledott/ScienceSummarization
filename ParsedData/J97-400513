    By parameter estimation we mean determining values for the weights 0.
    In order for a stochastic grammar to be useful, we must be able to compute the correct weights, where by correct weights we mean the weights that best account for a training corpus.
    The degree to which a given set of weights accounts for a training corpus is measured by the similarity between the distribution q(x) determined by the weights /3 and the distribution of trees x in the training corpus.
    The distribution determined by the training corpus is known as the empirical distribution.
    For example, suppose we have a training corpus containing twelve trees of the four types from L(G1) shown in Figure 3, where c(x) is the count of how often the In comparing a distribution q to the empirical distribution /3, we shall actually measure dissimilarity rather than similarity.
    Our measure for dissimilarity of distributions The divergence between /5 and q at point x is the log of the ratio of p(x) t
