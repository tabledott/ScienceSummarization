aim that longer sentences are preferred over shorter ones whenever possible and reasonable.
    The first question that arises is at what level propositions should be combined.
    To date, the issue of sentence scoping has always been dealt with at a pre-linguistic, conceptual level (e.g.
    (Dale 1988) or (Carcagno and Iordanskaja 1989)).
    However, different languages have different syntactic means of combining clauses; clause combining must refer to the specific linguistic resources of the target language.
    Therefore, in Joyce the task is performed by the sentence planner rather than the text planner'.
    Joyce performs the following syntactic clausecombining operations: Relative clause formation, adjectival attachment (the process by which an adjective from a copula-construction is embedded in an NP), and conjunction.
    Conjunction includes multiple conjunctions of more than one clause, and may lead to elision of repeated sentence elements (&amp;quot;conjunction reduction&amp;quot;).
