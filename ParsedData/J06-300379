 hard disk space, but progress in hardware will likely make 10 or even 100 terabytes affordable in the relatively near future.
    For noun-modifier classification, more labeled data should yield performance improvements.
    With 600 noun-modifier pairs and 30 classes, the average class has only 20 examples.
    We expect that the accuracy would improve substantially with 5 or 10 times more examples.
    Unfortunately, it is time consuming and expensive to acquire hand-labeled data.
    Another issue with noun-modifier classification is the choice of classification scheme for the semantic relations.
    The 30 classes of Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) might not be the best scheme.
    Other researchers have proposed different schemes (Vanderwende 1994; Barker and Szpakowicz 1998; Rosario and Hearst 2001; Rosario, Hearst, and Fillmore 2002).
    It seems likely that some schemes are easier for machine learning than others.
    For some applications, 30 classes may not be necessary; the 5 class scheme may be su
