e better suited for morphologically rich languages with flexible word order appears as one of the most important goals for future research in this area.
			Comparing the results of our two systems, we see that the Blended parser outperforms the SingleMalt parser for all languages, with an average im 937 provement of 1.40 percentage points, a minimum of 0.44 (Greek) and a maximum of 2.40 (English).
			As shown by McDonald and Nivre (2007), the Single Malt parser tends to suffer from two problems: errorpropagation due to the deterministic parsing strat egy, typically affecting long dependencies more thanshort ones, and low precision on dependencies orig inating in the artificial root node due to fragmented parses.9 The question is which of these problems isalleviated by the multiple views given by the compo nent parsers in the Blended system.
			Table 2 throwssome light on this by giving the precision and recall for dependencies of different length, treating de pendents of the artificial root node as a special
