rrection evaluation; and Section 5 concludes the paper.
  
  
    We begin by establishing some notation.
    We consider a set of source sentences 5 = {s1, ... , sn} together with a set of hypotheses H = {h1, ... , hn} generated by an error correction system.
    Let G = {g1, ... , gn} be the set of gold standard annotations for the same sentences.
    Each annotation gi = {g1i , ... , gr i } is a set of edits.
    An edit is a triple (a, b, C), consisting of: The remainder of this section describes a method for solving these two steps.
    We start by describing how to construct an edit lattice from a source-hypothesis pair.
    Then, we show that finding the optimal sequence of edits is equivalent to solving a shortest path search through the lattice.
    Finally, we describe how to evaluate the edits using F1 measure.
    We start from the well-established Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966), which is defined as the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions needed to transform one st
