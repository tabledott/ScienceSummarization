his is not completely surprising, since all systems use very similar technology.
    For some language pairs (such as GermanEnglish) system performance is more divergent than for others (such as English-French), at least as measured by BLEU.
    The statistical systems seem to still lag behind the commercial rule-based competition when translating into morphological rich languages, as demonstrated by the results for English-German and English-French.
    The predominate focus of building systems that translate into English has ignored so far the difficult issues of generating rich morphology which may not be determined solely by local context.
    This is the first time that we organized a large-scale manual evaluation.
    While we used the standard metrics of the community, the we way presented translations and prompted for assessment differed from other evaluation campaigns.
    For instance, in the recent IWSLT evaluation, first fluency annotations were solicited (while withholding the source sentence), a
