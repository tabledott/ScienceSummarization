nd Classes" The search space P begins with all possible n-gram word features and unigram class features, and grows by adding class questions (as described earlier).
  The results in Table 2 are achieved in the neighborhood of about 200 features.
  As can be seen in Figure 1, performance improves quickly as features are added and improves rather very slowly after the 60-th feature.
  The performance is fairly close for the various feature sets when a sufficient number of features are added.
  We also compared these results to a deci- sion tree grown on the same 4 head-word events.
