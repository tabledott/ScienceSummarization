n making a decision.
    Since the precision of the segmentation is not critical, a language independent segmentation system like the one presented by Amithay, Richmond and Smith (1997) is adequately reliable for this task.
    There are two basic alternatives for handling a text.
    The first one is to tokenize it and classify the individual tokens or group of tokens.
    This alternative works for languages that use word separators (such as spaces or punctuation), where a relatively simple set of separator patterns can adequately tokenize the text.
    The second alternative is to classify entities simply with respect to a given starting and ending character position, without knowing the word boundaries, but just the probability (that can be learned automatically) of a boundary given the neighboring contexts.
    This second alternative works for languages like Chinese, where no separators between the words are typically used.
    Since for the first class of languages we can define a priori probabilities
