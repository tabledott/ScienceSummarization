	Improving Translation Quality by Discarding Most of the Phrasetable
		It is possible to reduce the bulk of phrasetables for Statistical Machine Translation us ing a technique based on the significance testing of phrase pair co-occurrence in the parallel corpus.
		The savings can be quitesubstantial (up to 90%) and cause no reduction in BLEU score.
		In some cases, an im provement in BLEU is obtained at the same time although the effect is less pronounced if state-of-the-art phrasetable smoothing is employed.
	
	
			An important part of the process of Statistical Ma chine Translation (SMT) involves inferring a large table of phrase pairs that are translations of each other from a large corpus of aligned sentences.These phrase pairs together with estimates of con ditional probabilities and useful feature weights, called collectively a phrasetable, are used to match a source sentence to produce candidate translations.
			The choice of the best translation is made based on the combination of the probabilities a
