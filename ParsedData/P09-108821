ignments, altered such that they are consistent with our ternary grammar.
    This is achieved by using the factorisation algorithm of Zhang et al. (2008a) to first create initial trees.
    Where these factored trees contain nodes with mixed terminals and non-terminals, or more than three non-terminals, we discard alignment points until the node factorises correctly.
    As the alignments contain many such non-factorisable nodes, these trees are of poor quality.
    However, all samplers used in these experiments are first &#8216;burnt-in&#8217; for 1000 full passes through the data.
    This allows the sampler to diverge from its initialisation condition, and thus gives us confidence that subsequent samples will be drawn from the posterior.
    An expectation over phrase tables and Hiero grammars is built from every 50th sample after the burn-in, up until the 1500th sample.
    We evaluate the translation models using IBM BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001).
