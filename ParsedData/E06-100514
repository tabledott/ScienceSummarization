computed with respect to multiple reference translations.
    The evaluation (as well as the alignment training) was case-insensitive, without considering the punctuation marks.
    Different applications of the proposed combination method have been evaluated.
    First, we focused on combining different MT systems which have the same source and target language.
    The initial experiments were performed on the BTEC Chinese-English task.
    We combined translations produced by 5 different MT systems.
    Table 2 shows the performance of the best and the worst of these systems in terms of the BLEU score.
    The results for the consensus translation show a dramatic improvement in translation quality.
    The word error rate is reduced e. g. from 54.6 to 47.8%.
    The research group which had submitted the best translation in 2004 translated the same test set a year later with an improved system.
    We compared the consensus translation with this new translation (last line of Table 2).
    It can be observed
