ted by CIDR.
    Four of the clusters are from Usenet newsgroups.
    The remaining two clusters are from the official TDT corpus2.
    Among the factors for our selection of clusters are: coverage of as many news sources as possible, coverage of both TDT and non-TDT data, coverage of different types of news (e.g., terrorism, internal affairs, and environment), and diversity in cluster sizes (in our case, from 2 to 10 articles).
    The test corpus is used in the evaluation in such a way that each cluster is summarized at 9 different compression rates, thus giving nine times as many sample points as one would expect from the size of the corpus.
    Table 2 shows a sample centroid, produced by CIDR [Radev et al., 1999] from cluster A.
    The &amp;quot;count&amp;quot; column indicates the average number of occurrences of a word *across the entire cluster.
    The IDF values were computed from the TDT corpus.
    A centroid, in this context, is a pseudo-document which consists of words which have Count*IDF scor
