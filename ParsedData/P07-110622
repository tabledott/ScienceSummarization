    Our word-based system achieved the best Fmeasures over the AS (96.5%) and CU (94.6%) corpora in the first bakeoff, and the CU (95.1%) and MR (97.2%) corpora in the second bakeoff.
  
  
    We proposed a word-based CWS model using the discriminative perceptron learning algorithm.
    This model is an alternative to the existing characterbased tagging models, and allows word information to be used as features.
    One attractive feature of the perceptron training algorithm is its simplicity, consisting of only a decoder and a trivial update process.
    We use a beam-search decoder, which places our work in the context of recent proposals for searchbased discriminative learning algorithms.
    Closed tests using the first and second SIGHAN CWS bakeoff data demonstrated our system to be competitive with the best in the literature.
    Open features, such as knowledge of numbers and European letters, and relationships from semantic networks (Shi and Wang, 2007), have been reported to imp
