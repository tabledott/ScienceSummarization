ic classes, grouping the codes into small sets with roughly the same meaning and attached descriptions; for example M, K are grouped as a pair described as &amp;quot;human male&amp;quot;.
    The hierarchy produced is shown in Figure 3.
    The named entities identified as part of the preprocessing phase (Section 4.1) are used by this module, which requires first a mapping between the name types and LDOCE semantic codes, shown in Table 4.
    Any use of preferences for sense selection requires prior identification of the site in the sentence where such a relationship holds.
    Although prior identification was not done by syntactic methods in Wilks (1975), it is often easiest to think of the relationships as specified in grammatical terms, e.g., as subject-verb, verb-object, adjectivenoun etc.
    We perform this step by means of a shallow syntactic analyzer (Stevenson 1998) which finds the following grammatical relations: the subject, direct and indirect object of each verb (if any), and the noun modified b
