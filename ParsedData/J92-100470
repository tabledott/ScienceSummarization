    Finally, &amp;quot;teens&amp;quot; will be popped off and matched, and &amp;quot;endi tens-place, teens&amp;quot; will be inserted at the top with probability 1.0.
    This answer will be returned to the parent, &amp;quot;tens-place,&amp;quot; and two new hypotheses will be inserted at the top of the Paths through the parse tree for the phrase &amp;quot;four fifteen&amp;quot; with associated probabilities derived from the training data. stack as follows: ones-place number, tens-plac
