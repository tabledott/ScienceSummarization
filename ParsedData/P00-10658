es for each possible semantic role r are then computed from the features.
    The probability computation will be described in the next section; the features include: Phrase Type: This feature indicates the syntactic type of the phrase expressing the semantic roles: examples include noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), and clause (S).
    Phrase types were derived automatically from parse trees generated by the parser, as shown in Figure 2.
    The parse constituent spanning each set of words annotated as a frame element was found, and the constituent's nonterminal label was taken as the phrase type.
    As an example of how this feature is useful, in communication frames, the SpEAKER is likely appear a a noun phrase, Topic as a prepositional phrase or noun phrase, and MEDiUM as a prepostional phrase, as in: &amp;quot;We talked about the proposal over the phone.&amp;quot; When no parse constituent was found with boundaries matching those of a frame element during testing, the largest constituent beginning at t
