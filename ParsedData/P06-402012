l relations in the hierarchy.
    The macroaveraged scores are the mean of the individual scores for each relation.
    On the reannotated DepBank, the system achieves a microaveraged F1 score of 76.3% across all relations, using our new training method (Watson et al., 2006).
    Briscoe and Carroll (2006) show that the system has equivalent accuracy to the PARC XLE parser when the morphosyntactic features in the original DepBank gold standard are taken into account.
    Figure 3 shows a breakdown of the new system&#8217;s results by individual relation.
  
  
    Development has been partially funded by the EPSRC RASP project (GR/N36462 and GR/N36493) and greatly facilitated by Anna Korhonen, Diana McCarthy, Judita Preiss and Andreas Vlachos.
    Much of the system rests on earlier work on the ANLT or associated tools by Bran Boguraev, David Elworthy, Claire Grover, Kevin Humphries, Guido Minnen, and Larry Piano.
