   This makes it harder to achieve statistical significance.
    Notice also the minimum and maximum columns of the &amp;quot;DOP-P&amp;S&amp;quot; lines, constructed by finding for each of the paired runs the difference between the DOP and the Pereira and Schabes algorithms.
    Notice that the minimum is usually negative, and the maximum is usually positive, meaning that on some tests DOP did worse than Pereira and Schabes and on some it did better.
    It is important to run multiple tests, especially with small test sets like these, in order to avoid misleading results.
    In this section, we examine the empirical runtime of our algorithm, and analyze Bod's.
    We also note that Bod's algorithm will probably be particularly inefficient on longer sentences.
    It takes about 6 seconds per sentence to run our algorithm on an HP 9000/715, versus 3.5 hours to run Bod's algorithm on a Sparc 2 (Bod, 1995b).
    Factoring in that the HP is roughly four times faster than the Sparc, the new algorithm is about 5
