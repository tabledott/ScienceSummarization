2. the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones Both have gained or are gaining wide usage, and are also becoming relevant for theoretical linguistics (see Bod et al. 2003a).
    One instantiation of DOP which has received considerable interest is the model known as DOP12 (Bod 1992).
    DOP1 combines subtrees from a treebank by means of node-substitution and computes the probability of a tree from the normalized frequencies of the subtrees (see Section 2 for a full definition).
    Bod (1993) showed how standard parsing techniques can be applied to DOP1 by converting subtrees into rules.
    However, the problem of computing the most probable parse turns out to be NP-hard (Sima'an 1996), mainly because the same parse tree can be generated by exponentially many derivations.
    Many implementations of DOP1 therefore estimate the most probable parse by Monte Carlo techniques (Bod 1998; Chappelier &amp; Rajman 2000), or by Viterbi n-best search (Bod 2001), or by restricting the set of subt
