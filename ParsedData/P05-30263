 algorithm.
    A &#8220;decoding&#8221; algorithm then uses these alignments, in conjunction with confidence estimates for the various engines and a trigram language model, in order to score and rank a collection of sentence hypotheses that are synthetic combinations of words from the various original engines.
    The highest scoring sentence hypothesis is selected as the final output of our system.
    We experimentally tested the new approach by combining translations obtained from combining three Arabic-to-English translation systems.
    Translation quality is scored using the METEOR MT evaluation metric (Lavie, Sagae et al 2004).
    Our experiments demonstrate that our new MEMT system achieves a substantial improvement over all of the original systems, and also outperforms an &#8220;oracle&#8221; capable of selecting the best of the original systems on a sentence-by-sentence basis.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    In section 2 we describe the algorithm for generating multi-e
