lties are encountered when these modules have to be integrated.
  Usually, there are two choices.
  Either everything is described in a single place using a deeply intricate data struc- ture, like packing both syntactic and semantic equa- tions in CF rules in some LFG extensions (e.g.
  [10]); the price is a loss in understmtdability and general~ ity.
  Or descriptions are kept separate and the pro- eessing is done accordingly: first, a morphological phase, then a syntactic analysis, and then a semantic analysis, without any communication between these different steps [4].
  The price is that interdependent constraints between these levels are lost, resulting in inadequate linguistic description or very complex control strategies at the implementation level.
  In this paper, we argue that typed unification gram- mars give the linguist a formal framework which has the desirable properties.
  We will give an introduc- tion to such a formalism, called IF,_ (~Iyped I"ea- ture Structure), which integrates disjunct
