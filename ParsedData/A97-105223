orts of lexicographers / linguists and are, therefore, prone to errors of omission and commission which are hard or impossible to detect automatically (e.g.
    Boguraev &amp; Briscoe, 1989; see also section 3.1 below for an example).
    Furthermore, manual encoding is labour intensive and, therefore, it is costly to extend it to neologisms, information not currently encoded (such as relative frequency of different subcategorizations), or other (sub)languages.
    These problems are compounded by the fact that predicate subcategorization is closely associated to lexical sense and the senses of a word change between corpora, sublanguages and/or subject domains (Jensen, 1991).
    In a recent experiment with a wide-coverage parsing system utilizing a lexicalist grammatical framework, Briscoe &amp; Carroll (1993) observed that half of parse failures on unseen test data were caused by inaccurate subcategorization information in the ANLT dictionary.
    The close connection between sense and subcategorization and
