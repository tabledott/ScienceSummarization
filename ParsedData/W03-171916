h OOV recall that we see the widest variation among systems, which in turn is consistent with the observation that dealing with unknown words is the major outstanding problem of Chinese word segmentation.
    While some systems performed little better than the baseline, others had a very respectable 0.80 recall on OOV.
    Again, there was clearly a benefit for many systems in using additional resources than what is in the training data: A number of systems that were run on both closed and open tracks showed significant improvements in the open track.
    For the closed-track entries that did well on OOV, one must conclude that they have effective unknown-word detection methods.
  
  
    We feel that this First International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff has been useful in that it has provided us with a good sense of the range of performance of various systems, both from academic and industrial institutions.
    There is clearly no single best system, insofar as there is no system that consistently outpe
