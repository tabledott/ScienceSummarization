 The baseline system consists of the SRL pipeline only (P).
  Adding lin- guistic constraints (C) results in a more precision- oriented system with slightly lower recall, but sig- nificantly higher F1.
  Even higher performance is obtained when adding the global SRL model (G).

  5.3 Syntactic?Semantic Integration The final experiment concerned the integration of syntactic and semantic analysis.
  In this setting, the system chooses the output that maximizes the joint syntactic?semantic score, based on the top N syntactic trees.
  Table 7 shows the results on the development set.
  We see that syntactic?semantic integration improves both syntactic accuracy and semantic F1.
  This holds for the constraint-based SRL system as well as for the full system.
