achment selects for the tree with the fewest nodes, so in (2a), the parse that makes for Mary a complement of sings is preferred.
    Right Association selects for the tree that incorporates a constituent A into the rightmost possible constituent (where rightmost here means beginning the furthest to the right).
    Thus, in (2b) the parse in which yesterday modifies reserved is preferred.
    The problem with these heuristics is that when they are formulated loosely, as in the previous paragraph, they appear to conflict.
    In particular, in (2a), Right Association seems to call for the parse that makes for Mary a modifier of song.
    Pereira's goal is to show how a shift-reduce parser can enforce both heuristics without conflict and enforce the desired preferences for examples like (2a) and (2b).
    He argues that Minimal Attachment and Right Association can be enforced in the desired way by adopting the following heuristics for resolving conflicts: Since these two principles never apply to the same choic
