, we also seek to extract aligned sentence pairs that instantiate a richer set of phenomena.
    Relying on edit distance to identify likely paraphrases has the unfortunate result of excluding interesting sentence pairs that are similar in meaning though different in form.
    For example: We are currently experimenting with data extracted from the first two sentences in each article, which by journalistic convention tend to summarize content (Dolan et al. 2004).
    While noisier than the edit distance data, initial results suggest that these can be a rich source of information about larger phrasal substitutions and syntactic reordering.
    Although we have not attempted to address the issue of paraphrase identification here, we are currently exploring machine learning techniques, based in part on features of document structure and other linguistic features that should allow us to bootstrap initial alignments to develop more data.
    This will we hope, eventually allow us to address such issues as paraphra
