 to know something about the likely NE tag of the next word before reaching it.
    Most systems use gazetteers to encode information about personal and organisation names, locations and trigger words.
    There is considerable variation in the size of the gazetteers used.
    Some studies found that gazetteers did not improve performance (e.g.
    Malouf (2002)) whilst others gained significant improvement using gazetteers and triggers (e.g.
    Carreras et al. (2002)).
    Our system incorporates only English and Dutch first name and last name gazetteers as shown in Table 6.
    These gazetteers are used for predicates applied to the current, previous and next word in the window.
    Collins (2002) includes a number of interesting contextual predicates for NER.
    One feature we have adapted encodes whether the current word is more frequently seen lowercase than uppercase in a large external corpus.
    This feature is useful for disambiguating beginning of sentence capitalisation and tagging sentences whi
