ed) LR parsing is more efficient in practice for the ANLT grammar despite exponential worst case complexity results.
    Section 7 explains the technique we employ for deriving a probabilistic version of the LR parse table from the training corpus, and demonstrates that this leads to a more refined and parse-context&#8212;dependent probabilistic model capable of distinguishing derivations that in a probabilistic context-free model would be equally probable.
    Section 8 describes and presents the results of our first experiment parsing LDOCE noun definitions, and Section 9 draws some preliminary conclusions and outlines ways in which the work described should be modified and extended.

    Probabilistic Approaches to Parsing In the field of speech recognition, statistical techniques based on hidden Markov mod
  
  
    We describe work toward the construction of a very wide-coverage probabilistic parsing system for natural language (NL), based on LR parsing techniques.
    The system is intended to ran
