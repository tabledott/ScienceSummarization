n the number of rules in the grammar: If G = (Ri, ,R,) is a grammar defined as a finite ordered sequence of rewriting rules each of which denotes a regular relation, then the set of input-output string-pairs for the grammar as a whole is the regular relation given by R1 o o R. This theorem also has an immediate corollary: The input-output string pairs of every such rewriting grammar are accepted by a single finite-state transducer.
    Again, given an implementation of the regular calculus, a grammar transducer can be constructed algorithmically from its rules.
    We can also show that certain more complex methods of combination also denote regular relations.
    Suppose a grammar is specified as a finite sequence of rules but with a further specification that rules in some subsequences are to be treated as a block of mutually exclusive alternatives.
    That is, only one rule in each such subsequence can be applied in any derivation, but the choice of which one varies freely between derivations.
