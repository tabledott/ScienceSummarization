  Personalizing PageRank for Word Sense Disambiguation
  
    In this paper we propose a new graphbased method that uses the knowledge in a LKB (based on WordNet) in order to perform unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation.
    Our algorithm uses the full graph of the LKB efficiently, performing better than previous approaches in English all-words datasets.
    We also show that the algorithm can be easily ported to other languages with good results, with the only requirement of having a wordnet.
    In addition, we make an analysis of the performance of the algorithm, showing that it is efficient and that it could be tuned to be faster.
  
  
    Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a key enabling-technology that automatically chooses the intended sense of a word in context.
    Supervised WSD systems are the best performing in public evaluations (Palmer et al., 2001; Snyder and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2007) but they need large amounts of hand-tagged data, which is typically very expensive to build.
