    In those cases where the trace corresponds to a &#8220;moved&#8221; argument, the corresponding long-range dependencies can be recovered directly from the correct CCG derivation.
    In the Treebank, the &#8220;moved&#8221; constituent is coindexed with a trace (*T*), which is inserted at the extraction site: 17 We regard this type of dependency as anaphoric rather than syntactic, on the basis of its immunity to such syntactic restrictions as subject islands.
    CCG has a similarly uniform analysis of these constructions, albeit one that does not require syntactic movement.
    In the CCG derivation of the example, the relative pronoun has the category (NPi\NPi)/(S[dcl]/NPi) whereas the verb bought just bears the standard transitive category (S[dcl]\NP)/NP.
    The subject NP and the incomplete VP combine via type-raising and forward composition into an S[dcl]/NP, which the relative pronoun then takes as its argument: The coindexation on the lexical category of the relative pronoun guarantees t
