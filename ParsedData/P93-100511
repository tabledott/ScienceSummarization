 the identity of the non-terminal Ni, i.e., p(ri ) = p(ri).
    Thus So in P-CFG the derivation order does not affect the probabilistic model'.
    A less crude approximation than the usual PCFG is to use a decision tree to determine which aspects of the leftmost derivation have a bearing on the probability of how node i will be expanded.
    In other words, the probability distribution p(r2Itfl will be modeled by p(rilE[t.n) where E[t] is the equivalence class of the history t as determined by the decision tree.
    This allows our 'Note the abuse of notation since we denote by p(7%) the conditional probability of rewriting the nonterminal Ni. probabilistic model to use any information anywhere in the partial derivation tree to determine the probability of different expansions of the i-th non-terminal.
    The use of decision trees and a large bracketed corpus may shift some of the burden of identifying the intended parse from the grammarian to the statistical estimation methods.
    We refer to probabilisti
