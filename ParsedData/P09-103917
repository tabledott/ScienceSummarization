y associated with Eisner&#8217;s dynamic programming parsing algorithm and with the Markovian assumptions made explicitly by his generative model.
    We next show how similar features 6Actually, any logical condition can be encoded with linear constraints involving binary variables; see e.g.
    Clarke and Lapata (2008) for an overview.
    7By sibling features we mean features that depend on pairs of sibling arcs (i.e., of the form (i, j) and (i, k)); by grandparent features we mean features that depend on pairs of grandparent arcs (of the form (i, j) and (j, k)). can be incorporated in our model by adding &#8220;dynamic&#8221; constraints to our ILP.
    Define: zfirst child , ij 0 otherwise. but this would yield a constraint matrix with O(n4) non-zero elements.
    Instead, we define auxiliary variables &#946;jk and &#947;ij: sibl ijk z &#947;i(j+1)&#8804; &#947;ij +zij analogously for the case n Then, we have that The following constraints encode the logical relations for the auxiliary vari Auxiliary var
