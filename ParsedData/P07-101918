lar comparison but measures search quality by BLEU, which shows an even larger relative speed-up for a given BLEU score, because translations with very different model costs might have similar BLEU scores.
    It also shows that our full-integration implementation in Cubit faithfully reproduces Pharaoh&#8217;s performance.
    Fixing the stack size to 100 and varying the threshold yielded a similar result.
    In tree-to-string (also called syntax-directed) decoding (Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006), the source string is first parsed into a tree, which is then recursively converted into a target string according to transfer rules in a synchronous grammar (Galley et al., 2006).
    For instance, the following rule translates an English passive construction into Chinese: Our tree-to-string system performs slightly better than the state-of-the-art phrase-based system Pharaoh on the above data set.
    Although different from the SCFG-based systems in Section 2, its derivation trees remain context-free and t
