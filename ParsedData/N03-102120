 in N has the form L[t] for some terminal t E T and some label L E A.3 The terminal t is the lexical head of its constituent, or just the head.
    One link on the RHS of each L2MTG production serves as the heir of the link on the LHS.
    Each component of the heir link inherits the lexical head of its parent nonterminal.
    An example of a 2-L2MTG derivation is in Figure 1.
    Some subclasses and superclasses of MTG have been studied before.
    The non-lexicalized class 2-MTG(2) is equivalent to ITG (Wu, 1997).
    Alshawi et al. (2000)'s &amp;quot;collections of finite-state head transducers&amp;quot; can be viewed as a subclass of 2-LMTG where, among other restrictions, A contains only one (dummy) nonterminal label.
    &amp;quot;Syntax-directed translations of order k&amp;quot; (Aho &amp; Ullman, 1969) are equivalent to k-MTG(2).
    On the other hand, MTG is a subclass of Multiple CFG (Seki et al., 1991) where the functions that render the RHS of production rules may not mix symbols from different co
