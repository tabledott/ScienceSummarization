based WSD.
    The methods here presented cope with the problem of sequence-labeling, i.e., they disambiguate all the words coocurring in a sequence (typically, all content words of a sentence).
    All the methods rely on the information represented on some LKB, which typically is some version of WordNet, sometimes enriched with proprietary relations.
    The results on our datasets, when available, are shown in Table 2.
    The table also shows the performance of supervised systems.
    The TexRank algorithm (Mihalcea, 2005) for WSD creates a complete weighted graph (e.g. a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a weighted edge) formed by the synsets of the words in the input context.
    The weight of the links joining two synsets is calculated by executing Lesk&#8217;s algorithm (Lesk, 1986) between them, i.e., by calculating the overlap between the words in the glosses of the correspongind senses.
    Once the complete graph is built, the PageRank algorithm is executed over it and wo
