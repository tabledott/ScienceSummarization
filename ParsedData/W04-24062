, 1998), (Fukumoto and Suzuki, 1999)), by comparison it is much less than that devoted to word sense disambiguation, which is the process of assigning a meaning to a word from a predefined set of possibilities.
    However, solutions to disambiguation usually require the availability of an external knowledge source or manually created sense&#8211; tagged training data.
    As such these are knowledge intensive methods that are difficult to adapt to new domains.
    By contrast, word sense discrimination is an unsupervised clustering problem.
    This is an attractive methodology because it is a knowledge lean approach based on evidence found in simple raw text.
    Manually sense tagged text is not required, nor are specific knowledge rich resources like dictionaries or ontologies.
    Instances are clustered based on their mutual contextual similarities which can be completely computed from the text itself.
    This paper presents a systematic comparison of discrimination techniques suggested by Pedersen and
