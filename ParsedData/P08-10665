ombination is only allowed at those slots.
    Therefore, the search space becomes much smaller.
    Furthermore, shared structures can be easily defined based on the labels of the slots.
    In order to take advantage of dynamic programming, we fixed the positions onto which another another tree could be attached by specifying NTs in dependency trees.
    Marcu et al. (2006) showed that many useful phrasal rules cannot be represented as hierarchical rules with the existing representation methods, even with composed transfer rules (Galley et al., 2006).
    For example, the following rule A number of techniques have been proposed to improve rule coverage.
    (Marcu et al., 2006) and (Galley et al., 2006) introduced artificial constituent nodes dominating the phrase of interest.
    The binarization method used by Wang et al. (2007) can cover many non-constituent rules also, but not all of them.
    For example, it cannot handle the above example.
    DeNeefe et al. (2007) showed that the best results were ob
