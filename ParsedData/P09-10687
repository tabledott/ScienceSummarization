me or coreferent) across all three events.
    Chains represent coherent scenarios, not just a set of independent pairs, so we want to model argument overlap across all pairs.
    The second problem with narrative chains is that they make judgments only between protagonist arguments, one slot per event.
    All entities and slots in the space of events should be jointly considered when making event relatedness decisions.
    As an illustration, consider the verb arrest.
    Which verb is more related, convict or capture?
    A narrative chain might only look at the objects of these verbs and choose the one with the highest score, usually choosing convict.
    But in this case the subjects offer additional information; the subject of arrest (police) is different from that of convict (judge).
    A more informed decision prefers capture because both the objects (suspect) and subjects (police) are identical.
    This joint reasoning is absent from the narrative chain model.
