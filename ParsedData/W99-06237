ns productions from outside our grammar the machine has no direct method for handling them (e.g. the resulting database query may be syntactically malformed).
    We have developed a general approach for combining parsers when preserving the entire structure of a parse tree is important.
    The combining algorithm is presented with the candidate parses and asked to choose which one is best.
    The combining technique must act as a multi-position switch indicating which parser should be trusted for the particular sentence.
    We call this approach parser switching.
    Once again we present both a non-parametric and a parametric technique for this task.
    First we present the non-parametric version of parser switching, similarity switching: The intuition for this technique is that we can measure a similarity between parses by counting the constituents they have in common.
    We pick the parse that is most similar to the other parses by choosing the one with the highest sum of pairwise similarities.
