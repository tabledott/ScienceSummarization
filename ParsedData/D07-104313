			In figure 2, we present some illustrative examples of the problem of matching.
			For the purposes of thisdiscussion we will be using F-Measure as the mea sure to describe the problem of matching, however, these problems affect any measure which requires a mapping from clusters to classes for evaluation.In the figures, the shaded regions represent CLUS TERS, the shapes represent CLASSES.
			In a perfect clustering, each shaded region would contain all and only the same shapes.
			The problem of matchingcan manifest itself either by not evaluating the en tire membership of a cluster, or by not evaluating every cluster.
			The former situation is presented in the figures A and B in figure 2.
			The F-Measure ofboth of these clustering solutions in 0.6.

			cluster contains 3 of 5 elements of the class (Recall) and 3 of 5 elements of the cluster are members of the class (Precision).
