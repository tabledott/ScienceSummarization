discussed in Section 3.2.2.
    Prefix-Suffix Filter reduces the word error rate ranging from 7.4% for the smallest (10K word) manually segmented corpus to 21.8% for the largest (110K word) manually segmented corpus &#63719;- around 1% absolute reduction for all segmenters.
    The column headed by '3-gram LM + PS Filter + New Stems' shows the impact of unsupervised stem acquisition from a 155 million word Arabic corpus.
    Word error rate reduction due to the unsupervised stem acquisition is 38% for the segmenter developed from the 10K word manually segmented corpus and 32% for the segmenter developed from 110K word manually segmented corpus.
    Language model vocabulary size (LM VOC Size) and the unknown stem ratio (OOV ratio) of various segmenters is given in Table 6.
    For unsupervised stem acquisition, we have set the frequency threshold at 10 for every 10-15 million word corpus, i.e. any new morphemes occurring more than 10 times in a 10-15 million word corpus are considered to be new stem candidate
