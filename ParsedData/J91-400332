    Predicates in the language are typed for a particular event-sort, and thematic roles are treated as partial functions over the event (cf.
    Dowty 1989 and Chierchia 1989).

    Knowledge of an object includes not just being able to identify or refer, but more specifically, being able to explain how an artifact comes into being, as well as what it is used for; the denotation of an object must identify these roles.
    Thus, any artifact can be identified with the state of being that object, relative to certain predicates.
    As is well known from work on event semantics and Aktionsarten, it is a general property of processes that they can shift their event type to become a transition event (cf.
    Hinrichs 1985; Moens and Steedman 1987; and Krifka 1987).
