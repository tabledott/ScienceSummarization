y applying a maximum likelihood approach.
    If the language model Pr(eI1) = p&#947;(eI1) depends on parameters &#947; and the translation model Pr(fJ1 |eI1) = p&#952;(fJ1 |eI1) depends on parameters &#952;, then the optimal parameter values are obtained by maximizing the likelihood on a parallel training corpus fS1 , eS1 (Brown et al., 1993): We obtain the following decision rule: instead of Eq.
    5 (Och et al., 1999): State-of-the-art statistical MT systems are based on this approach.
    Yet, the use of this decision rule has various problems: Here, we replaced p&#710;&#65533;(fJ1 |ei) by p&#710;&#65533;(ei|fJ1 ).
    From a theoretical framework of the sourcechannel approach, this approach is hard to justify.
    Yet, if both decision rules yield the same translation quality, we can use that decision rule which is better suited for efficient search.
    As alternative to the source-channel approach, we directly model the posterior probability Pr(ei|fJ1 ).
    An especially well-founded framework for do
