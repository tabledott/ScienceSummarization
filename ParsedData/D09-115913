s can hardly cover all possible situations.
    By taking advantage of the kernel methods which can search a feature space much larger than that could be represented by a feature extraction-based approach, we define a new tree kernel over phrase dependency trees and incorporate this kernel within an SVM to extract relations between opinion expressions and product features.
    The potential relation set consists of the all combinations between candidate product features and candidate opinion expressions in a sentence.
    Given a phrase dependency parsing tree, we choose the subtree rooted at the lowest common parent(LCP) of opinion expression and product feature to represent the relation.
    Dependency tree kernels has been proposed by (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).
    Their kernel is defined on lexical dependency tree by the convolution of similarities between all possible subtrees.
    However, if the convolution containing too many irrelevant subtrees, over-fitting may occur and decreases the performance
