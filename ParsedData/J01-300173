s defined by a standard machine readable dictionary, with a high degree of accuracy.
    Our evaluation shows that disambiguation can be carried out with more accurate results when several knowledge sources are combined.
    It remains unclear exactly what it means to optimize the combination of modules within a learning system like TiMBL: we could, in further work, treat the part-of-speech tagger as a partial tagger and not a filter, and we could allow the system to learn some &amp;quot;optimal&amp;quot; weighting of all the partial taggers.
    It also remains an interesting question whether, because of the undoubted existence of novel senses in text, a sense tagger can ever reach the level that part-of-speech tagging has.
    However, we believe we have shown that interesting combinations of WSD methods on a substantial training corpus are possible, and that this can show, among other things, the relative independence of the types of semantic information expressed by the various forms of lexical input.
