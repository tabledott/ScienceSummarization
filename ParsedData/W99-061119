ent or not.
    Both MLR (Aone and Bennett, 1995) and RESOLVE (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995), for example, apply the C4.5 decision tree induction algorithm (Quinlan, 1992) to the task.
    As supervised learning algorithms, both systems require a fairly large amount of training data that has been annotated with coreference resolution information.
    Our approach, on the other hand, uses unsupervised learning4 and requires no training data.5 In addition, both MLR and RESOLVE require an additional mechanism to coordinate the collection of pairwise coreference decisions.
    Without this mechanism, it is possible that the decision tree classifies NP i and NP i as coreferent, and NP i and NPk as coreferent, but NP i and NPk as not coreferent.
    In an evaluation on the MUC-6 data set (see Table 6), RESOLVE achieves an F-measure of 47%.
    The MUC-6 evaluation also provided results for a large number of non-learning approaches to coreference resolution.
