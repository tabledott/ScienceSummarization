  Automatically Labeling Semantic Classes
  
    Systems that automatically discover semantic classes have emerged in part to address the limitations of broad-coverage lexical resources such as WordNet and Cyc.
    The current state of the art discovers many semantic classes but fails to label their concepts.
    We propose an algorithm labeling semantic and for leveraging them to extract relationships using a top-down approach.
  
  
    The natural language literature is rich in theories of semantics (Barwise and Perry 1985; Schank and Abelson 1977).
    However, WordNet (Miller 1990) and Cyc (Lenat 1995) aside, the community has had little success in actually building large semantic repositories.
    Such broad-coverage lexical resources are extremely useful in applications such as word sense disambiguation (Leacock, Chodorow and Miller 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu 2001).
    Current manually constructed ontologies such as WordNet and Cyc have important limitations.
    First, they of
