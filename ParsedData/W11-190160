o do joint mention detection and coreference resolution.
    While it did not happen to be among the top-performing systems, the difference in performance could be due to the richer features used by other systems rather than to the use of a joint model.
    Most systems represented the markable mentions internally in terms of the parse tree NP constituent span, but some systems used shared attribute models, where the attributes of the merged entity are determined collectively by heuristically merging the attribute types and values of the different constituent mentions.
    Various types of trained models were used for predicting coreference.
    It is interesting to note that some of the systems, including the best-performing one, used a completely rule-based approach even for this component.
    Most participants appear not to have focused much on eventive coreference, those coreference chains that build off verbs in the data.
    This usually meant that mentions that should have linked to the eventive verb
