n.
    There will also be a brief review of previous work using syntactic information for language modeling, before we introduce our model in Section 4.
    Three parse trees: (a) a complete parse tree; (b) a complete parse tree with an explicit stop symbol; and (c) a partial parse tree.
  
  
    This section will introduce probabilistic (or stochastic) context-free grammars (PCFGs), as well as such notions as complete and partial parse trees, which will be important in defining our language model later in the paper.'
    In addition, we will explain some simple grammar transformations that will be used.
    Finally, we will explain the notion of c-command, which will be used extensively later as well.
    PCFGs model the syntactic combinatorics of a language by extending conventional context-free grammars (CFGs).
    A CFG G = (V,T,P, St), consists of a set of nonterminal symbols V, a set of terminal symbols T, a start symbol St E V, and a set of rule productions P of the form: A a, where a E (VU T)*.
