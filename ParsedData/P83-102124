se a value array representation of bindings (Boyer and Moore.
    1972) while exploring any given derivation path. reducing to a constant the variable lookup time at the cost of having to save and restore o(n) variable bindings from the value array each time the parsing procedure moves to explore a different derivation path.
    Secondly, the unification cost can be made independent of the derivation length, if we forgo the occurs check that prevents a variable from being bound to a term containing it.
    Finally, the combination of structure sharing and copying suggested in the last section eliminates the overhead of switching to a different derivation path in the value array method at the cost of a uniform o(log n) time to look up or create a variahIP binding in a balanced binary tree.
    When adding a new edge to the chart, a chart parser must verify that no edge with the same label between the same nodes is already present.
    In general DCG parsing (and therefore in online parsing with any unification
