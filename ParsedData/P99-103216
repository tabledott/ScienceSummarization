e previous project reporting intercoder agreement results for similar categories, the switchboard-DAMSL project mentioned above.
    While their Kappa results are very good for other tags, the opinion-statement tagging was not very successful: &amp;quot;The distinction was very hard to make by labelers, and accounted for a large proportion of our interlabeler error&amp;quot; (Jurafsky et al., 1997).
    In step 6, as in step 3, there is strong evidence of relative bias among judges D, J and M. Each pairwise comparison of judges also shows a strong pattern of symmetric disagreement.
    The results of this analysis are presented in Table 3.3 Also as in step 3, the two-category latent class model produces the most consistent clusters across the data configurations.
    Thus, it is used to define the bias-corrected tags for the second data set as well.
  
  
    Recently, there have been many successful applications of machine learning to discourse processing, such as (Litman, 1996; Samuel et al., 1998).
