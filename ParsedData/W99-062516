    In each of the three runs, two of these subsets were used for training and one for testing.
    To create a reference standard, the entire collection of 10,345 paragraph pairs was marked for by two reviewers who were given definition and detailed instructions.
    Each reindependently marked each paragraphs as similar or not similar.
    Subsequently, the two
