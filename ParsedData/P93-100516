nt rate, defined as the percentage of sentences for which the correct parse is proposed among the many parses that the grammar provides for a sentence.
    We also measure the parse base, which is defined as the geometric mean of the number of proposed parses on a per word basis, to quantify the ambiguity of the grammar.
    &#8226; the Viterbi rate defined as the percentage of sentences for which the most likely parse is consistent.
    The any-consistent rate is a measure of the grammar's coverage of linguistic phenomena.
    The Viterbi rate evaluates the grammar's coverage with the statistical model imposed on the grammar.
    The goal of probabilistic modelling is to produce a Viterbi rate close to the any-consistent rate.
    The any-consistent rate is 90% when we require the structure and the labels to agree and 96% when unlabeled bracketing is required.
    These results are obtained on 760 sentences from 7 to 17 words long from test material that has never been seen by the grammarian.
