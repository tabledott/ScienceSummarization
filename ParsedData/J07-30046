mmars (Stabler 2004), or Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman 1996, 2000).
    However, until very recently, only handwritten grammars, which lack the wide coverage and robustness of Treebank parsers, were available for these formalisms (Butt et al. 1999; XTAG-group 1999; Copestake and Flickinger 2000; OpenCCG1 [White and Baldridge 2003; White 2006]).
    Because treebank annotation for individual formalisms is prohibitively expensive, there have been a number of efforts to extract TAGs, LFGs, and, more recently, HPSGs, from the Penn Treebank (Xia 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker 2000; Xia, Palmer, and Joshi 2000; Xia 2001; Cahill et al. 2002; Miyao, Ninomiya, and Tsujii 2004; O&#8217;Donovan et al.
    2005; Shen and Joshi 2005; Chen, Bangalore, and Vijay-Shanker 2006).
    Statistical parsers that are trained on these TAG and HPSG corpora have been presented by Chiang (2000) and Miyao and Tsujii (2005), whereas the LFG parsing system of Cahill et al. (2004) uses a postprocessing step on the output of
