Again, the distribution deviates from a gaussian distribution substantially more than Gale &amp; Church (1991) report for French/German/English.
    Moreover, the distribution does not resemble any smooth distribution at all, including the logarithmic normal used by Brown et al. (1991), raising doubts about the potential performance of pure length-based alignment.
    Continuing nevertheless, to estimate the other term Pr(Li .= L2), a prior over six classes is constructed, where the classes are defined by the number of passages included within L1 and L2.
    Table 1 shows the probabilities used.
    These probabilities are taken directly from Gale &amp; Church (1991); slightly improved performance might be obtained by estimating these probabilities from our corpus.
    The aligned results using this model were evaluated by hand for the entire contents of a ranpoint that the Honourable Member has made to say that, when at the outset of our discussions I said that I did not think that the Government would be re
