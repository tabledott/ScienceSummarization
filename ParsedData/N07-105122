    This MAX-RULE-PRODUCT algorithm does not need special treatment of infinite unary chains because it is optimizing a product rather than a sum.
    While these three methods yield very similar results (see Fig.
    2), the MAX-RULEPRODUCT algorithm consistently outperformed the other two.
    Overall, the closed-form options were superior to the reranking ones, except on exact match, where the gains from correctly calculating the risk outweigh the losses from the truncation of the candidate set.
  
  
    Most research on parsing has focused on English and parsing performance on other languages is generally significantly lower.3 Recently, there have been some attempts to adapt parsers developed for English to other languages (Levy and Manning, 2003; Cowan and Collins, 2005).
    Adapting lexicalized parsers to other languages in not a trivial task as it requires at least the specification of head rules, and has had limited success.
    Adapting unlexicalized parsers appears to be equally diffic
