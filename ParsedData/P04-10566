    Candidate extractions consist of base NPs, augmented with all their contiguous subsequences headed by a noun or number.
    The set of features associated with each candidate is based on the feature templates introduced in (Collins, 2002), used there for training a ranking algorithm on the extractions returned by a maximum-entropy tagger.
    Many of these features use the concept of word type, which allows a different form of token generalization than POS tags.
    The short type of a word is created by replacing any maximal contiguous sequences of capital letters with 'A', of lowercase letters with 'a', and of digits with '0'.
    For example, the word TGF-1 would be mapped to type A-0.
    Consequently, each token position i in
