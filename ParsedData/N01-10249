result in progressively word beginnings with frequencies in excess of some better overall solutions. threshold (T ).
    We call these pseudo-prefixes.
    We As in our earlier approach (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), we begin by generating, from an untagged corpus, a list of word pairs that might be morphological variants.
    Our algorithm has changed somewhat, though, since we previously sought word pairs that vary only by a prefix or a suffix, yet we now wish to generalize to those with circumfixing differences.
    We use &#8220;circumfix&#8221; to mean true circumfixes like the German ge-/-t as well as combinations of prefixes and suffixes.
    It should be mentioned also that we assume the existence of languages having valid circumfixes that are not composed merely of a prefix and a suffix that appear independently elsewhere.
    To find potential morphological variants, our first goal is to find word endings which could serve as suffixes.
    We had shown in our earlier work how one might do this using a
