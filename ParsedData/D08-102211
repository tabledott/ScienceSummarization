 hyperedges at each node.
    In other words, it becomes nondeterministic how to &#8220;cut&#8221; a forest into tree fragments, which is analogous to the non-deterministic pattern-match in forest-based decoding (Mi et al., 2008).
    For example there are two parse hyperedges e1 and e2 at the root node in Figure 4.
    When we follow one of them to grow a fragment, there again will be multiple choices at each of its tail nodes.
    Like in tree-based case, a fragment is said to be complete if all its leaf nodes are admissible.
    Otherwise, an incomplete fragment can grow at any non-admissible frontier node v, where following each parse hyperedge at v will split off a new fragment.
    For example, following e2 at the root node will immediately lead us to two admissible nodes, NPB0, 1 and VP1, 6 (we will highlight admissible nodes by gray shades Algorithm 1 Forest-based Rule Extraction. in this section like in Figures 3 and 4).
    So this fragment, frag1 = {e2}, is now complete and we can extract a rule, I
