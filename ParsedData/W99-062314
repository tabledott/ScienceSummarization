 precision is larger than 0.5 only in those partitions that contain very few samples.
    From this we see that a finer-grained model for parser combination, at least for the features we have examined, will not give us any additional power.
    The results in Table 2 were achieved on the development set.
    The first two rows of the table are baselines.
    The first row represents the average accuracy of the three parsers we combine.
    The second row is the accuracy of the best of the three parsers.'
    The next two rows are results of oracle experiments.
    The parser switching oracle is the upper bound on the accuracy that can be achieved on this set in the parser switching framework.
    It is the performance we could achieve if an omniscient observer told us which parser to pick for each of the sentences.
    The maximum precision row is the upper bound on accuracy if we could pick exactly the correct constituents from among the constituents suggested by the three parsers.
