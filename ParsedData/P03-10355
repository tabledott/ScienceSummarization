    Some types of unknown words that are not discussed in Sproat&#8217;s system are dealt with in our system.
  
  
    There is no standard definition of Chinese words &#8211; linguists may define words from many aspects (e.g.

    For example, the plausible word segmentation for the sentence in Figure 1(a) is as shown.
