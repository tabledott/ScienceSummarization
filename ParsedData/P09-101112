record type, a record is chosen uniformly from the set of records with that type): where s(t) def = 1r E s : r.t = t} and r0.t is a dedicated START record type.2 We also model the transition of the final record type to a designated STOP record type in order to capture regularities about the types of records which are described last.
    More sophisticated models of coherence could also be employed here (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008).
    We assume that s includes a special null record whose type is NULL, responsible for generating parts of our text which do not refer to any real records.
    Each record type t E T has a separate field choice model, which specifies a distribution over a sequence of fields.
    We want to capture salience and coherence at the field level like we did at the record level.
    For instance, in the weather domain, the minimum and maximum fields of a temperature record are mentioned whereas the average is not.
