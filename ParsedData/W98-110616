    Devising the right set of role assignments for a case frame can be surprisingly difficult.
    Determining the necessary thematic roles for an event is relatively straightforward, but anticipating how they will be manifested syntactically can be tricky.
    For example, consider some of the manually defined case frames that were used to recognize terrorist events in the UMass MUC-4 system (Lehnert et al., 1992a).
    The ATTACK case frame shows a very common situation where multiple conceptual roles map to the same syntactic role.
    When &amp;quot;attacked&amp;quot; is used as a passive verb, the subject may be either a victim or a physical target, and the object of the preposition &amp;quot;by&amp;quot; may be the agent or instrument.
