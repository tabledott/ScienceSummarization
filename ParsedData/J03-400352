eans distance is adjacent, A=0 means not adjacent) are as follows: Some alternative structures for the same surface sequence of chunks (NPB PP PP in the first case, NPB PP SBAR in the second case) in which the adjacency condition distinguishes between the two structures.
    The percentages are taken from sections 2&#8211;21 of the treebank.
    In both cases right-branching structures are more frequent.
    = 0.177 x 0.0557 x 0.8853 x 0.7078 = 0.006178 Probabilities for the SBAR case in Figure 14, assuming the SBAR contains a verb (V=0 means modification does not cross a verb, V=1 means it does), are as follows: Some alternative structures for the same surface sequence of chunks in which the verb condition in the distance measure distinguishes between the two structures.
    In both cases the low-attachment analyses will get higher probability under the model, because of the low probability of generating a PP modifier involving a dependency that crosses a verb.
