 SIM.
    Both of these differences are statistically significant at p &lt; 0.002 by a Fisher Sign Test.
    The gain in performance is observed across all five aspects.
    Our model also yields significant improvement (p &lt; 0.05) over the decoding-only variant GG DECODE, confirming the importance of joint training.
    As shown in Figure 2, our model demonstrates consistent improvement over the baselines across all the training rounds.
    Model Analysis We separately analyze our percomputed separately on cases of actual consensus and actual disagreement. formance on the 210 test instances where all the target ranks agree and the remaining 290 instances where there is some contrast.
    As Table 2 shows, we outperform the PRANK baseline in both cases.
    However on the consensus instances we achieve a relative reduction in error of 21.8% compared to only a 1.1% reduction for the other set.
    In cases of consensus, the agreement model can guide the ranking models by reducing the decision space to five r
