			PHEAD, or an underscore if not available.
			The PHEAD and PDEPREL were not used at all in this year?s data sets (i.e., they always contained underscores) but were maintained for compatibilitywith last year?s data sets.
			This means that, in prac tice, the first six columns can be considered as input to the parser, while the HEAD and DEPREL fields are the output to be produced by the parser.
			Labeled training sets contained all ten columns; blind test sets only contained the first six columns; and gold standard test sets (released only after the end of the test period) again contained all ten columns.
			All data files were encoded in UTF-8.
			The official evaluation metric in both tracks wasthe labeled attachment score (LAS), i.e., the per centage of tokens for which a system has predicted the correct HEAD and DEPREL, but results were also reported for unlabeled attachment score (UAS), i.e., th
