			A learn ing system for semantic parsing is given a trainingcorpus of NL sentences paired with their respec tive MRs from which it has to induce a semantic parser which can map novel NL sentences to their correct MRs. Figure 1 shows an example of an NL sentence and its MR from the CLANG domain.
			CLANG (Chen et al, 2003) is the standard formal coachlanguage in which coaching advice is given to soc cer agents which compete on a simulated soccer field in the RoboCup 1 Coach Competition.
			In theMR of the example, bpos stands for ?ball posi tion?.
			The second domain we have considered is the GEOQUERY domain (Zelle and Mooney, 1996) which is a query language for a small database of about 800 U.S. geographical facts.
			Figure 2 shows an NL query and its MR form in a functional querylanguage.
			The parse of the functional query language is also shown along with the involved productions.
			This example is also used later to illus trate how our system does semantic parsing.
