ive (resp. negative) seed set by adding to it the synonyms of positive (resp. negative) seed terms and the antonyms of negative (resp. positive) seed terms.
    The system classifies then a target term t into either Positive or Negative by means of two alternative learning-free methods based on the probabilities that synonyms of t also appear in the respective expanded seed sets.
    A problem with this method is that it can classify only terms that share some synonyms with the expanded seed sets.
    Kim and Hovy also report an evaluation of human inter-coder agreement.
    We compare this evaluation with our results in Section 5.
    The approach we have proposed for determining term orientation (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) is described in more detail in Section 3, since it will be extensively used in this paper.
    All these works evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by checking them against precompiled sets of Positive and Negative terms, i.e. checking how good the algorithms are at classi
