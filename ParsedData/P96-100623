    We compared the classification accuracy of LEXAS against the default strategy of picking the most frequent sense.
    This default strategy has been advocated as the baseline performance level for comparison with WSD programs (Gale et al., 1992).
    There are two instantiations of this strategy in our current evaluation.
    Since WORDNET orders its senses such that sense 1 is the most frequent sense, one possibility is to always pick sense 1 as the best sense assignment.
    This assignment method does not even need to look at the training sentences.
    We call this method &amp;quot;Sense 1&amp;quot; in Table 5.
    Another assignment method is to determine the most frequently occurring sense in the training sentences, and to assign this sense to all test sentences.
    We call this method &amp;quot;Most Frequent&amp;quot; in Table 5.
    The accuracy of LEXAS on these two test sets is given in Table 5.
    Our results indicate that exemplar-based classification of word senses scales up quite well whe
