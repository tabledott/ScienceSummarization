ull Boolean descriptions can be generated.
    This can be done in many different ways depending, among other things, on what form of descriptions are preferred, for example, disjunctions of conjunctions, or conjunctions of disjunctions.
    We will aim for the latter, while staying as close as possible to the Incremental Algorithm.
    The algorithm proceeds as follows.
    First we add negations to the list of atomic properties.
    Then D&amp;RPlural runs a number of times: first, in Phase 1, the algorithm is performed using all positive and negative literals; if this algorithm ends before C = S, Phase 2 is entered in which further distractors are removed from C by making use of negations of intersections of two literals, and so on, until either C = S (Success) or all combinations have been tried (Failure).
    Observe that the negation of an intersection comes down to set union, because of De Morgan&#8217;s Law: P1 n &#183; &#183; &#183; n Pn = P1 U &#183; &#183; &#183; U Pn.
    Thus, Phase 2 of the algo
