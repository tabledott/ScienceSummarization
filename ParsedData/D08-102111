 The number of unique paraphrases dropped from several million to 800,000.
    The fact that we are able to produce paraphrases for a much smaller set of phrases is a downside to using syntactic constraints as we have initially proposed.
    It means that we would not be able to generate paraphrases for phrases such as create equal.
    Many NLP tasks, such as SMT, which could benefit from paraphrases require broad coverage and may need to paraphrases for phrases which are not syntactic constituents.
  
  
    To generate paraphrases for a wider set of phrases, we change our phrase extraction heuristic again so that it produces phrase pairs for arbitrary spans in the sentence, including spans that aren&#8217;t syntactic constituents.
    We assign every span in a sentence a syntactic label using CCG-style notation (Steedman, 1999), which gives a syntactic role with elements missing on the left and/or right hand sides.
    The function CCG-labels describes the set of CCGlabels for the phrase spanning positions
