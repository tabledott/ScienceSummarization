adaptations to the SMT task, the core sense disambiguation task remains pure WSD: ? The rich context features are typical of WSD and almost never used in SMT.
			The dynamic integration of context-sensitive translation probabilities is not typical of SMT.?
			Although it is embedded in a real SMT sys tem, the WSD task is exactly the same as inrecent and coming Senseval Multilingual Lexi cal Sample tasks (e.g., Chklovski et al (2004)), where sense inventories represent the semantic distinctions made by another language.
			We begin by presenting the WSD module and the SMT integration technique.
			We then show that incorporating it into a standard phrase-based SMT baseline system consistently improves translation quality across all three different test sets from the Chinese-English IWSLT text translation evaluation,as well as on the larger NIST Chinese-English trans lation task.
			Depending on the metric, the individualgains are sometimes modest, but remarkably, incorporating WSD never hurts, and helps enough
