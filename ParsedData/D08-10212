    Multiple paraphrases are frequently extracted for each phrase and can be ranked using a paraphrase probability based on phrase translation probabilities.
    We find that the quality of the paraphrases that are generated in this fashion improves significantly when they are required to be the same syntactic type as the phrase that they are paraphrasing.
    This constraint: A thorough manual evaluation of the refined paraphrasing technique finds a 19% absolute improvement in the number of paraphrases that are judged to be correct.
    This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes related work in syntactic constraints on phrase-based SMT and work utilizing syntax in paraphrase discovery.
    Section 3 details the problems with extracting paraphrases from parallel corpora and our improvements to the technique.
    Section 4 describes our experimental design and evaluation methodology.
    Section 5 gives the results of our experiments, and Section 6 discusses their implications.
