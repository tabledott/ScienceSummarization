n using a fixed probability threshold (which resulted in the lower accuracy of 86.4% reported above).
    Furthermore, we see in Figure 4 that the N mostsubjective-sentences method generally outperforms the other baseline summarization methods (which perhaps suggests that sentiment summarization cannot be treated the same as topic-based summarization, although this conjecture would need to be verified on other domains and data).
    It&#8217;s also interesting to observe how much better the last N sentences are than the first N sentences; this may reflect a (hardly surprising) tendency for movie-review authors to place plot descriptions at the beginning rather than the end of the text and conclude with overtly opinionated statements.
    The previous section demonstrated the value of subjectivity detection.
    We now examine whether context information, particularly regarding sentence proximity, can further improve subjectivity extraction.
    As discussed in Section 2.2 and 3, contextual constraints are eas
