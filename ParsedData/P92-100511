 
    In this section we outline the semantics of the QLF language in a way that is as close as possible to classical approaches that provide the semantics in terms of a function from models to truth values.
    The main difference is that denotation functions will be partial functions for some unresolved QLF formulas, reflecting the intuition that these are 'partial interpretations'.
    The denotation of a QLF expression will be extended monotonically as it is further resolved, a fully resolved formula receiving a total function as its denotation.
    The semantics is not intended to describe the resolution process.
    Before giving evaluation rules for the QLF language, we first present a simplified version of the semantics for fully instantiated QLF expressions.
    This is for expository purposes only; the full QLF semantics does not depend on the simplified version.
    We will use the notation [[E]]m for the truth value of an expression E with respect to a model m (but will leave m implicit). m includ
