matically by a maximum-entropy-based parts-ofspeech tagger (Tsuruoka and Tsujii 2005).
    The results indicate a drop of about three points in labeled precision/recall (a two-point drop in unlabeled precision/recall).
    A reason why we observed larger accuracy drops in labeled precision/recall is that Sentence length vs. accuracy. predicate&#8211;argument relations are fragile with respect to parts-of-speech errors because predicate types (e.g., adjective, intransitive verb) are determined depending on the parts-of-speech of predicate words.
    Although our current parsing strategy assumes that parts-of-speech are given beforehand, for higher accuracy in real application contexts, we will need a method for determining parts-of-speech and parse trees jointly.
    Table 15 shows a manual classification of the causes of disambiguation errors in 100 sentences randomly chosen from Section 00.
    In our evaluation, one error source may cause multiple dependency errors.
    For example, if an incorrect lexical
