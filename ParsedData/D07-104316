2 Rand Index can be interpreted as the probability that a pair of points is clustered similarly (together or separately) in C and K .Meila (2007) describes a number of poten tial problems of this class of measures posed by (Fowlkes and Mallows, 1983) and (Wallace, 1983).
			The most basic is that these measures tend not to vary over the interval of [0, 1].
			Transformations likethose applied by the adjusted Rand Index and a mi nor adjustment to the Mirkin measure (see Section4) can address this problem.
			However, pair matching measures also suffer from distributional problems.
			The baseline for Fowlkes-Mallows varies sig nificantly between 0.6 and 0 when the ratio of datapoints to clusters is greater than 3 ? thus including nearly all real-world clustering problems.
			Similarly, the Adjusted Rand Index, as demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations in (Fowlkes and Mal lows, 1983), varies from 0.5 to 0.95.
			This variance in the measure?s baseline prompts Meila to ask if the assumption of linearity foll
