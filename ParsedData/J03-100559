mWER and the number of search errors decrease significantly as the coverage pruning threshold tc increases.
    For the GE reordering constraint, mWER decreases from 73.5% to 24.9%.
    For a coverage pruning threshold tc &#8805; 5.0, mWER remains nearly constant at 25.0%, although search errors still occur.
    For the S3 reordering constraint, mWER decreases from 70.0% to 28.3%.
    The largest coverage threshold tested for the S3 constraint is tc = 5.0, since for larger threshold values tc, the search procedure cannot be carried out because of memory and time restrictions.
    The number of search errors is reduced as the coverage pruning threshold is increased.
    It turns out to be difficult to verify search errors by looking at the reference translation probabilities Qref alone.
    The translation with the maximum translation probability seems to be quite narrowly defined.
    The coverage pruning is more effective for the GE constraint than for the S3 constraint, since the overall search space for th
