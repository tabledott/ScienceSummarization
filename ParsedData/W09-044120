 of paraphrase quality is presented in Section 4.1, followed by a brief analysis of the effect of varying the pivot corpus used by the automatic paraphrase generation upon the correlation performance of the TERp metric in Section 4.2.
    We analyzed the utility of the paraphrase probability and found that it was not always a very reliable estimate of the degree to which the pair was semantically related.
    For example, we looked at all paraphrase pairs that had probabilities greater than 0.9, a set that should ideally contain pairs that are paraphrastic to a large degree.
    In our analysis, we found the following five kinds of paraphrases in this set: pairs only differ in the morphological form for one of the words.
    As the examples show, any knowledge that these pairs may provide is already available to TERp via stemming.
    (50 ton &#8594; 50 tons) (caused clouds &#8594; causing clouds) (syria deny &#8594; syria denies) Given this distribution of the pivot-based paraphrases, we experimented with a
