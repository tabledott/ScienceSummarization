ind-best-value is then caUed with A = type, and initial-value set to the basic-level type of Object1, which, let us assume, is dog.
  Assume user-knows(Object1, (type, dog)) is true, i.e., the user knows or can easily perceive that  Objectl is a dog.
  Find-best-value then sets value to dog, and examines the taxonomic descendants of dog to see if any of them are accurate descriptions of Ob- ject1 (this is the subsumption test) and rule out more distractors than dog does.
  In this case, the only accurate child of dog is chihuahua, but (type, chihuahua) does not have more discriminatory power than (type, dog) (both rule out {Object3}), so find- best-value returns dog as the best value for the type attribute.
  Make-referring-expression the  verifies that (type.
  dog) rules out at least one distraetor, and therefore adds this attribute-value pair to L, while removing rules-out((type, dog)) = {Object3} from D. This means that  the only remaining distraetor in D is Object2.
