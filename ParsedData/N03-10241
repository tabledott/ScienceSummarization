ration systems (Iordanskaja et al., 1991; Lenke, 1994; Stede, 1999).
    And researchers in multi-document text summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999), information extraction (Shinyama et al., 2002), and question answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Hermjakob et al., 2002) have focused on identifying and exploiting paraphrases in the context of recognizing redundancies, alternative formulations of the same meaning, and improving the performance of question answering systems.
    In previous work (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002), paraphrases are represented as sets or pairs of semantically equivalent words, phrases, and patterns.
    Although this is adequate in the context of some applications, it is clearly too weak from a generative perspective.
    Assume, for example, that we know that text pairs (stock market rose, stock market gained) and (stock market rose, stock prices rose) have the same meaning.
    If we memorized only these two pairs, it would be impossible to i
