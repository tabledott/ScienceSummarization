eral hours for each pass.
    By trading CPU time for memory massively, the time needed by a C++ implementation on a Sun 4/75 was reduced to 1.7 mm for the first pass, 0.8 mm for the second, and 0.5 min for the third pass in an application to this pair of articles.
    (Initialization, i.e., reading the files and building up the data structures, takes another 0.6 min in the beginning.)
    It should be noted that a naive implementation of the algorithm without using the appropriate data structures can easily lead to times that are a factor of 30 higher and do not scale up to larger texts.
    The application of our method to a text that we put together from the Hansard corpus had essentially no problem in identifying the correct sentence alignment in a process of five passes.
    The alignments for the first 1000 sentences of the English text were checked by hand, and seven errors were found; five of them occurred in sentences where sentence boundaries were not correctly identified by the program because of p
