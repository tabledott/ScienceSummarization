he training procedure was an expectationmaximization (EM) procedure like that used by Melamed (2000), except that maximum weighted bipartite matching was used instead of competitive linking.
    Any entry containing a NULL was then removed.
    We add to this dictionary a list of English-French cognate pairs, identified using the method of Tiedemann (1999).
    Tiedemann&#8217;s approach involved learning languagespecific character weights for the computation of weighted edit distance to measure cognateness.
    He used a list of known cognates to train the weights.
    We instead used the weighted translation pairs in a translation model lexicon built from the Bible.8 The result is 35,513 word pairs from the corpus of Web pages under consideration.
    An additional set of 11,264 exact string matches were added (also from the corpus of Web pages).
    Qualitatively, these entries were highly noisy; a random selection of the cognate pairs is shown in Table 2.
    All of these word pairs were added to the dict
