similarity between the raw SMS text and the normalized English text.
    The 1st row of Table 5 reports the similarity as 0.5784 in BLEU score, which implies that there are quite a number of English word 3-gram that are common in the raw and normalized messages.
    The 2nd experiment is carried out using only simple dictionary look-up.
    Lexical ambiguity is addressed by selecting the highest-frequency normalization candidate, i.e., only unigram LM is used.
    The performance of the 2nd experiment is 0.6958 in BLEU score.
    It suggests that the lingo dictionary plus the unigram LM is very useful for SMS normalization.
    Finally we carry out the 3rd experiment using dictionary look-up plus bi-gram LM.
    Only a slight improvement of 0.0128 (0.7086-0.6958) is obtained.
    This is largely because the English words in the lingo dictionary are mostly highfrequency and commonly-used.
    Thus bi-gram does not show much more discriminative ability than unigram without the help of the phrasebased lexical ma
