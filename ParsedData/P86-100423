    Clause semantics calls reference resolution for such an implicit constituent in the same way that it calls reference resolution for explicit constituents.
    Reference resolution treats elided noun phrases exactly as it treats pronouns, that is by instantiating them to the first member of a list of potential pronominal referents, the FocusList.
    The general treatment of pronouns resembles that of[Sidner1979], although there are some important differences, which are discussed in detail in [Dah11986].
    The hypothesis that elided noun phrases can be treated in much the same way as pronouns is consistent with previous claims by 1Gunde119801, and [Kameyama1985], that in languages which regularly allow zero-np's, the zero corresponds to the focus.
    If these claims are correct, it is not surprising that in a sublanguage that allows zero-np's, the zero should also correspond to the focus.
    After control returns to clause semantics from reference resolution, semantics checks the selectional r
