 but this is too costly and brittle.
    Recently, a number of machine learning approaches have been proposed (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Mooney, 2007).
    However, they are supervised, and providing the target logical form for each sentence is costly and difficult to do consistently and with high quality.
    Unsupervised approaches have been applied to shallow semantic tasks (e.g., paraphrasing (Lin and Pantel, 2001), information extraction (Banko et al., 2007)), but not to semantic parsing.
    In this paper we develop the first unsupervised approach to semantic parsing, using Markov logic (Richardson and Domingos, 2006).
    Our USP system starts by clustering tokens of the same type, and then recursively clusters expressions whose subexpressions belong to the same clusters.
    Experiments on a biomedical corpus show that this approach is able to successfully translate syntactic variations into a logical representation of their common meaning (e.g., USP learns to map active and passive voice to the
