 in German), but it is not at all a morpheme.
    The possessive marker 's, on the other hand, is of relatively low frequency in English, but is clearly a morpheme.
    MDL is nonetheless the key to understanding this problem.
    In the next section, I will present a brief description of the algorithm used to bootstrap the problem, one which avoids the trap mentioned briefly in note 21.
    This provides us with a set of candidate splittings, and the notion of the signature of the stem becomes the working tool for determining which of these splits is linguistically significant.
    MDL is a framework for evaluating proposed analyses, but it does not provide a set of heuristics that are nonetheless essential for obtaining candidate analyses, which will be the subject of the next two sections.
  
  
    The central idea of minimum description length analysis (Rissanen 1989) is composed of four parts: first, a model of a set of data assigns a probability distribution to the sample space from which the data is a
