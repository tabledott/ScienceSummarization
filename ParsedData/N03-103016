or ENABLEMENT-NS For each tuple ,the probability estimates the The dominance set of a DS-LST contains feature representations of a discourse segmented lexicalized syntactic tree.
    Each feature is a representation of the syntactic and lexical information that is found at the point where two edus are joined together in a DS-LST.
    Our hypothesis is nan .
    The span of is ,and set has two elements involving edus from it, namely the dominance relationships and .
    To decide the appropriate structure, keeps them both; this is because a different dominance relationship between edus 1 and 2, namely , would most likely influence the structure probability of .
    In the case of (the probability of the relation ), we keep both the lexical heads and the syntactic labels, but filter out the edu identifiers (clearly, the relation between two spans does not depend on the positions of the spans involved); also, we filter out all the elements of whose dominance relationship does not hold across the two sub-spans of
