se indexing and synset indexing, against the manually disambiguated collection (experiment 6).
    The synset run performs approximately as the basic SMART run.
    It seems therefore useless to apply conceptual indexing if no disambiguation of the query is feasible.
    This is not a major problem in an interactive system that may help the user to disambiguate his query, but it must be taken into account if the process is not interactive and the query is too short to do reliable disambiguation.
  
  
    We have experimented with a retrieval approach based on indexing in terms of WordNet synsets instead of word forms, trying to address two questions: 1) what potential does WordNet offer for text retrieval, abstracting from the problem of sense disambiguation, and 2) what is the sensitivity of retrieval performance to disambiguation errors.
    The answer to the first question is that indexing by synsets can be very helpful for text retrieval; our experiments give up to a 29% improvement over a standard SMART
