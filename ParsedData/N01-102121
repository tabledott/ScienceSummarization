son, 1998)) in the processing of unreduced relative clauses.
    Since the Earley parser is designed to work with context-free grammars, the following example grammar adopts a GPSG-style analysis of relative clauses (Gazdar et al., 1985, page 155).
    The estimates of the ratios for the two S[+R] rules are obtained by counting the proportion of subject relatives among all relatives in the Treebank&#8217;s parsed Brown corpus7.
    Grammar (3) generates both subject and object relative clauses.
    S[+R] &#8594; NP[+R] VP is the rule that generates subject relatives and S[+R] &#8594; NP[+R] S/NP generates object relatives.
    One might expect there to be a greater processing load for object relatives as soon as enough lexical material is present to determine that the sentence is in fact an object relatives.
    The same probabilistic Earley parser (modified to handle null-productions) explains this asymmetry in the same way as it explains the garden path effect.
    Its predictions, under the same linking hy
