 an invaluable resource in the study of natural language processing (NLP) such as machine translation and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).
    It is also valuable for language education.
    However, no such corpus has been available to the public.
    We recently have obtained a noisy parallel corpus of Japanese and English newspapers consisting of issues published over more than a decade and have tried to align their articles and sentences.
    We first aligned the articles using a method based on CLIR (Collier et al., 1998; Matsumoto and Tanaka, 2002) and then aligned the sentences in these articles by using a method based on dynamic programming (DP) matching (Gale and Church, 1993; Utsuro et al., 1994).
    However, the results included many incorrect alignments due to noise in the corpus.
    To remove these, we propose two measures (scores) that evaluate the validity of article and sentence alignments.
    Using these, we can selectively extract valid alignments.
    In this paper, we first
