y while dashed arrows indicate starting of a new entity. added in the next step by either linking to the existing entity, or starting a new entity.
    A second layer of nodes are created to represent the two possible outcomes.
    Subsequent mentions are added to the tree in the same manner.
    The process is mention-synchronous in that each layer of tree nodes are created by adding one mention at a time.
    Since the number of tree leaves is the number of possible coreference outcomes and it equals the Bell Number (Bell, 1934), the tree is called the Bell tree.
    The Bell Number is the number of ways of partitioning distinguishable objects (i.e., mentions) into non-empty disjoint subsets (i.e., entities).
    The Bell Number has a &#8220;closed&#8221; formula and it increases rapidly as increases: !
    Clearly, an efficient search strategy is necessary, and it will be addressed in Section 4.
    Figure 1 illustrates how the Bell tree is created for a document with three mentions.
