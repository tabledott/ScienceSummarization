w of the domains being considered.
    In Section 3, we present the semantic parsing model of WASP.
    Section 4 outlines the algorithm for acquiring a bilingual lexicon through the use of word alignments.
    Section 5 describes a probabilistic model for semantic parsing.
    Finally, we report on experiments that show the robustness of WASP in Section 6, followed by the conclusion in Section 7.
  
  
    In this paper, we consider two domains.
    The first domain is ROBOCUP.
    ROBOCUP (www.robocup.org) is an AI research initiative using robotic soccer as its primary domain.
    In the ROBOCUP Coach Competition, teams of agents compete on a simulated soccer field and receive coach advice written in a formal language called CLANG (Chen et al., 2003).
    Figure 1 shows a sample MR in CLANG.
    The second domain is GEOQUERY, where a functional, variable-free query language is used for querying a small database on U.S. geography (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Kate et al., 2005).
