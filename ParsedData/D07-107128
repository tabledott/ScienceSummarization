and Manandhar (1999) present an unsupervised approach for learning CCG lexiconsthat does not represent the semantics of the training sentences.
			Bos et al (2004) present an al gorithm that learns CCG lexicons with semantics but requires fully?specified CCG derivations in thetraining data.
			Bozsahin (1998) presents work on us ing CCG to model languages with free word order.
			In addition, there is related work that focuses on modeling child language learning.
			Siskind (1996) presents an algorithm that learns word-to-meaning mappings from sentences that are paired with a set of possible meaning representations.
			Villavicencio (2001) describes an approach that learns a categorial grammar with syntactic and semantic information.Both of these approaches use sentences from child directed speech, which differ significantly from the natural language interface queries we consider.
			Finally, there is work on manually developing parsing techniques to improve robustness (Carbonell 684and Hayes, 1983; Seneff, 1
