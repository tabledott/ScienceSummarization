on sentence-level ? Diagnostic error analysis on sentence-level is naturally provided.
			This is a feature that many machine translation researchers look for.
			Many existing data points ? Every sentence is a data point instead of every system (corpus-level).
			For example, there are 919 sentences vs. 8 systems in the 2003 NIST Chinese-English machine translation evaluation.
			Only one objective function to optimize ? Minimize a single ORANGE score instead of maximize Pearson?s correlation coefficients between automatic scores and human judgments in adequacy, fluency, or other quality metrics.
			A natural fit to the existing statistical machine translation framework ? A metric that ranks a good translation high in an n best list could be easily integrated in a minimal error rate statistical machine translation training framework (Och 2003).
