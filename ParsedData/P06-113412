 to the condition.
    One annotator judged only the sense (giving tag O), while the second considered the hypernym as well (giving tag UB).
  
  
    Encouraged by the results of the agreement study, we devised a method targeting the automatic annotation of word senses for subjectivity.
    The main idea behind our method is that we can derive information about a word sense based on information drawn from words that are distributionally similar to the given word sense.
    This idea relates to the unsupervised word sense ranking algorithm described in (McCarthy et al., 2004).
    Note, however, that (McCarthy et al., 2004) used the information about distributionally similar words to approximate corpus frequencies for word senses, whereas we target the estimation of a property of a given word sense (the &#8220;subjectivity&#8221;).
    Starting with a given ambiguous word w, we first find the distributionally similar words using the method of (Lin, 1998) applied to the automatically parsed texts of the Britis
