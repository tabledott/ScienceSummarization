nterestingly, the combination of the SVM committee-based learning model with our classifier (denoted by &#8216;SVM (Prob)&#8217;), performs competitively with both of the approaches that use our probabilistic learning model and significantly better than the SVM committeebased learning model with an SVM classifier, &#8216;SVM (SVM)&#8217;, according to a binomial sign test (p&lt;0.01) after 150 iterations.
    These results suggest that performance may be enhanced when the learning and classification tasks are carried out by different models.
    This is an interesting possibility, which we intend to explore further.
    An important issue in incremental learning scenarios is identification of the optimum stopping point.
    Various methods have been investigated to address this problem, such as &#8216;counter-training&#8217; (Yangarber, 2003) and committee agreement (Zhang, 2004); how such ideas can be adapted for this task is one of many avenues for future research.
