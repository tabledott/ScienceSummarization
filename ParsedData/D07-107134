IS data, where we have selectively removed various aspectsof the approach, to measure their impact on performance.
			It can be seen that accuracy is seriously de graded if the new CCG rules are removed, or if the features associated with these rules (which allow the model to penalize these rules) are removed.Finally, we report results concerning the effi ciency of the new online algorithm as compared to the ZC05 algorithm.
			We compared running times for the new algorithm, and the ZC05 algorithm, on the geography domain, with both methods making 4 passes over the training data.
			The new algorithm took less than 4 hours, compared to over 12 hours for the ZC05 algorithm.
			The main explanation for this improved performance is that on many trainingexamples,10 in step 1 of the new algorithm a cor rect parse is found, and the algorithm immediately moves on to the next example.
			Thus GENLEX is not required, and in particular parsing the example with the large set of entries generated by GENLEX is not require
