turing the same information.
    Table 6 contains results for dynamic adaptation, using the source-side EM metric for linear weighting.
    In this setting, TM adaptation is much less effective, not significantly better than the baseline; performance of combined LM and TM adaptation is also lower.
    However, LM adaptation improves over the baseline by up to a BLEU point.
    The perTable 7 shows results for the hybrid approach described at the end of section 3.5.2: global weights are learned on NIST04-nw, but linear weights are derived dynamically from the current test file.
    Performance drops slightly compared to pure crossdomain adaptation, indicating that it may be important to have a good fit between global and mixture weights.
    The results of the final experiment, to determine the effects of source granularity on dynamic adaptation, are shown in table 8.
    Source-side EM distances are applied to the whole test set, to genres within the set, and to each document individually.
