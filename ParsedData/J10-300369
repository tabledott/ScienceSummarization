rs given a bilingual parallel corpus C. Summary.
    Extract bilingual phrase pairs from C using word alignments and standard SMT heuristics.
    Pivot all pairs of English phrases on any shared foreign phrases and consider them paraphrases.
    The alignment notation from Algorithm 3 is employed. where both p(&#175;ej |f&#175;) and p(&#175;f |&#175;ek) can be computed using maximum likelihood estimation as part of the bilingual phrasal extraction process: number of times f&#175; is extracted with &#175;ej number of times f&#175; is extracted with any e&#175; p( &#175;ej |f&#175; ) = Once the probability values are obtained, the most likely paraphrase can be chosen for any phrase.
    Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) are able to extract millions of phrasal paraphrases from a bilingual parallel corpus.
    Such an approach is able to capture a large variety of paraphrastic phenomena in the inferred paraphrase pairs but is seriously limited by the bilingual word alignment technique.
    Even state-of-the-art a
