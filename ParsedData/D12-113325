ies, we found an improvement across the board for both languages, with no category having a significant decrease in F-score, but we also found some interesting patterns for categories that improved more than the average.
    Table 5 shows selected entries from the confusion matrix for German, where we see substantial improvements for finite and non-finite verbs, which are often morphologically ambiguous but which can be disambiguated using syntactic context.
    We also see improved accuracies for common and proper nouns, which are both capitalized in standard German orthography and therefore often mistagged, and for relative pronouns, which are less often confused for determiners in the joint model.
    Table 6 gives a similar snapshot for English, and we again see improvements for verb categories that are often morphologically ambiguous, such as past participles, which can be confused for past tense verbs, and present tense verbs in third person singular, which can be confused for nouns.
