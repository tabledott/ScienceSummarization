rformance.
    This paper will attempt to establish upper and lower bounds on the level of performance that can be expected in an evaluation.
    An estimate of the lower bound of 75% (averaged over ambiguous types) is obtained by measuring the performance produced by a baseline system that ignores context and simply assigns the most likely sense in all cases.
    An estimate of the upper bound is obtained by assuming that our ability to measure performance is largely limited by our ability obtain reliable judgments from human informants.
    Not surprisingly, the upper bound is very dependent on the instructions given to the judges.
    Jorgensen, for example, suspected that lexicographers tend to depend too much on judgments by a single informant and found considerable variation over judgments (only 68% agreement), as she had suspected.
    In our own experiments, we have set out to find word-sense disambiguation tasks where the judges can agree often that we could show that they were outperforming the base
