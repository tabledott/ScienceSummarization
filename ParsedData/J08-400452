pendorff also discusses the criteria to be used in the selection of the sample, from the minimum number of units (obtained using a formula from Bloch and Kraemer [1989], reported in Krippendorff [2004a, page 239]), to how to make the sample representative of the data population (each category should occur in the sample often enough to yield at least five chance agreements), to how to ensure the reliability of the instructions (the sample should contain examples of all the values for the categories).
    These recommendations are particularly relevant in light of the comments of Craggs and McGee Wood (2005, page 290), which discourage researchers from testing their coding instructions on data from more than one domain.
    Given that the reliability of the coding instructions depends to a great extent on how complications are dealt with, and that every domain displays different complications, the sample should contain sufficient examples from all domains which have to be annotated according to the instructions
