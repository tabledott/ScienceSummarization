stical model for resolving pronouns, whereas we used a decision tree learning algorithm and resolved general noun phrases, not just pronouns.
    Similarly, Kehler (1997) used maximum entropy modeling to assign a probability distribution to alternative sets of coreference relationships among noun phrase entity templates, whereas we used decision tree learning.
    The work of Aone and Bennett (1995), McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), Fisher et al. (1995), and McCarthy (1996) employed decision tree learning.
    The RESOLVE system is presented in McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), Fisher et al. (1995), and McCarthy (1996).
    McCarthy and Lehnert (1995) describe how RESOLVE was tested on the MUC5 English Joint Ventures (EJV) corpus.
    It used a total of 8 features, 3 of which were specific to the EJV domain.
    For example, the feature JV-CHILD-i determined whether i referred to a joint venture formed as the result of a tie-up.
    McCarthy (1996) describes how the original RESOLVE for MUC-5 EJV was improved to inclu
