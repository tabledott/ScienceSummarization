asis for the training of some of their component classifiers.
    Resulting accuracy is comparable to, but not better than, that of the maximum entropy tagger.
    Their approach is also demonstrated for prepositional phrase attachment, again with results comparable to but not better than state-of-the-art single classifier systems.
    High accuracy on the same task is claimed by Alegre, Sopena, and Lloberas (1999) for combining ensembles of neural networks.
    ADABOOST has also been applied to text filtering (Schapire, Singer, and Singhal 1998) and text categorization (Schapire and Singer 1998).
    In Chen, Bangalore, and Vijay-Shanker (1999), classifier combination is used to overcome the sparse data problem when using more contextual information in supertagging, an approach in which parsing is reduced to tagging with a complex tagset (consisting of partial parse trees associated with lexical items).
    When using pairwise voting on models trained using different contextual information, an error reductio
