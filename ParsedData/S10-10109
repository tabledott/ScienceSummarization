s for task A, recognition and normalization of time expressions, are given in tables 2 and 3.
    The results for Spanish are more uniform and generally higher than the results for English.
    For Spanish, the f-measure for TIMEX3 extents ranges from 0.88 through 0.91 with an average of 0.89; for English the f-measure ranges from 0.26 through 0.86, for an average of 0.78.
    However, due to the small sample size it is hard to make any generalizations.
    In both languages, type detection clearly was a simpler task than determining the value.
    The results for task B, event recognition, are given in tables 4 and 5.
    Both tables contain results for both Spanish and English, the first part of each table contains the results for Spanish and the next part the results for English.
    The column headers in table 5 are abbreviations for polarity (pol), mood (moo), modality (mod), tense (tns), aspect (asp) and class (cl).
