propriate for use with multiple coders, different magnitudes of disagreement, and missing values, and is based on assumptions similar to those of &#960;; and weighted kappa &#954;w (Cohen 1968), a generalization of &#954;.
    2.6.1 Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945;.
    The coefficient &#945; (Krippendorff 1980, 2004a) is an extremely versatile agreement coefficient based on assumptions similar to &#960;, namely, that expected agreement is calculated by looking at the overall distribution of judgments without regard to which coders produced these judgments.
    It applies to multiple coders, and it allows for different magnitudes of disagreement.
    When all disagreements are considered equal it is nearly identical to multi-&#960;, correcting for small sample sizes by using an unbiased estimator for expected agreement.
    In this section we will present Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945; and relate it to the other coefficients discussed in this article, but we will start with &#945;&#8217;s origins as a measure of vari
