 If neither z and x nor z and y were found in the same minimal NP, then it is quite possible that the sum of their dissimilarities could be less than the dissimilarity between x and y.
    The algorithm tries to produce a partition of the set of adjectives as close as possible to the optimal one.
    This is accomplished by minimizing an objective function (Ico which scores a partition P. The objective function we use is The algorithm starts by producing a random partition of the adjectives, computing its 0:1) value and then for each adjective computing the improvement in (1) for every cluster where it can be moved; the adjective is moved to the cluster that yields the best improvement of (13 if there is such a cluster and the next adjective is considered.
    This procedure is repeated until no more moves lead to an improvement of O.
    This is a hill-climbing method and therefore is guaranteed to converge, but it may lead to a local minimum of (1), inferior to the global minimum that corresponds to the opt
