ence of discourse (deep anaphora)&#8212;or whether they are interpreted with respect to a previous logical form (surface anaphora).
    While their deep anaphors include pronouns, Hankamer and Sag do not consider other expressions like NPs in discourse that might also be described in similar model-interpretive terms, nor do they describe in any detail how model interpretation works for the expressions they consider.
    To avoid confusion then, I will use the term discourse anaphors for expressions that have these two properties.'
    My main point will be that tensed clauses share these properties as well, and hence should also be considered discourse anaphors.
    This will capture in a simple way the oft-stated, but difficult-to-prove intuition that tense is anaphoric.
    To begin with, in Section 2, I characterize the dependency of an anaphoric expression Xb on a discourse entity Ea in terms of an anaphoric function a(Xb,Ea), that itself depends on 1. the ontology of the specified entity Ea and 2. discou
