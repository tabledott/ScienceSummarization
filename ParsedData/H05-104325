hich change their SO label based on associatedfeatures, but whose SO labels in the context of the respec tive features are consistent throughout the reviews (e.g.,in the Hotel domain, ?hot water?
			has a consistently posi tive connotation, whereas ?hot room?
			has a negative one).
			In order to solve this task, OPINE first assigns each (w, f) pair an initial SO label which is w?s SO label.
			The system then executes a relaxation labeling step duringwhich syntactic relationships between words and, respec tively, between features, are used to update the default SO labels whenever necessary.
