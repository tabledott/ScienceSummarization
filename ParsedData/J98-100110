an applied this knowledge base to the problem of WSD: in an attempt to translate Virgil's Georgics by machine, she looked up, for each Latin word stem, the translation in a Latin-English dictionary and then looked up this word in the word-to-head index of Roget's.
    In this way, each Latin word stem was associated with a list of Roget head numbers associated with its English equivalents.
    The numbers for words appearing in the same sentence were then examined for overlaps.
    Finally, English words appearing under the multiply-occurring head categories were chosen for the translation.'
    Masterman's methodology is strikingly similar to that underlying much of the knowledge-based WSD accomplished recently (see Section 2.3).
    It is interesting to note that Weaver's text also outlined the statistical approach to language analysis prevalent now, nearly fifty years later: This approach brings into the foreground an aspect of the matter that probably is absolutely basic&#8212;namely, the statistical char
