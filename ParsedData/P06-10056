e count paths with terminals that are both pronouns.
    We partition pronouns into seven groups of matching gender, number, and person; for example, the first person singular group contains I, me, my, mine, and myself.
    If the two terminal pronouns are from the same group, coreference along the path is likely.
    If they are from different groups, like I and his, then they are non-coreferent.
    Let NS(p) be the number of times the two terminal pronouns of a path, p, are from the same pronoun group, and let ND(p) be the number of times they are from different groups.
    We define the coreference of p as: Our statistics indicate the example path, &#8220;Noun needs pronoun&#8217;s support,&#8221; has a low C(p) value.
    We could use this fact to prevent us from resolving &#8220;his&#8221; to &#8220;John&#8221; when &#8220;John needs his support&#8221; is presented to a pronoun resolution system.
    To mitigate data sparsity, we represent the path with the root form of the verbs and nouns.
    Also, we
