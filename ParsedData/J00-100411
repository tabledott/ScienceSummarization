tion, the transducers derive pairs of dependency trees, a source language dependency tree and a target dependency tree.
    A dependency tree for a sentence, in the sense of dependency grammar (for example Hays [1964] and Hudson [1984]), is a tree in which the words of the sentence appear as nodes (we do not have terminal symbols of the kind used in phrase structure grammar).
    In such a tree, the parent of a node is its head and the child of a node is the node's dependent.
    The source and target dependency trees derived by a dependency transduction model are ordered, i.e., there is an ordering on the nodes of each local tree.

    Each pair of source and target trees generated is synchronized in the sense to be formalized in Section 4.2.
