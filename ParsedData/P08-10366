ly correlated with a particular aspect.
    The Multi-Grain Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (MG-LDA) is an extension of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).
    As was demonstrated in Titov and McDonald (2008), the topics produced by LDA do not correspond to ratable aspects of entities.
    In particular, these models tend to build topics that globally classify terms into product instances (e.g., Creative Labs Mp3 players versus iPods, or New York versus Paris Hotels).
    To combat this, MG-LDA models two distinct types of topics: global topics and local topics.
    As in LDA, the distribution of global topics is fixed for a document (a user review).
    However, the distribution of local topics is allowed to vary across the document.
    A word in the document is sampled either from the mixture of global topics or from the mixture of local topics specific to the local context of the word.
    It was demonstrated in Titov and McDonald (2008) that ratable aspects will be captured by local
