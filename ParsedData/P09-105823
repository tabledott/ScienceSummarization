    Nakagawa and Uchimoto (2007) provided empirical evidence that the characterbased model is not always better than the wordbased model.
    They proposed a hybrid approach that exploits both the word-based and characterbased models.
    Our approach overcomes the limitation of the original hybrid model by a discriminative online learning algorithm for training.
  
  
    In this paper, we presented a discriminative wordcharacter hybrid model for joint Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging.
    Our approach has two important advantages.
    The first is robust search space representation based on a hybrid model in which word-level and characterlevel nodes are used to identify known and unknown words, respectively.
    We introduced a simple scheme based on the error-driven concept to effectively learn the characteristics of known and unknown words from the training corpus.
    The second is a discriminative online learning algorithm based on MIRA that enables us to incorporate arbitrary features to
