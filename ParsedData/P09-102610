sociated with topics (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu et al., 2005).
    In our work, we search for aspects associated with a topic, but particularized to polarity.
    Not all aspects associated with a topic are discriminative with respect to stance; we hypothesized that, by including polarity, we would be more likely to find useful associations.
    An aspect may be associated with both of the debate topics, but not, by itself, be discriminative between stances toward the topics.
    However, opinions toward that aspect might discriminate between them.
    Thus, the basic unit in our web mining process is a polarity-target pair.
    Polarity-target pairs which explicitly mention one of the topics are used to anchor the mining process.
    Opinions about relevant aspects are gathered from the surrounding context.
    For each debate, we downloaded weblogs and forums that talk about the main topics (corresponding to the sides) of that debate.
    For example, for the iPhone vs. Blackberry debate, we search the web
