an annotated corpus of paper abstracts taken from the MEDLINE database.
    Currently, 670 abstracts are annotated with named entity tags by biomedical experts and made available to public (Ver.
    1.1).1 These 670 abstracts are a subset of more than 5,000 abstracts obtained by the query &#8220;human AND blood cell AND transcription factor&#8220; to the MEDLINE database.
    Table 1 shows basic statistics of the GENIA corpus.
    Since the GENIA corpus is intended to be extensive, there exist 24 distinct named entity classes in the corpus.2 Our task is to find a named entity region in a paper abstract and correctly select its class out of these 24 classes.
    This number of classes is relatively large compared with other corpora used in previous studies, and compared with the named entity task for newswire articles.
    This indicates that the task with the GENIA corpus is hard, apart from the difficulty of the biomedical domain itself.
  
  
    We formulate the named entity task as the classification of e
