ll data sets, past work has often emphasized them over semantic knowledge.
    Of course, all state-of-the-art coreference systems have needed to capture semantic compatibility to some degree.
    As an example of nominal headword compatibility, a &#8220;president&#8221; can be a &#8220;leader&#8221; but cannot be not an &#8220;increase.&#8221; Past systems have often computed the compatibility of specific headword pairs, extracted either from lexical resources (Ng, 2007; Bengston and Roth, 2008; Rahman and Ng, 2009), web statistics (Yang et al., 2005), or surface syntactic patterns (Haghighi and Klein, 2009).
    While the pairwise approach has high precision, it is neither realistic nor scalable to explicitly enumerate all pairs of compatible word pairs.
    A more compact approach has been to rely on named-entity recognition (NER) systems to give coarse-grained entity types for each mention (Soon et al., 1999; Ng and Cardie, 2002).
    Unfortunately, current systems use small inventories of types and so pr
