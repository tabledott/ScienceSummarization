nal viewpoint, deducing textual topic structure from lexical occurrence information alone is appealing, both because it is easy to compute, and because discourse cues are sometimes misleading with respect to the topic structure (Brown and Yule 1983, Section 3).
    TextTiling assumes that a set of lexical items is in use during the course of a given subtopic discussion, and when that subtopic changes, a significant proportion of the vocabulary changes as well.
    The algorithm is designed to recognize episode boundaries by determining where thematic components like those listed by Chafe (1979) change in a maximal way.
    However, unlike other researchers who have studied setting, time, characters, and the other thematic factors that Chafe mentions, I attempt to determine where a relatively large set of active themes changes simultaneously, regardless of the type of thematic factor.
    This is especially important in expository text in which the subject matter tends to structure the discourse more so than c
