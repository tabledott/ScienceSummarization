t of all possible colors and index them in the document collection appropriately.
    We used the hyponym relations learned by our system to perform semantic indexing on a QA passage retrieval task.
    We selected the 179 questions from the QA track of TREC-2003 that had an explicit semantic answer type (e.g.
    &amp;quot;What band was Jerry Garcia with?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;What color is the top stripe on the U.S. flag?&amp;quot;).
    For each expected semantic answer type corresponding to a given question (e.g. band and color), we indexed the entire TREC-2002 IR collection with our system's hyponyms.
    We compared the passages returned by the passage retrieval module with and without the semantic indexing.
    We counted how many of the 179 questions had a correct answer returned in the top-1 and top-100 passages.
    Table 7 shows the results.
    Our system shows small gains in the performance of the IR output.
    In the top-1 category, the performance improved by 20%.
    This may lead to better
