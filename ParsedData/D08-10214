 2004; Quirk et al., 2005).
    Phrase-based rules have also been replaced with synchronous context free grammars (Chiang, 2005) and with tree fragments (Huang and Knight, 2006).
    A number of techniques for generating paraphrases have employed syntactic information, either in the process of extracting paraphrases from monolingual texts or in the extracted patterns themselves.
    Lin and Pantel (2001) derived paraphrases based on the distributional similarity of paths in dependency trees.
    Barzilay and McKeown (2001) incorporated part-of-speech information and other morphosyntactic clues into their co-training algorithm.
    They extracted paraphrase patterns that incorporate this information.
    Ibrahim et al. (2003) generated structural paraphrases capable of capturing longdistance dependencies.
    Pang et al. (2003) employed a syntax-based algorithm to align equivalent English sentences by merging corresponding nodes in parse trees and compressing them down into a word lattice.
