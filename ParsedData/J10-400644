ally similar, associated, or both), obtaining good results across the board.
    In the DM approach, we collect one set of statistics from the corpus, and then exploit different views of the extracted data and different algorithms to tackle different tasks.
    Turney, on the contrary, uses a single generic algorithm, but must go back to the corpus to obtain new training data for each new task.
    We compare DM with some of Turney&#8217;s results in Section 6 but, independently of performance, we find the DM approach more appealing.
    As corpora grow in size and are enriched with further levels of annotation, extracting ad hoc data from them becomes a very time-consuming operation.
    Although we did not carry out any systematic experiments, we observe that the extraction of tuple counts from (already POS-tagged and parsed) corpora in order to train our sample DM models took days, whereas even the most time-consuming operations to adapt DM to a task took on the order of 1 to 2 hours on the same machines (
