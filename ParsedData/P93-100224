 that alignment is a one-time cost and given available computing power.
    It is unclear, though, how much further it is worthwhile to proceed.
    The natural next step in sentence alignment is to account for word ordering in the translation model, e.g., the models described in (Brown et al., 1993) could be used.
    However, substantially greater computing power is required before these approaches can become practical, and there is not much room for further improvements in accuracy.
