#180;egin, 1997; Dechter, 2003), and updating a factor&#8217;s outgoing messages is known as constraint propagation.
    R&#180;egin (1994) famously introduced an efficient propagator for a global constraint, ALLDIFFERENT, by adapting combinatorial bipartite matching algorithms.
    In the same spirit, we will demonstrate efficient propagators for our global constraints, e.g. by adapting combinatorial algorithms for weighted parsing.
    We are unaware of any previous work on global factors in sum-product BP, although for max-product BP,13 Duchi et al. (2007) independently showed that a global 1-to-1 alignment constraint&#8212;a kind of weighted ALLDIFFERENT&#8212;permits an efficient propagator based on weighted bipartite matching.
    Table 1 shows our asymptotic runtimes for all factors in &#167;&#167;3.3&#8211;3.4.
    Remember that if several of these factors are included, the total runtime is additive.14 Propagating the local factors is straightforward (&#167;5.1).
    We now explain how to handle the g
