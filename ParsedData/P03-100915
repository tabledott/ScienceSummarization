or improvement, the result compares favourably to previously published results10.
    We argue, however, that evaluation against a monosemous gold standard reveals only part of the picture.
    10Due to differences in task definition and experimental setup, a direct comparison with earlier results is impossible.
    For example, Stevenson and Joanis (2003) report an accuracy of 29% (which implies mPUR &#8804; 29%), but their task involves classifying 841 verbs to 14 classes based on differences in the predicate-argument structure.
    In evaluation against the polysemic gold standard, we assume that a verb which is polysemous in our corpus data may appear in a cluster with verbs that share any of its senses.
    In order to evaluate the clusters against polysemous data, we assigned each polysemic verb V a single sense: the one it shares with the highest number of verbs in the cluster K(V ).
    Table 3 shows the results against polysemic and monosemous gold standards.
    The former are noticeably better than
