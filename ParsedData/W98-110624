 hits (i.e., spurious extractions).
    In the next section, we describe a corpus-based algorithm that constructs conceptual case frames empirically by learning semantic preferences for each extraction pattern and using these preferences to assign conceptual roles automatically.
    (Consequently, the human reviewer no longer needs to assign roles to the extraction patterns manually.)
    Extraction patterns with compatible syntactic constraints are then ISemantic constraints could be associated with the conceptual roles assigned by the human reviewer, but our goal is to assign both the conceptual roles and selectional restrictions automatically. merged to produce multi-slot case frames with selectional restrictions.
    The conceptual case frames should be more reliable at identifying relevant information (our experimental results support this hypothesis), and the case frames can instantiate multiple role objects in a single structure to simplify subsequent discourse processing.
