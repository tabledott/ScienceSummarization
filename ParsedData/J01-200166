the morphology of the language is quite reasonable already in its outlines.
    Nevertheless, the results, when studied up close, show that there remain a good number of errors that must be uncovered using additional heuristics and evaluated using the MDL measure.
    These errors may be organized in the following ways: In the next section, we discuss some of the approaches we have taken to resolving these problems.

    We can use the description length of the grammar formulated in (2) and (3) to evaluate any proposed revision, as we have already observed: note the description length of the grammar and the compressed corpus, perform a modification of the grammar, recompute the two lengths, and see if the modification improved the resulting description length.'
