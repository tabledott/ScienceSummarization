ald et al., 2005).
    It can be expected that the total decoding time for SDIG can be as short as 0.1 second per sentence.
    Neither of the two systems has any specific translation components, which are usually present in real world systems (E.g. components that translate numbers, dates, names, etc.)
    It is reasonable to expect that the performance of SDIG can be further improved with such specific optimizations.
  
  
    We noticed that the SDIG system outputs tend to be longer than those of the IBM Model 4 system, and are closer to human translations in length.
    This partly explains why the IBM Model 4 system has slightly higher individual n-gram precision scores (while the SDIG system outputs are still better in terms of absolute matches).
    The relative orders between the parent and child ETs in the output tree is currently kept the same as the orders in the input tree.
    Admittedly, we benefited from the fact that both Chinese and English are SVO languages, and that many of orderings betwee
