    . is computed over the set of coreferent NP pairs (with respect to the candidate partition), denoting the probability of encountering in this set when the pairs are represented as attribute-value vectors using N&amp;C&#8217;s features.
    On the other hand, is computed over the set of non-coreferent NP pairs (with respect to the candidate partition), denoting the probability of encountering in this set when the pairs are represented as attribute-value vectors using N&amp;C&#8217;s features.

    For evaluation purposes, we use the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) coreference corpus, which is composed of three data sets created from three different news sources, namely, broadcast news (BNEWS), newspaper (NPAPER), and newswire (NWIRE).5 Statistics of these data sets are shown in Table 2.
    In our experiments, we use the training texts to acquire coreference classifiers and evaluate the resulting systems on the test texts wi
