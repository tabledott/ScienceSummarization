absolute distance (see column four Table 4).
    All three effects interact in the cascade we describe.
    The PP chunker reduces the number of decisions for the relations finder (instead of one instance for the preposition and one for the NP chunk, we get only one instance for the PP chunk-). introduces an extra feature (Feature 12 in Table 3), and changes the context (instead of a preposition and an NP, context may now be one PP).
    As we already noted above, precision and recall are monotonically increasing when adding more structure.
    However, we note large differences, such as NP chunks which increase Fs_i by more than 10%, and VP chunks which add another 6.8%, whereas ADVPs and ADJPs yield hardly any improvement.
    This may partially be explained by the fact that these chunks are less frequent than the former two.
    Preps, on the other hand, while hardly reducing the average distance or the number of instances, improve 1,3-1 by nearly 1%.
    PPs yield another 1.1%.
