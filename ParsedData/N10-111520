The non-directional parser avoids error propagation by not making the initial error.
    On average, the non-directional parser manages to assign correct heads to over 60% of the tokens before making its first error.
    The MST parser would have ranked 5th in the shared task, and NONDIR would have ranked 7th.
    The better ranking systems in the shared task are either higher-order global models, beam-search based systems, or ensemble-based systems, all of which are more complex and less efficient than the NONDIR parser.
    Parse Diversity The parses produced by the nondirectional parser are different than the parses produced by the graph-based and left-to-right parsers.
    To demonstrate this difference, we performed an Oracle experiment, in which we combine the output of several parsers by choosing, for each sentence, the parse with the highest score.
    Results are presented in Table 4.
