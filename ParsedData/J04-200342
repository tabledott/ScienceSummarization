built, and only the size of C2 and the monolingual corpus have a substantial effect on the translation quality.
    It is interesting to note, though, that a basic statistical machine translation system with an accuracy near 50% can be built without any domain-specific bilingual corpus C2, solely on the basis of a disambiguated dictionary and the hierarchical lexicon models, as Table 9 shows. can be comparatively small, given the limited number of tag sequence pairs (tf|te) for which translation probabilities must be provided: In the Verbmobil training corpus, for example, there are only 261 different German and 110 different English tag sequences.
    &#8226; In the next step, the second bilingual corpus C2 and D' are combined, and a word alignment A for both is trained.
    C2, D', and A are presented as input to the maximum-entropy training of a hierarchical lexicon model as described in Section 4.2.
    &#8226; The language model can be trained on a separate monolingual corpus.
    As monolingual data are
