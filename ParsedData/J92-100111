use the meaning of a preposition actually names a relation, relation-based cues are a good source of information for disambiguating them.
    (References to objects in the discourse focus can also be a strong cue for disambiguating prepositions, but this cue appears fairly infrequently [Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner 19901.)
    The problem of determining role relationships entangles word sense discrimination with the problem of syntactic attachment.
    The attachment problem is a direct result of the ambiguity in determining whether a concept is related to an adjacent object, or to some enveloping structure that incorporates the adjacent object.
    Most proposed solutions to this problem specify a fixed set of ordered rules that a system applies until a unique, satisfactory attachment is found (Fodor and Frazier 1980; Wilks, Huang, and Fass 1985; Shieber 1983; Hirst 1987; Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler 1989).
    Such rules can be either syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic.
    Syntactic rules attempt to
