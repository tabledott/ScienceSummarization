ticularly terse and difficult (See Table 1).
    Yet tweets provide a unique compilation of information that is more upto-date and inclusive than news articles, due to the low-barrier to tweeting, and the proliferation of mobile devices.1 The corpus of tweets already exceeds the size of the Library of Congress (Hachman, 2011) and is growing far more rapidly.
    Due to the volume of tweets, it is natural to consider named-entity recognition, information extraction, and text mining over tweets.
    Not surprisingly, the performance of &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; NLP tools, which were trained on news corpora, is weak on tweet corpora.
    In response, we report on a re-trained &#8220;NLP pipeline&#8221; that leverages previously-tagged out-ofdomain text, 2 tagged tweets, and unlabeled tweets to achieve more effective part-of-speech tagging, chunking, and named-entity recognition.
