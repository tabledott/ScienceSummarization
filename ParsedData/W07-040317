atched words (Vogel et al., 2003).
    We include both pM1(&#175;e |f) and pM1( f|&#175;e).
    We can produce a translation model using insideoutside, without ever creating a Viterbi parse.
    However, we can also examine the maximum likelihood phrasal alignments predicted by the trained model.
    Despite its strengths derived from using phrases throughout training, the alignments predicted by our phrasal ITG are usually unsatisfying.
    For example, the fragment pair (order of business, ordre des travaux) is aligned as a phrase pair by our system, linking every English word to every French word.
    This is frustrating, since there is a clear compositional relationship between the fragment&#8217;s component words.
    This happens because the system seeks only to maximize the likelihood of its training corpus, and phrases are far more efficient than word-to-word connections.
    When aligning text, annotators are told to resort to many-to-many links only when no clear compositional relationship exists (M
