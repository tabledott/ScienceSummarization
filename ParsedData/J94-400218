ammatical roles, level of phrasal embedding, and parallelism of grammatical role.
    Semantic constraints and real-world knowledge play no role in filtering or salience ranking.
    Third, proximity of an NP relative to a pronoun is used to select an antecedent in cases in which several candidates have equal salience weighting.
    Fourth, intrasentential antecedents are preferred to intersentential candidates.
    This preference is achieved by three mechanisms: The fifth property which we note is that anaphora is strongly preferred to cataphora.
    RAP generates the list of non-coreferential pronoun&#8212;NP pairs for the current sentence, the list of pleonastic pronouns, if any, in the current sentence, the list of possible antecedent NP&#8212;lexical anaphor pairs, if any, for the current sentence, and the list of pronoun&#8212;antecedent NP pairs that it has identified, for which antecedents may appear in preceding sentences in the text.
    Each NP appearing in any of the first three lists is represen
