unded on both sides by words that could not be matched.
  Conclusions We have been studying how to find corresponding words in parallel texts given aligned regions.
  We have introduced several novel techniques that make substantial progress toward this goal.
  The philosophy underlying all our techniques is to keep errors of commission low.
  Whatever words are matched by these robust techniques should almost always be correct.
  Then, at any stage, the words that are matched can be used eortfidently for further esearch.
  The first technique we have introduced is the measurement of association of pairs of words by d~ 2, based on a two by two contingency table.
  This measure does better than mutual information at showing which pairs of words are translations, because it accounts for the cases in which one of the words occurs and the other does not.
  We apply this measure iteratively.
  Our caution is expressed by selecting at most one pair of words containing a given word on each iteration.
