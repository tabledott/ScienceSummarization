 vector-space representation of the contexts that each target term appears in (Pereira et al., 1993; Ruge, 1997; Lin, 1998b).
    Other systems take the whole document as the context and consider term co-occurrence at the document level (Crouch, 1988; Sanderson and Croft, 1999).
    Once these contexts have been defined, these systems then use clustering or nearest neighbour methods to find similar terms.
    Alternatively, some systems are based on the observation that related terms appear together in particular contexts.
    These systems extract related terms directly by recognising linguistic patterns (e.g.
    X, Y and other Zs) which link synonyms and hyponyms (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999).
    Our previous work (Curran and Moens, 2002) has evaluated thesaurus extraction performance and efficiency using several different context models.
    In this paper, we evaluate some existing similarity metrics and propose and motivate a new metric which outperforms the existing metrics.
    We also present an ap
