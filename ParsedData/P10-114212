ably favored over their negative counterparts.
    For example, three NPs are likely to end up in the same cluster in the resulting partition even if there is strong evidence that A and C are not coreferent, as long as the other two pairs (i.e., (A,B) and (B,C)) are classified as positive.
    Several algorithms that address one or both of these problems have been used for coreference clustering.
    Correlation clustering (Bansal et al., 2002), which produces a partition that respects as many pairwise decisions as possible, is used by McCallum and Wellner (2004), Zelenko et al. (2004), and Finley and Joachims (2005).
    Graph partitioning algorithms are applied on a weighted, undirected graph where a vertex corresponds to an NP and an edge is weighted by the pairwise coreference scores between two NPs (e.g., McCallum and Wellner (2004), Nicolae and Nicolae (2006)).
    The Dempster-Shafer rule (Dempster, 1968), which combines the positive and negative pairwise decisions to score a partition, is used by Kehl
