    Many researchers (e.g., Halliday St Hasan (1976), Tannen (1989), Walker (1991)) have noted that term repetition is a strong cohesion indicator.
    I have found in this work that term repetition alone is a very useful indicator of subtopic structure, when analyzed in terms of multiple simultaneous information threads.
    This section describes two algorithms for discovering subtopic structure using term repetition as a lexical cohesion indicator.
    The first method compares, for a given window size, each pair of adjacent blocks of text according to how similar they are lexically.
    This method assumes that the more similar two blocks of text are, the more likely it is that the current subtopic continues, and, conversely, if two adjacent blocks of text are dissimilar, this implies a change in subtopic flow.
    The second method, an extension of Morris Si Hirst's (1991) approach, keeps track of active chains of repeated ter
