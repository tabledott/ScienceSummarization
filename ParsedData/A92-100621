 from the previous proposition).
    This fails (since the two clauses have different verbs and different actants), so the current DSyntR is sent to the realizer, which prints out the first sentence.
    The new DSyntR becomes the current one.
    Control is returned to the text planner, which processes the third :make-propos it ion command and sends the appropriate proposition to the sentence planner.
    The sentence planner generates the clausal DSyntR tree shown in Figure 10 (the information is classified).
    It then attempts to combine the new clause with the &amp;quot;current DSyntR&amp;quot;, first using the adjectival attachment strategy.
    This succeeds, yielding the tree shown in Figure 11.
    It then returns control to the text planner, since another clause could be merged with the current DSyntR.
    The text planner then calls schema conceptual-break.
    The only effect of this schema is to send a conceptual-break message to the sentence planner, which thereupon sends its current DSyntR to
