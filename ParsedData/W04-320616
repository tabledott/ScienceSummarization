h graph edge is labeled with the syntactic relation between the words it connects.
    TE then substitutes each slot anchor (see section 3.1) in the parse graphs with its corresponding slot variable.
    Therefore, &#8220;Aspirin stops heart attack?&#8221; will be transformed into &#8216;X stop Y&#8217;.
    This way all the anchors for a certain slot are unified under the same variable name in all sentences.
    The parsed sentences related to all of the anchor sets are subsequently merged into a single set of parse graphs S = {P1, P2, ... , Pn} (see P1 and P2 in Figure 2).
    The core of TE is a General Structure Learning algorithm (GSL) that is applied to the set of parse graphs S resulting from the previous step.
    GSL extracts single-rooted syntactic DAGs, which are named spanning templates since they must span at least over Na slot variables, and should also appear in at least Nr sentences from S (In our experiments we set Na=2 and Nr=2).
    GSL learns maximal most general templates: they are spanni
