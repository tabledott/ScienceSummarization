ually inspected the calibrated plots for each classifier and chose the method that showed better calibration as the calibration procedure for that classifier.
    Plots of the predicted probabilities versus true probabilities for the ARCM-TmP VS ALL classifier, before and after calibration are shown in Figure 2.
    The performance improvement over a classifier that is trained using all the features for all the classes is shown in Table 5.
    Table 6 shows the performance of the system after adding the CCG features, additional features ex
  
  
    Adding new features can improve performance when the syntactic representation being used for classification contains the correct constituents.
    Additional features can&#8217;t recover from the situation where the parse tree being used for classification doesn&#8217;t contain the correct constituent representing an argument.
    Such parse errors account for about 7% absolute of the errors (or, about half of 12.7%) for the Charniak parse based system.
