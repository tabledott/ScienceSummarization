ed all the filters, or if the next highest did, etc.
    The three filters in the filtering phase may be done in parallel.
    The example we use to illustrate the algorithm is in figure 2.
  
  
    The goal of the current algorithm design was conceptual clarity rather than efficiency.
    The hope is that the structure provided will allow easy addition of further constraints and preferences.
    It would be simple to change the control structure of the algorithm so that it first proposed all the continuing or retaining anchors and then the shifting ones, thus avoiding a precomputation of all possible anchors.
    [GJW86] states that a realization may contribute more than one entity to the Cf(U).
    This is true in cases when a partially specified semantic description is consistent with more than one interpretation.
    There is no need to enumerate explicitly all the possible interpretations when constructing possible Cf(U)'s6, as long as the associated semantic theory allows partially specified interpreta
