aking the rules of a grammar in reverse order and inverting each of them in turn, later rules in the new sequence act as filters on ambiguities produced by earlier ones.
    The existence of a large class of ambiguities that are introduced at one point in the recognition process and eliminated at another has been a major source of difficulty in efficiently reversing the action of linguistically motivated phonological grammars.
    In a large grammar, the effect of these spurious ambiguities is multiplicative, since the information needed to cut off unproductive paths often does not become available until after they have been pursued for some considerable distance.
    Indeed, speech understanding systems that use phonological rules do not typically invert them on strings but rather apply them to the lexicon to generate a list of all possible word forms (e.g.
    Woods et al. 1976; Klatt 1980).
    Recognition is then accomplished by standard tablelookup procedures, usually augmented with special devices to ha
