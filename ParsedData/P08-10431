ined in the proposed syntactic analyses (the yields of syntactic parse-trees) and the spacedelimited tokens (henceforth, &#8216;tokens&#8217;) that constitute the unanalyzed surface forms (utterances).
    In Semitic languages the situation is very different.
    In Modern Hebrew (Hebrew), a Semitic language with very rich morphology, particles marking conjunctions, prepositions, complementizers and relativizers are bound elements prefixed to the word (Glinert, 1989).
