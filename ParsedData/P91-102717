 are relatively rare, instrumental adjuncts as in &amp;quot;John hit the naiL with a hammer&amp;quot; are more common.
    The problem, of course, is how to distinguish them from genuine, subcategorized PPs headed by with, as in &amp;quot;John sprayed the lawn with distilled water&amp;quot;.
    The hope is that a frequency analysis like the one planned for purpose adjuncts will work here as well, but how successful it will be, and if successful how large a sample size it will require, remain to be seen.
    The question of sample size leads back to an evaluation of the initial priorities, which favored simplicity, speed, and accuracy, over efficient use of the corpus.
    There are various ways in which the high-priority criteria can be traded off against efficiency.
    For example, consider (2c): one might expect that the overwhelming majority of occurrences of &amp;quot;is V-ing&amp;quot; are genuine progressives, while a tiny minority are cases copula.
    One might also expect that the occasional copula
