average increases with segment size, as we will discuss later, and changes if one assumes different distributions of false positives throughout the document.
    However, this does not change the fact that in most cases, false positives are penalized some amount less than false negatives.
    This is not an entirely undesirable side effect.
    This metric was devised to take into account how close an assigned boundary is to the true one, rather than just marking it as correct or incorrect.
    This method of penalizing false positives achieves this goal: the closer the algorithm&#8217;s boundary is to the actual boundary, the less it is penalized.
    However, overpenalizing false negatives to do this is not desirable.
    One way to fix the problem of penalizing false negatives more than false positives is to double the false positive penalty (or halve the false negative penalty).
    However, this would undermine the probabilistic nature of the metric.
    In addition, doubling the penalty may not always b
