correctly.
    The theoretical maximum accuracy for the task is, of course, 100%, although in Section 5 we discuss some classification results from human experts that indicate that a more realistic expectation is much lower (around 87%).
    We first report the results of experiments using a training methodology of 10-fold crossvalidation repeated 50 times.
    This means that the 10-fold cross-validation procedure is repeated for 50 different random divisions of the data.
    The numbers reported are the averages of the results over all the trials.
    That is, the average accuracy and standard error from each random division of the data (a single cross-validation run including 10 training and test sets) are averaged across the 50 different random divisions.
    This large number of experimental trials gives us a very tight bound on the mean accuracy reported, enabling us to determine with high confidence the statistical significance of differences in results.
    Table 8 shows that performance of classifica
