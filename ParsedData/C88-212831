racking search, that is, following the Prolog search strategy.
  The implementation is in Common Lisp and runs on Symbolics 3600, Sun, and Macintosh computers.
  It is used (in conjunction with a more extensive .grammar) ~s the generation component of the GENESYS system for utterance planning and production.
  6 Precursors Perhaps the clearest espousal of the notion of grammar eversability was made by Kay [1975], whose research into functional grammar has been motivated by the desire to "make it possible to generate and analyze sentences with the same grammar."
  Other researchers have also put such ideas into effect.
  Jacobss PHRED system [Jacobs, 1985] "operates from a declarative knowledge base of linguistic knowledge, common to that used by PHRAN", an analyzer for so-called phrasal grammars.
  Jacobs notes that other systems ~ have shared at least part of the linguistic information for parsing and generation; for instance, the HAM-ANS [Wahlster t al., 1983]a;nd VII~-LANG [Steinacker and Buchberger, 1983]
