er feature set we compared (Haghighi and Klein, 2009) &#8722;S against both our multi-pass system and its single-pass variant.
    The comparison indicates that both these contributions help: our single-pass system outperforms Haghighi and Klein (2009) consistently, and the multi-pass architecture further improves the performance of our single-pass system between 1 and 4 F1 points, depending on the corpus and evaluation metric.
    Recent unsupervised coreference work from Haghighi and Klein (2009) included a novel semantic component that matched related head words (e.g., AOL is a company) learned from select wikipedia articles.
    They first identified articles relevant to the entity mentions in the test set, and then bootstrapped from known syntactic patterns for apposition and predicate-nominatives in order to learn a database of related head pairs.
    They show impressive gains by using these learned pairs in coreference decisions.
    This type of learning using test set mentions is often described as
