eratively update them.
    We remove the entries when they do not co-occur with others.
    There are 25 such English name candidates.
    Thus, the initial scores are actually slightly different from the values in Table 3.
    We show the new scores and the best propagation scores in Table 5.
    In the table, &#8220;init.&#8221; refers to the initial scores. and &#8220;CO&#8221; and &#8220;MI&#8221; stand for best scores obtained using either the co-occurrence or mutual information method.
    While both methods result in gains, CO very slightly outperforms the MI approach.
    In the score propagation process, we introduce two additional parameters: the interpolation parameter &#945; and the number of iterations k. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the effects of these parameters.
    Intuitively, we want to preserve the initial score of a pair, but add a slight boost from its neighbors.
    Thus, we set &#945; very close to 1 (0.9 and 0.95), and allow the system to perform 20 iterations.
    In both figures, the
