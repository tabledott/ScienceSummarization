    Thus the purpose of this section is not to show that the acquired levels are &#8220;correct,&#8221; but simply to show how the levels vary with &#945; and the sample size.
    To show how the level of generalization varies with changes in &#945;, top(c,v,obj) was determined for a number of hand-picked (c, v, obj) triples over a range of values for &#945;.
    The triples were chosen to give a range of strongly and weakly selecting verbs and a range of verb frequencies.
    The data were again extracted from a subset of the BNC using the system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997), and the G2 statistic was used in the chi-square test.
    The results are shown in Table 3.
    The number of times the verb occurred with some object is also given in the table.
    The results suggest that the generalization level becomes more specific as &#945; increases.
    This is to be expected, since, given a contingency table chosen at random, a higher value of &#945; is more likely to lead to a significant result than a
