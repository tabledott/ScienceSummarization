sected alignment model (Liang et al., 2008), adding (s, t) to the lexicon if s was aligned to t at least three times and more than any other word.
    Also, as in Koehn and Knight (2002), we make use of a seed lexicon, which consists of a small, and perhaps incorrect, set of initial translation pairs.
    We used two methods to derive a seed lexicon.
    The first is to use the evaluation lexicon Le and select the hundred most common noun word types in the source corpus which have translations in Le.
    The second method is to heuristically induce, where applicable, a seed lexicon using edit distance, as is done in Koehn and Knight (2002).
    Section 6.2 compares the performance of these two methods.
    We evaluate a proposed lexicon Lp against the evaluation lexicon Le using the Fl measure in the standard fashion; precision is given by the number of proposed translations contained in the evaluation lexicon, and recall is given by the fraction of possible translation pairs proposed.12 Since our model natur
