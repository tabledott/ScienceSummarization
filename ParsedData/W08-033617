ous character and next character, and the conjunction of previous and current characters in the zero-order templates.
    We will refer to this segmenter as CRF-basic.
    Table 3 shows that the feature-based segmenter CRF-basic outperforms the lexicon-based MaxMatch by 5.9% relative F measure.
    Comparing the OOV recall rate and the IV recall rate, the reason is that CRFbasic wins a lot on the OOV recall rate.
    We see that a feature-based segmenter like CRF-basic clearly has stronger ability to recognize unseen words.
    On MT performance, however, CRF-basic is 0.38 BLEU points worse than MaxMatch on the test set.
    In Section 3.2, we will look at how the MT training and test data are segmented by each segmenter, and provide statistics and analysis for why certain segmenters are better than others.
    In Section 3.1 we have refuted two hypotheses.
    Now we know that: (i) phrase table construction does not fully capture what a word segmenter can do.
    Thus it is useful to have word segmentation f
