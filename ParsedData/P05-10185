 Centering Theory into a robust coherence metric (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2000; Hasler, 2004; Karamanis et al., 2004).
    Such a translation is challenging in several respects: one has to specify the &#8220;free parameters&#8221; of the system (Poesio et al., 2004) and to determine ways of combining the effects of various constraints.
    A common methodology that has emerged in this research is to develop and evaluate coherence metrics on manually annotated corpora.
    For instance, Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000) annotate a corpus of student essays with transition information, and show that the distribution of transitions correlates with human grades.
    Karamanis et al. (2004) use a similar methodology to compare coherence metrics with respect to their usefulness for text planning in generation.
    The present work differs from these approaches in two key respects.
    First, our method does not require manual annotation of input texts.
    We do not aim to produce complete centering annotations; instead,
