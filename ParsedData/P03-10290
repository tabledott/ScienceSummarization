  An Improved Extraction Pattern Representation Model For Automatic IE Pattern Acquisition
  
    Several approaches have been described for the automatic unsupervised acquisition of patterns for information extraction.
    Each approach is based on a particular model for the patterns to be acquired, such as a predicate-argument structure or a dependency chain.
    The effect of these alternative models has not been previously studied.
    In this paper, we compare the prior models and introduce a new model, the Subtree model, based on arbitrary subtrees of dependency trees.
    We describe a discovery procedure for this model and demonstrate experimentally an improvement in recall using Subtree patterns.
  
  
    Information Extraction (IE) is the process of identifying events or actions of interest and their participating entities from a text.
    As the field of IE has developed, the focus of study has moved towards automatic knowledge acquisition for information extraction, including domain-specific lex
