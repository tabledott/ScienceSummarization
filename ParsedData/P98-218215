29 valid to total entries for the category vehicle, and .36 for the category weapon.
    This can be seen in the slope of the graphs in figure 1.
    Tables 2 and 5 give the relevant data for the categories that we investigated.
    In general, the ratio of valid to total entries fell between .2 and .4, even in the cases that the output was relatively small.
    A second way to evaluate the algorithm is by the total number of valid entries produced.
    As can be seen from the numbers reported in table 2, our algorithm generated from 2.4 to nearly 3 times as many valid terms for the two contrasting categories from the MUC corpus than the algorithm of R&amp;S.
    Even more valid terms were generated for appropriate categories using the Wall Street Journal.
    Another way to evaluate the algorithm is with the number of valid entries produced that are not in Wordnet.
    Table 2 presents these numbers for the categories vehicle and weapon.
    Whereas the R&amp;S algorithm produced just 11 terms not already pr
