ed on deterministic parsing (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Kate et al., 2005), which lack the robustness that characterizes recent advances in statistical NLP.
    Other learning methods involve the use of fullyannotated augmented parse trees (Ge and Mooney, 2005) or prior knowledge of the NL syntax (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005) in training, and hence require extensive human efforts when porting to a new domain or language.
    In this paper, we present a novel statistical approach to semantic parsing which can handle MRs with a nested structure, based on previous work on semantic parsing using transformation rules (Kate et al., 2005).
    The algorithm learns a semantic parser given a set of NL sentences annotated with their correct MRs.
    It requires no prior knowledge of the NL syntax, although it assumes that an unambiguous, context-free grammar (CFG) of the target MRL is available.
    The main innovation of this alshows a sample query in this language.
    Note that both domains involve the use of MRs wit
