 is an alternate method of parsing that reduces the amount of disambiguation done by the parser.
    The idea is to locally check the constraints that are associated with the descriptions of lexical items to filter out incompatible descriptions.1 During this disambiguation, the system can also exploit statistical information that can be associated with the descriptions based on their distribution in a corpus of parses.
    We first employed these ideas in the context of Lexicalized Tree Adjoining grammars (LTAG) in Joshi and Srinivas (1994).
    Although presented with respect to LTAG, these techniques are applicable to other lexicalized grammars as well.
    In this paper, we present vastly improved supertag disambiguation results&#8212;from previously published 68% accuracy to 92% accuracy using a larger training corpus and better smoothing techniques.
    The layout of the paper is as follows: In Section 2, we present an overview of the robust parsing approaches.
