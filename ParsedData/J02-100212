between the false positive and the relevant correct boundaries; on average, it is k2, assuming a uniform distribution of boundaries across the document.
    This example shows the consequences of two different locations of false positives: on the left, the penalty is k2; on the right, it is k. Now, consider false positives.
    A false positive occurs when the algorithm places a boundary at some position where there is no boundary in the reference segmentation.
    The number of times that this false positive is noted by Pk depends on where exactly inside S2 the false positive occurs.
    (See Figure 3.)
    If it occurs in the middle of the segment, the false positive is noted k times (as seen on the right-hand side of Figure 3).
    If it occurs j &lt; k sentences from the beginning or the end of the segment, the segmentation is penalized j times.
    Assuming uniformly distributed false positives, on average a false positive is noted 2k times by the metric&#8212;half the rate for false negatives.
