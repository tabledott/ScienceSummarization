 chances of matching words in relevant documents by adding terms with similar statistical properties to those in the original query (Voorhees, 1994; Qiu and Frei, 1993; Xu and Croft, 1996).
    In this paper we will concentrate on the task of answer retrieval from FAQ pages, i.e., an IR problem where user queries are matched against documents consisting of question-answer pairs found in FAQ pages.
    Equivalently, this is a QA problem that concentrates on finding answers given FAQ documents that are known to contain the answers.
    Our approach to close the lexical gap in this setting attempts to marry QA and IR technology by deploying SMT methods for query expansion in answer retrieval.
    We present two approaches to SMT-based query expansion, both of which are implemented in the framework of phrase-based SMT (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003).
    Our first query expansion model trains an endto-end phrase-based SMT model on 10 million question-answer pairs extracted from FAQ pages.
