    A prototype is ready and Leary hopes to set requirements for a full system by the end of the year.

    In order to guarantee non-empty output for the overall condensation system, the generation component has to be fault-tolerant in cases where the transfer system operates on a fragmentary parse, or produces non-valid fstructures from valid input f-structures.
    Robustness techniques currently applied to the generator include insertion and deletion of features in order to match invalid transferoutput to the grammar rules and lexicon.
    Furthermore, repair mechanisms such as repairing subject-verb agreement from the subject&#8217;s number value are employed.
    As a last resort, a fall-back mechanism to the original uncondensed f-structure is used.
    These techniques guarantee that a non-empty set of reduced f-structures yielding grammatical strings in
