e majority class, broken down by part of speech.
    Note that SC3 and SC1 are most often better than the majority class, followed closely by PB2 and SC2.
    This suggests that the second order context vectors (SC) have an advantage over the first order vectors for small training data as is found among the 24 SENSEVAL-2 words.
    We believe that second order methods work better on smaller amounts of data, in that the feature spaces are quite small, and are not able to support the degree of exact matching of features between instances that first order vectors require.
    Second order context vectors succeed in such cases because they find indirect second order co&#8211; occurrences of feature words and hence describe the context more extensively than the first order representations.
    With smaller quantities of data, there is less possibility of finding instances that use exactly the same set of words.
    Semantically related instances use words that are conceptually the same but perhaps not lexically.
