ctures using feature forests (Miyao, Ninomiya, and Tsujii 2003; Miyao and Tsujii 2003, 2005).
    Together with the parameter estimation algorithm for feature forest models, these methods constitute a complete procedure for the probabilistic modeling of wide-coverage HPSG parsing.
    The methods we propose here were applied to an English HPSG parser, Enju (Tsujii Laboratory 2004).
    We report on an extensive evaluation of the parser through parsing experiments on the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al. 1994).
    The content of this article is an extended version of our earlier work reported in Miyao and Tsujii (2002, 2003, 2005) and Miyao, Ninomiya, and Tsujii (2003).
    The major contribution of this article is a strict mathematical definition of the feature forest model and the parameter estimation algorithm, which are substantially refined and extended from Miyao and Tsujii (2002).
    Another contribution is that this article thoroughly discusses the relationships between
