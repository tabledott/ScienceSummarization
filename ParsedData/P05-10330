  A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model For Statistical Machine Translation
  
    We present a statistical phrase-based translamodel that uses phrases that contain subphrases.
    The model is formally a synchronous context-free grammar but is learned from a bitext without any syntactic information.
    Thus it can be seen as shift to the of syntaxtranslation systems without any lin- In our experiments using BLEU as a metric, the hierarchical phrasebased model achieves a relative improvement of 7.5% over Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art phrase-based system.
  
  
    The alignment template translation model (Och and Ney, 2004) and related phrase-based models advanced the previous state of the art by moving from words to phrases as the basic unit of translation.
    Phrases, which can be any substring and not necessarily phrases in any syntactic theory, allow these models to learn local reorderings, translation of short idioms, or insertions and deletions that are sensitive to local context.
    They are thus a simpl
