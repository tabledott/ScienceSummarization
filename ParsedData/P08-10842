spondences at the morphological level across various languages have been well-documented (Campbell, 2004).
    The model presented in this paper automatically induces a segmentation and morpheme alignment from a multilingual corpus of short parallel phrases.1 For example, given parallel phrases meaning in my land in English, Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic, we wish to segment and align morphemes as follows:
  
  
    This example illustrates the potential benefits of unsupervised multilingual learning.
    The three Semitic languages use cognates (words derived from a common ancestor) to represent the word land.
    They also use an identical suffix (-y) to represent the first person possessive pronoun (my).
    These similarities in form should guide the model by constraining the space of joint segmentations.
    The corresponding English phrase lacks this resemblance to its Semitic counterparts.
    However, in this as in many cases, no segmentation is required for English as all the morphemes are expressed as
