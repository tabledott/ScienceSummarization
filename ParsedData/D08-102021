ngth n, xi is the number of times relation i appeared, and pi is the probability of relation i based on the Penn Discourse Treebank.
    P(n) is the maximum likelihood estimation of an article having n discourse relations based on the entire Penn Discourse Treebank (the number of articles with exactly n discourse relations, divided by the total number of articles).
    The log likelihood of an article based on its discourse relations (F13) feature is defined as: The multinomial distribution is particularly suitable, because it directly incorporates length, which significantly affects readability as we discussed earlier.
    It also captures patterns of relative frequency of relations, unlike the simpler unigram model.
    Note also that this equation has an advantage over the unigram model that was not present for vocabulary.
    While every article contains at least one word, some articles do not contain any discourse relations.
    Since the PDTB annotated all explicit relations and relations between adjace
