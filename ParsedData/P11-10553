s that relations do not overlap &#8212; there cannot exist two facts r(e1, e2) and q(e1, e2) that are both true for any pair of entities, e1 and e2.
    Unfortunately, this assumption is often violated; for example both Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple) are clearly true.
    Indeed, 18.3% of the weak supervision facts in Freebase that match sentences in the NY Times 2007 corpus have overlapping relations.
    This paper presents MULTIR, a novel model of weak supervision that makes the following contributions: Given a corpus of text, we seek to extract facts about entities, such as the company Apple or the city Boston.
    A ground fact (or relation instance), is an expression r(e) where r is a relation name, for example Founded or CEO-of, and e = e1, ... , e,,, is a list of entities.
    An entity mention is a contiguous sequence of textual tokens denoting an entity.
    In this paper we assume that there is an oracle which can identify all entity mentions in a corpus, but the oracle doesn&#8217;t
