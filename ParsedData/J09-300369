    Finally, a unique aspect of the work presented in this article is the evaluation of different features for recognizing contextual polarity.
    We first presented the features explored in this research in Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffman (2005), but this work significantly extends that initial evaluation.
    We explore the performance of features across different learning algorithms, and we evaluate not only features for discriminating between positive and negative polarity, but features for determining when a word is or is not expressing a sentiment in the first place (neutral in context).
    This is also the first work to evaluate the effect of neutral instances on the performance of features for discriminating between positive and negative contextual polarity.
    Recognizing contextual polarity is just one facet of the research in automatic sentiment analysis.
    Research ranges from work on learning the prior polarity (semantic orientation) of words and phrases (e.g., Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 199
