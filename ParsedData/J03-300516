luated against manually annotated data, Abney&#8217;s (1996) parser identified chunks with 87.9% precision and 87.1% recall.
    The parser further achieved a per-word accuracy of 92.1% (where per-word accuracy includes the chunk category and chunk length identified correctly).
    Despite their imperfect output, heuristic methods for the extraction of syntactic relations are relatively common in statistical NLP.
    Several statistical models employ frequencies obtained from the output of partial parsers and other heuristic methods; these include models for disambiguating the attachment site of prepositional phrases (Hindle and Rooth 1993; Ratnaparkhi 1998), models for interpreting compound nouns (Lauer 1995; Lapata 2002) and polysemous adjectives (Lapata 2001), models for the induction of selectional preferences (Abney and Light 1999), methods for automatically clustering words according to their distribution in particular syntactic contexts (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993), automatic thesaurus extraction (G
