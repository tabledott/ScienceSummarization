al parsing models for other linguistically expressive formalisms.
    There are essentially three ways in which this might work.
    For lexicalized grammars, it may in some cases be possible to translate the subcategorization frames in the CCG lexicon directly into the target theory.
    For type-logical grammars (Moortgat 1988; Morrill 1994; Moot 2003), this is little more than a matter of transducing the syntactic types for the lexicon into the appropriate notation.
    For formalisms like LTAG, the relation is more complex, but the work of Joshi and Kulick (1996), who &#8220;unfold&#8221; CCG categories into TAG elementary trees via partial proof trees, and Shen and Joshi (2005), who define LTAG &#8220;spines&#8221; that resemble categories, suggest that this is possible.
    Transduction into HPSG signs is less obvious, but also seems possible in principle.
    A second possibility is to transduce CCGbank itself into a form appropriate to the target formalism.
    There seems to be a similar ordering ove
