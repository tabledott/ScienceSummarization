tituent structure is not relevant here, we normalize all contributors before computing reliability.
    We treat every word in a summary as a coding unit, and the SCU it was assigned to as the coding value.
    We require every surface word to be in exactly one contributor, and every contributor to be in exactly one SCU, thus an SCU annotation constitutes a set of equivalence classes.
    Computing reliability then becomes identical to comparing the equivalence classes constituting a set of coreference annotations.
    In (Passonneau, 2004), we report our method for computing reliability for coreference annotations, and the use of a distance metric that allows us to weight disagreements.
    Applying the same data representation and reliability formula (Krippendorff&#8217;s Alpha) as in (Passonneau, 2004), and a distance metric that takes into account relative SCU size, to the two codings C1 and C2 yields &#945; = 81.
    Values above .67 indicate good reliability (Krippendorff, 1980).
