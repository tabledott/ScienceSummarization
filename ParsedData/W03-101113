ic similarity.
    We will first explain the WordNet-based distance measure (Lin, 1997) and then explain how we determine the similarity between neighbour sets generated using different measures.
    The similarity of two nouns in WordNet is defined as the similarity of their maximally similar senses.
    The commonality of two concepts is defined as the maximally specific superclass of those concepts.
    So, if syn(n) is the set of senses of the noun n in WordNet, sup(c) is the set of (possibly indirect) superclasses of concept c in WordNet and P(c) is the probability that a randomly selected noun refers to an instance of c, then the similarity between ni and n2 can be calculated using the formula for simwn in Figure 1.
    The probabilities P(c) are estimated by the frequencies of concepts in SemCor (Miller et al., 1994), a sense-tagged subset of the Brown corpus, noting that the occurrence of a concept refers to instances of all the superclasses of that concept (i.e.
    P(root of tree6) = 1).
