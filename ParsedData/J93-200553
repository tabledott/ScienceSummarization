owever, suggests that such information is accurately characterized as lexical preference.
    An initial experiment on a subset of the Wall Street Journal Corpus, for example, shows that said has a quite different metonymic distribution there, reported in Figure 9.

    An important question related to the extraction of preference information is what the corpus should be.
    Recent effort has been spent constructing balanced corpora, containing text fro
