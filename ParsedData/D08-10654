aspect of our lattice MBR is the linear approximation to the BLEU score.
    We will show that MBR decoding under this score achieves a performance that is at least as good as the performance obtained under sentence-level BLEU score.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    We review MBR decoding in Section 2 and give the formulation in terms of a gain function.
    In Section 3, we describe the conditions on the gain function for efficient decoding over a lattice.
    The implementation of lattice MBR with Weighted Finite State Automata is presented in Section 4.
    In Section 5, we introduce the corpus BLEU approximation that makes it possible to perform efficient lattice MBR decoding.
    An example of lattice MBR with a toy lattice is presented in Section 6.
    We present lattice MBR experiments in Section 7.
    A final discussion is presented in Section 8.
  
  
    Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding aims to find the candidate hypothesis that has the least expected loss under the probabil
