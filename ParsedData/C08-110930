g approach that produces results comparable to exhaustive annotation.
			This makes using multiple raters possible since less time is required to assess the system?s performance.
			While the work presented here has focused on prepositions, the arguments against using only one rater, and for using a sampling approach generalize to other error types, such as determiners and collocations.
			Acknowledgements We would first like to thank our two annotators Sarah Ohls and Waverly VanWinkle for their hours of hard work.
			We wouldalso like to acknowledge the three anonymous reviewers and Derrick Higgins for their helpful com ments and feedback.
