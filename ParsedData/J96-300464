an the particular computational methods used.
    The method reported in this paper makes use solely of unigram probabilities, and is therefore a zeroeth-order model: the cost of a particular segmentation is estimated as the sum of the costs of the individual words in the segmentation.
    However, as we have noted, nothing inherent in the approach precludes incorporating higher-order constraints, provided they can be effectively modeled within a finite-state framework.
    For example, as Can (1994) has noted, one can construct examples where the segmentation is locally ambiguous but can be determined on the basis of sentential or even discourse context.
    Two sets of examples from Can are given in (1) and (2) (=--- Gan's Appendix B, exx.
    11a /11b and 14a /14b respectively).
    In (1) the sequence ,I5M ma3-1u4 cannot be resolved locally, but depends instead upon broader context; similarly in (2), the sequence Alt ca12-neng2 cannot be resolved locally: this CL(assifier) horse way on sick ASP(ect) 'This
