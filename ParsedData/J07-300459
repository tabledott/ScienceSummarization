ory.
    For this reason we treat any constituent that is coindexed with an *ICH* as an adjunct.
    The null element *PPA* (&#8220;Permanent Predictable Ambiguity,&#8221; 26 occurrences) is used for genuine attachment ambiguities.
    Since the Treebank manual states that the actual constituent should be attached at the more likely attachment site, we chose to ignore any *PPA* null element.
    Our algorithm also ignores the null element *?
    *, which occurs 582 times, and indicates &#8220;a missing predicate or a piece thereof&#8221; (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).
    It is used for VP ellipsis, and can also occur in conjunction with a VP pro-form do (You either believe he can do it or you don&#8217;t *?
    *), or in comparatives (the total was far higher than expected *?
    *).23 We can now define the complete translation algorithm, including the modifications necessary to deal with traces and argument clusters: 23 We believe that both conjuncts in the first example are complete sentences
