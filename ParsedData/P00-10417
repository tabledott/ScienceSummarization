assume that the likelihood of a word in the summary is independent of other words in the summary.
    In this case, the probability of any particular summarycontent candidate can be calculated simply as the product of the probabilities of the terms in the candidate set.
    Therefore, the overall probability of a candidate summary, , consisting of words , under the simplest, zero-level, summary model based on the previous assumptions, can be computed as the product of the likelihood of (i) the terms selected for the summary, (ii) the length of the resulting summary, and (iii) the most likely sequencing of the terms in the content set.
    In general, the probability of a word appearing in a summary cannot be considered to be independent of the structure of the summary, but the independence assumption is an initial modeling choice.
    The probability of any particular surface ordering as a headline candidate can be computed by modeling the probability of word sequences.
    The simplest model is a bigram lang
