shing idiomatic combinations from non-idiomatic ones.
    We also show that our syntactic and overall fixedness measures substantially outperform a widely used measure of collocation, , even when the latter takes syntactic relations into account.
    Others have also drawn on the notion of syntactic fixedness for idiom detection, though specific to a highly constrained type of idiom (Widdows and Dorow, 2005).
    Our syntactic fixedness measure looks into a broader set of patterns associated with a large class of idiomatic expressions.
    Moreover, our approach is general and can be easily extended to other idiomatic combinations.
    Each measure we use to identify VNICs captures a different aspect of idiomaticity: reflects the statistical idiosyncrasy of VNICs, while the fixedness measures draw on their lexicosyntactic peculiarities.
    Our ongoing work focuses on combining these measures to distinguish VNICs from other idiosyncratic verb+noun combinations that are neither purely idiomatic nor completely
