ed from Japanese articles or not, though they don&#8217;t have explicit links to the original Japanese articles.
    Consequently, we only used the translated English articles for the article alignment.
    The number of English articles used was 35,318, which is 68 percent of all of the articles.
    On the other hand, the English articles before mid-July 1996 do not have such tags.
    So we used all the articles for the period.
    The number of them was 59,086.
    We call the set of articles before mid-July 1996 &#8220;1989-1996&#8221; and call the set of articles after mid-July 1996 &#8220;1996-2001.&#8221; If an English article is a translation of a Japanese article, then the publication date of the Japanese article will be near that of the English article.
    So we searched for the original Japanese articles within 2 days before and after the publication of each English article, i.e., the corresponding article of an English article was searched for from the Japanese articles of 5 days&#8217; issues.
