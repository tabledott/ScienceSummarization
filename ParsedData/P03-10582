 This problem is particular severe for WSD, since sense-tagged data must be collected separately for each word in a language.
    One source to look for potential training data for WSD is parallel texts, as proposed by Resnik and Yarowsky (1997).
    Given a word-aligned parallel corpus, the different translations in a target language serve as the &#8220;sense-tags&#8221; of an ambiguous word in the source language.
    For example, some possible Chinese translations of the English noun channel are listed in Table 1.
    To illustrate, if the sense of an occurrence of the noun channel is &#8220;a path over which electrical signals can pass&#8221;, then this occurrence can be translated as &#8220;&#39057;&#36947;&#8221; in Chinese.
    This approach of getting sense-tagged corpus also addresses two related issues in WSD.
    Firstly, what constitutes a valid sense distinction carries much subjectivity.
    Different dictionaries define a different sense inventory.
    By tying sense distinction to the differen
