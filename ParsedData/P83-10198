 of speech, implemented as part of a computational model of syntactic processing.
    The essential idea is that non-fluencies occur when a speaker corrects something that he or she has already said out loud.
    Since words once said cannot be unsaid, a speaker can only accomplish a self-correction by saying something additional -- namely the intended words.
    The intended words are supposed to substitute for the wrongly produced words.
    For example, in sentence (1), the speaker initially said / but meant we.
    The problem for the hearer, as for any natural language understanding system, is to determine what words are to be expunged from the actual words said to find the intended sentence.
    Labov (1966) provided the key to solving this problem when he noted that a phonetic signal (specifically, a markedly abrupt cut-off of the speech signal) always marks the site where self-correction takes place.
    Of course, finding the site of a self-correction is only half the problem; it remains to specify w
