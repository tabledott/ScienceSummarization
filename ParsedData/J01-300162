he metric presented in this paper and others that are not based on probabilistic models.
    Melamed and Resnik (2000) propose a metric for scoring WSD output when there may be more than one correct sense in the gold standard text, as with the evaluation corpus we use.
    They mention that when a WSD system returns more than one sense it is difficult to tell if they are intended to be disjunctive or conjunctive.
    The score for a token is computed by dividing the number of correct senses identified by the algorithm by the total it returns, making the metric equivalent to precision in information retrieval (van Rijsbergen 1979).6 For systems which return exactly one sense for each word, this equates to scoring a token as 1 if the sense returned is correct, and 0 otherwise.
    For the evaluation of the system presented here, the metric proposed by Melamed and Resnik is then equivalent to the exact match metric.
    The exact match metric has the advantage of being widely used in the WSD literature.
