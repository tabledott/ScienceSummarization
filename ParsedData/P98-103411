 NP parsing of the improvement corpus.
    The benefit of rule r is given by Br = Cr &#8212; Er where Cr is the number of NPs correctly identified by r, and Er is the number of precision errors for which r is responsible.1 A rule is considered responsible for an error if it was the first rule to bracket part of a reference NP, i.e., an NP in the base NP training corpus.
    Thus, rules that form erroneous bracketings are not penalized if another rule previously bracketed part of the same reference NP.
    For example, suppose the fragment containing base NPs Boca Raton, Hot Springs, and Palm Beach is bracketed as shown below. resort towns like [NP, Boca/NNP Raton/NNP , Hot/NNP] [NP, Springs/NNP], and [NP, Palm/NNP Beach/NNP1 Rule (NNP NNP , NNP) brackets NPi; (NNP) brackets NP2; and (NNP NNP) brackets NP3.
    Rule (NNP NNP , NNP) incorrectly identifies Boca Raton , Hot as a noun phrase, so its score is &#8212;1.
    Rule (NNP) incorrectly identifies Springs, but it is not held responsible for the error becau
