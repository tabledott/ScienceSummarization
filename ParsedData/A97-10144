na erkennen, &amp;di er weint at-it will him Anna recognise that he cries 'Anna will recognise him at his cry' A sample constituent structure is given below: The fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies, marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes.
    This hybrid representation makes the structure less transparent, and therefore more difficult to annotate.
    Apart from this rather technical problem, two further arguments speak against phrase structure as the structural pivot of the annotation scheme: Finally, the structural handling of free word order means stating well-formedness constraints on structures involving many trace-filler dependencies, which has proved tedious.
    Since most methods of handling discontinuous constituents make the formalism more powerful, the efficiency of processing deteriorates, too.
    An alternative solution is to make argument structure the main structural component of the formalism.
    This assumption underlies a growing number
