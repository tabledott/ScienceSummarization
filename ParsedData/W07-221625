&#171;i,x&#171;j in place of wki,j.
    Furthermore, under some standard conditions the fixed-point iteration method guarantees a constant number of bits of precision gain for the parameters at each iteration, resulting in overall polynomial time computation in the size of the input and in the required number of bits for the precision.
    As far as we know, this is the first EM learning algorithm for the model in Paskin (2001) working in the non-projective case.
    The projective case has been investigated in Paskin (2001).
  
  
    We have shown that several computational problems related to parsing can be solved in polynomial time for the class of non-projective dependency models with the assumption that dependency relations are mutually independent.
    These independence assumptions are unwarranted, as it has already been established that modeling non-local information such as arity and nearby parsing decisions improves the accuracy of dependency models (Klein and Manning, 2002; McDonald and Pereira, 2
