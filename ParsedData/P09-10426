ehn, 2005; Tiedemann, 2007) and compared several measures of dependency conservation.
    For the English-Bulgarian corpus, we observed that 71.9% of the edges we projected were edges in the corpus, and we projected on average 2.7 edges per sentence (out of 5.3 tokens on average).
    For Spanish, we saw conservation of 64.4% and an average of 5.9 projected edges per sentence (out of 11.5 tokens on average).
    As these numbers illustrate, directly transferring information one dependency edge at a time is unfortunately error prone for two reasons.
    First, parser and word alignment errors cause much of the transferred information to be wrong.
    We deal with this problem by constraining groups of edges rather than a single edge.
    For example, in some sentence pair we might find 10 edges that have both end points aligned and can be transferred.
    Rather than requiring our target language parse to contain each of the 10 edges, we require that the expected number of edges from this set is at least 10q,
