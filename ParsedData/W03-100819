enerate the CCGbank using the Propbank annotations.
    The impact of our head-word based scoring is analyzed in Table 3, which compares results when only the head word must be correctly identified (as in Table 2) and to results when both the beginning and end of the argument must be correctly identified in the sentence (as in Gildea and Palmer (2002)).
    Even if the head word is given the correct label, the boundaries of the entire argument may be different from those given in the PropBank annotation.
    Since constituents in CCGbank do not always match those in PropBank, even the CCG gold standard parses obtain comparatively low scores according to this metric.
    This is exacerbated when automatic parses are considered.
  
  
    Our CCG-based system for automatically labeling verb arguments with PropBank-style semantic roles outperforms a system using a traditional Treebankbased parser for core arguments, which comprise 75% of the role labels, but scores lower on adjunctlike roles such as temporals an
