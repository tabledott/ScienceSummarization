strings, which are edited by a matching rule that applies before syntactic analysis begins; 2) complete constituents, when two constituents of the same type appear in the parser's buffer; or 3) incomplete constituents, when the parser finds itself trying to complete a constituent of the same type as a constituent it has just completed.
    Whenever two such copies appear in such a configuration, and the first one ends with an editing signal, the first is expunged from further analysis.
    This editing system has been implemented as part of a deterministic parser, and tested on a wide range of sentences from transcribed speech.
    Further study of the self-correction system promises to provide insights into the units of production and the nature of linguistic categories.
