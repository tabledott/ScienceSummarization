r a special case of our loss function (1) when b = 0 and M &#8212;* oc.
    It is easy to show for labeled nodes j E L, the optimal value is the given label: f(xj) = yj.
    Then the optimization problem decouples into a set of onedimensional problems, one for each unlabeled node The above problem is easy to solve.
    It corresponds exactly to the supervised, non-transductive version of metric labeling, except we use squared difference while (Pang and Lee, 2005) used absolute difference.
    Indeed in experiments comparing the two (not reported here), their differences are not statistically significant.
    From this perspective, our semisupervised learning method is an extension with interacting terms among unlabeled data.
  
  
    We performed experiments using the movie review documents and accompanying 4-class (C = 10, 1, 2,31) labels found in the &#8220;scale dataset v1.0&#8221; available at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/ movie-review-data/ and first used in (Pang and Lee, 2005).
    We chose 4
