    For the purposes of this research, each of these factors&#8217; values are averaged over all the adjectives in a text, yielding three realvalued feature values for the text, which will be added to the SVM model.
    Our approach shares the intuition of Natsukawa and Yi (2003) that sentiment expressed with regard to a particular subject can best be identified with reference to the subject itself.
    Collecting emotive content from a text overall can only give the most general indication of the sentiment of that text towards the specific subject.
    Nevertheless, in the present work, it is assumed that the pertinent analysis will occur at the text level.
    The key is to find a way to incorporate pertinent semantic orientation values derived from phrases into a model of texts.
    Our approach seeks to employ semantic orientation values from a variety of different sources and use them to create a feature space which can be separated into classes using an SVM.
    In some application domains, it is k
