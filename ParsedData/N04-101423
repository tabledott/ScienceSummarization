r x, i x - q.NP.NN x &#8594; r x State i means &#8220;produce a Japanese function word out of thin air.&#8221; We include an i production for every Japanese word in the vocabulary, e.g.
    : State r means &#8220;re-order my children and then recurse.&#8221; For internal nodes, we include a production for every parent/child-sequence and every permutation thereof, e.g.
    : - r NP(x0:CD, x1:NN) &#8594; q.NP.CD x0, q.NP.NN x1 - r NP(x0:CD, x1:NN) &#8594; q.NP.NN x1, q.NP.CD x0 The rhs sends the child subtrees back to state q for recursive processing.
    However, for English leaf nodes, we instead transition to a different state t, so as to prohibit any subsequent Japanese function word insertion: - r NN(x0:car) &#8594; t x0 State t means &#8220;translate this word,&#8221; and we have a production for every pair of co-occurring English and Japanese words: - t car &#8594; kuruma - t car &#8594; wa - t car &#8594; *e* This follows (Yamada and Knight, 2001) in also allowing English words to disappear, or translat
