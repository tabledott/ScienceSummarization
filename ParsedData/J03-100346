are used to guide the search process and to give preference to some solutions over others.
    Optimization has not been the focus of this article, but we came across various heuristic strategies that would speed up the algorithm.
    For instance, we can try edges in the order determined by the cost function (from cheap to more expensive), and we can use a greedy algorithm to find a first distinguishing graph quickly.
    In general, one of the advantages of the graph perspective is that many efficient algorithms for dealing with graph structures are known.
    We can use those algorithms to formulate more efficient versions of the subgraph construction component (perhaps using the method of Tarjan [1972]; see also Sedgewick [1988]) and of the subgraph isomorphism testing component (e.g., using the aforementioned approach of Messmer and Bunke [1995, 1998]).
    The graph perspective has a number of attractive properties.
