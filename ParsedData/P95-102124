 to the addition of a new (leftmost or rightmost) subtree below the nede that was the site of the adjunction.
    For this reason, we have equipped DTG with an operation (sister-adjunction) that does exactly this and nothing more.
    From the definition of DTG in Section 2 it can be seen that the essential aspects of Schabes &amp; Shieber (1994) treatment for modification, including multiple modifications of a phrase, can be captured by using this operation4.
    After defining DTG in Section 2, we discuss, in Section 3, DTG analyses for the English and Kashmiri data presented in this section.
    Section 4 briefly discusses DTG recognition algorithms.
  
  
    A d-tree is a tree with two types of edges: domination edges (d-edges) and immediate domination edges (i-edges).
    D-edges and i-edges express domination and immediate domination relations between nodes.
    These relations are never rescinded when dtrees are composed.
    Thus, nodes separated by an i-edge will remain in a mother-daughter relation
