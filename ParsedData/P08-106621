tracted from the training data for the tuning and test sets.
    The constraint of well-formed dependency structures greatly reduced the size of the rule set.
    Although the rule size increased a little bit after incorporating dependency structures in rules, the size of string-to-dependency rule set is less than 20% of the baseline rule set size.
    Table 2 shows the BLEU and TER scores on MT04.
    On decoding output, the string-todependency system achieved 1.48 point improvement in BLEU and 2.53 point improvement in TER compared to the baseline hierarchical stringto-string system.
    After 5-gram rescoring, it achieved 1.21 point improvement in BLEU and 1.19 improvement in TER.
    The filtered model does not show improvement on BLEU.
    The filtered string-to-string rules can be viewed the string projection of stringto-dependency rules.
    It means that just using dependency structure does not provide an improvement on performance.
    However, dependency structures allow the use of a dependency LM w
