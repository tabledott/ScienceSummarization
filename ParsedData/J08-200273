g to the algorithm described in Section 6.1.
    The performance measures reported here are higher than the results of our submission in the CoNLL 2005 shared task (Haghighi, Toutanova, and Manning 2005), because of two changes.
    One was changing the rule that produces continuing arguments to only add continuation labels to core argument labels; in the previous version the rule added continuation labels to all repeated labels.
    Another was fixing a bug in the way the sentences were passed in as input to Charniak&#8217;s parser, leading to incorrect analyses of forward quotes.8 We first present results of our local and joint model using the parses provided as part of the CoNLL 2005 data (and having wrong forward quotes) in Figure 18.
    We then report results from the same local and joint model, and the joint model using the top five Charniak parses, where the parses have correct representation of the forward quotes in Figure 19.
    For these results we used the version of the Charniak parser from 4 Ma
