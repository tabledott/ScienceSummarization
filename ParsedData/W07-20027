ge of correctly ?retrieved?
			examples for a cluster (divided by total clus ter size), and recall as the percentage of correctly ?retrieved?
			examples for a cluster (divided by total class size).
			Given a particular class sr of size nr and a cluster hi of size ni, suppose nir examples in the class sr belong to hi.
			The F value of this class and cluster is defined to be: f(sr, hi) = 2P (sr, hi)R(sr, hi) P (sr, hi) + R(sr, hi) where P (sr, hi) = nir nr is the precision value and R(sr, hi) = nir ni is the recall value defined for classsr and cluster hi.
			The FScore of class sr is the max imum F value attained at any cluster, that is, 8 F (sr) = max hi f(sr, hi) and the FScore of the entire clustering solution is: FScore = c?
			r=1 nr n F (sr) where q is the number of classes and n is the size of the clustering solution.
			If the clustering is theidentical to the original classes in the datasets, FS core will be equal to one which means that the higher the FScore, the better the clustering is. For the
