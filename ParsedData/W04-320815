ates for subsequent iterations.
    The algorithm then iterates to refine document matching and parallel sentence extraction.
    The IBM model parameters, including sentence alignment score and word alignment scores, are computed in each iteration.
    The parameter values eventually stay unchanged and the set of extracted bilingual sentence pairs also converges to a fixed size.
    The system then stops and gives the last set of bilingual sentence pairs as the final output.
  
  
    We evaluate our algorithm on a very-non-parallel corpus of TDT3 data, which contains various news stories transcription of radio broadcasting or TV news report from 1998-2000 in English and Chinese Channels.
    We compare the results of our proposed method against a baseline method that is based on the conventional, &#8220;find-topic-extract-sentence&#8221; principle only.
    We investigate the performance of the IBM Model 4 EM lexical learner on data from very-non-parallel corpus, and evaluate how our method can boost its pe
