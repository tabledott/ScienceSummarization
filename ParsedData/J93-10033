sards).
    Their efforts have been Augean, and they have been well rewarded by interesting results.
    The statistical significance of most of their work is above reproach, but the required volumes of text are simply impractical in many settings.
    The second approach is typified by much of the work of Gale and Church (Gale and Church this issue, and in press; Church et al. 1989).
    Many of the results from their work are entirely usable, and the measures they use work well for the examples given in their papers.
    In general, though, their methods lead to problems.
    For example, mutual information estimates based directly on counts are subject to overestimation when the counts involved are small, and z-scores substantially overestimate the significance of rare events.
    The third approach is typified by virtually all of the information-retrieval literature.
    Even recent and very innovative work such as that using Latent Semantic Indexing (Dumais et al. 1988) and Pathfinder Networks (Schvaneve
