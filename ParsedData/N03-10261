    Recent work in statistical text summarization has put forward systems that do not merely extract and concatenate sentences, but learn how to generate new sentences from (Summary, Text) tuples.
    Depending on the chosen task, such systems either generate single-sentence &#8220;headlines&#8221; for multi-sentence text (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999), or they provide a sentence condensation module designed for combination with sentence extraction systems (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Jing, 2000).
    The challenge for such systems is to guarantee the grammaticality and summarization quality of the system output, i.e. the generated sentences need to be syntactically wellformed and need to retain the most salient information of the original document.
    For example a sentence extraction system might choose a sentence like: The UNIX operating system, with implementations from Apples to Crays, appears to have the advantage. from a document, which could be condensed as: UNIX appears to have the advantage.
