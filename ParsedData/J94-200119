ssarily improve tagging accuracy.
    In our experiments, ML training degrades the performance unless the initial model is already very bad.
    The preceding results suggest that the optimal strategy to build the best possible model for tagging is the following: whichever occurs first.
  
  
    I would like to thank Peter Brown, Fred Jelinek, John Lafferty, Robert Mercer, Salim Roukos, and other members of the Continuous Speech Recognition group for the fruitful discussions I had with them throughout this work.
    I also want to thank one of the referees for his judicious comments.
