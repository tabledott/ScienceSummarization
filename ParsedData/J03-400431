    In the future, we plan to investigate our models for WSD in specific domains, such as sport and finance.
    The senses and frequency distribution of senses for a given domain will in general be quite different from those in a balanced corpus.
    There are individual words that are not used in the first sense on which our TCM preferences do well, for example sound (precision = 22), but there are not enough data to isolate predicates or arguments that are good disambiguators from those that are not.
    We intend to investigate this issue further with the SENSEVAL-2 lexical sample data, which contains more instances of a smaller number of words.
    Performance of selectional preferences depends not just on the actual word being disambiguated, but the cohesiveness of the tuple &lt;pred, arg, gr&gt;.
    We have therefore investigated applying a threshold on the probability of the class (nc, vc, or ac) before disambiguation.
