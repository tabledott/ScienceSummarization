ends to be several times the average size.
			Making the shards evenly sized is desirable because the total runtime of the process is determined by the largest shard.
			The shards are made more balanced by hashing based on the first two words: int ShardForKey(string key, int nshards) { string prefix = FirstTwoWords(key); return Hash(prefix) % nshards; } This requires redundantly storing unigram counts inall shards in order to be able to calculate relative fre quencies within shards.
			That is a relatively smallamount of information (a few million entries, com pared to up to hundreds of billions of n-grams).
			5.3 Language Model Generation.
			The input to the language model generation step is the output of the n-gram generation step: n-gramsand their counts.
			All information necessary to calculate relative frequencies is available within individ ual shards because of the sharding function.
			That is everything we need to generate models with Stupid Backoff.
			More complex smoothing methods require addi
