 emotions they evoke?
    What percentage of commonly used terms, in each part of speech, evoke an emotion?
    Are emotions more commonly evoked by nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs?
    Is there a correlation between the semantic orientation of a word and the emotion it evokes?
    Which emotions tend to go together; that is, which emotions are evoked simultaneously by the same term?
    This work is intended to be a pilot study before we create a much larger emotion lexicon with tens of thousands of terms.
    We focus on the emotions of joy, sadness, anger, fear, trust, disgust, surprise, and anticipation&#8212; argued by many to be the basic and prototypical emotions (Plutchik, 1980).
    Complex emotions can be viewed as combinations of these basic emotions.
