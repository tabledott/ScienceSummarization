 finite-state machinery (Kumar and Byrne, 2003), which is unable to process nested structures and long-distance dependencies in natural languages.
    Syntax-based models aim to alleviate this problem by exploiting the power of synchronous rewriting systems.
    Both Yamada and Knight (2001) and Chiang (2005) use SCFGs as the underlying model, so their translation schemata are syntax-directed as in Fig.
    1, but their translators are not: both systems do parsing and transformation in a joint search, essentially over a packed forest of parse-trees.
    To this end, their translators are not directed by a syntactic tree.
    Although their method potentially considers more than one single parse-tree as in our case, the packed representation of the forest restricts the scope of each transfer step to a one-level contextfree rule, while our approach decouples the sourcelanguage analyzer and the recursive converter, so that the latter can have an extended domain of locality.
    In addition, our translator also e
