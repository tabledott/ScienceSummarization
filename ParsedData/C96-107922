ently, the scores were appreciably lower, ranging across most systems from 65 to 75% in recall, and from 75% to 85% in precision.
  The top-scoring sys- tem had 75% recall, 86% precision.
  Systems did particularly poorly in identifying descriptions; the highest-scoring system had 38% recall and 51% precision for descriptions.
  There seemed general agreement that having prepared code for template elements in advance did make it easier to port a system to a new see- nario in a few weeks.
  This factor, and the room that exists for improvement in performance, sug- gest that including this task in a future MUC may be worthwhile.
  The goal for scenar io  templates  mini- MUC - -  was to demonstrate that effective infor- mation extraction systems could be created in a few weeks.
  This too was successful.
  Although it is difficult to meaningfully compare results on differ- ent scenarios, the scores obtained by most systems after a few weeks (40% to 50% recall, 60% to 70% precision) were comparable to the best s
