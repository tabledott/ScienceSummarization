ortantly, we can assume that the word boundaries are similar in French and English.
    However, the situation is messier with English and Chinese.
    First, segmentation of the Chinese text into words already introduces some ambiguity of the seed word identities.
    Secondly, English-Chinese translations are complicated by the fact that the two languages share very little stemming properties, or part-of-speech set, or word order.
    This property causes every English word to have many Chinese translations and vice versa.
    In a source-target language translation scenario, the translated text can be &amp;quot;rearranged&amp;quot; and cleaned up by a monolingual language model in the target language.
    However, the lexicon is not very reliable in establishing &amp;quot;bridges&amp;quot; between nonparallel English-Chinese texts.
    To compensate for this ambiguity in the seed lexicon, we introduce a confidence weighting to each bilingual word pair used as seed words.
