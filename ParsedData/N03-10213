ceding permutation in P. We could, for example, obtain the result above if we put put and switch their roles in the 2nd and 3rd permutations.
    However, the normal form requires the 2nd to be [1, 3, 2, 4], not [4, 3, 2, 1], so must be listed last.
    Let Q be an MTG derivation where no more production rules can be applied.
    Let Render(Q) be the result of evaluating all the N's in Q.
    The (formal) an MTG the set of multithat can be generated by applying zto the link of then evaluating all the joins.
    I.e., = : $ z Due to the importance of lexical information in disambiguating syntactic structure, we shall pay special attention to lexicalized MTGs (LMTGs) of the variety A bilexical MTG has a set A of &amp;quot;delexicalized&amp;quot; nonterminal labels.
    Intuitively, A corresponds to the nonterminal set of an CFG.
    Then, every nonterminal in form some terminal some label The terminal the lexical head of its constituent, or just the head.
    One link on the RHS each production serves as the he
