smaller, cleaner data sets.
    Another argument is made vividly by Banko and Brill (2001).
    They explore the performance of a number of machine learning algorithms (on a representative disambiguation task) as the size of the training corpus grows from a million to a billion words.
    All the algorithms steadily improve in performance, though the question &#8220;Which is best?&#8221; gets different answers for different data sizes.
    The moral: Performance improves with data size, and getting more data will make more difference than fine-tuning algorithms.
    Dragomir Radev has made a useful distinction between NLP &#8220;giving&#8221; and &#8220;taking.&#8221;4 NLP can give to the Web technologies such as summarization (for Web pages or Web search results); machine translation; multilingual document retrieval; questionanswering and other strategies for finding not only the right document, but the right part of a document; and tagging, parsing, and other core technologies (to improve indexing for searc
