  8 Conclus ion This paper describes how to combine some translation units in order to translate one sen- tence and how to select tile best translation out of some candidates generated by system.
  To represent he combination of fragments, we in- troduce the representation called matching ex- pression.
  To select the best translation, we de- fine the score of translation based on the score of the matching expression.
  This framework can be applied to not only the translation between word-dependency trees but also the translation between other data struc- tures.
  We hope that generation can be imple- mented in same framework as the translation from a
