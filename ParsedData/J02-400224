ey abandoned an informal sentence selection experiment in which they used agriculture articles and experts in the field as participants, as the participants were too strongly influenced by their personal research interest.
    As a result of subjectivity, a number of human sentence extraction experiments over the years have resulted in low agreement figures.
    Rath, Resnick, and Savage (1961) report that six participants agreed on only 8% of 20 sentences they were asked to select out of short Scientific American texts and that five agreed on 32% of the sentences.
    They found that after six weeks, subjects selected on average only 55% of the sentences they themselves selected previously.
    Edmundson and Wyllys (1961) Teufel and Moens Summarizing Scientific Articles find similarly low human agreement for research articles.
    More recent experiments reporting more positive results all used news text (Jing et al. 1998; Zechner 1995).
    As discussed above, the compression rates on news texts are far low
