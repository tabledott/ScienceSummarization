s identical to one or the other of the disjuncts.
    The result is C. Now suppose that A, B, and C are all complex.
    Furthermore, let us suppose that A and B are distinct but C is compatible with both of them as in the following: What should be the result of (Unify {A B) C)?
    Because A and B are incompatible, we cannot actually unify C with both of them.
    That operation would fail.
    Because there is no basis for choosing one, both alternatives have to be left open.
    Nevertheless. we need to take note of the fact that either A or B is to be unified with C. We can do this by making the result a complex disjunction.
    = {(AC) c) .
    The new value of C, C', is a disjunction of tuples which can be, but. have not yet been unified.
    Thus (A C) and (B C) are sets that consist of compatible structures.
    Furthermore, at least one of the tuples in the complex disjunction must remain consistent regardless of what happens to A and B.
    After the first unification we can still unify A with any s
