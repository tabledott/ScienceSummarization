nuals.
    The training and test sentences were annotated by the University of Lancaster.
    The Lancaster treebank uses 195 part-ofspeech tags and 19 non-terminal labels.
    This treebank is described in great detail in (Black et al., 1993).
    The main reason for applying SPATTER to this domain is that IBM had spent the previous ten years developing a rule-based, unification-style probabilistic context-free grammar for parsing this domain.
    The purpose of the experiment was to estimate SPATTER's ability to learn the syntax for this domain directly from a treebank, instead of depending on the interpretive expertise of a grammarian.
    The parser was trained on the first 30,800 sentences from the Lancaster treebank.
    The test set included 1,473 new sentences, whose lengths range from 3 to 30 words, with a mean length of 13.7 words.
    These sentences are the same test sentences used in the experiments reported for IBM's parser in (Black et al., 1993).
    In (Black et al., 1993), IBM's parser was e
