and rank the candidates based on their average scores.
    Note that the second strategy implies the application of the first strategy.
    The results of these two combination strategies are shown in Table 3 along with the results of the two individual methods.
    We see that both combination strategies are effective and the MRRs of the combined results are all better than those of the two individual methods.
    It is interesting to see that the benefit of applying the phonetic correspondence model as a filter is quite significant.
    Indeed, although the performance of the frequency correlation method alone is much worse than that of the phonetic correspondence method, when working on the subset of candidates passing the phonetic filter (i.e., those candidates that have a reasonable phonetic alignment with the English name), it can outperform the phonetic correspondence method.
    This once again indicates that exploiting the frequency correlation can be effective.
    When combining the scores of these
