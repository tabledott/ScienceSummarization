 It is called the Deep-Syntactic Structure or &amp;quot;DSyntS&amp;quot; for short, and is inspired in this form by I. Mel'euk's Meaning-Text Theory (Mel'euk, 1988).
    This representation has the following salient features: Lexemes which are in the lexicon are in uppercase, those that are not are in lowercase.
    For lexemes not in the lexicon it is necessary to specify the word class This illustrates that function words (do) need not be included in the input DSyntS, and that syntactic issues such as subject-verb and noun-determiner agreement are handled automatically.
    The tree in Figure 2 yields (3): Note that REALPRO does not perform the task of lexical choice: the input to REALPRO must specify all meaning-bearing lexemes, including features for free pronominalization.
    Also, REALPRO does not map any sort of semantic labels to syntactic categories.
    These tasks, we assume, are handled by a separate component (such as a sentence planner).
    This has the advantage that the sentence planner can
