g the equivalence of these three string-set characterizations.
    These essential properties carry over in the n-way generalizations, and therefore the correspondence theorems also generalize.
    In particular, simple analogs of the standard inductive proofs show that Every n-way regular expression describes a regular n-relation; Every regular n-relation is described by an n-way regular expression; Every n-tape finite-state transducer accepts a regular n-relation; and Every regular n-relation is accepted by an n-tape finite-state transducer.
    The strength of our analysis method comes from the equivalence of these different characterizations.
    While we reason about the regular relations in algebraic and settheoretic terms, we conveniently describe the sets under discussion by means of regular expressions, and we prove essential properties by constructive operations on the corresponding finite-state transducers.
    In the end, of course, it is the transducers that satisfy our practical, computational g
