 for unparsable chunks.
    They decode using Pharaoh, augmented with their own log-linear features (such as p(esnippet|fsnippet) and its converse), side by side to &#8220;traditional&#8221; lexical weights.
    Riezler and Maxwell (2006) do not achieve higher BLEU scores, but do score better according to human grammaticality judgments for in-coverage cases.
  
  
    When hierarchical phrase-based translation was introduced by Chiang (2005), it represented a new and successful way to incorporate syntax into statistical MT, allowing the model to exploit non-local dependencies and lexically sensitive reordering without requiring linguistically motivated parsing of either the source or target language.
    An approach to incorporating parser-based constituents in the model was explored briefly, treating syntactic constituency as a soft constraint, with negative results.
    In this paper, we returned to the idea of linguistically motivated soft constraints, and we demonstrated that they can, in fact, lead to su
