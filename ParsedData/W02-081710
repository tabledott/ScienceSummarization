tures are selected from a pool of eighteen different features that have been previously acknowledged as good indicators of word sense, including: part of speech of the ambiguous word itself, surrounding words and their parts of speech, keywords in context, noun before and after, verb before and after, and others.
    An iterative forward search algorithm identifies at each step the feature that leads to the highest cross-validation precision computed on the training data.
    More details on this system can be found in (Mihalcea, 2002b).
    The second classifier is a COnstraint-BAsed Language Tagger (COBALT).
    The system treats every training example as a set of soft constraints on the sense of the word of interest.
    WordNet glosses, hyponyms, hyponym glosses and other WordNet data is also used to create soft constraints.
    Currently, only &#8220;keywords in context&#8221; type of constraint is implemented, with weights accounting for the distance from the target word.
    The tagging is performed by
