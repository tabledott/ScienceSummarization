task.
    Evaluation has showed that the semantic generalisation approach presented here performs well when compared to a previously reported document-centric method.
    Differences between the two approaches are most obvious when the results of the sentence filtering task are considered and it seems that this is a more informative evaluation for this problem.
    The semantic similarity approach has the additional advantage of not requiring a large corpus containing a mixture of documents relevant and irrelevant to the extraction task.
    This corpus is unannotated, and so may not be difficult to obtain, but is nevertheless an additional requirement.
    The best score recorded by the proposed algorithm on the sentence filtering task is an F-measure of 0.58 (22nd iteration).
    While this result is lower than those reported for IE systems based on knowledge engineering approaches these results should be placed in the context of a weakly supervised learning algorithm which could be used to complement manua
