 given theNONSTART tag.
			The task of segmenting new, un segmented test data becomes a matter of assigning a sequence of tags (labels) to the input sequence of Chinese characters.
			Conditional random fields are configured as a linear-chain (finite state machine) for this purpose,and tagging is performed using the Viterbi algorithm to efficiently find the most likely label se quence for a given character sequence.
			3.1 Lexicon features as domain knowledge.
			One advantage of CRFs (as well as traditional maximum entropy models) is its flexibility in using arbitrary features of the input.
			To explore this advantage, as well as the importance of domain knowledge, we use many open features from external re sources.
			To specifically evaluate the importance ofdomain knowledge beyond the training data, we divide our features into two categories: closed fea tures and open features, (i.e., features allowed in thecompetition?s ?closed test?
			and ?open test?
			respec tively).
			The open features include a l
