 the videos.
    Even limiting the set to descriptions produced from the Tier-2 tasks, there are still 16 descriptions on average for each video, with at least 12 descriptions for over 95% of the videos.
    For most clusters, then, we have a dozen or more high-quality parallel descriptions that can be paired with one another to create monolingual parallel training data.
  
  
    One of the limitations to the development of machine paraphrasing is the lack of standard metrics like BLEU, which has played a crucial role in driving progress in MT.
    Part of the issue is that a good paraphrase has the additional constraint that it should be lexically dissimilar to the source sentence while preserving the meaning.
    These can become competing goals when using n-gram overlaps to establish semantic equivalence.
    Thus, researchers have been unable to rely on BLEU or some derivative: the optimal paraphrasing engine under these terms would be one that simply returns the input.
    To combat such problems, Liu e
