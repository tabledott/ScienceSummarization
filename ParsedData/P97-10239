othesis of same proportions of adjective pairs (types) of same and different orientation in a given category, the number of same- or different-orientation pairs follows a binomial distribution with p = 0.5 (Conover, 1980).
    We show in Table 1 the results for several representative categories, and summarize all results below: different orientations, there are, rather surprisingly, small differences in the behavior of conjunctions between linguistic environments (as represented by the three attributes).
    There are a few exceptions, e.g., appositive and conjunctions modifying plural nouns are evenly split between same and different orientation.
    But in these exceptional cases the sample is very small, and the observed behavior may be due to chance.
    The analysis in the previous section suggests a baseline method for classifying links between adjectives: since 77.84% of all links from conjunctions indicate same orientation, we can achieve this level of performance by always guessing that a link is of
