cially when the cache is small and/or the training data is large.
			When we used a 200 MB cache, the improved system took only 13 hours for training by the CRL data, while TinySVM and SVM-Light took 30 hours and 46hours respectively for the same cache size.
			Al though we have examined other SVM toolkits, we could not find any system that uses this approach in the training phase.
	
	
			The above methods can also be applied to othertasks in natural language processing such as chunk ing and POS tagging because the quadratic kernels give good results.
			Utsuro et al (2001) report that a combination of two NE recognizers attained F = 84.07%, butwrong word boundary cases are excluded.
			Our system attained 85.04% and word boundaries are auto matically adjusted.
			Yamada (Yamada et al, 2001) also reports that F*??
			is best.
			Although his sys tem attained F = 83.7% for 5-fold cross-validation of the CRL data (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2001), our system attained 86.8%.
