ges agreed).
    The gold standard contained 86 page pairs marked as &#8220;good&#8221; by both judges and 174 page pairs marked as &#8220;bad&#8221; by both judges.9 Computing tsim (MCBM on the words in the document pair) is not tractable for very large documents and translation lexicons.
    However, in preliminary comparisons, we found that representing tsim for long documents by as few as their first 500 words results in excellent performance on the r. measure.10 This allows O(1) estimation of tsim for two documents.
    Further, the competitive linking algorithm appears to be as reliable as MCBM, and it runs significantly faster in practice.
    The results reported here approximated tsim in this way.
    Of the 325 pairs, 32 were randomly selected as a development set, which we used to select manually a threshold T = 0.44.
    This value maximized the r. score against goldstandard human judgments on the development set.11 r. scores against each judge and their intersection were then computed at that thr
