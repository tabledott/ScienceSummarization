 rule schemata, 15 feature propagation rules, 30 default feature value rules, 22 category expansion rules and 41 feature types which together define 1124 compiled phrase structure rules in which categories are represented as sets of features, that is, attribute-value pairs, possibly with variable values, possibly bound between mother and one or more daughter categories.
    142 of the phrase structure schemata are manually identified as peripheral rather than core rules of English grammar.
    Categories are matched using fixedarity term unification at parse time.
    The lexical categories of the grammar consist of feature-based descriptions of the 149 PoS tags and 13 punctuation tags (a subset of the CLAWS tagset, see e.g.
    Sampson, 1995) which constitute the preterminals of the grammar.
    The number of distinct lexical categories associated with each preterminal varies from 1 for some function words through to around 35 as, for instance, tags for main verbs are associated with a VSUBCAT attribute taki
