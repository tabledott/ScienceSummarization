    We saw our best results under this condition (27.64).
  
  
    We participated in all categories.
    Given the four language pairs, with two translation directions and (except for Czech) two test domains, this required us to build 14 translation systems.
    We had access to a fairly large computer cluster to carry out our experiments over the course of a few weeks.
    However, speed issues with the decoder and load issues on the crowded cluster caused us to take a few shortcuts.
    Also, a bug crept in to our EnglishFrench experiments where we used the wrong detokenizer, resulting drop of 2&#8211;3 points in %BLEU.
    Minimum error rate training is the most timeconsuming aspects of the training process.
    Due to time constraints, we did not carry out this step for all but the Czech systems (a new language for us).
    For the other systems, we re-used weight settings from our last year&#8217;s submission.
    One of the most crucial outcomes of tuning is a proper weight setting for output length,
