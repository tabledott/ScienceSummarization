unt increases by several orders of magnitudes.
    The proposed method is used to train the feature function weights of a phrase-based statistical machine translation system.
    Experiments conducted on the NIST 2008 translation tasks show significant runtime improvements moderate BLEU score gains over MERT.
  
  
    Many statistical methods in natural language processing aim at minimizing the probability of sentence errors.
    In practice, however, system quality is often measured based on error metrics that assign non-uniform costs to classification errors and thus go far beyond counting the number of wrong decisions.
    Examples are the mean average precision for ranked retrieval, the F-measure for parsing, and the BLEU score for statistical machine translation (SMT).
    A class of training criteria that provides a tighter connection between the decision rule and the final error metric is known as Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) and has been suggested for SMT in (Och, 2003).
    MERT aims at estima
