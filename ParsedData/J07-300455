 the future form constituents (&#8220;argument clusters&#8221;), which are then coordinated.
    These constituents are obtained by type-raising and composing the arguments in each conjunct, yielding a functor which takes a verb with the appropriate category to its left to yield a verb phrase (Dowty 1988; Steedman 1985).
    Then the argument clusters are conjoined, and combine with the verb via function application:21 This construction is one in which the CCGbank head-dependency structure (shown subsequently) fails to capture the full set of predicate&#8211;argument structure relations that would be implicit in a full logical form: That is, the dependency structure does not express the fact that right away takes scope over $5 million and in future over additional amounts, rather than the other way around.
    However, this information is included in the full surface-compositional semantic interpretation that is built by the combinatory rules.
    Because the Treebank constituent structure does not correspond
