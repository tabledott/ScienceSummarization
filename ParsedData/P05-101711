s of xi respectively before and after update.
    What is discussed here was constructed with the reference to work by Inoue and Carlucci (2001), in which they applied the spin glass model to image restoration.
    Initially, the averages of the seed words are set according to their given orientations.
    The other averages are set to 0.
    When the difference in the value of the variational free energy is smaller than a threshold before and after update, we regard computation converged.
    The words with high final average values are classified as positive words.
    The words with low final average values are classified as negative words.
    The performance of the proposed method largely depends on the value of hyper-parameter Q.
    In order to make the method more practical, we propose criteria for determining its value.
    When a large labeled dataset is available, we can obtain a reliable pseudo leave-one-out error rate : At a high temperature, spins are randomly oriented (paramagnetic phase, m Pz&
