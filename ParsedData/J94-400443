 lexical entries for stab and dar illustrate the difference in the use of this parameter: is (27) (i) (ii) Lexical entry for stab: [Event CAUSE ([Thing W] , [Event GOposs ([Thing :CONFLATED KNIFE-WOUND], [Path TOWARDposs ([Position ATposs ([Thing KNIFE-WOUND], [Thing Z])])])])l Lexical entry for dar: [Event CAUSE ([Thing W], [Event GOposs ([Thing ~ Y], [Path TOWARDposs ([Position ATposs ([Thing Y], [Thing ZI)])])])] Because the English entry contains a :CONFLATED marker in the logical position cor- responding to KNIFE-WOUND, this constituent is suppressed in the syntactic struc- ture.
  By contrast, this marker does not appear in the corresponding position in Span- ish, thus forcing this constituent to be overtly realized (i.e., puflaladas) in the svntactic structure.
  The general solution to conflational divergence is diagrammed as follows: (28) RLCS 1: [~(x,) X ([T(W) W], [T(Z) * Z] [T(Q) Q])] RLCS 2: [T(X) X ([z(w) W], [T(Z) :CONFLATED Z] [T(Q) Q])] Trans lat ion:  [Y-MAX [Y-MAX W [X-MAX X Z]] Q] [T(X~ X
