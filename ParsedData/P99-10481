    Earlier work found that nearly 50% of definite descriptions had no prior referents (Vieira and Poesio, 1997), and we found that number to be even higher, 63%, in our corpus.
    Some non-anaphoric definite descriptions can be identified by looking for syntactic clues like attached prepositional phrases or restrictive relative clauses.
