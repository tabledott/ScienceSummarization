er-based approach is a worthwhile compromise, performing only slightly worse in terms of accuracy, but taking shorter time to train and run.
    As part of our investigation, we also built a state-of-the-art Chinese word segmenter, which outperforms the best SIGHAN 2003 word segmenters in the closed track on 3 out of 4 test corpora.
  
  
    Most corpus-based language processing research has focused on the English language.
    Theoretically, we should be able to just port corpus-based, machine learning techniques across different languages since the techniques are largely language independent.
    However, in practice, the special characteristics of different languages introduce complications.
    For Chinese in particular, words are not demarcated in a Chinese sentence.
    As such, we need to perform word segmentation before we can proceed with other tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging and parsing, since one POS tag is assigned to each Chinese word (i.e., all characters in a Chinese word have the s
