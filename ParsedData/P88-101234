act that a variable occupies the second argument position of the predicate lube-oil' does not mean it is lube oil.
    We cannot properly restrict that argument position to be lube oil, or fluid, or even a material, for that would rule out perfectly true sentences like &amp;quot;Truth is not lube oil.&amp;quot; Generally, when one uses a type hierarchy, one assumes the types to be disjoint sets with cleanly defined boundaries, and one assumes that predicates take arguments of only certain types.
    There are a lot of problems with this idea.
    In any case, in our work, we are not buying into this notion that the universe is typed.
    Rather we are using the type hierarchy strictly as a heuristic, as a set of guesses not about what could or could not be but about what it would or would not occur to someone to atty.
    When two types are declared to be disjoint, we are saying that they are certainly disjoint in the real world, and that they are very probably disjoint everywhere except in certain bizarre mo
