ntation has the following simplified form: (9) [Y-MAX [Y-MAX W IX-MAX X Z]] Q]8 With these simplifications, the G?T4 can be conceptualized asthe following set of relations: (10) Simplified G?T4: 1.
  Q ~Q Figure 8 shows the simplified ~?T4 in terms of tree-like representations.
  9 We are now prepared to define and resolve the translation divergences of Fig- ure 1 on the basis of the simplified formalization presented in (8)-(10) above.
  The 8 For the purposes of this discussion, we will retain the convention that syntactic adjuncts occur on the right at the maximal level.
  Note that this is not always the case: the setting of an adjunction parameter (described by Dorr [1993b]) determines the side and level at which a particular adjunct will occur.
  9 For ease of illustration, this diagram omits the type specification.
  (There is no loss of generality, since the G?R mapping does not make use of this specification.)
  We will retain this convention throughout the rest of this paper.
