n be generated in any order, so there are 1! ways to generate an assignment of size 1.6 It follows that the probability of generating a pair of bags (B1, B2) with a particular assignment A of size 1 is The above equation holds regardless of how we represent concepts.
    There are many plausible representations, such as pairs of trees from synchronous tree adjoining grammars (Abeille et al. 1990; Shieber 1994; Candito 1998), lexical conceptual structures (Dorr 1992) and WordNet synsets (Fellbaum 1998; Vossen 1998).
    Of course, for a representation to be used, a method must exist for estimating its distribution in data.
    A useful representation will reduce the entropy of the trans distribution, which is conditioned on the concept distribution as shown in Equation 10.
    This topic is beyond the scope of this article, however.
    I mention it only to show how the models presented here may be used as building blocks for models that are more psycholinguistically sophisticated.
