t for some sentences, none of the obtained ? derivations give the correct MR. But as will be described shortly, the most probable derivation which gives the correct MR is needed to collect positive and negative examples for the next iteration.
			Hence in these cases, aversion of the extended Earley?s algorithm, EX TENDED EARLEY CORRECT, is invoked which also takes the correct MR as an argument and returns the best ? derivations it finds, all of which give the correct MR. This is easily done by making sure all subtrees derived in the process are present in the parse of the correct MR. From these derivations, positive and negativeexamples are collected for the next iteration.
			Positive examples are collected from the most probable derivation which gives the correct MR, fig ure 3 showed an example of a derivation which gives the correct MR. At each node in such aderivation, the substring covered is taken as a positive example for its production.
			Negative exam ples are collected from those derivations whose
