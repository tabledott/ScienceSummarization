    However, rather than hand-creating lexical rules and running into the same limitations as with GTag&#8217;s rules, we used an empiricallyderived resource called VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel 2004), available at http://semantics.isi.edu/ocean.
    This resource consists of lexical relations mined from Google searches.
    The mining uses a set of lexical and syntactic patterns to test for pairs of verb strongly associated on the Web in an asymmetric &#8216;happens-before&#8217; relation.
    For example, the system discovers that marriage happens-before divorce, and that tie happens-before untie.
    We automatically extracted all the &#8216;happensbefore&#8217; relations from the VerbOcean resource at the above web site, and then automatically converted those relations to GTag format, producing 4,199 rules.
    Here is one such converted rule: Adding these lexical rules to GTag (with morphological normalization being added for rule matching on word features) amounts to a considerable au
