e 1).
    Adjectives and PPs.
    This problem is similar to the previous problem, with the difference being that there are also adjectives preceding the entity.
    The solution is also similar to the solution to the previous problem.
    We moved the adjectives from the nested NP into the main NP.
    These three modifications to the data solved most, but not all, of the inconsistencies.
    Another source of problems was conjunctions, such as North and South Korea, where North and South are a phrase, but South Korea is an entity.
    The rest of the errors seemed to be due to annotation errors and other random weirdnesses.
    We ended up unable to make 0.4% of the entities consistent with the parses, so we omitted those entities from the training and test data.
    One more change we made to the data was with respect to possessive NPs.
    When we encountered noun phrases which ended with (POS &#8217;s) or (POS &#8217;), we modified the internal structure of the NP.
    Originally, these NPs were flat, bu
