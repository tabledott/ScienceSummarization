he particle to precede the verb.
    As one example, the following clause contains both a verb (forden) as well as a particle (auf): [5] Infinitives In some cases, infinitival verbs are still not in the correct position after transformations [1]&#8211;[4].
    For this reason we add a second step that involves infinitives.
    First, we remove all internal VP nodes within the parse tree.
    Second, for any clause (i.e., phrase labeled S...), if the clause dominates both a finite and infinitival verb, and there is an argument (i.e., a subject, or an object) between the two verbs, then the infinitive is moved to directly follow the finite verb.
    As an example, the following clause contains an infinitival (einreichen) that is separated from a finite verb konnten by the direct object es:
  
  
    The transformation removes the VP-OC, and moves the infinitive, giving:
  
  
    [6] Negation As a final step, we move negative particles.
    If a clause dominates both a finite and infinitival verb, as well as a
