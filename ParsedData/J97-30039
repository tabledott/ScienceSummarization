 a stochastic tagger and a rule-based tagger.
  
  
    There are two kinds of word-guessing rules employed by our cascading guesser: morphological rules and nonmorphological ending-guessing rules.
    Morphological wordguessing rules describe how one word can be guessed given that another word is known.
    Unlike morphological guessing rules, nonmorphological rules do not require the base form of an unknown word to be listed in the lexicon.
    Such rules guess the Pos-class for a word on the basis of its ending or leading segments alone.
    This is especially important when dealing with uninflected words and domain-specific sublanguages where many highly specialized words can be encountered.
    In English, as in many other languages, morphological word formation is realized by affixation: prefixation and suffixation.
    Thus, in general, each kind of guessing rule can be further subcategorized depending on whether it is applied to the beginning or tail of an unknown word.
