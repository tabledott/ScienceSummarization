ially significant aspects of an evaluated clus tering solution.
	
	
			In this section, we present two clustering experiments.
			We describe a document clustering experiment and evaluate its results using V-measure, high lighting the interaction between homogeneity and completeness.
			Second, we present a pitch accent type clustering experiment.
			We present results fromboth of these experiments in order to show how V measure can be used to drawn comparisons across data sets.
			5.1 Document Clustering.
			Clustering techniques have been used widely to sort documents into topic clusters.
			We reproduce such an experiment here to demonstrate the usefulnessof V-measure.
			Using a subset of the TDT-4 cor pus (Strassel and Glenn, 2003) (1884 English newswire and broadcast news documents manually la beled with one of 12 topics), we ran clustering experiments using k-means clustering (McQueen, 1967) and evaluated the results using V-Measure,VI and Q0 ? those measures that satisfied the desirable properties def
