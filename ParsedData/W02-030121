 we compared the change in the training time and the accuracy with and without the class splitting.
    We used a feature set {hw, pre, suf, sub, posi[&#8722;2,&#183;&#183;&#183;,2],pc[&#8722;2,&#8722;1]} and the inner product kernel.9 The training time was measured on a machine with four 700MHz PentiumIIIs and 16GB RAM.
    Table 2 shows the results of the experiments.
    Figure 1 shows the results graphically.
    We can see that without splitting we soon suffer from super-linearity of the SVM training, while with splitting we can handle the training with over 100,000 samples in a reasonable time.
    It is very important that the splitting technique does not sacrifice the accuracy for speed, rather improves the accuracy.
    In this experiment, we see the effect of the word cache feature and the HMM state feature described in Section 3.4.
    The effect is assessed by the accuracy gain observed by adding each feature set to a base feature set and the accuracy degradation observed by subtracting it from a
