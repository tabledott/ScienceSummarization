 of having more features.
    We see a similar pattern with the ANIM feature.
    Comparing the third to the first panel of Table 14 (the errors without the ANIM feature compared to the errors with the ANIM feature added to the set), we see an even larger improvement in discriminability of unaccusatives when the ANIM feature is added.
    The confusability of unaccusatives and unergatives drops from 7 errors to 5 errors, and of unaccusatives and object-drops from 11 errors to 6 errors.
    Again, confusability of unergatives and object-drops is worse, with an increase in errors of 5 to 7.
    We had predicted that the TRANS feature would make a three-way distinction among the verb classes, based on its predicted linear relationship between the classes (see the inequalities in Table 13).
    We had further expected that PASS and VBN would behave similarly, since these features are correlated to TRANS.
    To make a three-way distinction among the verb classes, we would expect confusability between all three pa
