he boundaries of frame elements separately from the question of finding the correct label for a particular frame element, similar features are used to calculate both probabilities.
    In the experiments below, the system is no longer given frame element boundaries but is still given as inputs the human-annotated target word and the frame to which it belongs.
    We do not address the task of identifying which frames come into play in a sentence but envision that existing word sense disambiguation techniques could be applied to the task.
    As before, features are extracted from the sentence and its parse and are used to calculate probability tables, with the predicted variable in this case being fe, a binary indicator of whether a given constituent in the parse tree is or is not a frame element.
    The features used were the path feature of Section 4.1.3, the identity of the target word, and the identity of the constituent&#8217;s head word.
    The probability distributions calculated from the training da
