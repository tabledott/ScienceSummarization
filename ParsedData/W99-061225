tainly related to the years of research and organized evaluations on this specific task in this language.
    It is not clear what resources are required to adapt systems to new languages.&amp;quot; It is important to mention that the F-measure for the human performance on this task is about 96%, (Sundheim 1995).
    Our experiments on Romanian text were consistent with this figure.
    In order to obtain a baseline performance for this method we considered the performance of a system that tags only the examples found in one of the the original training wordlists.
    We consider this to be a plausible lower bound measure if the training words have not been selected from the test text.
    Day and Palmer (1997) showed that a baseline Fmeasure score for the ENAMEX task varies from 21.2% for English to 73.2% for Chinese.
    It is important to mention that, when they computed these figures, they trained their language independent system on large annotated corpora (e.g. the Wall Street Journal for English).
