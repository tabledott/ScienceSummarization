se pairs into memory if the source phrase occurs in the test corpus.
    Therefore, the large test corpus size for this task also affects the translation speed.
    In Fig.
    1, we see the average translation time per sentence as a function of the sentence length.
    The translation times were measured for the translation of the 5432 test sentences of the Canadian Hansards task.
    We see a clear linear dependency.
    Even for sentences of thirty words, the translation takes only about 1.5 seconds.
  
  
    Recently, phrase-based translation approaches became more and more popular.
    Some examples are the alignment template system in (Och et al., 1999; Och and Ney, 2002) that we used for comparison.
    In (Zens et al., 2002), a simple phrase-based approach is described that served as starting point for the system in this work.
    (Marcu and Wong, 2002) presents a joint probability model for phrase-based translation.
    It does not use the word alignment for extracting the phrases, but directly gene
