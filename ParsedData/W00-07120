  Knowledge-Free Induction Of Morphology Using Latent Semantic Analysis
  
    Morphology induction is a subproblem of important tasks like automatic learning of machine-readable dictionaries and grammar induction.
    Previous morphology induction approaches have relied solely on statistics of hypothesized stems and affixes to choose which affixes to consider legitimate.
    Relying on stemand-affix statistics rather than semantic knowledge leads to a number of problems, such as the inappropriate use of valid affixes (&amp;quot;ally&amp;quot; stemming to &amp;quot;all&amp;quot;).
    We introduce a semantic-based algorithm for learning morphology which only proposes affixes when the stem and stem-plusaffix are sufficiently similar semantically.
    We implement our approach using Latent Semantic Analysis and show that our semantics-only approach provides morphology induction results that rival a current state-of-the-art system.
