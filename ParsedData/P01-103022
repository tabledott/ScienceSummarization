cide, as Model 4 is an imperfect model of the translation process&#8212;i.e., there is no guarantee that a numerically optimal decoding is actually a good translation.
    Suppose a decoder outputs, while the optimal decoding turns out to be.
    Then we consider six possible outcomes: no error (NE) : , and is a perfect , andis a perfect translation, whileis not. harmless search error (HSE): , butandare both perfectly good translations. compound error (CE): , and neither is a perfect translation.
    Here, &#8220;perfect&#8221; refers to a human-judged translation that transmits all of the meaning of the source sentence using flawless target-language syntax.
    We have found it very useful to have several decoders on hand.
    It is only through IP decoder output, for example, that we can know the stack decoder is returning optimal solutions for so many sentences (see Table 1).
    The IP and stack decoders enabled us to quickly locate bugs in the greedy decoder, and to implement extensions to the basic gree
