formulated a bit, one might pose the question, does the young language learner&#8212;who has access not only to the spoken language, but perhaps also to the rudiments of the syntax and to the intended meaning of the words and sentences&#8212;does the young learner have access to additional information that simplifies the task of morpheme identification?
    It is the belief that the answer to this question is yes that drives the intuition (if one has this intuition) that an MDL-based analysis of the present sort is an unlikely model of human language acquisition.
    But I think that such a belief is very likely mistaken.
    Knowledge of semantics and even grammar is unlikely to make the problem of morphology discovery significantly easier.
    In surveying the various approaches to the problem that I have explored (only the best of which have been described here), I do not know of any problem (of those which the present algorithm deals with successfully) that would have been solved by having direct access t
