    English dependency trees are provided by Minipar (Lin, 1994).
    The goal of this experiment is to empirically confirm that the English spans marked invalid by Section 3.2&#8217;s dependency-augmented ITG provide useful guidance to an aligner.
    To do so, we compare an ITG with hard cohesion constraints, an unconstrained ITG, and a weighted maximum matching aligner.
    All aligners use the same simple objective function.
    They maximize summed link values v(l), where v(l) is defined as follows for an l = (Ej, Fk): All three aligners link based on 02 correlation scores, breaking ties in favor of closer pairs.
    This allows us to evaluate the hard constraints outside the context of supervised learning.
    Table 1 shows the results of this experiment.
    We can see that switching the search method from weighted maximum matching to a cohesionconstrained ITG (D-ITG) has produced a 34% relative reduction in alignment error rate.
    The bulk of this improvement results from a substantial increase in
