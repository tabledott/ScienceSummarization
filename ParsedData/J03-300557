hether (v, n) or (v, n') was the correct pair in each triple.
    Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth (2000) reported pseudodisambiguation results with two clustering models: (1) Rooth et al.&#8217;s (1999) clustering approach, which models the semantic fit between a verb and its argument (VA model), and (2) a refined version of this approach that models only the fit between a verb and its object (VO model), disregarding other arguments of the verb.
    The results of the two models on the pseudodisambiguation task are shown in Table 14.
    At this point, it is important to note that neither Rooth et al. (1999) nor Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth (2000) used pseudodisambiguation for the final evaluation of their models.
    Rather, the performance on the pseudodisambiguation task was used to optimize the model parameters.
    The results in Tables 13 and 14 show the pseudodisambiguation performance achieved for the best parameter settings.
    In other words, these results were obtained on the development set (i.e., o
