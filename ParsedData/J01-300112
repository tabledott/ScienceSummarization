is weighting scheme, inspired by those used in computer chess programs, assigns each sub-process a weight in the range -100 to +100 before summing.
    Unlike McRoy, this approach does not consider the specificity of a knowledge source in a particular instance but always assigns the same overall weight to each.
    Harley and Glennon report 78% correct tagging of all content words at the CIDE guideword level (which they equate to the LDOCE sense level) and 73% at the subsense level, as compared to a hand-tagged corpus of 4,000 words.
    An early application of machine learning to the WSD problem was carried out by Brown et al. (1991).
    Several different disambiguation cues, such as first noun to the left/right and second word to the left/right, were extracted from parallel text.
    Translation differences were used to define the senses, as this approach was used in an English-French machine translation system.
    The parallel text effectively provided supervised training examples for this algorithm.
