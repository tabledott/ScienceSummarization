e measure of labeler agreement.
    Results in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993) and (Swerts, 1995) show that with a larger number of labelers, notions of BOUNDARY STRENGTH can be employed.
    4Consensus percentages for the three types in Table 1 do not necessarily sum to the total consensus agreement percentage, since a phrase is both segment-initial and segment-final when it makes up a segment by itself. group T. When the read and spontaneous data are pooled, group S agreed upon significantly more SBEG boundaries (p&lt;.05, x=4.7, df=1) as well as SF boundaries (p&lt;.05, x=4.4, df=1) than did group T. Further, it is not the case that text-alone segmenters simply chose to place fewer boundaries in the discourse; if this were so, then we would expect a high percentage of SCONT consensus labels where no SBEGs or SFs were identified.
    Instead, we find that the number of consensus SCONTs was significantly higher for text-and-speech labelings than for text-alone (p&lt;.001, x=49.1, df=1).
    It appears that the
