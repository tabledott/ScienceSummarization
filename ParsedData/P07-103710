    One important way of portraying such lexical descriptions is via the supertags devised in the LTAG and CCG frameworks (Bangalore &amp; Joshi, 1999; Clark &amp; Curran, 2004).
    A supertag (see Figure 1) represents a complex, linguistic word category that encodes a syntactic structure expressing a specific local behaviour of a word, in terms of the arguments it takes (e.g. subject, object) and the syntactic environment in which it appears.
    In fact, in LTAG a supertag is an elementary tree and in CCG it is a CCG lexical category.
    Both descriptions can be viewed as closely related functional descriptions.
    The term &#8220;supertagging&#8221; (Bangalore &amp; Joshi, 1999) refers to tagging the words of a sentence, each with a supertag.
    When well-formed, an ordered sequence of supertags can be viewed as a compact representation of a small set of constituents/parses that can be obtained by assembling the supertags together using the appropriate combinatory operators (such as subs
