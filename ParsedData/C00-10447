d is based on information extracted fiom conjunctions between adjectives in a large corpus I because orientation constrains the use of the words in specific contexts (e.g., compare corrupt and brutal with *corrupt but brutal), observed conjunctions of adjectives can be exploited to inler whether the conjoined words are of the same or different orientation.
  Using a shallow parser on a 21 million word corpus of Wall Street Jour- nal articles, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown developed and trained a log-linear statistical model that predicts whether any two adjectives have the same orientation with 82% accuracy.
  The predicted links o1 same or dil L ferent orientation are automatically assigned a strength value (essentially, a confidence stimate) by tile model, and induce a graph that can be partitioned with a clus- tering algorithm into components so that all words in the same component belong to the same orientation class.
  Once the classes have been determined, flequency infor- mation is used to assign positi
