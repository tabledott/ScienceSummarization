or many language pairs the amount of available bilingual text is very limited.
    In this work, we will address this problem and propose a general framework to solve it.
    Our hypothesis is that adding information from source language text can also provide improvements.
    Unlike adding target language text, this hypothesis is a natural semi-supervised learning problem.
    To tackle this problem, we propose algorithms for transductive semi-supervised learning.
    By transductive, we mean that we repeatedly translate sentences from the development set or test set and use the generated translations to improve the performance of the SMT system.
    Note that the evaluation step is still done just once at the end of our learning process.
    In this paper, we show that such an approach can lead to better translations despite the fact that the development and test data are typically much smaller in size than typical training data for SMT systems.
    Transductive learning can be seen as a means to adapt the
