a beam of derivations D, where hod and hid are the lexical heads of the top two entries on the stack of d. Figure 3 gives a partial tree representation of a potential derivation state for the string &amp;quot;the dog chased the cat with spots&amp;quot;, at the point when the word &amp;quot;with&amp;quot; is to be predicted.
    The shift-reduce parser will have, perhaps, built the structure shown, and the stack state will have an NP entry with the head &amp;quot;cat&amp;quot; at the top of the stack, and a VBD entry with the head &amp;quot;chased&amp;quot; second on the stack.
    In the Chelba and Jelinek model, the probability of &amp;quot;with&amp;quot; is conditioned on these two headwords, for this derivation.
    Since the specific results of the SLM will be compared in detail with our model when the empirical results are presented, at this point we will simply state that they have achieved a reduction in both perplexity and word error rate over a standard trigram using this model.
