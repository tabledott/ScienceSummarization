(1a-b) (abstracting away from agreement information) are given in (2) and (3).
    The MRSs are ordered tuples consisting of a top handle (h1 in both cases), an instance or event variable (e in both cases), a bag of elementary predications (eps), and a bag of scope constraints (in these cases, QEQ constraints or &#8216;equal modulo quantifiers&#8217;).
    In a well-formed MRS, the handles can be 1These examples also differ in that probably is a prehead modifier while on a spaceship is a post-head modifier.
    This word-order distinction cross-cuts the semantic distinction, and our focus is on the latter, so we won&#8217;t consider the word-order aspects of these examples here. identified in one or more ways respecting the scope constraints such that the dependencies between the eps form a tree.
    For a detailed description of MRS, see the works cited above.
    Here, we will focus on the difference between the intersective modifier on (a spaceship) and the scopal modifier probably.
    In (2), the ep cont
