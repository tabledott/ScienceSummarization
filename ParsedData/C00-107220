y, two consecutive non-stopword 9 (bigram) fie- quency, and three consecutive non-stopwords (tri- gram) fiequeney to facilitate the computation of the -21ogA value for each term.
  We expect high rank- ing bigram and trigram signature terms to be very informative.
  We set the cutoff associated weight at 10.83 with confidence level ~t = 0.001 by looking up a X 2 statistical table.
  Table 2 shows the top 10 unigrmn, bigram, and tri- gram topic signature terms for each topic m. Several conclusions can be drawn directly.
  Terms with high -21ogA are indeed good indicators for their corre- sponding topics.
  The -2logA values decrease as the number of words in a term increases.
  This is rea- sonable, since longer terms usually occur less often than their constituents.
  However, bigram terms are more informative than nnigrant erms as we can ob- serve: jail//prison overervwding of topic 151, tobacco industry of topic 257, computer security of topic 258, and solar en, ergy/imwer of topic 271.
