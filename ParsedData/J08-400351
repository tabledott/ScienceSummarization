cause a RIGHT-ARCpl transition leaves the dependent in &#955;1 while a LEFT-ARCpl removes it.)
    Moreover, for any i &#8712; &#955;cq that is a root in Gx,, if i is a dependent of p in Gx then any j such that j &#8712; &#955;cq, i &lt; j and j is a root in Gx, must also be a dependent of p in Gx (else Gx would fail to be projective).
    Finally, if p has a head k in Gx, then k must be in &#955;cq and any j such that j &#8712; &#955;cq and k &lt; j must either be a dependent of p in Gx or must have a head to the left in both Gx, and Gx (anything else would again be inconsistent with the assumption that Gx is projective).
    Therefore, we can construct a transition sequence C0,m such that Gcm = Gx, by starting in c0 = cs(x) and applying exactly the same q transitions as in C0,q, followed by as many LEFT-ARCpl transitions as there are left dependents of p in Gx, interleaving NO-ARCp transitions whenever the node at the head of &#955;1 already has a head, followed by a RIGHT-ARCpl transition if p has a head i
