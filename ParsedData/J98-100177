ies of meaning, for example, Bloomfield (1933) and Harris (1954), for whom meaning is a function of distribution; and in Barwise and Perry's (1953) situation semantics, where the sense or senses of a word are seen as an abstraction of the role that it plays systematically in the discourse.
    The COBUILD project (Sinclair 1987) adopts this view of meaning by attempting to anchor dictionary senses in current usage by creating sense divisions on the basis of clusters of citations in a corpus.
    Atkins (1987) and Kilgarriff (forthcoming) also implicitly adopt the view of Harris (1954), according to which each sense distinction is reflected in a distinct context.
    A similar view underlies the class-based methods cited in Section 2.4.3 (Brown et al. 1992; Pereira and Tishby 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993).
    In this volume, Schiitze continues in this vein and proposes a technique that avoids the problem of sense distinction altogether: he creates sense clusters from a corpus rather than relying on a p
