  This is because the strings of a TAL grow linearly (for a detailed definite of the property called "contact growth" property, see [Jmhi ,1983 I.
  For those familiar with [Joehi, 19&amp;3], it is worth pointing out that the SA constraint is only abbreviating, i.e., it does not affect the power of TAGs.
  The NA and OA constraints however do affect the power of TAGs.
  This way of looking at local constraints has only greatly simplified their statement, but it has also Mlowed us to capture the insight that the locality of the constraint in statable in terms of the elemental/ trees themselves!
