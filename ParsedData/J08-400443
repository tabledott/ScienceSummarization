ould straddle the conventional cutoff point of 0.80, and even so the difference is very small).
    Finally, one would expect the difference between &#960; and &#954; to diminish as the number of coders grows; this is shown subsequently.6 We define B, the overall annotator bias in a particular set of coding data, as the difference between the expected agreement according to (multi)-&#960; and the expected agreement according to (multi)-&#954;. Annotator bias is a measure of variance: If we take c to be a random variable with equal probabilities for all coders, then the annotator bias B is the sum of the variances of P(k|c) for all categories k &#8712; K, divided by the number of coders c less one (see Artstein and Poesio [2005] for a proof).
    This allows us to make the following observations about the relationship between &#960; and &#954;.
    In other words, provided enough coders are used, it should not matter whether a single-distribution or individual-distribution coefficient is used.
    This is not
