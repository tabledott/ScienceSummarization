es are ranked with respect to their grammatical function (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995), and in others with respect to their position in Prince&#8217;s (1981) givenness hierarchy (Strube and Hahn 1999) or their thematic role (Sidner 1979).
    As a result, two &#8220;instantiations&#8221; of the same theory make different predictions for the same input.
    Poesio et al. (2004) explore alternative specifications proposed in the literature, and demonstrate that the predictive power of the theory is highly sensitive to its parameter definitions.
    A common methodology for translating entity-based theories into computational models is to evaluate alternative specifications on manually annotated corpora.
    Some studies aim to find an instantiation of parameters that is most consistent with observable data (Strube and Hahn 1999; Karamanis et al. 2004; Poesio et al.
    2004).
    Other studies adopt a specific instantiation with the goal of
