a semantic dictionary.
    While previous corpus-based methods are highly accurate for this task, they are difficult to port to other languages because they require resources that are expensive to construct or simply nonexistent in other languages.
    We present an unsupervised algorithm for prepositional phrase attachment in English that requires only an part-of-speech tagger and a morphology database, and is therefore less resourceintensive and more portable than previous approaches, which have all required either treebanks or partial parsers.
  
  
    The exact task of our algorithm will be to construct a classifier c/ which maps an instance of an ambiguous prepositional phrase (v, n, p, n2) to either N or V, corresponding to noun attachment or verb attachment, respectively.
    In the full natural language parsing task, there are more than just two potential attachment sites, but we limit our task to choosing between a verb v and a noun n so that we may compare with previous supervised attempts on this
