aves may be labeled by X.
    (T&#931;(&#8709;) = T&#931;.)
    Leaves are nodes with no children.
    The nodes of a tree t are identified one-to-one with its paths: pathst &#8834; paths &#8801; N* &#8801; U i=0 Ni (A0 &#8801; {()}).
    The path to the root is the empty sequence (), and p1 extended by p2 is p1 &#183; p2, where &#183; is concatenation.
    For p &#8712; pathst, rankt(p) is the number of children, or rank, of the node at p in t, and labelt(p) &#8712; The paths to X in t are pathst(X) &#8801; {p &#8712; pathst  |labelt(p) &#8712; X}.
    A frontier is a set of paths f that are pairwise prefix-independent: A frontier of t is a frontier f &#8838; pathst.
    Fort, s &#8712; T&#931;(X), p &#8712; pathst, t[p &#8592; s] is the substitution of s for p in t, where the subtree at path p is replaced by s. For a frontier f of t, the mass substitution of X for the frontier f in t is written t[p &#8592; X, &#8704;p &#8712; f] and is equivalent to substituting the X(p) for the p serially in any order. in
