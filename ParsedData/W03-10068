mation, the extraction procedure from the PTB that is described in (Chen, 2001) including extensions to extract a TAG from the PropBank, and finally the extraction of deeper linguistic features from the resulting TAG.
    A TAG is defined to be a set of lexicalized elementary trees (Joshi and Schabes, 1991).
    They may be composed by several well-defined operations to form parse trees.
    A lexicalized elementary tree where the lexical item is removed is called a tree frame or a supertag.
    The lexical item in the tree is called an anchor.
    Although the TAG formalism allows wide latitude in how elementary trees may be defined, various linguistic principles generally guide their formation.
    An important principle is that dependencies, including long-distance dependencies, are typically localized the same elementary tree by appropriate grouping of syntactically or semantically related elements.
    The extraction procedure fragments a parse tree from the PTB that is provided as input into elementary
