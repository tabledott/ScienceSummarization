 representation simpler and more readable by suppressing lemmatization, token numbering and PoS tags, but have left the DepBank annotations unmodified.
    The example illustrates some differences between the schemes.
    For instance, the subj and ncsubj relations overlap as both annotations contain such a relation between call(ed) and Ten), but the GR annotation also includes this relation between limit and effort(s) and reject and justice(s), while DepBank links these two verbs to a variable pro.

    However, for evaluation, these DepBank relations add little or no information not already specified by the xcomp relations in which these verbs also appear as dependents.
    On the other hand, DepBank includes an adjunct relation between meanwhile and call(ed), while the GR annotation trea
