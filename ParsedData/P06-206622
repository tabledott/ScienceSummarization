sefulness of these constraints in the context of non-projective dependency parsing.
    When we compare the two graded constraints to each other, we find that the gap degree measure partitions the data into less and larger clusters than the edge degree, which may be an advantage in the context of using the degree constraints as features in a data-driven approach towards parsing.
    However, our purely quantitative experiments cannot answer the question, which of the two measures yields the more informative clusters.
    The planarity constraint appears to be of little use as a generalization of projectivity: enforcing it excludes more than 75% of the non-projective data in PDT, and 90% of the data in DDT.
    The relatively large difference in coverage between the two treebanks may at least partially be explained with their different annotation schemes for sentence-final punctuation.
    In DDT, sentence-final punctuation marks are annotated as dependents of the main verb of a dependency nexus.
    This, as
