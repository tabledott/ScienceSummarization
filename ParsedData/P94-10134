rns are sufficient to identify and label the correct form.
    In homophone disambiguation, distinct semantic concepts such as ceiling and sealing have also become represented by the same ambiguous form, but in the medium of speech and with similar disambiguating clues.
    Capitalization restoration is a similar problem in that distinct semantic concepts such as AIDS' aids (disease or helpful tools) and Bush/ bush (president or shrub) are ambiguous, but in the medium of all-capitalized (or casefree) text, which includes titles and the beginning of sentences.
