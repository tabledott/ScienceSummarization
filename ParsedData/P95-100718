ments is shown in figure 2.
    As can be seen, the dependency model is more accurate than the adjacency model.
    This is true across the whole spectrum of training schemes.
    The proportion of cases in which the procedure was forced to guess, either because no data supported either analysis or because both were equally supported, is quite low.
    For the pattern and two-word window training schemes, the guess rate is less than 4% for both models.
    In the three-word window training scheme, the guess rates are less than 1%.
    For all larger windows, neither model is ever forced to guess.
    In the case of the pattern training scheme, the difference between 68.9% for adjacency and 77.5% for dependency is statistically significant at the 5% level (p = 0.0316), demonstrating the superiority of the dependency model, at least for the compounds within Grolier's encyclopedia.
    In no case do any of the windowed training schemes outperform the pattern scheme.
    It seems that additional instances admitte
