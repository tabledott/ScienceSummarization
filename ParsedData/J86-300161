at plays a role in determining the DP/DSPs is shared knowledge about actions and objects in the domain of discourse.
    This shared knowledge is especially important when the linguistic markers and utterance-level intentions are insufficient for determining the DSP precisely.
    In Section 7 we introduce two relations, a supports relation between propositions and a generates relation between actions, and present two rules stating equivalences; one links a dominance relation between two DSPs with a supports relation between propositions and the other links a dominance relation between DSPs to a generates relation between actions.
    Use of these rules in one direction allows for (partially) determining what supports or generates relationship holds from the dominance relationship.
    But the rules can be used in the opposite direction also: if, from the content of utterances and reasoning about the domain of discourse, a supports or generates relationship can be determined, then the dominates relationship b
