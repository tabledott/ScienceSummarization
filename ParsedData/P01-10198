a1, a2)] = f([a1], [a2]) for some function f. Intuitively, where the SMRS of the SEMENT a1 denotes G1 and the SMRS of the SEMENT a2 denotes G2, we want the semantic value of the SMRS of op(a1, a2) to denote the following: G1 &#8745; G2 &#8745; [hook(a1) = hole(a2)] But this cannot be constructed purely as a function of G1 and G2.
    The solution is to add hooks and holes to the denotations of SEMENTS (cf.
    Zeevat, 1989).
    We define the denotation of a SEMENT to be an element of I &#215; I &#215; P(G), where I = E &#8746; A, as follows: So, the meanings of SEMENTs are ordered threetuples, consisting of the hook and hole elements (from I) and a set of variable assignment functions that satisfy the SMRS.
    We can now define the following operation f over these denotations to create an algebra: Definition 5 Semantics of the Semantic Construction Algebra where G0 = {g : g(i1) = g(i02)} And this operation demonstrates that semantic construction is compositional: Theorem 2 Semantics of Semantic Construction
