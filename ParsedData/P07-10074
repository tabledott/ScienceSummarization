and since priors across different domains.
    Using the sense performing adaptation from a general corpus to a priors estimated by expectation-maximization (EM), more specific corpus is a natural scenario, we focus the predominant sense in the new domain is pre- on adapting a WSD system trained on BC to WSJ in dicted.
    Using this predicted predominant sense and this paper.
    Henceforth, out-of-domain data will readopting a count-merging technique, we improve the fer to BC examples, and in-domain data will refer to effectiveness of the adaptation process.
    WSJ examples.
    In the next section, we discuss the choice of corpus and nouns used in our experiments.
    We then introduce active learning for domain adaptation, followed by count-merging.
    Next, we describe an EMbased algorithm to estimate the sense priors in the new domain.
    Performance of domain adaptation using active learning and count-merging is then presented.
    Next, we show that by using the predominant sense of the target doma
