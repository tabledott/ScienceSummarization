			Since the distinction between these four categories is not available in Moses, hence we have no baseline results for this case.

			tion limit affects performance.8 As has been shownin previous work in Chinese-English and Arabic English translation, limiting phrase displacements to six source-language words is a reasonable choice.For both C-E and A-E, the hierarchical model is sig nificantly better (p ? .05) than either other modelsfor distortion limits equal to or greater than 6 (ex cept for distortion limit 12 in the case of C-E).
			Since a distortion limit of 6 works reasonably well for both language pairs and is the default in Moses, we use
