ructiondependent way allows us to make simple changes that have wide ranging effects.
    This is illustrative of how our approach tries to rein in cases where the DCA breaks down by using linguistically informed constraints that are as general as possible.
    Second, we used more detailed linguistic knowledge of Chinese to develop a small set of rules, expressed in a tree-based pattern-action formalism, that perform local modifications of a projected analysis on the Chinese side.
    To avoid the slippery slope of unending language-specific rule tweaking, we strictly constrained the possible rules.
    Rules were permitted to refer only to closed class items, to parts of speech projected from the English analysis, or to easily enumerated lexical categories (e.g.
    {dollar, RMB, $, For example, one such rule deals with noun modification: word nk to its place with nj, nk_j as dependents.
    Another deals with aspectual markers for verbs: &#8226; If vi, vk, a sequence of Chinese words aligned with English v
