e arguments of the same type, such as point.num(num,num), which is a kind of point that represents a field coordinate in CLANG.
			In this case, extra nodes are inserted in the treewith new type concepts that are unique for each ar gument.
			An example is shown in Figure 4 in whichthe additional type concepts num1 and num2 are in troduced.
			Again, during parsing, context will be used to determine the correct type for a given word.
			The point label of the root node of Figure 4 is the concept that includes all kinds of points in CLANG.
