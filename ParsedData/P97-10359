scenario key in Table 2.
    The AVMs of the remaining dialogues would differ from the key by at least one value.
    Thus, even though the dialogue strategies in Figures 2 and 3 are radically different, the AVM task representation for these dialogues is identical and the performance of the system for the same task can thus be assessed on the basis of the AVM representation.
    Success at the task for a whole dialogue (or subdialogue) is measured by how well the agent and user achieve the information requirements of the task by the end of the dialogue (or subdialogue).
    This section explains how PARADISE uses the Kappa coefficient (Carletta, 1996; Siegel and Castellan, 1988) to operationalize the taskbased success measure in Figure 1.
    The Kappa coefficient, K, is calculated from a confusion matrix that summarizes how well an agent achieves the information requirements of a particular task for a set of dialogues instantiating a set of scenarios.5 For example, Tables 3 and 4 show two hypothetical confus
