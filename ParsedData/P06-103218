    The following sentences, for example, remained uncorrected: He published many paper in provincial and national publication.
    He has published thirty-two pieces of papers.
    Large amounts of additional training data would doubtless be helpful in providing contextual resolutions to the problems.
    Improved alignment models may also play a role here in capturing complex structures of the kind represented by constructions involving counters.
  
  
    The artificially-engineered training data that we relied on for our experiments proved surprisingly useful in modeling real errors made by nonnative speakers.
    However, this is obviously a less than ideal data source, since the errors introduced by regular expressions are homogenously distributed in a way that naturally-occurring errors are not, creating artifacts that undoubtedly impair our SMT models.
    Artificial data of this sort may be useful as proof of concept, but hand engineeri
