translated into two different words (disaster and tragedy) in two diferent contexts.
    The process we described can be viewed more abstractly as follows: forming target sets that were translated into the same orthographic form in the source corpus.
    The first step of the process assumes a sentence- or segment-aligned parallel corpus; suitable data are now available for many languages via organizations such LDC and ELRA and the Web is a promising source of data in new language pairs and in new genres (Nie et al., 1999; Resnik, 1999a).
    After identifying and tokenizing sentences, we obtain word-level alignments for the parallel corpus using the GIZA++ implementation of the IBM statistical MT models (Och and Ney, 2000).
    For each French word instance f, we collect the word instance e with which it is aligned.
    Positions of the word instances are recorded so that in later stages we can project the eventual semantic annotation ort e to f. For example, the alignment of The accident was a tragedy with
