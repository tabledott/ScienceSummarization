  Even though 86% of the nouns in WordNet have a single sense, the mean number of WordNet senses per word for the one hundred most frequently occurring nouns in the Brown Corpus is 5.15, with only eight words having a single sense.
  1WordNet is a lexical database developed by George Miller and his colleagues at Princeton Urdversity.
  PREVIOUS WORK Yarowsky [3] compared the Bayesian statistical method with the published results of other corpus-based statisti- cal models.
  Although direct comparison was not possible due to the differences in corpora and evaluation criteria, he minimizes these differences by using the same words, with the same definition of sense.
  He argues, convinc- ingly, that the Bayesian model is as good as or better than the costlier methods.
  As a pilot for the present study, a two-sense distinction task for line was run using the content vector and neural network classifiers, achieving reater than 90~ accuracy.
  A three-sense distinction task was then run, which is re- p
