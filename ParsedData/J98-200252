generalization method that uses a thesaurus as prior knowledge.
  
  
    For an arbitrary subtree T' of a thesaurus tree T and an arbitrary tree cut model M = 0) of T, let MT, = (UT', ) denote the submodel of M that is contained in T'.
    Also for any sample S and any subtree T' of T, let ST, denote the subsample of S contained in T'.
    (Note that MT = M, ST = S.) Then define, in general for any submodel MT' and subsample ST', UST' I , Or) to be the data description length of subsample ST, using submodel L(Or UT') to be the parameter description length for the submodel Mr, and L'(MT, ) to be L(ST, I UT', GT') + L(OT, I Up).
    (Note that, when calculating the parameter description length for a submodel, the sample size of the entire sample ISI is used.)
    First note that for any (sub)tree T, (sub)model MT = (FT, UT) contained in T, and (sub)sample ST contained in T, and T's child subtrees T, : i = 1, .
    ,k, we have: provided that FT is not a single node (root node of T).
    This follows from the mu
