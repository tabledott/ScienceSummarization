gnment of z with the highest score(z) = &amp; w &#183; f(x, zi, i) that leads to an incorrect prediction y = C(x, z).
    Because the structure of compositional inference C does not allow dynamic programming, finding such an assignment is again intractable.
    We resort to enumerating only over K-best assignments instead.
    If none of the K-best assignments of z leads to an incorrect prediction y, then we skip the training instance for parameter update.
    Features.
    For each xi in x, we encode the following features: with unseen words in the test data, we add features that describe word categories based on the General Inquirer dictionary.
    We add this feature for each xi that is not a stop word.
    We also add a number of boolean features that provide following properties of xi using the polarity lexicon and the negator lexicon: &#8211; whether xi is a function-word negator &#8211; whether xi is a content-word negator &#8211; whether xi is a negator of any kind &#8211; the polarity of xi according
