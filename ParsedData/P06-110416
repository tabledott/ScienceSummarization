o measure the performance.
    In this subsection, we report the experiments of different kernel setups for different purposes. parse tree on relation extraction, we remove the entity-related information from parse trees by replacing the entity-related phrase types (&#8220;E1PER&#8221; and so on as shown in Fig.
    1) with &#8220;NP&#8221;.
    Table 1 compares the performance of 5 tree kernel setups on the ACE 2003 data using the tree structure information only.
    It shows that: ACE 2003 five major types using the parse tree structure information only (regardless of any entity-related information) kernel setups over the ACE major types of both the 2003 data (the numbers in parentheses) and the 2004 data (the numbers outside parentheses) the 2003 data although the ACE 2003 data is two times larger than the ACE 2004 data.
    This may be due to two reasons: 1) The ACE 2004 data defines two new entity types and re-defines the relation types and subtypes in order to reduce the inconsistency between LDC annota
