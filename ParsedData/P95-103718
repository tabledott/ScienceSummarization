rch space, (roughly 0(1711N1), where IT1 is the number of part-ofspeech tags, n is the number of words in the sentence, and 'NI is the number of non-terminal labels), it is not possible to compute the probability of every parse.
    However, the specific search algorithm used is not very important, so long as there are no search errors.
    A search error occurs when the the highest probability parse found by the parser is not the highest probability parse in the space of all parses.
    SPATTER's search procedure uses a two phase approach to identify the highest probability parse of a sentence.
    First, the parser uses a stack decoding algorithm to quickly find a complete parse for the sentence.
    Once the stack decoder has found a complete parse of reasonable probability (&gt; 10&#8212;s), it switches to a breadth-first mode to pursue all of the partial parses which have not been explored by the stack decoder.
    In this second mode, it can safely discard any partial parse which has a probability lower
