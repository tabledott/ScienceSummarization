 parameter training in Section 2.
    In Section 3, we present our decoder and, in Section 4, we evaluate our models empirically.
    In Section 5, we conclude with a brief discussion.
  
  
    After being exposed to 100M+ words of parallel Chinese-English texts, current phrase-based statistical machine translation learners induce reasonably reliable phrase-based probabilistic dictionaries.
    For example, our baseline statistical phrasebased system learns that, with high probabilities, the Chinese phrases &#8220;ASTRO- -NAUTS&#8221;, &#8220;FRANCE AND RUSSIA&#8221; and &#8220;COMINGFROM&#8221; can be translated into English as &#8220;astronauts&#8221;/&#8220;cosmonauts&#8221;, &#8220;france and russia&#8221;/&#8220;france and russian&#8221; and &#8220;coming from&#8221;/&#8220;from&#8221;, respectively.
    1 Unfortunately, when given as input Chinese sentence 1, our phrase-based system produces the output shown in 2 and not the translation in 3, which correctly orders the phrasal translations into a gramm
