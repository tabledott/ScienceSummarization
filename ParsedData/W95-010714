rule templates that determine a space of possible transformational rules.
    The patterns of the learned rules match to particular combinations of features in the neighborhood surrounding a word, and their action is to change the system's current guess as to the feature for that word.
    To learn a model, one first applies the baseline heuristic to produce initial hypotheses for each site in the training corpus.
    At each site where this baseline prediction is not correct, the templates are then used to form instantiated candidate rules with patterns that test selected features in the neighborhood of the word and actions that correct the currently incorrect tag assignment.
    This process eventually identifies all the rule candidates generated by that template set that would have a positive effect on the current tag assignments anywhere in the corpus.
    Those candidate rules are then tested against the rest of corpus, to identify at how many locations they would cause negative changes.
    One of those
