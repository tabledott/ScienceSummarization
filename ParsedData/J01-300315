    Note that in our focus on verb class distinctions we have not considered finergrained features that rely on more specific semantic features, such as, for example, that the subject of the intransitive melt must be something that can change from solid to liquid.
    While this type of feature may be important for semantic distinctions among individual verbs, it thus far seems irrelevant to the level of verb classification that we adopt, which groups verbs more broadly according to syntactic and (somewhat coarser-grained) semantic properties.
    Our analysis of thematic assignment&#8212;which was summarized in Table 2, repeated here as Table 3&#8212;is elaborated here for each verb class.
    The sentences in (1) above illustrate the relevant alternants of an unergative verb, race.
    Unergatives are intransitive action verbs whose transitive form, as in (lb), can be the causative counterpart of the intransitive form (la).
    The type of causative alternation that unergatives partici
