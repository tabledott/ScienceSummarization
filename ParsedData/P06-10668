This is because word order in Chinese and English is usually similar.
    The last one is the maximum entropy based reordering model proposed by us, which will be described in the next section.
    We define a derivation D as a sequence of applications of rules (1) &#8722; (3), and let c(D) and e(D) be the Chinese and English yields of D. The probability of a derivation D is where Pr(i) is the probability of the ith application of rules.
    Given an input sentence c, the final translation e* is derived from the best derivation D* We developed a CKY style decoder that employs a beam search algorithm, similar to the one by Chiang (2005).
    The decoder finds the best derivation that generates the input sentence and its translation.
    From the best derivation, the best English e* is produced.
    Given a source sentence c, firstly we initiate the chart with phrases from phrase translation table by applying the lexical rule.
    Then for each cell that spans from i to j on the source side, all possible deriva
