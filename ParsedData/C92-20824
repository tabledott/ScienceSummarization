 indicators and wildcard characters.
  (Markowitz e~ al.
  1986), (Jensen &amp; Binot 1987), and (Nakamura &amp; Nagao 1988) also use pattern recogni- tion to extract semantic relations uch as taxonomy from various dictionaries.
  (Ahlswede &amp; Evens I988) compares an approach based on parsing Websters 7th definitions with one based on pattern recognition, and finds that for finding simple semantic relations, pattern recognition [s far more accurate and efficient than parsing.
  The general feeling is that the struc- ture and function of MRDs makes their interpretation amenable to pattern-recognition techniques.
  Thus one could say by interpreting sentence (S1) ac- cording to (In-b) we are applying pattern-based rela- tion recognition to general texts.
  Since one of the goals of building a lexical hierarchy automatically is to aid in the construction of a natural anguage processing program, this approach to acquisition is preferable to one that needs a complex parser ~nd knowledge base.
  The tradeoff is
