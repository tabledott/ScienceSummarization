tion&#8212; because the sets i and Y are discrete sets.
    That said, for some functions h(y) and f(z) strong duality does hold, as stated in the following: L(u(k), z(k), y(k)) = L(u(k)), where the last equality is because y(k), z(k) are defined as the respective argmax&#8217;s.
    Thus, the inequality in Eq.
    9 is tight, and (y(k), z(k)) and u(k) are primal and dual optimal.
    Although the algorithm is not guaranteed to satisfy y(k) = z(k) for some k, by Theorem 1 if it does reach such a state, then we have the guarantee of an exact solution to Eq.
    4, with the dual solution u providing a certificate of optimality.
    We show in the experiments that this occurs very frequently, in spite of the parsing problem being NP-hard.
    It can be shown that Eq.
    8 is the dual of an LP relaxation of the original problem.
    When the conditions of Theorem 1 are satisfied, it means that the LP relaxation is tight for this instance.
    For brevity
  
  
    In this section we extend the approach to consid
