ts to extend).
    This refinement enables the model to readily handle relation phrases containing multiple verbs.
    A consequence of this pattern is that the relation phrase must be a contiguous span of words in the sentence.
    The syntactic constraint eliminates the incoherent relation phrases returned by existing systems.
    For example, given the sentence Extendicare agreed to buy Arbor Health Care for about US $432 million in cash and assumed debt.
    TEXTRUNNER returns the extraction (Arbor Health Care, for assumed, debt).
    The phrase for assumed is clearly not a valid relation phrase: it begins with a preposition and splices together two distant words in the sentence.
    The syntactic constraint prevents this type of error by simply restricting relation phrases to match the pattern in Figure 1.
    The syntactic constraint reduces uninformative extractions by capturing relation phrases expressed via LVCs.
    For example, the POS pattern matched against the sentence &#8220;Faust made a deal w
