lary of the training bitext, as when dealing with technical text or with a very small MRBD.
    The presented framework can be used as a method of enhancing an MRBD.
    Merging an MRBD with an N-best translation lexicon induced using the MRBD Filter will result in an MRBD with more entries that are relevant to the sublanguage of the training bitext.
    All the relevant entries will be rank ordered for appropriateness.
    A Cognate Filter is another kind of oracle filter.
    It is based on the simple heuristic that if a source word S is a cognate of some target word T, then T is the correct translation of S in their sentence pair, and there are no other translations of S or T in that sentence pair.
    Of course, identical words can mean different things in different languages.
    The cognate heuristic fails when dealing with such faux amis [Mac94].
    Fortunately, between French and English, true cognates occur far more frequently than faux amis.
    There are many possible notions of what a cognate is.
