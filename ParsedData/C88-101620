  The purpose of any is to sharpen the derivation process by restricting the choice of translates to the positinnally likely candidates in the corresponding sen tencc.
  To find fixed locutions in English, we can use the final probabilities QL and QR obtained by tile method of the previous section to compute mutual informations between primary and secondary word pairs, QR(e I e) IR(e;e r) = log- - - -  (5.3) P(e) and QL(e I e) 1L(e~;e) = log P(e) where P(e) = C(e)/N is the relative frequency of occurrence of the secondary word e in the English text (C(e) denotes the number of occurrences of e  in the text of size N), and QR and QL are the average secondary generation probabilities, QR(e]e) = ZQR(e  ,  i] e) (5,4) i and Ql.
  (e]e) = EQR(e  ,  i l e) i WE can then establish
