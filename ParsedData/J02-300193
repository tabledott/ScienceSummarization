nce on different roles because of the smaller number of categories.
    This breakdown is shown in Table 18.
    Results are given for two systems: the first assumes that the frame element boundaries are known and the second finds them automatically.
    The second system, which is described in Section 7.1, corresponds to the rightmost two columns in Table 18.
    The &#8220;Labeled Recall&#8221; column shows how often the frame element is correctly identified, whereas the &#8220;Unlabeled Recall&#8221; column shows how often a constituent with the given role is correctly identified as being a frame element, even if it is labeled with the wrong role.
    EXPERIENCER and AGENT, two similar roles generally found as the subject for complementary sets of verbs, are the roles that are correctly identified the most often.
    The &#8220;Unlabeled Recall&#8221; column shows that these roles are easy to find in the sentence, as a predicate&#8217;s subject is almost always a frame element, and the &#8220;Known Boundar
