eriments described above, we estimated the parameters of the models from only a small fraction of the data we have available: for the translation model, we used only about one percent of our data, and for the language model, only about ten percent.
    We have serious problems in sentences in which the translation of certain source words depends on the translation of other source words.
    For example, the translation model produces aller from to go by producing aller from go and nothing from to.
    Intuitively we feel that to go functions as a unit to produce aller.
    While our model allows many target words to come from the same source word, it does not allow several source words to work together to produce a single target word.
    In the future, we hope to address the problem of identifying groups of words in the source language that function as a unit in translation.
    This may take the form of a probabilistic division of the source sentence into groups of words.
    At present, we assume in our tr
