ieved documents that are relevant, in this case the percentage of detected documents that match the target grade level.
    Recall indicates the percentage of the total number of relevant documents in the data set that are retrieved, in this case the percentage of the total number of documents from the target level that are detected. these classifiers, indicated by large dots in the plot, are in the range of 33-43%, with only one over 40%.
    The curves for bigram and unigram models have similar shapes, but the trigram models outperform the lower-order models.
    Error rates for the bigram models range from 37-45% and the unigram models have error rates in the 39-49% range, with all but one over 40%.
    Although our training corpus is small the feature selection described in Section 4.2 allows us to use these higher-order trigram models.
    By combining language model scores with other features in an SVM framework, we achieve our best results.
    Figures 2 and 3 show DET curves for this set of classifier
