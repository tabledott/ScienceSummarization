  Combining Lexical Syntactic And Semantic Features With Maximum Entropy Models For Information Extraction
  
    Extracting semantic relationships between entities is challenging because of a paucity of annotated data and the errors induced by entity detection modules.
    We employ Maximum Entropy models to combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features derived from the text.
    Our system obtained competitive results in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) evaluation.
    Here we present our general approach and describe our ACE results.
  
  
    Extraction of semantic relationships between entities can be very useful for applications such as biography extraction and question answering, e.g. to answer queries such as &#8220;Where is the Taj Mahal?&#8221;.
    Several prior approaches to relation extraction have focused on using syntactic parse trees.
    For the Template Relations task of MUC-7, BBN researchers (Miller et al., 2000) augmented syntactic parse trees with semantic information c
