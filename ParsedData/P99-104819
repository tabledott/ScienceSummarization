amp;quot;larger situation and unfamiliar use&amp;quot; NPs.
    This set of NPs does not correspond exactly to our definition of existential NPs because we consider associative NPs to be existential and they do not.
    Even so, our results are slightly better than their previous results.
    A more equitable comparison is to measure our system's performance on only the independent existential noun phrases.
    Using this measure, our algorithm achieved 81.8% recall with 85.6% precision using Va, and achieved 82.9% recall with 83.5% precision using Vb.
  
  
    We have developed several methods for auto-matically identifying existential noun phrases using a training corpus.
    It accomplishes this task with recall and precision measurements that exceed those of the earlier Vieira Rz Poesio system, while not exploiting full parse trees, appositive constructions, hand-coded lists, or case sensitive text7.
    In addition, because the system is fully automated and corpus-based, it is suitable for applications
