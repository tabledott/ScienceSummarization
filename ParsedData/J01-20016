ks properly across a range of languages (not just for language L).
    There can be no better way to make the case that a particular analysis derives from a particular theory than to automate that process, so that all the linguist has to do is to develop the theory-as-computer-algorithm; the application of the theory to a particular language is carried out with no surreptitious help.
    From a practical point of view, the development of a fully automated morphology generator would be of considerable interest, since we still need good morphologies of many European languages and to produce a morphology of a given language &amp;quot;by hand&amp;quot; can take weeks or months.
    With the advent of considerable historical text available on-line (such as the ARTFL database of historical French), it is of great interest to develop morphologies of particular stages of a language, and the process of automatic morphology writing can simplify this stage&#8212;where there are no native speakers available&#8212;conside
