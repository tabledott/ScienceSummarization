th was and inserting really.
    Self-corrected strings can be viewed formally as having extra material inserted, but not involving either deletion or replacement of material.
    The linguistic system does seem to make use of both deletions and replacements in other subsystems of grammar however, namely in ellipsis and rank shift.
    As with the editing system, these are not errors but formal systems that interact with the central features of the syntax.
    True errors do of course occur involving all three logical possibilities (insertion, deletion, and replacement) but these are relatively rare.
    The self-correction rules have access to the internal data structures of the parser, and like the parser itself, they operate deterministically.
    The parser views the editing signal as occurring at the end of a constituent, because it marks the right edge of an expunged element.
    There are two types of editing rules in the system: expunction of copies, for which there are three rules, and lexically trig
