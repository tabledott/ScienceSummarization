ions remain at this point.
    The most important are the following: principles at work relating pairs of stems, as in English many stems (like win) are related to another stem with a doubled consonant (winn, as in winn-ing).
    We have been reasonably successful in identifying such semiregular morphology, and will report this in a future publication.
    There is a soft line between the discovery of related stems, on the one hand, and the parsing of a word into several suffixes.
    For example, in the case mentioned briefly above for French, it is not unreasonable to propose two stems for 'to write' ecri and ecriv, each used in distinct forms.
    It would also be reasonable, in this case, to analyze the latter stem ecriv as composed of ecri plus a suffix -v, although in this case, there are no additional benefits to be gained from the more fine-grained analysis.
    31 In particular, consider a paradigm with a set {0 of suffixes.
    We may represent a subsignature of that signature as a string of Os and
