dependently of each other often leads to incorrect parses &#8212; see figure 4 for further explanation.
    Adjuncts in the Penn Treebank We add the &amp;quot;-C&amp;quot; suffix to all non-terminals in training data which satisfy the following conditions: In addition, the first child following the head of a prepositional phrase is marked as a complement.
    The model could be retrained on training data with the enhanced set of non-terminals, and it might learn the lexical properties which distinguish complements and adjuncts (&amp;quot;Marks&amp;quot; vs -week&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;because&amp;quot;).
    However, it would still suffer from the bad independence assumptions illustrated in figure 4.
    To solve these kinds of problems, the generative process is extended to include a probabilistic choice of left and right subcategorisation frames: other leads to errors.
    In (1) the probability of generating both &amp;quot;Dreyfus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fund&amp;quot; as subj
