chandran et al., 2003).3 The problem is to select, given a set of possible candidates (in our case, potential A speakers), the one candidate that maximizes a given conditional probability distribution.
    We use maximum entropy modeling (Berger et al., 1996) to directly model the conditional probability , where each in The only role of the denominator is to ensure that is a proper probability distribution.
    It is defined as: To find the most probable speaker of part A, we use the following decision rule: Note that we have also attempted to model the problem as a binary classification problem where is an observation associated with the corresponding speaker.is represented here by only one variable for notational ease, but it possibly represents several lexical, durational, structural, and acoustic observations.
    Given feature functions and model parameters , the probability of the maximum entropy model is defined as: each speaker is either classified as speaker A or not, but we abandoned that approach,
