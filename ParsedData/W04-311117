malignancy entity definition is currently under development, as mentioned in Section 2.1, a guiding principle is that it will also be treated as a relation and broken down into component entities.
    While this also has conceptual benefits for the annotation guidelines, it has the fortunate effect of making such otherwise syntaxunfriendly malignancies as colorectal adenomas containing early cancer and acute myelomonocytic leukemia in remission amenable for mapping the component parts to syntactic nodes.
    Entities within Prenominal Modifiers While we are for the most part following the Penn Treebank guidelines (Bies et al., 1995), we are modifying them in two important aspects.
    One concerns the prenominal modifiers, which in the Penn Treebank were left flat, with no structure, but in this biomedical domain contain much of the information - e.g., cancer-associated autoimmune antigen.
    Not only would this have had no annotation for structure, but even more bizarrely, cancer-associated would have been
