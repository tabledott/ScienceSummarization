odel of a parse &#969; &#8712; Q, given a sentence S, as follows: where &#955; &#183; f (&#969;) = Ei &#955;ifi(&#969;).
    The function fi is the integer-valued frequency function of the ith feature; &#955;i is the weight of the ith feature; and ZS is a normalizing constant which ensures that P(&#969;|S) is a probability distribution: where &#961;(S) is the set of possible parses for S. For the normal-form model, features are defined over single derivations, including local word&#8211;word dependencies arising from lexicalized rule instantiations.
    The feature set is derived from the gold-standard normal-form derivations in CCGbank.
    For the dependency model, features are defined over dependency structures as well as derivations, and the feature set is derived from all derivations leading to gold-standard dependency structures, including nonstandard derivations.
    Section 7 describes the feature types in more detail.
    For the dependency model, the training data consists of gold-standard dependenc
