rser encounters an unknown word, the first-best tag delivered by Ratnaparkhi&#8217;s (1996) tagger is used.
    As it happens, the tag dictionary built up when training contains entries for every word observed, even low-frequency words.
    This means that during decoding, the output of the tagger is used only for those words that are truly unknown, that is, that were never observed in training.
    For all other words, the chart is seeded with a separate item for each tag observed with that word in training.
  
  
    In this section we present the results of effectively doing a &#8220;clean-room&#8221; implementation of Collins&#8217; parsing model, that is, using only information available in (Collins 1997, 1999), as shown in Table 4.
    The clean-room model has a 10.6% increase in F-measure error compared to Collins&#8217; parser and an 11.0% increase in F-measure error compared to our engine in its complete emulation of Collins&#8217; Model 2.
    This is comparable to the increase in error seen when re
