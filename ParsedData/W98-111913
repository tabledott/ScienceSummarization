uded from computing the precision: We performed a ten-way cross-validation where we reserved 10% of the corpus for testing and used the remaining 90% for training.
    Our preliminary results are shown in the last line of Table 1.
    We are also interested in finding the relative importance of each probability (i.e. each of the four factors in equation (8) in pronoun resolution.
    To this end, we ran the program &amp;quot;incrementally&amp;quot;, each time incorporating one more probability.
    The results are shown in Table 1 (all obtained from cross-validation).
    The last column of Table 1 contains the p-values for testing the statistical significance of each improvement.
    Due to relatively large differences between Tree-bank parse trees and Hobbs' trees, our Hobbs' implementation does not yield as high an accuracy as it would have if we had had perfect Hobbs' tree representations.
    Since the Hobbs' algorithm serves as the base of our scheme, we expect the accuracy to be much higher with more a
