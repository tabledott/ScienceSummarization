3n0un2 A(Class, I nouni, prep) to make disambiguation decisions.
    The third approach (Brill and Resnik 1994; Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos 1994; Collins and Brooks 1995) receives quadruples (verb, nouni, prep, noun2) and labels indicating which way the PP-attachment goes, like those in Table 11, and learns a disambiguation rule for resolving PP-attachment ambiguities.
    For example, Brill and Resnik, (1994) propose a method they call transformation-based error-driven learning (see also Brill [1995]).
    Their method first learns IF-THEN type rules, where the IF parts represent conditions like (prep is with) and (verb is see), and the THEN parts represent transformations from (attach to verb) to (attach to nouni), or vice versa.
    The first rule is always a default decision, and all the other rules indicate transformations (changes of attachment sites) subject to various IF conditions.
    We note that, for the disambiguation problem, the first two approaches are basically unsupervised learning metho
