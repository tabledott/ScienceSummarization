occurrences of a knowledge in the wordspecific corpus.
    Based on this high conditional probability, the system will use the template for a knowledge of to keep it from being marked as an error.
    Other function words and tags in the +1 position have much lower conditional probability, so for example, a knowledge is will not be treated as an exception to the error.
    TOEFL essays are graded on a 6 point scale, where 6 demonstrates &amp;quot;clear competence&amp;quot; in writing on rhetorical and syntactic levels and 1 demonstrates &amp;quot;incompetence in writing&amp;quot;.

    For each score value, all 50 essays were concatenated to form a super-essay.
    In every super-essay, for each adjacent pair and triple of tags containing
