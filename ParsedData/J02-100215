nalize false positives that fall within k sentences of a true boundary.
    Notation is as in Figure 2. algorithm has made at least one false negative (missing boundary) error, but it is not penalized for this error under Pk.
    The size of the segment plays a role in the amount that a false positive within the segment or a false negative at its boundary is penalized.
    Let us consider false negatives (missing boundaries) first.
    As seen above, with average size segments, the penalty for a false negative is k. For larger segments, it remains at k&#8212;it cannot be any larger than that, since for a given position i there can be at most k intervals of length k that include that position.
    As segment size gets smaller, however, the false negative penalty changes.
    Suppose we have two segments, A and B, and the algorithm misses the boundary between them.
    Then the algorithm will be penalized k times if Size(A)+ Size(B) &gt; 2k, that is, as long as each segment is about half the average size or lar
