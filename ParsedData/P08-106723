-best reranking with local features achieves an even higher F-score of 91.28, and we suspect this is due to the aggressive updates and instability of the perceptron, as we do observe the learning curves to be non-monotonic.
    We leave the use of more stable learning algorithms to future work. best-performing systems on the whole Section 23.
    Types D, G, and S denote discriminative, generative, and semi-supervised approaches, respectively.
    McClosky et al. (2006) achieved an even higher accuarcy (92.1) by leveraging on much larger unlabelled data.
    Moreover, their technique is orthogonal to ours, and we suspect that replacing their n-best reranker by our forest reranker might get an even better performance.
    Plus, except for n-best reranking, most discriminative methods require repeated parsing of the training set, which is generally impratical (Petrov and Klein, 2008).
    Therefore, previous work often resorts to extremely short sentences (&lt; 15 words) or only looked at local features (Taskar
