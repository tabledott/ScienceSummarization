			Maximum spanning tree dependency based parsers decomposes a dependency structure into parts known as ?factors?.
			The factors of the first order maximum spanning tree parsing algorithm are edges consisting of the head, the dependent (child) and the edge label.
			This algorithm has a quadratic complexity.
			The second order parsing algorithm of McDonald and Pereira (2006) uses aseparate algorithm for edge labeling.
			This algo rithm uses in addition to the first order factors: theedges to those children which are closest to the de pendent.
			The second order algorithm of Carreras (2007) uses in addition to McDonald and Pereira (2006) the child of the dependent occurring in the sentence between the head and the dependent, and the an edge to a grandchild.
			The edge labeling is an integral part of the algorithm which requires an additional loop over the labels.
			This algorithm therefore has a complexity of O(n4).
