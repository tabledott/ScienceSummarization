 in ValTrees on the basis of a metric that assigns higher weights to the trees that are more skewed to the right are used by the rethoncal parser are discussed at length in (Marcu, 1997a, Marcu, 1997b) When the rhetorical parser takes text (I) as input, it produces the RS-tree in figure 2 The convention that we use is that nuclei are surrounded by solid boxes and satellites by dotted boxes, the links between a node and a subordinate nucleus or nuclei are represented by solid arrows, and the links between a node and a subordinate satellite by dotted Imes The nodes with only one satellite denote occurrences of parenthetical information for example, textual unit 2 is labeled as parenthetical to the textual unit that results from juxtaposing 1 and 3 The numbers associated with each leaf correspond to the numencal labels in text (1) The numbers associated with each internal node correspond to the salient units of that node and are explicitly represented in the RS-tree By inspecting the RS-tree in figure 2, one can
