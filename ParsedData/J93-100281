 correct analyses of other examples.
    However, considerably more data will be required before we can decide whether this trend is robust enough to provide the basis for automatic identification of false positives.
    Using a manually disambiguated training corpus and manually tuned grammar appears feasible with the definitions sublanguage.
    Results comparable to those obtained by Fujisaki et al. (1989) and Sharman, Jelinek, and Mercer (1990) are possible on the basis of a quite modest amount of manual effort and a very much smaller training corpus, because the parse histories contain little 'noise' and usefully reflect the semantically and pragmatically appropriate analysis in the training corpus, and because the number of failures of coverage were reduced to some extent by adding the rules specifically motivated by the training corpus.
    Unlike Fujisalci et al. or Sharman, Jelinek, and Mercer, we did not integrate information about lexemes into the rule probabilities or make use of lexical syntactic
