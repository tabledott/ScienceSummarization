ignature are based only on suffix frequencies of the stems that appear with exactly the same set of suffixes in the corpus.
    It is that modeling assumption that needs to be dropped, and replaced by a multinomial-based frequency prediction based on counts over the 2n &#8212; 1 signatures belonging to each paradigm of length n. 2.
    Identifying paradigms from signatures.
    We would like to automatically identify NULLed.ing as a subcase of the more general NULL.ed.ing.s.
    This is a difficult task to accomplish well, as English illustrates, for we would like to be able to determine that NULL.s is primarily a subcase of 's.NULL.s, and not of (e.g.)
    NULLed.s.'
    3.
    Determining the relationship between prefixation and suffixation.
    The system currently assumes that prefixes are to be stripped off the stem that has already been identified by suffix stripping.
    In future work, we would like to see alternative hypotheses regarding the relationship of prefixation and suffixation tested by the M
