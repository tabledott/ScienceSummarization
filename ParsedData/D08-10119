ition probabilities Following Och and Ney (2003), we use a fixed value p0 for the probability of jumping to a null state, which can be optimized on held-out data, and the overall distortion model becomes As suggested by Liang et al. (2006), we can group the distortion parameters {c(d)}, d= i - i', into a few buckets.
    In our implementation, 11 buckets are used for c(&#8804;-4), c(-3), ... c(0), ..., c(5), c(&#8805;6).
    The probability mass for transitions with jump distance larger than 6 and less than -4 is uniformly divided.
    By doing this, only a handful of c(d) parameters need to be estimated.
    Although it is possible to estimate them using the EM algorithm on a small development set, we found that a particularly simple model, described below, works surprisingly well in our experiments.
    Since both the backbone and the hypothesis are in the same language, It seems intuitive that the distortion model should favor monotonic alignment and only allow non-monotonic alignment with a certain penalt
