uld generalize over the set to minimize sparse data problems.
    We will refer to these as the SubjNoun features.
    Wiebe, Bruce, &amp; O&#8217;Hara (1999) developed a machine learning system to classify subjective sentences.
    We experimented with the features that they used, both to compare their results to ours and to see if we could benefit from their features.
    We will refer to these as the WBO features.
    WBO includes a set of stems positively correlated with the subjective training examples (subjStems) and a set of stems positively correlated with the objective training examples (objStems).
    We defined a three-valued feature for the presence of 0, 1, or &gt; 2 members of subjStems in a sentence, and likewise for objStems.
    For our experiments, subjStems includes stems that appear &gt; 7 times in the training set, and for which the precision is 1.25 times the baseline word precision for that training set. objStems contains the stems that appear &gt; 7 times and for which at least 50% of
