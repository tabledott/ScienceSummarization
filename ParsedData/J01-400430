_MATCH.
    The performance of ONE_WRD is the worst.
    HD_WRD offers better recall compared to STR_MATCH, but poorer precision.
    However, its F-measure is comparable to that of STR_MATCH.
    The score of the coreference system at the University of Massachusetts (RESOLVE), which uses C4.5 for coreference resolution, is shown in Table 3.
    RESOLVE is shown because among the MUC-6 systems, it is the only machine learning&#8212;based system that we can directly compare to.
    The other MUC-6 systems were not based on a learning approach.
    Also, none of the systems in MUC-7 adopted a learning approach to coreference resolution (Chinchor 1998).
    RESOLVE's score is not high compared to scores attained by the rest of the MUC6 systems.
    In particular, the system's recall is relatively low.
    Our system's score is higher than that of RESOLVE, and the difference is statistically significant.
    The RESOLVE system is described in three papers: McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), Fisher et al. (1995), and Mc
