    We have build a baseNP recognizer by training a machine learning algorithm with correct tagged data and testing it with unseen data.
    The machine learning algorithm we used was a MemoryBased Learning algorithm (MBL).
    During training it stores a symbolic feature representation of a word in the training data together with its classification (chunk tag).
    In the testing phase the algorithm compares a feature representation of a test word with every training data item and chooses the classification of the training item which is closest to the test item.
    In the version of the algorithm that we have used, is 1-IG, the distances between feature representations are computed as the weighted sum of distances between individual features (Daelemans et al., 1998).
    Equal features are defined to have distance 0, while the distance between other pairs is some feature-dependent value.
    This value is equal to the information gain of the feature, an informat
