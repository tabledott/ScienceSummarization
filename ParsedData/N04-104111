rmation is biased towards infrequent elements/features.
    We therefore multiply mief with the following discounting factor: n m where n is the number of words and N = cef &#215; By averaging the feature vectors of the committee members of a particular semantic class, we obtain a grammatical template, or signature, for that class.
    For example, Figure 1 shows an excerpt of the grammatical signature for concept (B) in Section 1.
    The vector is obtained by averaging the feature vectors for the words Curtis Joseph, John Vanbiesbrouck, Mike Richter, and Tommy Salo (the committee of this concept).
    The &amp;quot;-V:subj:N:sprawl&#65533; feature indicates a subject-verb relationship between the concept and the verb sprawl while &amp;quot;N:appo:N:goaltender&amp;quot; indicates an apposition relationship between the concept and the noun goaltender.
    The (-) in a relationship means that the right hand side of the relationship is the head (e.g. sprawl is the head of the subject-verb relationship).
