			It is not supervising: our experiments show that using the entity-related information gives a large performance improvement.
			735 and tree kernel-based methods well complement each other and the composite kernel can effectively inte grate both flat and structured features.
			To our knowledge, this is the first research to dem onstrate that, without extensive feature engineer ing, an individual tree kernel can achieve much better performance than the state-of-the-art linear kernel in re lation extraction.
			This shows the great potential of structured parse tree information for relation extrac tion and our tree kernel takes a big stride towards the right direction.
			For the future work, we will focus on improving the context-sensitive convolution tree kernel by ex ploring more useful context inform
