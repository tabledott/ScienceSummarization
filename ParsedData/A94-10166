    (In rows 1 through 7, the array has not yet been operated on, so it still shows its initial state.)
    After processing (see rows 9 through 22), each element is the score for the best set of components covering the input from word i to word j (the best cover for this substring)2.
    (Only a truncated score is shown for each element in the figure, for readability.
    There is also a list of best components associated with each element.)
    The array is upper triangular since the starting position of a component i must be less than or equal to its ending position j.
    For any position, the score is calculated based on a combination of scores in the row to its left and in the column below it, versus the previous contents of the array cell for it
