    OntoNotes coreference distinguishes between identity coreference and appositive coreference, treating the latter separately because it is already captured explicitly by other layers of the OntoNotes annotation.
    Thus we evaluated systems only on the identity coreference task, which links all categories of entities and events together into equivalent classes.
    The situation with mentions for OntoNotes is also different than it was for MUC or ACE.
    OntoNotes data does not explicitly identify the minimum extents of an entity mention, but it does include handtagged syntactic parses.
    Thus for the official evaluation, we decided to use the exact spans of mentions for determining correctness.
    The NP boundaries for the test data were pre-extracted from the handtagged Treebank for annotation, and events triggered by verb phrases were tagged using the verbs themselves.
    This choice means that scores for the CoNLL-2011 coreference task are likely to be lower than for coref evaluations b
