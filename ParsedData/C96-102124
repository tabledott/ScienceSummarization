e discourse referents are members of the same COP, Et ~' class.
			Their unification into a single class indicates both successful anaphora resolution (of the pronoun at offset 103), as well as the operation of higherqevel discourse processing designed to identify all references to a particular COREF class, not just the anaphoric ones (cf.
			(Kennedy and Boguraev, :1996)).
			The higher salience of the optimal candidate--which ix also a member of this COREF class--shows the effect of the locality heuristic described in section 2.2.3.
			Both the pronoun and the candidate appear in the same sub- ordinate context (within a relative clause); as a result the salience of the candidate (but not of the class to which it bekmgs) is temporarily boosted to negate the effect of subordinatkm.
