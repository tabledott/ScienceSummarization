  7 Discuss ion Morphological analysis is an important practical prob- lem with potential apl)lication in many areas including kana-to-kanji conversion 7, speech recognition, charac- ter recognition, speech synthesis, text revision support, information retrieval, and machine translation.
  Most conventional Japanese morphological nalyzers use rule-based heuristic searches.
  They usually use a connectivity rnatrix (part-of-sl)eech-pair grammar) ,as the language model.
  To rank the morphological nal- ysis hypotheses, they usually use heuristics uch as Longest Match Method or Least Bunsetsus Number Method [16].
  There are some statistically-based approaches to Japanese morphological nalysis.
  The tagging models previously used are either part of speech I)igram [9, 14] or Character-based IIMM [12].
  Both hemistic-based and statistically-based ap- proaches use t.he Minimum Connective-Cost Method [7], which is a linear time dynamic programming algo- rithm that finds the morphological
