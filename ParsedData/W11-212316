(including that of other features), they can be recombined and thereafter efficiently handled as a single packed hypothesis.
    If there are too many distinct states, the decoder prunes low-scoring partial hypotheses, possibly leading to a search error.
    Therefore, we want state to encode the minimum amount of information necessary to properly compute language model scores, so that the decoder will be faster and make fewer search errors.
    We offer a state function s(wn1) = wn&#65533; where substring wn&#65533; is guaranteed to extend (to the right) in the same way that wn1 does for purposes of language modeling.
    The state function is integrated into the query process so that, in lieu of the query p(wnjwn&#8722;1 1 ), the application issues query p(wnjs(wn&#8722;1 1 )) which also returns s(wn1 ).
    The returned state s(wn1) may then be used in a followon query p(wn+1js(wn1)) that extends the previous query by one word.
    These make left-to-right query patterns convenient, as the application need
