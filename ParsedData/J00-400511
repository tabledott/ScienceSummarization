tions may be incompatible with the definition of coreference but no reason is given for these incompatibilities and no intuitive motivation for the relation IDENT is offered.
    As a result, the annotator is left with a long series of instructions that fail to be held together by a common rationale.
    Remedy.
    Go back to basics: start from a definition of coreference and write a TD that implements the definition.
    We suggest that it is not until this has been done successfully that extensions into the area of bound anaphora become a risk worth taking.
    Problems posed to coreference annotation by intensionality (Hirschman et al. 1997) have motivated considerable complications in the TD.
    Consider Section 6.4, which discusses the implications of &amp;quot;change over time.&amp;quot; The TD says that &amp;quot;two rnarkables should be recorded as coreferential if the text asserts them to be coreferential at ANY TIME&amp;quot; (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997, page 11).
