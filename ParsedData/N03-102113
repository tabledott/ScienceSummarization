 over values, where n is the length of the longest component of the input multitext.
    We still have 3 nonterminal labels per dimension per inference.
    Also, each inference now needs to compute an RTV at a cost inputs of &#177; must have no overlapping intervals, or else the output is undefined.
    A.C: (C (G)). the time complexity of Parser A in (C (G) For a binarized which also needs to keep track of two lexical heads per dimension per inference, this complexity rises to (G)13D Parser B is a generalization of Parser R2B for biof arbitrary rank.
    It decomposes inference rule A.0 into ID and LP subrules, using generalized hooks that carry an RTV.
    The decomposition can happen in one of two ways, depending on the heir's role (1 or 2) in the DLV.
    X[h] Y[g]) Z [h] 0 \Z [h] + X[h] Z [II]) 0 X[h](v)[v + The rules in Section 3.2 are simple examples of B.ID1 and B.LP1.
    Parser B is faster than Parser A, but takes more space.
    The hooks of Parser B must keep track of one more nonterminal label p
