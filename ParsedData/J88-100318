the category in question), and by 1/8 for p &lt; 0.01, VOLSUNGA uses the RTP value itself as a factor in the equation which defines probability.
    Fourth, VOLSUNGA uses no tag triples and no idioms.
    Because of this, manually constructing specialcase lists is not necessary.
    These methods are useful in certain cases, as the accuracy figures for CLAWS show; but the goal here was to measure the accuracy of a wholly algorithmic tagger on a standard corpus.
  
  
    Brown University and the Summer Institute of Linguistics, 7500 W. Camp Wisdom Road, Dallas, TX 75236 Several algorithms have been developed in the past that attempt to resolve categorial ambiguities in natural language text without recourse to syntactic or semantic level information.
    An innovative method (called &amp;quot;CLAWS&amp;quot;) was recently developed by those working with the Lancaster &#8212;Oslo/Bergen Corpus of British English.
    This algorithm uses a systematic calculation based upon the probabilities of co-occurrence of
