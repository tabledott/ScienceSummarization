    We are also focusing on other potential applications, including chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003), named entity recognition (Florian et al., 2004; Ando and Zhang, 2005b; Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2006), and speaker adaptation (Kuhn et al., 1998).
    Finally, we are investigating more direct ways of applying structural correspondence learning when we have labeled data from both source and target domains.
    In particular, the labeled data of both domains, not just the unlabeled data, should influence the learned representations.
  
  
    We thank Rie Kubota Ando and Tong Zhang for their helpful advice on ASO, Steve Carroll and Pete White of The Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia for providing the MEDLINE data, and the PennBioIE annotation team for the annotated MEDLINE data used in our test sets.
