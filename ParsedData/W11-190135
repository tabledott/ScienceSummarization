t the more frequent verbs tend to be polysemous.
    Table 9 gives the distribution of number of framesets per lemma in the PropBank layer of the OntoNotes 4.0 data.
    During automatic processing of the data, we tagged all the tokens that were tagged with a part of speech VBx.
    This means that there would be cases where the wrong token would be tagged with propositions.
    The CoNLL-2005 scorer was used to generate the scores.
    Named Entities BBN&#8217;s IdentiFinderTMsystem was used to predict the named entities.
    Given the 15The number of lemmas in Table 9 do not add up to this number because not all of them have examples in the training data, where the total number of instantiated senses amounts to 4229. time constraints, we could not re-train it on the OntoNotes data and so an existing, pre-trained model was used, therefore the results are not a good indicator of the model&#8217;s best performance.
    The pre-trained model had also used a somewhat different catalog of name types, which did no
