ons are the least frequent of the four senses, making up only 19% of the explicit relations, more than half of the errors involve the Temporal class.
    By far the most commonly confused pairing was Contingency relations being classified as Temporal relations, making up 29% of our errors.
    A random example of each of the most common types of errors is given below.
    Examples (6) and (7) show the relatively rare scenario when and does not signal expansion, and Example (8) shows but indicating a sense besides comparison.
    In these cases where the connective itself is not helpful in classifying the sense of the relation, it may be useful to incorporate features that were developed for classifying implicit relations (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008).
  
  
    We have shown that using a few syntactic features leads to state-of-the-art accuracy for discourse vs. non-discourse usage classification.
    Including syntactic features also helps sense class identification, and we have already attained results a
