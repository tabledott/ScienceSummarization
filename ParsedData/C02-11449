c.
			However, one can dramatically reduce the running time by taking advantage of the fact that the feature vector is sparse.
			By indexing the features, one can retrieve the set of elements that have a given feature.
			To compute the top similar words of a word w, we first sort w?s features according to their mutual information with w. We only compute pairwise similarities between w and the words that share a high mutual information feature with w. 4.2.
			Phase II: Find committees.
			The second phase of the clustering algorithm recursively finds tight clusters scattered in the similarity space.
			In each recursive step, the algorithm finds a set of tight clusters, called committees, and identifies residue elements that are not covered by any committee.
			We say a committee covers an element if the element?s similarity to the centroid of the committee exceeds some high similarity threshold.
			The algorithm then recursively attempts to find more committees among the residue elements.
