    However, paragraph 19 begins with an introductory phrase type that strongly signals a change in subtopic: For the last two centuries, astronomers have studied....
    The final paragraph is a summary of the entire text; the algorithm recognizes the change in terminology from the preceding paragraphs and marks a boundary, but only two of the readers chose to differentiate the summary; for this reason the algorithm is judged to have made an error even though this sectioning decision is reasonable.
    This illustrates the inherent fallibility of testing against reader judgments, although in part this is because the judges were given loose constraints.
    To assess the results of the algorithm quantitatively, I follow the advice of Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992a), and compare the algorithm against both upper and lower bounds.
    The upper bound in this case is the reader judgment data.
