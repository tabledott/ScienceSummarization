ives for the remaining relations which involve these translations.
    In addition we update the observed probabilities for the remaining relations, and consequently the remaining Ba's.
    This procedure is repeated until all target words have been determined or the maximal Ba is below the threshold.
    The actual parameters we have used so far were a = 0.05 and the bound for Bawas &#8212;0.5.
    To illustrate the selection algorithm, we give the details for example (6).
    The highest bound for the odds ratio (Ba = 1.36) was received for the relation 'increase-chance', thus selecting the translation 'increase' for `H-increase'.
    The second was Ba = 0.96, for 'achieve-progress'.
    This selected the translations 'achieve' and 'progress', while eliminating the other senses of 'YE-progress' in the remaining relations.
    Then, for the relation 'progress-in-talks' we got Bar = 0.3, thus selecting the appropriate translation for `H-talks'.
