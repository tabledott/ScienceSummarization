cal entry for a declarative transitive verb was chosen.
    Attachment errors of commas are also significant.
    It should be noted that commas were ignored in the evaluation of CFG parsers.
    We did not eliminate punctuation from the evaluation because punctuation sometimes contributes to semantics, as in coordination and insertion.
    In this error analysis, errors of commas representing coordination/insertion are classified into &#8220;coordination/insertion,&#8221; and &#8220;comma&#8221; indicates errors that do not contribute to the computation of semantics.
    Errors of noun phrase identification mean that a noun phrase was split into two phrases.
    These errors were mainly caused by the indirect effects of other errors.
    Errors of identifying coordination/insertion structures sometimes resulted in catastrophic analyses.
    While accurate analysis of such constructions is indispensable, it is also known to be difficult because disambiguation of coordination/insertion requires the computation
