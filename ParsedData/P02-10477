s do not enable us to reliably infer from sentence 1.a that &#8220;cannot buy arms legally(libya)&#8221; and do not give us access to general purpose knowledge bases that assert that &#8220;similar(libya,rwanda)&#8221;.
    The approach we advocate in this paper is in some respects less ambitious than current approaches to discourse relations because it relies upon a much smaller set of relations than those used by Mann and Thompson (1988) or Martin (1992).
    In our work, we decide to focus only on four types of relations, which we call: CONTRAST, CAUSE-EXPLANATIONEVIDENCE (CEV), CONDITION, and ELABORATION.
    (We define these relations in Section 2.2.)
    In other respects though, our approach is more ambitious because it focuses on the problem of recognizing such discourse relations in unrestricted texts.
    In other words, given as input sentence pairs such as those shown in (1)&#8211;(2), we develop techniques and programs that label the relations that hold between these sentence pairs as CONTRAST, C
