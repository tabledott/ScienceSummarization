ach other, but also that they are themselves homogeneous by accounting for intra-partition node similarity.
    We formulate this requirement in the framework of normalized cuts (Shi and Malik, 2000), where the cut value is normalized by the volume of the corresponding partitions.
    The volume of the partition is the sum of its edges to the whole graph: The normalized cut criterion (Ncut) is then defined as follows: By minimizing this objective we simultaneously minimize the similarity across partitions and maximize the similarity within partitions.
    This formulation also allows us to decompose the objective into a sum of individual terms, and formulate a dynamic programming solution to the multiway cut problem.
    This criterion is naturally extended to a k-way normalized cut: where A1 ... Ak form a partition of the graph, and V &#8722;Ak is the set difference between the entire graph and partition k. C [i, k] is the normalized cut value of the optimal segmentation of the first k sentences into i segme
