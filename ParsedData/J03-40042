    Although the preferences perform well in comparison with other unsupervised WSD systems on the same corpus, the results show that for many applications, further knowledge sources would be required to achieve an adequate level of accuracy and coverage.
    In addition to quantifying performance, we analyze the results to investigate the situations in which the selectional preferences achieve the best precision and in which the one-sense-per-discourse heuristic increases performance.
  
  
    Although selectional preferences are a possible knowledge source in an automatic word sense disambiguation (WDS) system, they are not a panacea.
    One problem is coverage: Most previous work has focused on acquiring selectional preferences for verbs and applying them to disambiguate nouns occurring at subject and direct object slots (Ribas 1995; McCarthy 1997; Abney and Light 1999; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000; Stevenson and Wilks 2001).
