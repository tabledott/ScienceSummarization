Common Lisp and Allegro Common Lisp.
  A PC version with the same functionality runs under mu- Lisp on ordinary XT/AT machines.
  CGP takes two inputs, a constraint file with set declarations, mapping statements, context-depend- ent disambiguation constraints, syntactic con- straints, etc., and a text file with morphologically analyzed word-forms (cf.
  The optimal implementation of constraint grammar parsing would be in terms of finite-state machines (cf.

  Discussion The CG formalism has so far been extensively applied only to English context-dependent disam- biguation and syntax.
  Presently some 400 context-dependent disam- biguation constraints have been formulated for Eng- lish by Atro Voutilainen, Juha Heikkil~, and Arto Anttila.
  These constraints prune 95-97 % of all mor- phological ambiguities in running English text, de- pending upon the complexity of the text.
  This level (which is not linal as work on the most recalcitrant problems proceeds) has
