lish sentence) for derivation d, and the last two terms are derivation and translation length penalties, respectively.
    The conditional probability P(d  |T) decomposes into the product of rule probabilities: where the first three are conditional probabilities based on fractional counts of rules defined in Section 3.3, and the last two are lexical probabilities.
    These parameters Al ... As are tuned by minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) on the dev sets.
    We refer readers to Mi et al. (2008) for details of the decoding algorithm.
    We use the Chinese parser of Xiong et al. (2005) to parse the source side of the bitext.
    Following Huang (2008), we also modify this parser to output a packed forest for each sentence, which can be pruned by the marginal probability-based insideoutside algorithm (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Huang, 2008).
    We will first report results trained on a small-scaled dataset with detailed analysis, and then scale to a larger one, where we also combine the technique of
