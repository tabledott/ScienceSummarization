wo more effective classifiers, and the accuracy values of the component English and Chinese classifiers are 0.775 and 0.790, respectively, which are higher than the corresponding TSVM classifiers.
    Overall, the use of transductive learning and the combination of English and Chinese views are beneficial to the final classification accuracy, and the cotraining approach is more suitable for making use of the unlabeled Chinese reviews than the transductive SVM.
    Figure 3 shows the accuracy curve of the cotraining approach (Combined Classifier) with different numbers of iterations.
    The iteration number I is varied from 1 to 80.
    When I is set to 1, the co-training approach is degenerated into SVM(ENCN2).
    The accuracy curves of the component English and Chinese classifiers learned in the co-training approach are also shown in the figure.
    We can see that the proposed co-training approach can outperform the best baselineTSVM(ENCN2) after 20 iterations.
    After a large number of iterations, the
