Net.The results are summarized in Table 2.
			These num bers differ slightly from previously reported scores due tovariations in the exact experimental setup, WordNet ver sion, and the method of breaking ties when computing?
			(here we break ties using the product-moment formu lation of Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient).
			It is worth noting that in their experiments, (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) report that the Vector method has rank correlation coefficients of .91 and .90 for MC and RG, respectively, which are also top performing values.
			In our experiments, the MarkovLink model with ZKLdistance measure was the best performing model over all.
			MarkovGloss and MarkovJoined were also strong contenders but with the cosine measure instead of ZKL.One reason for this distinction is that the stationary distributions resulting from the MarkovLink model are non zero for all but the initial word nodes (i.e. non-zero for all Synset nodes).
			Consequently, ZKL?s re-estimate for the zero terms adds litt
