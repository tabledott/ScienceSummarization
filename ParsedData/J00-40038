    The predicate used in an anaphoric definite description may be a synonym of the predicate used for the antecedent (a house .
    .
    . the home), a generalization /hypernym (an oak.. . the tree), and even, sometimes, a specialization/hyponym (a tree.. . the oak).

    We will use the term direct anaphora when both description and antecedent have the same head noun, as in a house.
    . the house.
    Direct anaphors are the easiest definite descriptions for a shallow system to resolve; in all other cases, as well as whe
