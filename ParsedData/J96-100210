a stochastic model that accurately represents the behavior of the random process.
    Such a model is a method of estimating the conditional probability that, given a context x, the process will output y.
    We will denote by p(yjx) the probability that the model assigns to y in context x.
    With a slight abuse of notation, we will also use p(y1x) to denote the entire conditional probability distribution provided by the model, with the interpretation that y and x are placeholders rather than specific instantiations.
    The proper interpretation should be clear from the context.
    We will denote by P the set of all conditional probability distributions.
    Thus a model p(y1x) is, by definition, just an element of P. To study the process, we observe the behavior of the random process for some time, collecting a large number of samples (xi, Yl), (x2, y2),.
    , (xN, yN).
    In the example we have been considering, each sample would consist of a phrase x containing the words surrounding in, together with
