tely following utterance.
    Thus, given an adequate ordering of the discourse entities in Cf, the costs of computations necessary to establish local coherence are minimized.
    Given that the ordering on the Cf list is crucial for determining the Cb, it is no surprise that there has been much discussion among researchers about the ranking criteria appropriate for different languages.
    In fact, Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994) hypothesize that the Cf ranking criteria are the only language-dependent factors within the centering model.
    Though evidence for many additional criteria for the Cf ranking have been brought forward in the literature, to some extent consensus has emerged that grammatical roles play a major role in making ranking decisions (e.g., whether the referential expression appears as the grammatical subject, direct object, or indirect object of an utterance).
    Our own work on the centering model' (Strube and Hahn 1996; Hahn and Strube 1996) brings in evidence from German, a free-word-ord
