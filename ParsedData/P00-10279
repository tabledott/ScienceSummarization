cus more attention on the extrema).
    The histogram is then smoothed and normalized as an approximation of the probability density function for this estimator ( g ( vvBBD ) ) which we can then use to quantify to what extent a given candidate log( ) such as /og(sang/sing)=.17, fits our empirically motivated expectations.
    The relative position of the candidate pairings on the graph suggests that this estimator is indeed informative given the task of ranking potential root-inflection pairings.
    However, estimating these distributions presents a problem given that the true alignments (and hence frequency ratios) between inflections The third alignment similarity function considers overall stem edit distance using a weighted Levenshtein measure.
    In morphological systems worldwide, vowels and vowel clusters are relatively mutable through morphological processes, while consonants generally tend to have a lower probability of change during inflection.
    Rather than treating all string edits as equal, a
