ed with at most p final output strings at each final state.
    Figure 2 gives an example of a 2-subsequential transducer.
    Here, the input string w = aa gives two distinct outputs aaa and aab.
    Since one cannot find any reasonable case in language in which the number of ambiguities would be infinite, p-subsequential transducers seem to be sufficient for describing linguistic ambiguities.
    However, the number of ambiguities could be very large in some cases.
    Notice that 1-subsequential transducers are exactly the subsequential transducers.
    Transducers can be considered to represent mappings from strings to strings.
    As such, they admit the composition operation defined for mappings, a useful operation that allows the construction of more complex transducers from simpler ones.
    The result of the application of T2 o Ti to a string s can be computed by first considering all output strings associated with the input s in the transducer Ti, then applying T2 to all of these strings.
