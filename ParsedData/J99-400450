lity equals the sum of the probabilities of all derivations using the given item.
    Formally, letting P(D) represent the probability of a particular derivation, and C(D, [i, X, j]) represent the number of occurrences of item [i, X, j] in derivation D (which for some parsers could be more than one if X were part of a loop), The reverse values in general have an analogous meaning.
    Let C(D, x) represent the number of occurrences (the count) of item x in item derivation tree D. Then, for an item x, the reverse value Z(x) should have the property Notice that we have multiplied an element of the semiring, V(D), by an integer, C(D, x).
    This multiplication is meant to indicate repeated addition, using the additive operator of the semiring.
    Thus, for instance, in the Viterbi semiring, multiplying by a count other than 0 has no effect, since x x = max(x, x) = x, while in the inside semiring, it corresponds to actual multiplication.
    This value represents the sum of the values of all derivation trees th
