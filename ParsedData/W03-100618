 this section, we are concerned with the problem of finding semantic arguments and labeling them with their correct semantic role given raw text as input.
    In order to perform this task, we parse this raw text using a combination of supertagging and LDA, which is a method that yields partial dependency parses annotated with TAG structures.
    We perform this task using both SEM-TAG and SYNT-TAG.
    For the former, after supertagging and LDA, the task is accomplished because the TAG structures are already annotated with semantic role information.
    For the latter, we use the best performing model from Section 6 in order to find semantic roles given syntactic features from the parse.
    Supertagging (Bangalore and Joshi (1999)) is the task of assigning a single supertag to each word given raw text as input.
    For example, given the sentence Prices are falling, a supertagger might return the supertagged sentence in Figure 4.
    Supertagging returns an almost-parse in the sense that it is performing mu
