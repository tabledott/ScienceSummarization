  Section 4 provides more details on graph construction.
    We consider the problem of partitioning the graph into two disjoint sets of nodes A and B.
    We aim to minimize the cut, which is defined to be the sum of the crossing edges between the two sets of nodes.
    In other words, we want to split the sentences into two maximally dissimilar classes by choosing A and B to minimize: Decoding Papadimitriou proved that the problem of minimizing normalized cuts on graphs is NP-complete (Shi and Malik, 2000).
    However, in our case, the multi-way cut is constrained to preserve the linearity of the segmentation.
    By segmentation linearity, we mean that all of the nodes between the leftmost and the rightmost nodes of a particular partition have to belong to that partition.
    With this constraint, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm for exactly finding the minimum normalized multiway cut in polynomial time: However, we need to ensure that the two partitions are not only maximally different from e
