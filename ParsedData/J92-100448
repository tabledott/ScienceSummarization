 two tasks represent very different sentence types.
    For instance, the overwhelming majority of the TIMIT sentences are statements, whereas the RM task is made up exclusively of questions and requests.
    The process of conversion to a new grammar involves parsing the new sentences one by one, and adding context-free rules whenever a parse fails.
    The person entering the rules must be very familiar with the grammar structure, but for the most part it is straightforward to identify and incrementally add missing rules.
    The parser identifies where in the sentence it fails, and also maintains a record of the successful partial parses.
    These pieces of information usually are adequate to pinpoint the problem.
    Once the grammar has been expanded to accomodate the new set of sentences, a subset grammar can be created automatically that only contains rules needed in the new domain, eliminating any rules that were particular to the original domain.
