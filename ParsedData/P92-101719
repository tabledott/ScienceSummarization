ed by a noun, a grammar inferred from raw text will tend to bracket the noun with the punctuation mark.
    This experiment illustrates the fact that although SCFGs provide a hierarchical model of the language, that structure is undetermined by raw text and only by chance will the inferred grammar agree with qualitative linguistic judgments of sentence structure.
    This problem has also been previously observed with linguistic structure inference methods based on mutual information.
    Magerman and Marcus (1990) addressed the problem by specifying a predetermined list of pairs of parts of speech (such as verb-preposition, pronoun-verb) that can never be embraced by a low-level constituent.
    However, these constraints are stipulated in advance rather than being automatically derived from the training material, in contrast with what we have shown to be possible with the insideoutside algorithm for partially bracketed corpora.
  
  
    We have introduced a modification of the wellknown inside-outside algo
