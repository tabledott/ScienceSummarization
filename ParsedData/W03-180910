articipant was presented with 40 sets of 5 sentences, where each of the five sentences contained a particular VPC.
    The VPC in question was indicated at the top of the screen, and they were asked two questions: (1) whether the VPC implies the verb, and (2) whether the VPC implies the particle.
    If the VPC was round up, e.g., the subject would be asked &#8220;Does round up imply round?&#8221; and &#8220;Does round up imply up?&#8221;, respectively.
    They were given the option of three responses: &#8220;Yes&#8221;, &#8220;No&#8221; or &#8220;Don&#8217;t Know&#8221;.
    Once they had indicated their answer and pressed next, they advanced to the next VPC and set of 5 sentences.
    They were unable to move on until a choice had been indicated.
    As with any corpus-based approach to lexical semantics, our study of VPCs is hampered by polysemy, e.g. carry outTRANSin the execute and transport out (from a location) senses.'
    Rather than intervene to customise example sentences to a prescribed sense, we
