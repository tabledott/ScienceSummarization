  Forest Reranking: Discriminative Parsing with Non-Local Features
  
    reranking techniques ofsuffer from the limited scope of the best list, which rules out many potentially alternatives.
    We instead propose a method that reranks a packed forest of exponentially many parses.
    Since exact inference is intractable with non-local features, we present an approximate algorithm inspired by forest rescoring that makes discriminative training practical over the whole Treebank.
    Our final result, an F-score of 91.7, outperforms both 50-best and 100-best reranking baselines, and is better than any previously reported systems trained on the Treebank.
  
  
    Discriminative reranking has become a popular technique for many NLP problems, in particular, parsing (Collins, 2000) and machine translation (Shen et al., 2005).
    Typically, this method first generates a list of top-n candidates from a baseline system, and then reranks this n-best list with arbitrary features that are not computable or intractabl
