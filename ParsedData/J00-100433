hich the number of multicharacter Japanese &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; is at most the number of English words.
    However, as noted above, evaluation of the Japanese output is done with Japanese characters, i.e., with the Japanese text in its natural format.
    Table 2 shows the Japanese character accuracy percentages for the trained English-to-Japanese model, e2j, and a baseline model, jww, which gives each English word its most highly correlated translation.
    The vocabularies in these English-Spanish and English-Japanese experiments are only a few thousand words; the utterances are fairly short (an average of 7.3 words per utterance) and often contain errors typical of spoken language.
    So while the domains may be representative of task-oriented dialogue settings, further experimentation would be needed to assess the effectiveness of our method in situations such as translating newspaper articles.
    In terms of the training data required, Tsukada et al. (1999) provide indirect empirical evidence sug
