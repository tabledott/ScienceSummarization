an those obtained in our preliminary experiment (Li and Abe 1995), in part because we only adopted rule (1) in the past.
    Accuracy-coverage curves for MDL, SA, and LA.
    For MDL, we generalized noun2 given (verb, prep, noun2) and (nounl, prep, noun2) triples as training data for each data set, using WordNet as the thesaurus in the same manner as in experiment 1.
    When disambiguating, we actually compared P(Classi I verb, prep) and P(Class2 I noun, prep), where Classi and Class2 are classes in the output tree cut models dominating noun2 in place of P(noun2 I verb, prep) and P(noun2 noun1,prep).12 We found that doing so gives a slightly better result.
    For SA, we employed a somewhat simplified version in which noun2 is generalized given (verb, prep, noun2) and (nouni,prep,noun2) triples using WordNet, and maxaass,3n0un2 A(Class, verb, prep) and maxClass,3noun2 A(Class j nouni,prep) are compared for disambiguation: If the former exceeds the latter then the prepositional phrase is attached to verb, and
