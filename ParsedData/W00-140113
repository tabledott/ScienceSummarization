 Here we summarize two experiments that we have performed that use different tree models.
    (For a more detailed comparisons of different tree models, see (Bangalore and Rainbow, 2000).)
    The simple accuracy, generation accuracy, simple tree accuracy and generation tree accuracy for the two experiments are tabulated in Table 2.
    The test corpus is a randomly chosen subset of 100 sentences from the Section 20 of WSJ.
    The dependency structures for the test sentences were obtained automatically from converting the Penn TreeBank phrase structure trees, in the same way as was done to create the training corpus.
    The average length of the test sentences is 16.7 words with a longest sentence being 24 words in length.
    As can be seen, the supertag-based model improves over the baseline LR model on all four baseline quantitative metrics.
  
  
    We have presented four metrics which we can compute automatically.
    In order to determine whether the metrics correlate with independent notions underst
