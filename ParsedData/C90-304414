 transla- tion units.
  It produces high quality trans- lations.
  It can translate some metaphorical sen- tences.
  In the system, semantic information is not used as constraints.
  As a result, the system can translate some metaphorical sentences.
  Demerits or problems of the system are: 1.
  A great deal of computation is needed.
  Can we make good thesauri?
  The first l)roblem is not serious.
  Parallel compu- tation or some heuristics will overcome it.
  But the second problem is serious.
  We have to study how to construct large thesauri.
