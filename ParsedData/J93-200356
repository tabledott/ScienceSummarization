    We arrive in this way at an English vocabulary of 42,005 words and a French vocabulary of 58,016 words.

    We have carried out 12 iterations of the EM algorithm for this data.
    We initialized the process by setting each of the 2, 437, 020, 096 translation probabilities, t(f I e), to 1/58,016.
    That is, we assume each of the 58,016 words in the French vocabulary to be equally likely as a translation for each of the 42,006 words in the English vocabulary.
    For t(f le) to be greater than zero at the maximum likelih
