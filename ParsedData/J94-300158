pse our vowel-harmony rules into a single one as follows: &#8212;consonantal Both occurrences of the variable a must be instantiated to the same value, either + or &#8212;, at each application of the rule.
    What the rule now says is that a vowel takes its backness from the vowel in the preceding syllable; that is, the most recent preceding vowel that is separated from it by zero or more consonants.
    While the explicit use of variables is an important addition to the notation, it was in fact foreshadowed by a property of the initial feature system, namely that features not explicitly mentioned in the center of a rule were assumed to be carried over from the input to the output.
    Without this convention, an explicit variable would have been required for each of these.
    Explicit feature variables do indeed increase the abbreviatory power of the notation, but, as we show below, they can be translated systematically into batch rules over unanalyzable segments.
    We pay special attention to batch rule
