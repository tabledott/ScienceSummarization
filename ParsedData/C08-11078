IRT, by measuring the proportion of instantiations of l that are covered by the instantiations of r. As far as we know, only (Shinyama et al, 2002)and (Pekar, 2006) learn rules between unary tem plates.
			However, (Shinyama et al, 2002) relies on comparable corpora for identifying paraphrasesand simply takes any two templates from comparable sentences that share a named entity instan tiation to be paraphrases.
			Such approach is notfeasible for non-comparable corpora where statis tical measurement is required.
			(Pekar, 2006) learnsrules only between templates related by local dis course (information from different documents is ignored).
			In addition, their template structure islimited to only verbs and their direct syntactic ar guments, which may yield incorrect rules, e.g. forlight verbs (see Section 5.2).
			To overcome this limitation, we use a more expressive template struc ture.
	
	
			3.1 Motivations.
			Most unsupervised rule learning algorithms focused on learning binary entailment rules.
