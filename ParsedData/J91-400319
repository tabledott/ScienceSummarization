ork of explicitly defined links (e.g.
    Quillian 1968; Collins and Quillian 1969; Fodor 1975; Carnap 1956; Brachman 1979).
    Sometimes referred to as meaning postulates, these links establish any inference between words as an explicit part of a network of word concepts.4 What I would like to do is to propose a new way of viewing primitives, looking more at the generative or compositional aspects of lexical semantics, rather than the decomposition into a specified number of primitives.
    Most approaches to lexical semantics making use of primitives can be characterized as using some form of feature-based semantics, since the meaning of a word is essentially decomposable into a set of features (e.g.
    Katz and Fodor 1963; Katz 1972; Wilks 1975; Schank 1975).
    Even those theories that rely on some internal structure for word meaning (e.g.
    Dowty 1979; Fillmore 1985) do not provide a complete characterization for all of the well-formed expressions in the language.
