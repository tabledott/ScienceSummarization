semy at a very high level and thus avoiding duplication of entries and time&#8212;consuming work (c.f. section 5.1).
    As opposed to WordNet, connectivity between word classes is a strong point of GermaNet.
    This is achieved in different ways: The cross&#8212;class relations ('pertains to') of WordNet are used more frequently, Certain WordNet relations are modified to cross word classes (verbs are allowed to 'cause' adjectives) and new cross&#8212;class relations are introduced (e.g.
    'selectional restrictions').
    Cross&#8212; class relations are particularly important as the expression of one concept is often not restricted to a single word class.
    Additionally, the final version will contain examples for each concept which are to be automatically extracted from the corpus.
  
  
    Some of the guiding principles of the GermaNet ontology creation are different from WordNet and therefore now explained.
    WordNet does contain artificial concepts, that is non&#8212;lexicalized concepts.
