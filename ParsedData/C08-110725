tedmany more incorrect mentions for the same num ber of incorrect rules.
			Second, a large percentage of incorrect mentions extracted are due to partial templates at the rule left-hand-side.
			Such rules are leaned because many binary templates have a more complex structure than paths between arguments.
			As explained in Section 3.2 the unary template structure we use is more expressive, enabling to learn the correct rules.
			For example, BInc learned?take Y into custody ? arrest Y ? while binary DIRT learned ?X take Y ? X arrest Y ?.
			System Level Analysis We manually analyzedthe reasons for false positives (incorrect extrac tions) and false negatives (missed extractions) of BInc, at its best performing cutoff point (K=20), by sampling 200 extractions of each type.
			From the false positives analysis (Table 2) we see that 39% of the errors are due to incorrect rules.
			The main reasons for learning such rules are those discussed in Section 3.3: (a) related templates that are not entailing; (b) infreq
