 by the multi-prototype approach.
    This result is to be expected since the single prototype mainly reflects the majority sense, preventing it from predicting appropriate synonyms for a minority sense.
    Also, once again, the performance of the multi-prototype approach is better for homonyms than polysemes.
    Variance in pairwise prototype distances can help explain the variance in human similarity judgements for a given word pair.
    We evaluate this hypothesis empirically on WordSim-353 by computing the Spearman correlation between the variance of the per-cluster similarity computations, V[D], D def = {d(7rk(w), 7rj(w')) : 1 &lt; k, j &lt; K}, and the variance of the human annotations for that pair.
    Correlations for each dataset are shown in Figure 4 left.
    In general, we find a statistically significant negative correlation between these values using x2 features, indicating that as the entropy of the pairwise cluster similarities increases (i.e., prototypes become more similar, and similariti
