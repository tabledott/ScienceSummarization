rained using all the features improve significantly over the two baselines in terms of accuracy, polar recall, polar F-measure, and neutral precision.
    Neutral F-measure is also higher, but not significantly so.
    These consistent results across three of the four algorithms show that the neutral&#8211;polar features are helpful for determining when a sentiment clue is actually being used to express a sentiment.
    Interestingly, Ripper is the only algorithm for which the word-token baseline performed better than the word+priorpol baseline.
    Nevertheless, the prior polarity feature is an important component in the performance of the Ripper classifier using all the features.
    Excluding prior polarity from this classifier results in a significant decrease in performance for every metric.
    Decreases range from 2.5% for neutral recall to 9.5% for polar recall.
    The best SVM classifier is the word+priorpol baseline.
    In terms of accuracy, this classifier does not perform much worse than the Boo
