final version of the learning software.
    We report the results for English and for Spanish and then the results of a set of experiments to determine the impact of the training set size on the algorithm's performance in both English and Spanish.
    For each language, we have a held-out development test set and a held-out, blind test set.
    We only report results on the blind test set for each respective language.
    The scoring program measures both precision =I recall, terms borrowed from the information-retrieval community, where number of correct responses and number responses number of correct responses number correct in key Put informally, recall measures the number of &amp;quot;hits&amp;quot; vs. the number of possible correct answers as specified in the key file, whereas precision measures how many answers were correct ones compared to the number of answers delivered.
    These two measures of performance combine to form one measure of performance, the F-measure, which is computed by the weighted
