   Without path coreference knowledge, a resolution process would resolve the pronouns in (1) and (2) the same way.
    Indeed, coreference resolution research has focused on the importance of the strategy for combining well known constraints and preferences (Mitkov, 1997; Ng and Cardie, 2002), devoting little attention to the development of new features for these difficult cases.
    The application of world knowledge to pronoun resolution has been limited to the semantic compatibility between a candidate noun and the pronoun&#8217;s context (Yang et al., 2005).
    We show semantic compatibility can be effectively combined with path coreference information in our experiments below.
    Our method for determining path coreference is similar to an algorithm for discovering paraphrases in text (Lin and Pantel, 2001).
    In that work, the beginning and end nodes in the paths are collected, and two paths are said to be similar (and thus likely paraphrases of each other) if they have similar terminals (i.e. the
