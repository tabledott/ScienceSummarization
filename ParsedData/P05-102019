 results seem to suggest that both partition-based and method-based features are important to learning a good ranking model.
    Random ranking.
    An interesting question is: how much does supervised ranking help?
    If all of our candidate partitions are of very high quality, then ranking will not be particularly important because choosing any of these partitions may yield good results.
    To investigate this question, we apply a random ranking model, which randomly selects a candidate partition for each test text.
    Row 6 of Table 3 shows the results (averaged over five runs) when the random ranker is used in place of the supervised ranker.
    In comparison to the results in row 3, we see that the supervised ranker surpasses its random counterpart by about 9-13% in F-measure, implying that ranking plays an important role in our approach.
    Perfect ranking.
    It would be informative to see whether our ranking model is performing at its upper limit, because further performance improvement beyond th
