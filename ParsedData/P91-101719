see Dagan and Itai (1990a) for a discussion on using an automatic parser for extracting lexical relations from a corpus, and for the technique of acquiring the statistics).
    The parser failed to produce any parse for about 35% of the sentences, which further reduced the actual size of the corpora which was used.
  
  
    Two measurements, applicability and precision, are used to evaluate the performance of the statistical model.
    The applicability denotes the proportion of cases for which the model performed a selection, i.e. those cases for which the boundBapassed the threshold.
    The precision denotes the proportion of cases for which the model performed a correct selection out of all the applicable cases.
    We compare the precision of the model to that of the &amp;quot;word frequencies&amp;quot; procedure, which always selects the most frequent target word.
    This naive &amp;quot;straw-man&amp;quot; is less sophisticated than other methods suggested in the literature but it is useful as a comm
