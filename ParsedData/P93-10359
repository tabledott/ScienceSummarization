centage of constituents (strings of words between matching parentheses) from sentences output by our system which do not cross any constituents in the Penn Treebank structural description of the sentence.
    For example, if our system outputs: and the Penn Treebank bracketing for this sentence was: ( ( ( The big dog ) ate ) . ) then the constituent the big would be judged correct whereas the constituent dog ate would not.
    Below are the first seven transformations found from one run of training on the Wall Street Journal corpus, which was initially bracketed using the right-linear initial-state parser.
    The first four transformations all extract noun phrases from the right linear initial structure.
    The sentence &amp;quot;The cat meowed .&amp;quot; would initially be bracketed as:7 ( ( The ( cat meowed ) ) . )
    Applying the first transformation to this bracketing would result in:
  
  
    In the first experiment we ran, training and testing were done on the Texas Instruments Air Travel Informati
