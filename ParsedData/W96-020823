gnificantly slower since they are searching for a simple declarative representation of the concept.
    Empirically, the time complexity for most methods are growing somewhat worse than linearly in the number of training examples.
    The worst in this regard are PFOIL-DNF and PFoiLCNF which have a worst-case complexity of 0(n2) (Mooney, 1995).
    However, all of the methods are able to process fairly large sets of data in reasonable time.
    With respect to testing time, the symbolic methods perform the best since they only need to test a small number of features before making a decision.
    Therefore, in an application where response time is critical, learned rules or decision trees could provide rapid classification with only a modest decrease in accuracy.
    Not surprisingly, there is a trade-off between training time and testing time, the symbolic methods spend more effort during training compressing the representation of the learned concept resulting in a simpler description that is quicker to test.
