ed the label propagation algorithm, which takes the form in Figure 2 (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002).
    Label propagation is an iterative algorithm where each node takes on the weighted average of its neighbour&#8217;s values from the previous iteration.
    The result is that nodes with many paths to seeds get high polarities due to the influence from their neighbours.
    The label propagation algorithm is known to have many desirable properties including convergence, a well defined objective function Input: G = (V, E), wig &#8712; [0, 1], P, N Output: pol &#8712; R|V | Initialize: poli = 1.0 for all vi &#8712; P and poli = &#8722;1.0 for all vi &#8712; N and poli = 0.0 &#8704;vi &#8712;&#65533; P &#8746; N (minimize squared error between values of adjacent nodes), and an equivalence to computing random walks through graphs.
    The primary difference between standard label propagation and the graph propagation algorithm given in Section 2.1, is that a node with multiple paths to a seed will be influenced by a
