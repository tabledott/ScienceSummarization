ions, we can ex pect an increase in noisy examples in data.
			This will push for new more robust learning algorithms that are less sensitive to noise.
			If we increase the size of the data ten-fold but also increase the noise, can learning still be successful?
			Another learning area of great interest is active learning, which has long relied on simulated user experiments.
			New workevaluated active learning methods with real users us ing MTurk (Baker et al, 2009; Ambati et al, 2010; Hsueh et al, 2009; ?).
			Finally, the composition ofcomplex data set annotations from simple user in puts can transform the method by which we learncomplex outputs.
			Current approaches expect exam ples of labels that exactly match the expectation ofthe system.
			Can we instead provide lower level sim 8 pler user annotations and teach systems how to learn from these to construct complex output?
			This would open more complex annotation tasks to MTurk.
			A general trend in research is that good ideascome from unexpected p
