kernel, whic h not only enumerates context free sub-trees but also context-sensitive sub-trees by considering their ancestor node paths as their contexts.
			Moreover, this paper evaluates the complementary nature of different linear kernels and tree kernels via a composite kernel.
			The layout of this paper is as follows.
			In Section 2, we review related work in more details.
			Then, the dynamic context-sensitive tree span and the contextsensitive convolution tree kernel are proposed in Sec tion 3 while Section 4 shows the experimental results.
			Finally, we conclude our work in Sec tion 5.
	
	
			The relation extraction task was first introduced as part of the Template Element task in MUC6 and then formulated as the Template Relation task in MUC7.
			Since then, many methods, such as feature-based (Kambhatla 2004; Zhou et al2005, 2006), tree ker nel-based (Zelenko et al2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004; Bunescu and Mooney 2005a; Zhang et al2006) and composite kernel-based (Zhao and Gris hman 2005; Zhang
