each bucket.
    When a collision occurs, linear probing places the entry to be inserted in the next (higher index) empty bucket, wrapping around as necessary.
    Therefore, a populated probing hash table consists of an array of buckets that contain either one entry or are empty.
    Non-empty buckets contain an entry belonging to them or to a preceding bucket where a conflict occurred.
    Searching a probing hash table consists of hashing the key, indexing the corresponding bucket, and scanning buckets until a matching key is found or an empty bucket is encountered, in which case the key does not exist in the table.
    Linear probing hash tables must have more buckets than entries, or else an empty bucket will never be found.
    The ratio of buckets to entries is controlled by space multiplier m &gt; 1.
    As the name implies, space is O(m) and linear in the number of entries.
    The fraction of buckets that are empty is m&#8722;1 m , so average lookup time is O( m 1) and, crucially, constant in the nu
