most frequent types, represent 4.5% of all the word types.
    A similar strategy was employed by Wu and Xia (1994) and by Fung (1995).
    Fung skimmed off the top 23.8% of the noun-noun entries in her lexicon to achieve a precision of 71.6%.
    Wu and Xia have reported automatic acquisition of 6,517 lexicon entries from a 3.3-million-word corpus, with a precision of 86%.
    The first 3.3 million word tokens in an English corpus from a similar genre contained 33,490 different word types, suggesting a recall of roughly 19%.
    Note, however, that Wu and Xia chose to weight their precision estimates by the probabilities attached to each entry: For example, if the translation set for English word detect has the two correct Chinese candidates with 0.533 probability and with 0.277 probability, and the incorrect translation with 0.190 probability, then we count this as 0.810 correct translations and 0.190 incorrect translations.
    (Wu and Xia 1994, 211) This is a reasonable evaluation method, but it is not co
