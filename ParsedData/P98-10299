    The fact that the errors the taggers make are strongly complementary is very encouraging.
    If all taggers made the exact same errors, there would obviously be no chance of improving accuracy through classifier combination.
    However, note that the high complementary rate between tagger errors in itself does not necessarily imply that there is anything to be gained by classifier combination.
    We ran experiments to determine whether the outputs of the different taggers could be effectively combined.
    We first explored combination via simple majority-wins voting.
    Next, we attempted to automatically acquire contextual cues that learned both which tagger to believe in which contexts and what tags are indicated by different patterns of tagger outputs.
    Both the word environments and the tagger outputs for the word being tagged and its neighbors are used as cues for predicting the proper tag.
    The simplest combination scheme is to have the classifiers vote.
