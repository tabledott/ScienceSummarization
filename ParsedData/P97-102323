bout 7 links per adjective for classification performance over 90% and only 12 links per adjective for performance over 99%.6 The difference between low and high values of P is in the rate at which increasing data increases overall precision.
    These results are somewhat more optimistic than those obtained with real data (Section 8), a difference which is probably due to the uniform distributional assumptions in the simulation.
    Nevertheless, we expect the trends to be similar to the ones shown in Figure 3 and the results of Table 3 on real data support this expectation.
  
  
    We have proposed and verified from corpus data constraints on the semantic orientations of conjoined adjectives.
    We used these constraints to automatically construct a log-linear regression model, which, combined with supplementary morphology rules, predicts whether two conjoined adjectives are of same In each figure, the last x coordinate indicates the d the dotted line shows the performance of a random or different orient
