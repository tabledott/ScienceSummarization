 of A-WASP.
  
  
    We evaluated the A-WASP algorithm in the GEOQUERY domain.
    The larger GEOQUERY corpus consists of 880 English questions gathered from various sources (Wong and Mooney, 2006).
    The questions were manually translated into Prolog logical forms.
    The average length of a sentence is 7.57 words.
    We performed a single run of 10-fold cross validation, and measured the performance of the learned parsers using precision (percentage of translations that were correct), recall (percentage of test sentences that were correctly translated), and Fmeasure (harmonic mean of precision and recall).
    A translation is considered correct if it retrieves the same answer as the correct logical form.
    Figure 8 shows the learning curves for the AWASP algorithm compared to: (1) the original WASP algorithm which uses a functional query language (FunQL); (2) SCISSOR (Ge and Mooney, 2005), a fully-supervised, combined syntacticsemantic parsing algorithm which also uses FunQL; and (3) Zettlemoyer and
