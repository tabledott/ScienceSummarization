ks concerning the third (far harder) problem.
    Our approach to grammar tuning is based on a semi-automatic parsing phase during which additions to the grammar are made manually and statistical information concerning the frequency of use of grammar rules is acquired.
    Using this statistical information and modified grammar, a breadth-first probabilistic parser is constructed.
    The latter is capable of ranking the possible parses identified by the grammar in a useful (and efficient) manner.
    However, (unseen) sentences whose correct analysis is outside the coverage of the grammar reri:ain a problem.
    The feasibility and usefulness of our approach has been investigated in a preliminary way by analyzing a small corpus of noun definitions drawn from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter 1978).
    This corpus was chosen because the vocabulary employed is restricted (to approximately 2,000 morphemes), average definition length is about 10 words (with a maximum of around 30),
