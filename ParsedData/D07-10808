			Word-based insertion/deletion penalties that penalize through the low probabilities of the lexical translation models (Bender et al, 2004).

			Backtrack-based penalties inspired by the dis tortion penalties in phrase-based modeling (Watanabe et al, 2006b).
			3.2 Sparse Features.
			In addition to the baseline features, a large number of binary features are integrated in our MT system.
			We may use any binary features, such as h( f , e) = ? ?
			1 English word ?violate?

			appeared in e and f . 0 otherwise.The features are designed by considering the decod ing efficiency and are based on the word alignmentstructure preserved in hierarchical phrase translation pairs (Zens and Ney, 2006).
			When hierarchical phrases are extracted, the word alignment is pre served.
