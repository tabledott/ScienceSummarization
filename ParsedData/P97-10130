  The Rhetorical Parsing Of Unrestricted Natural Language Texts
  
    We derive the rhetorical structures of texts by means of two new, surface-form-based algorithms: one that identifies discourse usages of cue phrases and breaks sentences into clauses, and one that produces valid rhetorical structure trees for unrestricted natural language texts.
    The algorithms use information that was derived from a corpus analysis of cue phrases.
  
  
    Researchers of natural language have repeatedly acknowledged that texts are not just a sequence of words nor even a sequence of clauses and sentences.
    However, despite the impressive number of discourse-related theories that have been proposed so far, there have emerged no algorithms capable of deriving the discourse structure of an unrestricted text.
    On one hand, efforts such as those described by Asher (1993), Lascarides, Asher, and Oberlander (1992), Kamp and Reyle (1993), Grover et al. (1994), and PrUst, Scha, and van den Berg (1994) take the position t
