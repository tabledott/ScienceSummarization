respond to each of Levins semantic lasses.
  See (Dorr and Voss, to appear).
  as the number of overlapping verbs divided by the av- erage of the number of verbs in the semantic lass and the number of verbs in the syntactic signature.
  Thus an overlap index of 1.00 is a complete overlap and an over- lap of 0 is completely disjoint.
  In this experiment, he sets of verbs with a high overlap index are of interest.
  When we parsed the 1668 example sentences in Part Two of Levins book (including the negative xamples), these sentences reduce to 282 unique patterns.
  The 191 sets of sentences listed with each of the 191 semantic classes in turn reduces to 748 distinct syntactic signa- tures.
  Since there are far more syntactic signatures than the 191 semantic lasses, it is clear that the mapping between signatures and semantic classes is not direct,.
  Only 12 mappings have complete overlaps.
  That means 6.3% of the 191 semantic lasses have a complete over- lap with a syntactic signature.
