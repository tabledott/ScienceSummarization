s work to estimate simi larity between augmented dependency trees and achieved the F-measure of 45.8 on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.
			One problem with the above two tree kernels is that matched nodes must be at the same height and have the same path to the root node.
			Bunescu and Mooney (2005a) pro posed a shortest path dependency tree kernel, which just sums up the number of common word classes at each position in the two paths, and achieved the F-measure of 52.5 on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.
			They argued that the information to model a relationship between two entities can be typically captured by the shortest path between them in the dependency graph.
			While the shortest path may not be able to well preserve structured de pendency tree information, another problem with their kernel is that the two paths should have same length.
			This makes it suffer from the similar behavior with that of Culotta and Sorensen (2004): high preci sion but very low recall.
