t 20 years, along with greater access to training data, make the application of such techniques to readability quite timely.
    While traditional formulas are based on linear regression with two or three variables, statistical language models can capture more detailed patterns of individual word usage.
    As we show in our evaluation, this generally results in better accuracy for Web documents and very short passages (less than 10 words).
    Another benefit of a language modeling approach is that we obtain a probability distribution across all grade models, not just a single grade prediction.
    Statistical models of text rely on training data, so in Section 2 we describe our Web training corpus and note some trends that are evident in word usage.
    Section 3 summarizes related work on readability, focusing on existing vocabulary-based measures that can be thought of as simplified language model techniques.
    Section 4 defines the modified multinomial na&#239;ve Bayes model.
    Section 5 describes ou
