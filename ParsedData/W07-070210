			Similarly the phrase ?eats apples?
			can be thought of as a function which takes a noun phraseNP to the left and returns a sentence S. This opera tion is called backward application.A sentence together with its CCG categories al ready contains most of the information present in a full parse.
			Because these categories are lexicalised, 11they can easily be included into factored phrase based translation.
			CCG supertags are categories that have been provided by a supertagger.
			Supertagswere introduced by Bangalore (1999) as a way of in creasing parsing efficiency by reducing the number of structures assigned to each word.
			Clark (2002) developed a suppertagger for CCG which uses a conditional maximum entropy model to estimate theprobability of words being assigned particular cat egories.
			Here is an example of a sentence that has been supertagged in the training corpus: We all agree on that
