us [MA931 and assigned the word senses ourselves.
    Manual assignment, however, in the case of a huge corpus would be beyond our capacity and therefore we devised an automatic method for an approximate word sense disambiguation based on the following notions: Determining the correct sense of an ambiguous word is highly dependent on the context in which the word occurs.
    Even without any sentential context, the human brain is capable of disambiguating word senses based on circumstances or experience3.
    In natural language processing, however, we rely mostly on the sentential contexts, Le. on the surrounding concepts and relations between them.
    These two problems arise: 1.
    The surrounding concepts are very often expressed by ambiguous words and a correct sense for these words also has to be determined.
    2.
    What relations and how deep an inference is needed for correct disambiguation is unknown.
    We based our word-sense disambiguating mechanism on the premise that two ambiguous words us
