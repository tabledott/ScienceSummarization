			Based on the described systematic modificationof each parameter, only V-measure, VI and Q0 empirically satisfy all of P1-P7 in all experimental con ditions.
			Full results reporting how frequently each evaluated measure satisfied the properties based on these experiments can be found in table 2.All evaluated measures satisfy P4 and P7.
			However, Rand, Mirkin, Fowlkes-Mallows, Gamma, Jac card and F-Measure all fail to satisfy P3 and P6 inat least one experimental configuration.
			This indi cates that the number of ?noise?
			classes or clusterscan be increased without reducing any of these mea sures.
			This implies a computational obliviousness topotent
