 by starting with the sentence's words as leaves of a tree structure, and labeling and extending nodes these nodes until a single-rooted, labeled tree is constructed.
    This pattern recognition process is driven by the decision-tree models described in the previous section.
    A parse tree can be viewed as an n-ary branching tree, with each node in a tree labeled by either a non-terminal label or a part-of-speech label.
    If a parse tree is interpreted as a geometric pattern, a constituent is no more than a set of edges which meet at the same tree node.
    For instance, the noun phrase, &amp;quot;a brown cow,&amp;quot; consists of an edge extending to the right from &amp;quot;a,&amp;quot; an edge extending to the left from &amp;quot;cow,&amp;quot; and an edge extending straight up from &amp;quot;brown&amp;quot;.
    In SPATTER, a parse tree is encoded in terms of four elementary components, or features: words, tags, labels, and extensions.
    Each feature has a fixed vocabulary, with each element of a
