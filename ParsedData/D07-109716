rapolation, rather than proper tuning, for other important parameters.
			This probably means that the per formance of the Blended system can be improved considerably by optimizing parameters for all six parsers separately.
			4 Results and Discussion.
			Table 1 shows the labeled attachment score results from our internal dry run (training on 90% of the training data, testing on the remaining 10%) and the official test runs for both of our systems.
			It should be pointed out that the test score for the Blended parser on Chinese is different from the official one (75.82), which was much lower than expected dueto a corrupted specification file required by Malt Parser.
			Restoring this file and rerunning the parser on the Chinese test set, without retraining the parser or changing any parameter settings, resulted in thescore reported here.
			This also improved the aver age score from 80.32 to 81.20, the former being the highest reported official score.
			For the Single Malt parser, the test results are on a
