 seeking a value above a threshold, and in yet others, good results are obtained only when this measure is paired with a similar measure constructed in mirror-image fashion from the end of the word&#8212;and then some arbitrary thresholds are selected which yield the best results.
    While no single method emerges as the best, one of the best yields precision of 0.91 and recall of 0.61 on a corpus of approximately 6,200 word types.
    (Precision here indicates proportion of predicted morpheme breaks that are correct, and recall denotes the proportion of correct breaks that are predicted.)
    The second approach that can be found in the literature is based on the hypothesis that local information in the string of letters (respectively, phonemes) is sufficient to identify morpheme boundaries.
    This hypothesis would be clearly correct if all morpheme boundaries were between pairs of letters 11-12 that never occur in that sequence morpheme internally, and the hypothesis would be invalidated if conditional p
