n oversampling method to dramatically expand the amount of training data for TLINK labeling, resulting in labeling predictive accuracy as high as 93% using an off-the-shelf Maximum Entropy classifier.
    Future research will investigate this effect further, as well as examine factors that enhance or mitigate this effect in different corpora.
    The paper showed that ME-C performed significantly better than a series of increasingly sophisticated baselines involving expansion of rules derived from human intuitions.
    Our results in these comparisons confirm the lessons learned from the corpus-based revolution, namely that rules based on intuition alone are prone to incompleteness and are hard to tune without access to the distributions found in empirical data.
    Clearly, lexical rules have a role to play in semantic and pragmatic reasoning from language, as in the discussion of example (2) in Section 1.
    Such rules, when mined by robust, large corpusbased methods, as in the Google-derived VerbOcean, ar
