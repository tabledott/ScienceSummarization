    At project meetings held twice a year, analyses of sample sentences are compared and any differences are discussed; the goal is to determine whether the differences are justified or whether the analyses should be changed to maintain parallelism.
    In addition, all of the fstructure features and their values are compared; this not only ensures that trivial differences in naming conventions do not arise, but also gives an overview of the constructions each language covers and how they are analyzed.
    All changes are implemented before the next project meeting.
    Each meeting also involves discussion of constructions whose analysis has not yet been settled on, e.g., the analysis of partitives or proper names.
    If an analysis is agreed upon, all the grammars implement it; if only a tentative analysis is found, one grammar implements it and reports on its success.
    For extremely complicated or fundamental issues, e.g., how to represent predicate alternations, subcommittees examine the issue and re
