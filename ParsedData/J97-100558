ioned by segmental structure: referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses.
    We evaluate three algorithms, each of which uses features pertaining to only one of these linguistic devices, in order to see whether linguistic associations proposed in the literature can be used by natural language processing systems to perform segmentation, and to compare the utility of different knowledge sources.
    Unlike most previous work, which typically considers each linguistic device in isolation, we also evaluate a simple additive method for combining linguistic devices, in which a boundary is proposed if each separate algorithm proposes a boundary.
    As we will see, the performance of our algorithms improves with the amount of knowledge exploited.
    The recall of the three algorithms is comparable to human performance, the precision much lower, and the fallout and error of only the noun phrase algorithm comparable.
    Furthermore, the results on combining algorithms suggests that with more sophisticated meth
