ern candidates to filter asymmetric ones.
    The first measure (M1) counts the proportion of words that can appear in both slots of the pattern, out of the total number of words.
    The reasoning here is that if a pattern allows a large percentage of words to participate in both slots, its chances of being a symmetric pattern are greater: M1 filters well patterns that connect words having different parts of speech.
    However, it may fail to filter patterns that contain multiple levels of asymmetric relationships.
    For example, in the pattern &#8216;x belongs to y&#8217;, we may find a word B on both sides (&#8216;A belongs to B&#8217;, &#8216;B belongs to C&#8217;) while the pattern is still asymmetric.
    In order to detect symmetric relationships in a finer manner, for the second and third measures we define 5ymG(P), the symmetric subgraph of G(P), containing only the bidirectional arcs and nodes of G(P): The second and third measures count the proportion of the number of symmetric nodes and edges i
