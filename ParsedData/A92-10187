    3 Hidden Markov Modeling The hidden Markov modeling component of our tagger is implemented as an independent module following the specgiven in [Levinson et with special attention to space and time efficiency issues.
    Only first-order modeling is addressed and will be presumed for the remainder of this discussion.
    3.1 Formalism brief, an a doubly stochastic process that generates sequence of symbols ={Sl,S2, , 1 &lt;i&lt; where W is some finite set of possible symbols, by composing an underlying Markov process with a state-dependent symbol generator (i.e., a Markov process with noise).'
    Th Markov process captures the notion of sequence depen and is described by a set of a matrix c probabilities A -= 1 &lt; a, the probability of moving from state i to state of initial probabilities H = {70 1 &lt; i &lt; is the probability of starting in state i.
    The symbol ger erator is a state-dependent measure on V described by of symbol probabilities 1 &lt; j &lt; &lt; &lt; M = IW I is
