    Briefly, Conditional Random Fields are log-linear models that rely on weighted features to make predictions on the input.
    Features used by our system include standard pattern matching and word features as well as some expert-created regular expression features8.
    Using 10-fold cross-validation on 264 labelled abstracts containing 551 types, 1064 locations and 557 states, we obtained the following results: An entity is considered correctly identified if and only if it matches the human labeling by both category (type, location or state) and span (from position a to position b).
    At this stage we have not distinguished between initial and final states.
    While it is difficult to compare taggers that tag different types of entities (e.g., (Friedman et al., 2001; Gaizauskas et al., 2003)), CRFs have been utilized for state-of-the-art results in NP-chunking and gene and protein tagging (Sha and Pereira, 2003; McDonald and Pereira, 2004) Currently, we are beginning to in
