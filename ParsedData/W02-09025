his allows us to restrict the word length to be able to increase the accuracy of the collected word pairs.
    For instance, by relying only on words at least of length 6, we could collect 622 word pairs with 96% accuracy.
    In our experiments, however, we included all the words pairs.
    As already mentioned, there are some wellestablished transformation rules for the adoption of words from a foreign language.
    For German to English, this includes replacing the letters k and z by c and changing the ending -t&#168;at by -ty.
    Both these rules can be observed in the word pair Elektrizit&#168;at and electricity.
    By using these two rules, we can gather 363 additional word pairs of which 330, or 91%, are in fact translations of each other.
    The combined total of 1339 (976+363) word pairs are separated and form the seed for some of the following steps.
    When words are adopted into another language, their spelling might change slightly in a manner that can not be simply generalized in a rule.
