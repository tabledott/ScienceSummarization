e to compute within the baseline system.
    But despite its apparent success, there remains a major drawback: this method suffers from the limited scope of the nbest list, which rules out many potentially good alternatives.
    For example 41% of the correct parses were not in the candidates of &#8764;30-best parses in (Collins, 2000).
    This situation becomes worse with longer sentences because the number of possible interpretations usually grows exponentially with the sentence length.
    As a result, we often see very few variations among the n-best trees, for example, 50best trees typically just represent a combination of 5 to 6 binary ambiguities (since 25 &lt; 50 &lt; 26).
    Alternatively, discriminative parsing is tractable with exact and efficient search based on dynamic programming (DP) if all features are restricted to be local, that is, only looking at a local window within the factored search space (Taskar et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2005).
    However, we miss the benefits of non-local fe
