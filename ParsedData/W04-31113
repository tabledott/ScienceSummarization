evels.
    Such inferences provide testable hypotheses and thus future research targets.
    The other major area of focus, in collaboration with researchers in the Knowledge Integration and Discovery Systems group at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), is the extraction of information about enzymes, focusing initially on compounds that affect the activity of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of proteins.
    For example, the goal is to see a phrase like Amiodarone weakly inhibited CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4-mediated activities with Ki values of 45.1&#8211;271.6 and extract the facts amiodarone inhibits CYP2C9 with Ki=45.1-271.6 amiodarone inhibits CYP2D6 with Ki=45.1-271.6 amiodarone inhibits CYP3A4 with Ki=45.1-271.6 Previous work at GSK has used search algorithms that are based on pattern matching rules filling template slots.
    The rules rely on identifying the relevant passages by first identifying compound names and then associating them with a limited number of relational terms such as inhibit or inactivate.
