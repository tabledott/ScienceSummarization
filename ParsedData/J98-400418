plications mentioned earlier the absolute magnitude of the probability of a tree is not of direct interest; rather we are concerned with its probability relative to the probabilities of other, alternative tree structures for the same yield.
    Thus it is arguably more reasonable to ignore the &amp;quot;spurious&amp;quot; tree structures The estimated relative frequency./ of NP attachment.
    This graph shows I as a function of the relative frequency f of NP attachment in the training data for various models discussed in the text. generated by Pi but not present in the training corpus, and compare the estimated relative frequencies of (A1) and (Bi) under Pi to their frequencies in the training data.
    Ideally the estimated relative frequency fi of (Al) will be close to its actual frequencyf in the training corpus.
    The relationship between f and fi is plotted in Figure 4.
    As inspection of Figure 4 makes clear, the value of fi can diverge substantially from f. For example, at f = 0.48 (the estimate o
