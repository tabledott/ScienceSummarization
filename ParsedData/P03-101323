 determine which sister-head dependencies are crucial for improving performance of the model.
    The results of the PP experiment are listed in Table 5.
    Again, we give results obtained using TnT tags and using perfect tags.
    The row &#8216;Split PP&#8217; contains the performance figures obtained by including split PPs in both the training and in the testing set.
    This leads to a substantial increase in LR (6&#8211;7%) and LP (around 8%) for both tagging schemes.
    Note, however, that these figures are not directly comparable to the performance of the unmodified Collins model: it is possible that the additional brackets artificially inflate LR and LP.
    Presumably, the brackets for split PPs are easy to detect, as they are always adjacent to a preposition.
    An honest evaluation should therefore train on the modified training set (with split PPs), but collapse the split categories for testing, i.e., test on the unmodified test set.
    The results for this evaluation are listed in rows &#8216
