 interannotator reliability is the robustness of the pyramid metric, given different SCU annotations.
    Table 1 gives three sets of pyramid scores for the same set of four PAL summaries.
    The rows of scores correspond to the original annotations (C1, C2) and a consensus.
    There is no significant difference in the scores assigned across the three annotations (between subjects ANOVA=0.11, p=0.90).
    Here we use three DUC 2003 summary sets for which four human summaries were written.
    In order to provide as broad a comparison as possible for the least annotation effort, we selected the set that received the highest DUC scores (D30042: Lockerbie), and the two that received the lowest (D31041: PAL; D31050: China).
    For each set, we collected six new summaries from advanced undergraduate and graduate students with evidence of superior verbal skills; we gave them the same instructions used by NIST.
    This turned out to be a large enough corpus to investigate how many summaries a pyramid needs for s
