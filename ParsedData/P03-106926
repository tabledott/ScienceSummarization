h are chosen to be included into the summary.
    A language generation system outputs a sentence (per theme) from the selected predicate argument structures.
    Barzilay et al. (2002) collected ten sets of articles each consisting of two to three articles reporting the same event and simulated MULTIGEN by manually selecting the sentences to be included in the final summary.
    This way they ensured that orderings were not influenced by mistakes their system could have made.
    Explicit references and connectives were removed from the sentences so as not to reveal clues about the sentence ordering.
    Ten subjects provided orders for each summary which had an average length of 8.8.
    We simulated the participants&#8217; task by using the model from Section 2.1 to produce an order for each candidate summary1.
    We then compared the differences in the orderings generated by the model and participants using the best performing features from Experiment 2 (i.e., NL and VDND).
    Note that the model was tr
