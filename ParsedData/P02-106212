tation marks if they appear in the candidate.
    Additionally, define to be the index of the last word beginning with a lower case letter, upper case letter, or digit within the quotation marks.
    The first set of feature templates tracks the values of for the words within quotes:2 Q= Q2= 2We only included these features if , to prevent an explosion in the length of feature strings.
    , , and .
    The values for and would be and (these features are derived from The and Lennon, which respectively do and don&#8217;t appear in the capitalization lexicon).
    This would give QF= and QF2= .
    At this point, we have fully described the representation used as input to the reranking algorithms.
    The maximum-entropy tagger gives 20 proposed segmentations for each input sentence.
    Each candidate is represented by the log probability from the tagger, as well as the values of the global features for .
    In the next section we describe algorithms which blend these two sources of information, the aim being
