and the fats of the animal).
    TypeDM formalizes this intuition by adopting as links the patterns inside the LexDM links, while the suffixes of these patterns are used to count their number of distinct surface realizations.
    We call the model TypeDM because it counts types of realizations, not tokens.
    For instance, the two LexDM links of&#8722;1+n-a+n-the and of&#8722;1+nsj+n-the are counted as two occurrences of the same TypeDM link of&#8722;1, corresponding to the pattern in the two original links.
    The scoring function 6 computes LMI not on the raw word&#8211;link&#8211;word cooccurrence counts, but on the number of distinct suffix types displayed by a link when it co-occurs with the relevant words.
    For instance, a TypeDM link derived from a LexDM pattern that occurs with nine different suffix types in the corpus is assigned a frequency of 9 for the purpose of the computation of LMI.
    The distinct TypeDM links are 25,336.
    The number of non-zero tuples in the TypeDM tensor is about 13
