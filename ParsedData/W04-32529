different learning algorithm was used in (Frank et al., 1999), where a Naive Bayes learning scheme is applied on the document collection, with improved results observed on the same data set as used in (Turney, 1999).
    Neither Turney nor Frank report on the recall of their systems, but only on precision: a 29.0% precision is achieved with GenEx (Turney, 1999) for five keyphrases extracted per document, and 18.3% precision achieved with Kea (Frank et al., 1999) for fifteen keyphrases per document.
    More recently, (Hulth, 2003) applies a supervised learning system to keyword extraction from abstracts, using a combination of lexical and syntactic features, proved to improve significantly over previously published results.
    As Hulth suggests, keyword extraction from abstracts is more widely applicable than from full texts, since many documents on the Internet are not available as full-texts, but only as abstracts.
    In her work, Hulth experiments with the approach proposed in (Turney, 1999), and a new a
