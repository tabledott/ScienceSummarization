 which denote the interval boundaries and a corresponding sequence for the change in error count involved at the corresponding interval boundary Here, denotes the change in the error count at . position to the error count at position .
    By merging all sequences and for all different sentences of our corpus, the complete set of interval boundaries and error count changes on the whole corpus are obtained.
    The optimal can now be computed easily by traversing the sequence of interval boundaries while updating an error count.
    It is straightforward to refine this algorithm to also handle the BLEU and NIST scores instead of sentence-level error counts by accumulating the relevant statistics for computing these scores (n-gram precision, translation length and reference length) .
  
  
    The basic feature functions of our model are identical to the alignment template approach (Och and Ney, 2002).
    In this translation model, a sentence is translated by segmenting the input sentence into phrases, transla
