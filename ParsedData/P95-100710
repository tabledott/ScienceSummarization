d, the correct parse depends on whether calcium characterises the ions or mediates the exchange.
    Another significant difference between the models is the predictions they make about the proportion 'Lauer and Dras (1994) give a formal construction motivating the algorithm given in Lauer (1994). of left and right-branching compounds.
    Lauer and Dras (1994) show that under a dependency model, left-branching compounds should occur twice as often as right-branching compounds (that is twothirds of the time).
    In the test set used here and in that of Resnik (1993), the proportion of leftbranching compounds is 67% and 64% respectively.
    In contrast, the adjacency model appears to predict a proportion of 50%.
    The dependency model has also been proposed by Kobayasi et al (1994) for analysing Japanese noun compounds, apparently independently.
    Using a corpus to acquire associations, they bracket sequences of Kanji with lengths four to six (roughly equivalent to two or three words).
