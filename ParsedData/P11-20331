ar time complexity and the comparative freedom to define non-local features, as exemplified by the comparison between MaltParser and MSTParser (Nivre et al., 2006b; McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Nivre, 2007).
    Recent research has addressed two potential disadvantages of systems like MaltParser.
    In the aspect of decoding, beam-search (Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang et al., 2009) and partial dynamic-programming (Huang and Sagae, 2010) have been applied to improve upon greedy one-best search, and positive results were reported.
    In the aspect of training, global structural learning has been used to replace local learning on each decision (Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang et al., 2009), although the effect of global learning has not been separated out and studied alone.
    In this short paper, we study a third aspect in a statistical system: feature definition.
    Representing the type of information a statistical system uses to make predictions, feature templates can be on
