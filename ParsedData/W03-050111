 start with the simplest low-content units: the determiners a and the.
    Other determiners were not considered for deletion because our analysis of the humanconstructed headlines revealed that most of the other determiners provide important information, e.g., negation (not), quantifiers (each, many, several), and deictics (this, that).
    Beyond these, we found that the human-generated headlines contained very few time expressions which, although certainly not content-free, do not contribute toward conveying the overall &#8220;who/what content&#8221; of the story.
    Since our goal is to provide an informative headline (i.e., the action and its participants), the identification and elimination of time expressions provided a significant boost in the performance of our automatic headline generator.

    We implemented the elimination of time expressions as a twostep process: where X is tagged as part of a
