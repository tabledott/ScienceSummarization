 found performance largely independent of these choices.
    Finally, we developed a principled way of incorporating DA modeling into the probability model of a continuous speech recognizer, by constraining word hypotheses using the discourse context.
    However, the approach gives only a small reduction in word error on our corpus, which can be attributed to a preponderance of a single dialogue act type (statements).
    The research described here is based on a project at the 1997 Workshop on Innovative Techniques in LVCSR at the Center for Speech and Language Processing at Johns Hopkins University (Jurafsky et al. 1997; Jurafsky et al.
    1998).
    The DA-labeled Switchboard transcripts as well as other project-related publications are available at http://www.colorado. edu/ling/jurafsky/ws97/.
