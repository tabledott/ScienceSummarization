dependency scheme for parser evaluation, the ultimate goal of such an evaluation is an important question.
    It is necessary to contrast the two different forms that evaluation can take: extrinsic task-based evaluation and intrinsic evaluation.
    We tend to agree with Moll&#180;a and Hutchinson (2003) that intrinsic evaluations have limited value and that task-based evaluation is the correct approach.
    Some of the results of the previous section at least broadly support the utility of the SD scheme for practical use in higherlevel tasks.
    Nevertheless, given the current trend in the NLP community as well as in other fields such as bioinformatics, where the advantage of dependency representations for shallow text understanding tasks has become salient, we would argue, following Clegg and Shepherd (2007), that dependency-based evaluation is close to typical user tasks.
    Moreover, it avoids some of the known deficiencies of other parser evaluation measures such as Parseval (Carroll et al., 1999).
