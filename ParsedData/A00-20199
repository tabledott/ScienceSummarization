hose given above except that the probability in the numerator is estimated from the wordspecific corpus and the probabilities in the denominator come from the general corpus.
    To return to a previous example, the phrase a knowledge contains the tag bigram for singular determiner followed by singular noun (AT NN).
    This sequence is much less common in the word-specific corpus for knowledge than would be expected from the general corpus unigram probabilities of AT and NN.
    In addition to bigram and trigram measures, ALEK compares the target word's part-ofspeech tag in the word-specific corpus and in the general corpus.
    Specifically, it looks at the conditional probability of the part-of-speech tag given the major syntactic category (e.g., plural noun given noun) in both distributions, by computing the following value.
    For example, in the general corpus, about half of all noun tokens are plural, but in the training set for the noun knowledge, the plural knowledges occurs rarely, if at all.
