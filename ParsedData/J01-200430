in the tree of the nonterminal that is being expanded.
    For example, suppose that we have a function that returns the label of the closest sibling to the left of constituent (A) or NULL if no such node exists.
    Then a subsequent function could be defined as follows: return the parent of the parent (the grandparent) of constituent (A) only if constituent (A) has no sibling to the left&#8212;in other words, if the previous function returns NULL; otherwise return the second closest sibling to the left of constituent (A), or, as always, NULL if no such node exists.
    If the function returns, for example, NP, this could either mean that the grandparent is NP or the second closest sibling is Conditional probability model represented as a decision tree, identifying the location in the partial parse tree of the conditioning information.
    NP; yet there is no ambiguity in the meaning of the function, since the result of the previous function disambiguates between the two possibilities.
