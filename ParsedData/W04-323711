he adaptation training data becomes: The adaptation is performed in stages: Fadapt \ Fbackground4 introduced in the model receive 0 weight.
    The resulting model is thus equivalent with the background model.
    &#8226; train the model such that the regularized loglikelihood of the adaptation training data is maximized.
    The prior mean is set at A0 = Abackground &#183; 0; &#183; denotes concatenation between the parameter vector for the background model and a 0-valued vector of length |Fadapt\ Fbackground |corresponding to the weights for the new features.
    As shown in Appendix A, the update equations are very similar to the 0-mean case: The effect of the prior is to keep the model parameters &#955;i close to the background ones.
    The cost of moving away from the mean for each feature fi is specified by the magnitude of the variance &#963;i: a small variance &#963;i will keep the weight &#955;i close to its mean; a large variance &#963;i will make the regularized log-likelihood (see Eq.
