as found to have better correlation with human judgments* METEOR was designed to explicitly address the weaknesses in BLEU identified above* It evaluates a translation by computing a score based on explicit word-to-word matches between the translation and a reference translation* If more than one reference translation is available, the given translation is scored against each reference independently, and the best score is reported* This is discussed in more detail later in this section* Given a pair of translations to be compared (a system translation and a reference translation), METEOR creates an alignment between the two strings* We define an alignment as a mapping between unigrams, such that every unigram in each string maps to zero or one unigram in the other string, and to no unigrams in the same string* Thus in a given alignment, a single unigram in one string cannot map to more than one unigram in the other string* This alignment is incrementally produced through a series of stages, each stage consist
