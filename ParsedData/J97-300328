g rule is rescored.
    This is done recursively until the score of the resulting rule does not exceed the threshold, at which point it is added to the working rule sets.
    This process is applied until no merges can be done to the rules that scored poorly.
    In our experiment we noticed that the merging added 30-40% new rules to the working rule sets, and therefore the final number of rules for the induced sets were: Prefix &#8212; 348, Suffix&#176; &#8212; 975, Suffixl&#8212; 1,263 and Ending* &#8212; 2,196.
    There are two important questions that arise at the rule acquisition stage: how to choose the scoring threshold 0, and what the performance of the rule sets produced with different thresholds is.
    The task of assigning a set of PUS-tags to a word is actually quite similar to the task of document categorization where a document is assigned a set of descriptors that represent its contents.
    There are a number of standard parameters (Lewis 1991) used for measuring performance on this kind of
