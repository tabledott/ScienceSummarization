arsing algorithms, feature models, and classifiers have been used for deterministic dependency parsing, there are very few studies that compare the impact of different components.
    The notable exceptions are Cheng, Asahara, and Matsumoto (2005), who compare two different algorithms and two types of classifier for parsing Chinese, and Hall, Nivre, and Nilsson (2006), who compare two types of classifiers and several types of feature models for parsing Chinese, English, and Swedish.
    In this article, we focus on parsing algorithms.
    More precisely, we describe two families of algorithms that can be used for deterministic dependency parsing, supported by classifiers for predicting the next parsing action.
    The first family uses a stack to store partially processed tokens and is restricted to the derivation of projective dependency structures.
    The algorithms of Kudo and Matsumoto (2002), Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), and Nivre (2003, 2006b) all belong to this family.
    The second family, represent
