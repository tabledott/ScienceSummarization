  D-PATR:  A Deve lopment  Env i ronment fo r  Un i f i ca t ion -Based  Grammars Lauri Karttunen Artificial Intelligence Center SRI International 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, CA 94025 USA and Center for the Study of Language and Information Stanford University 1 Introduction I)-PATR is a development environment for unification-based grammars on Xerox l i00 series work stations.
  It is based on the PATR formalism developed at SRI International.
  This formalism is suitable for encoding a wide variety of grammars.
  At one end of this range are simple phrase-structure grammars with no feature augmentations.
  The PATR formalism can also be used to encode grammars that are based on a number of current linguistic theories, such as lexical-functional grammar (Bresnan and Kaplan), head-driven phrase structure grammar (Pollard and Sag), and functional unification grammar (Kay).
  At the other end of the range covered by D-PATR are unification-based categorial grammars (Klein, Steedman, Uszkoreit, Wittenburg)
