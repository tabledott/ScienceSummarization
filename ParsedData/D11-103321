he Moore-Lewis and bilingual Moore-Lewis methods in Section 4.
    The results are in Table 5.
    A translation system trained on a pseudo indomain subset of the general corpus, selected with the bilingual Moore-Lewis method, can be further improved by combining with an in-domain model.
    Furthermore, this system combination works better than the conventional multi-model approach by up to 0.7 BLEU on both the dev and test sets.
    Thus a domain-adapted system comprising two phrase tables trained on a total of 180k sentences outperformed the standard multi-model system which was trained on 12 million sentences.
    This tiny combined system was also 3+ points better than the general-domain system by itself, and 6+ points better than the in-domain system alone.
  
  
    Sentence pairs from a general-domain corpus that seem similar to an in-domain corpus may not actually represent the same distribution of language, as measured by language model perplexity.
    Nonetheless, we have shown that relatively tiny
