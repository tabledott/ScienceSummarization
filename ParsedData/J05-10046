iation in the syntactic realization of semantic arguments and drawing connections to previous research into verb alter- nation behavior.
  In section 3 we describe our approach to semantic-role annotation, including the types of roles chosen and the guidelines for the annotators.
  Section 5 compares our PropBank methodology and choice of semantic-role labels to those of another semantic annotation project, FrameNet.
  We conclude the article with a dis- cussion of several preliminary experiments we have performed using the PropBank annotations, and discuss the implications for natural language research.
  Semantic Roles and Syntactic Alternation Our work in examining verb alternation behavior is inspired by previous research into the linking between semantic roles and syntactic realization, in particular, the comprehensive study of Levin (1993).
  Levin argues that syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the underlying semantics; the sets of syntactic frames associated with a particular Levin class refle
