ich aims to identify sentences in a corpus which are relevant for a particular IE task (Section 5).
    Results on each of these evaluation regimes are then presented (Sections 6 and 7).
  
  
    We begin by outlining the general process of learning extraction patterns, similar to one presented by (Yangarber, 2003). are currently in Sacc.
    This function assigns a real number to candidate patterns so V c E Scand, f(c, Sacc) H R. A set of high scoring patterns (based on absolute scores or ranks after the set of patterns has been ordered by scores) are chosen as being suitable for inclusion in the set of accepted patterns.
    These form the set Slearn.
    A key choice in the development of such an algorithm is step 4, the process of ranking the candidate patterns, which effectively determines which of the candidate patterns will be learned.
    Yangarber et al. (2000) chose an approach motivated by the assumption that documents containing a large number of patterns already identified as relevant to a parti
