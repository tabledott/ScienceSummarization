misations significantly reduced the execution time.
    We compare three versions of Segmenter (Kan et at, 1998).
    K98(p) is the original Perl implementation of the algorithm (version 1.6).
    K98(i) is my implementation of the algorithm.
    K98(j,,i) is a version of K98(i) which uses a document specific chain breaking strategy.
    The distribution of link distances are used to identify unusually long links.
    The threshold is a function p + c x VT, of the mean p and variance We found c = 1 works well in practice.
    Table 5 summarises the experimental results.
    K98 performed performed significantly better than K98(J,).
    This is due to the use of a different part-of-speech tagger and shallow parser.
    The difference in speed is largely due to the programming languages and term clustering strategies.
    Our chain breaking strategy improved accuracy (compare K98(i) with K98(j,a))&#8226; Two versions of our algorithm were developed, C99 and C99(b).
    The former is an exact implementation of t
