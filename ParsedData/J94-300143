ot in L2 and can therefore be defined by This operator, the regular-language analog of the logical equivalence between P -- Q and --,(P A --,(2), involves only concatenation and complementation, operations under which regular languages (though not relations) are closed.
    We can also express the symmetric requirement that a prefix be in Li if its suffix is in L2 by the expression Finally, we can combine these two expressions to impose the requirement that a prefix be in Li if and only if its suffix is in L2: These five special operators, being constructive combinations of more primitive ones, can also serve as components of practical computation.
    The double complementation in the definitions of these conditional operators, and also in several other expressions to be introduced later, constitutes an idiom for expressing universal quantification.
    While a regular expression a/37 expresses the proposition that an instance of 0 occurs between some instance of a and some instance of -y, the expression cE/
