h where extraction decisions are almost entirely driven by sentence-level reasoning.
    However, defining the Yr random variables and tying them to the sentencelevel variables, Zi, provides a direct method for modeling weak supervision.
    We can simply train the model so that the Y variables match the facts in the database, treating the Zi as hidden variables that can take any value, as long as they produce the correct aggregate predictions.
    This approach is related to the multi-instance learning approach of Riedel et al. (2010), in that both models include sentence-level and aggregate random variables.
    However, their sentence level variables are binary and they only have a single aggregate variable that takes values r E R U {none}, thereby ruling out overlapping relations.
    Additionally, their aggregate decisions make use of Mintzstyle aggregate features (Mintz et al., 2009), that collect evidence from multiple sentences, while we use r(e1, e2) for r E R and ei E E. Given this form of supervisi
