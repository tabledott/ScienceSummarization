are also replaced with slot nodes, since they, too, probably represent arguments (we condense adjacent slots into one).
    Nodes with in-degree lower than the synonymy threshold are removed under the assumption that they probably represent idiosyncrasies of individual sentences.
    See Figure 6 for examples.
    Figure 3 shows an example of a lattice and the slotted lattice derived via the process just described.
