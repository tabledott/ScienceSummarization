    Unfortunately, in the data set made available in the public domain, there is no indication of which sentences are used as test sentences.
    As such, we conducted 100 random trials, and in each trial, 600 sentences were randomly selected to form the test set.
    LEXAS is trained on the remaining 1769 sentences, and then tested on a separate test set of sentences in each trial.
    Note that in Bruce and Wiebe's test run, the proportion of sentences in each sense in the test set is approximately equal to their proportion in the whole data set.
    Since we use random selection of test sentences, the proportion of each sense in our test set is also approximately equal to their proportion in the whole data set in our random trials.
    The average accuracy of LEXAS over 100 random trials is 87.4%, and the standard deviation is 1.37%.
    In each of our 100 random trials, the accuracy of LEXAS is always higher than the accuracy of 78% reported in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994).
