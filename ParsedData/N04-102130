    &#8226; Our discriminative training technique, which directly optimizes the BLEU score on a development corpus, seems to have overfitting problems with large number of features.
    One could use a larger development corpus for discriminative training or investigate alternative discriminative training criteria.
    &#8226; The amount of annotated data that has been used to train the taggers and parsers is two orders of magnitude smaller than the parallel training data that has been used to train the baseline system (or the word-based features).
    Possibly, a comparable amount of annotated data (e.g. a treebank with 100 million words) is needed to obtain significant improvements.
    This is the first large scale integration of syntactic analysis operating on many different levels with a state-of-theart phrase-based MT system.
