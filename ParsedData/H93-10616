inclusion in WordNet promises to simplify the task of sense resolution.
  However, the mor- phology of collocations poses certain problems.
  Special algorithms are required for inflected forms of some colloca- tions: for example, "standing astride of" will return the phrasal verb, "stand astride of."
  As of the time this is written, WordNet contains more than 83,800 entries (unique character strings, words and colloca- tions) and more than 63,300 lexicalized concepts (synsets, plus defining glosses); altogether there are more than 118,600 entry-concept airs.
  The semantic relations are represented by more than 87,600 pointers between concepts.
  Approximately 43% of the entries are collocations.
  Approx- imately 63% of the synsets include definitional glosses.
  And approximately 14% of the nouns and 25% of the verbs are polysemous.
  WordNet continues to grow at a rate of almost 1,000 con- cepts a month.
  The task of semantic tagging has provided a useful stimulus to improve both coverage and precision.
