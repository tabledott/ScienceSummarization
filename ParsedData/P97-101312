low analyzer how the surrounding text should be broken into textual units.
    This information is used by an algorithm that concurrently identifies discourse usages of cue phrases and determines the clauses that a text is made of.
    The algorithm examines a text sentence by sentence and determines a set of potential discourse markers that occur in each sentence.
    It then applies left to right the procedures that are associated with each potential marker.
    These procedures have the following possible effects: &#8226; They can cause an immediate breaking of the current sentence into clauses.
    For example, when an 1,1 although&amp;quot; marker is found, a new clause, whose right boundary is just before the occurrence of the marker, is created.
    The algorithm is then recursively applied on the text that is found having a discourse usage.
    For example, when the cue phrase &amp;quot;Although&amp;quot; is identified, it is also assigned a discourse usage.
    The decision of whether a cue phrase is
