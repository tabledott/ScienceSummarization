unctive (Figure 6).
    An EB (the last bunsetsu in the post-conjunct) corresponds to a KB (the last bunsetsu in the pre-conjunct), and it follows from the definition of a path that the EB has a certain similarity to the KB.
    On the other hand, when there are modifiers in both conjuncts, an SB shows where the leftmost modifier starts in its pre-conjunct.
    Since the modifiers in the pre-conjunct and those in the post-conjunct usually do not correspond exactly, an SB is determined mainly on the basis of the balance between preand post-conjuncts and is not always detected precisely.
    This problem is managed in the next stages when the relations between CSs in a sentence are adjusted and when a dependency structure is constructed (described in Section 4.1 and Section 5.2).
    Two examples of detecting CSs are shown in Figures 7 and 8.
    A chain of matrix elements with the same letters shows the maximum path for the KB marked with this letter and '&gt;.'
    In the example sentence in Figure 7, the con
