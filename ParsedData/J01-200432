he POS of the closest c-commanding lexical head to A, which it finds by walking the parse tree; if the left-hand side of the rule is not a POS, then the algorithm returns (at level 4) the closest sibling to the left of the parent of constituent (A).
    The functions that we have chosen for this paper follow from the intuition (and experience) that what helps parsing is different depending on the constituent that is being expanded.
    POS nodes have lexical items on the right-hand side, and hence can bring into the model some of the head-head dependencies that have been shown to be so effective.
    If the POS is leftmost within its constituent, then very often the lexical item is sensitive to the governing category to which it is attaching.
    For example, if the POS is a preposition, then its probability of expanding to a particular word is very different if it is attaching to a noun phrase than if it is attaching to a verb phrase, and perhaps quite different depending on the head of the constituent to wh
