    In the case of perfects therefore, the relation between Eb and Ea is correspondingly indirect.13 The following example illustrates the case where 0 = and ETb = RTb.
    12. a. John played the piano. b. Mary played the kazoo.
    Sentence 12a. evokes a new event entity Ea describable as the event of John playing the piano.
    Since the tense of (12b) is simple past, ETb = RTb.
    Given 130(Cb,Ea, RTb) = Eb, then Eb is interpreted as coextensive with Ea.
    (Whether this is further interpreted as two simultaneous events or a single event of their playing a duet depends on context and, perhaps, world knowledge as well.)
    This is illustrated in Figure 4.
    Example 8 (repeated here) illustrates the case /30 where ETb &lt; RTb. be described as having bought some flowers.
    This is shown in Figure 7.
    8. a. John went to the hospital. b.
    He had twisted his ankle on a patch of ice.
    Clause 8a. evokes an entity Ea describable as John's going to the hospital.
    Since 8b is past perfect, ETb &l
