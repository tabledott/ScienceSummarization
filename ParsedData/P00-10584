G cannot, but because it does everything that CFG can, only more cleanly.
    (This is where the analogy with (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) breaks down.)
    Thus certain possibilities which were not apparent in a PCFG framework or prohibitively complicated might become simple to implement in a PTAG framework; we conclude by offering two such possibilities.
  
  
    The formalism we use is a variant of lexicalized tree-insertion grammar (LTIG), which is in turn a restriction of LTAG (Schabes and Waters, 1995).
    In this variant there are three kinds of elementary tree: initial, (predicative) auxiliary, and modifier, and three composition operations: substitution, adjunction, and sister-adjunction.
    Auxiliary trees and adjunction are restricted as in TIG: essentially, no wrapping adjunction or anything equivalent to wrapping adjunction is allowed.
    Sister-adjunction is not an operation found in standard definitions of TAG, but is borrowed from D-Tree Grammar (Rambow et al., 1995).
