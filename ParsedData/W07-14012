l entailment will finally lead to the development of entailment &#8220;engines&#8221;, which can be used as a standard module in many applications (similar to the role of part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers in current NLP applications).
    In the following sections, a detailed description of RTE-3 is presented.
    After a quick review of the previous challenges (1.2), section 2 describes the preparation of the dataset.
    In section 3 the evaluation process and the results are presented, together with an analysis of the performance of the participating systems.
