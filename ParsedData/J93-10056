will call simply &amp;quot;the parser.&amp;quot; The parser produces a single partial syntactic description of a sentence.
    Consider Example 2, and its parsed representation in Example 3.
    The information in the tree representation is partial in the sense that some attachment information is missing: the nodes dominated by &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; have not been integrated into the syntactic representation.
    Note in particular that many PPs have not been attached.
    This is a symptom of the fact that the parser does not (in many cases) have the kind of lexical information that we have just claimed is required in resolving PP attachment.
    Example 2 The radical changes in export and customs regulations evidently are aimed at remedying an extreme shortage of consumer goods in the Soviet Union and assuaging citizens angry over the scarcity of such basic items as soap and windshield wipers.
    From the syntactic analysis provided by the parser, we extracted a table containing the heads of all noun phrase
