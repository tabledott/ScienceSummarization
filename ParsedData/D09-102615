s of tags describing many of the web&#8217;s most popular and useful pages.
    However, not all tags are uniformly appropriate at all places within a document.
    In the sections that follow, we examine mechanisms by which Labeled LDA&#8217;s credit assignment mechanism can be utilized to help support browsing and summarizing tagged document collections.
    To create a consistent dataset for experimenting with our model, we selected 20 tags of medium to high frequency from a collection of documents dataset crawled from del.icio.us, a popular social bookmarking website (Heymann et al., 2008).
    From that larger dataset, we selected uniformly at random four thousand documents that contained at least one of the 20 tags, and then filtered each document&#8217;s tag set by removing tags not present in our tag set.
    After filtering, the resulting corpus averaged 781 non-stop words per document, with each document having 4 distinct tags on average.
    In contrast to many existing text datasets, our tagged co
