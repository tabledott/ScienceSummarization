erwise the data at the more frequent slot overwhelms the data at the less frequent slot.
    However, many alternations involve scFs with substantially different relative frequencies, especially when one SCF is specific to a particular preposition.
    We carried out some experiments using the MDL method and our Tcms.
    For the causative, we used a sample of 110 verbs and obtained 63% accuracy.
    For the conative, a sample of 16 verbs was used and this time accuracy was only 56%.
    Notably, only one negative decision was made because of the disparate frame frequencies, which reduces the cost of combining the argument head data.
  
  
    We have discovered a significant relationship between the similarity of selectional preferences at the target slots, and participation in the causative and conative alternations.
    A threshold, such as the mean or median can be used to obtain a level of accuracy well above the baseline.
    A lemma based similarity score does not always indicate a significant relation
