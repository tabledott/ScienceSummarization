n.
    We calculated Kendall&#8217;s tau as: num concordant pairs - num discordant pairs total pairs where a concordant pair is a pair of two translations of the same segment in which the ranks calculated from the same human ranking task and from the corresponding metric scores agree; in a discordant pair, they disagree.
    In order to account for accuracy- vs. Segment-level correlation for translations out of English error-based metrics correctly, counts of concordant vs. discordant pairs were calculated specific to these two metric types.
    The possible values of T range between 1 (where all pairs are concordant) and &#8722;1 (where all pairs are discordant).
    Thus an automatic evaluation metric with a higher value for T is making predictions that are more similar to the human judgments than an automatic evaluation metric with a lower T. We did not include cases where the human ranking was tied for two systems.
    As the metrics produce absolute scores, compared to five relative ranks in the human as
