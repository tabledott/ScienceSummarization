 might be more useful in a real system: in such a system some of the alternatives would be totally erroneous.
    Since the corresponding syntactic tuples would typically not be found in the corpora, they would be eliminated by our module.
    The experiment is described in detail in the following subsections.
    It provides an example for a thorough evaluation that is carried out without having a complete system available.
    We specifically describe the processing of the Hebrew data, which was performed by a professional translator, supervised by the authors.
    The German examples were processed very similarly.
    To locate ambiguous words, we simulated a bilingual lexicon and syntactic filters of a translation system.
    For every source language word, the translator searched all possible translations using a Hebrew&#8211;English dictionary (Alcalay 1990).
    The list of translations proposed by the dictionary was modified according to the following guidelines, to reflect better the lexicon of a pra
