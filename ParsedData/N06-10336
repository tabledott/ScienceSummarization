esulting item again has two boundary words.
    Later we add Pr(held  |Powell) when the resulting item is combined with &#65533; Powell &#65533;&#65533;&#65533; Powell form an S item.
    As illustrated in Figure 2, VPP-VP has contiguous spans on both source and target sides, so that we can generate a binary-branching SCFG: In this case m-gram integrated decoding can be done in O(|w|3+4(m&#8722;1)) time which is much lowerorder polynomial and no longer depends on rule size (Wu, 1996), allowing the search to be much faster and more accurate facing pruning, as is evidenced in the Hiero system of Chiang (2005) where he restricts the hierarchical phrases to be a binary SCFG.
    The benefit of binary grammars also lies in synchronous parsing (alignment).
    Wu (1997) shows that parsing a binary SCFG is in O(|w|6) while parsing SCFG is NP-hard in general (Satta and Peserico, 2005).
    The same reasoning applies to tree transducer rules.
    Suppose we have the following tree-to-string rules, following Galley et
