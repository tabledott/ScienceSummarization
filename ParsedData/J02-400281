serve that verb information is rarely used in current practical natural language applications.
    Most tasks such as information extraction and document classification identify and use nominal constructs instead (e.g., noun phrases, TF*IDF words and phrases).
    The verb clusters we employ were created using our intuition of which type of verb similarity would be useful in the genre and for the task.
    There are good reasons for using such a hand-crafted, genre-specific verb lexicon instead of a general resource such as WordNet or Levin&#8217;s (1993) classes: Many verbs used in the domain of scientific argumentation have assumed a specialized meaning, which our lexicon readily encodes.
    Klavans and Kan&#8217;s classes, which are based on Levin&#8217;s classes, are also manually created.
    Resnik and Diab (2000) present yet other measures of verb similarity, which could be used to arrive at a more data-driven definition of verb classes.
    We are currently comparing our verb clusterings to Klavans a
