le ongoing stories like the SARS crisis tend to produce very large and unfocused clusters.
    To extract likely paraphrase sentence pairs from these clusters, we used edit distance (Levenshtein 1966) over words, comparing all sentences pairwise within a cluster to find the minimal number of word insertions and deletions transforming the first sentence into the second.
    Each sentence was normalized to lower case, and the pairs were filtered to reject: A total of 139K non-identical sentence pairs were obtained.
    Mean Levenshtein distance was 5.17; mean sentence length was 18.6 words.
    To this corpus we applied the word alignment algorithms available in Giza++ (Och &amp; Ney, 2000), a freely available implementation of IBM Models 1-5 (Brown, 1993) and the HMM alignment (Vogel et al, 1996), along with various improvements and modifications motivated by experimentation by Och &amp; Ney (2000).
    In order to capture the many-to-many alignments that identify correspondences between idioms and other phras
