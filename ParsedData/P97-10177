for the best path through a WFSA instead of the best sequence (i.e., the same sequence does not receive bonus points for appearing more than once).
  
  
    This section describes how we designed and built each of our five models.
    For consistency, we continue to print written English word sequences in italics (golf ball), English sound sequences in all capitals (G AA I. F B AO 1..).
    Japanese sound sequences in lower case (g or uhubo or u) and katakana sequences naturally (=* A- 7 7ti &#8212; ) The first model generates scored word sequences, the idea being that ice cream should score higher than Ice creme, which should score higher than aice kreem.
    We adopted a simple unigram scoring method that multiplies the scores of the known words and phrases in a sequence.
    Our 262,000-entry frequency list draws its words and phrases from the Wall Street Journal corpus. an online English name list, and an online gazeteer of place names.2 A portion of the WFSA looks like this: An ideal word sequence model
