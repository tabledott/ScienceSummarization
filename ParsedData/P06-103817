formed in-depth evaluation on two languages, English and Russian, using three corpora, two for English and one for Russian.
    The first English corpus is the BNC, containing about 100M words.
    The second English corpus, Dmoz (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2005), is a web corpus obtained by crawling and cleaning the URLs in the Open Directory Project (dmoz.org), resulting in 68GB containing about 8.2G words from 50M web pages.
    The Russian corpus was assembled from many web sites and carefully filtered for duplicates, to yield 33GB and 4G words.
    It is a varied corpus comprising literature, technical texts, news, newsgroups, etc.
    As a preliminary sanity-check test we also applied our method to smaller corpora in Danish, Irish and Portuguese, and noted some substantial similarities in the discovered patterns.
    For example, in all 5 languages the pattern corresponding to &#8216;x and y&#8217; was among the 50 selected.
    The thresholds TH, TC, TP, ZT, ZB, were determined by memory size consider
