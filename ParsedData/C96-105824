  How- ever, Tables 1 2 show pilot results for a small set of data drawn from that corpus.
  (The full resnlts show substantially better performance, e.g., 93% correct tags and 87% correct parents fbr model C, but appear qualitatively similar.)
  The pilot experiment was conducted on a subset of 4772 of the sentences comprising 93,a~0 words and punctuation marks.
  The corpus was derived by semi-automatic means from the Penn Tree- bank; only sentences without conjunction were available (mean length=20, max=68).
  A ran- domly selected set of 400 sentences was set aside for testing all models; the rest were used to esti- mate the model parameters.
  In the pilot (unlike the full experiment), the parser was instructed to "back oil" from all probabilities with denomina- tors &lt; 10.
  For this reason, the models were insen- sitive to most lexical distinctions.
  In addition to models A, B, and C, described above, the pilot experiment evaluated two other models for comparison.
  Model C was a version of m
