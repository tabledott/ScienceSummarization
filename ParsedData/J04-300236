be greater than the maximum precision of its constituents.
    This criterion is used to avoid selecting unnecessarily long collocations.
    For example, scumbag is a strongly subjective clue.
    If be a scumbag does not have higher precision than scumbag alone, we do not want to select it.
    Specifically, let (W1, W2) be a bigram consisting of consecutive words W1 and W2.
    (W1,W2) is identified as a potential subjective element if prec(W1,W2) &#8805; 0.1 and: For trigrams, we extend the second condition as follows.
    Let (W1, W2, W3) be a trigram consisting of consecutive words W1, W2, and W3.
    The condition is then The selection of 4-grams is similar to the selection of 3-grams, comparing the 4-gram first with the maximum of the precisions of word W1 and trigram (W2, W3, W4) and then with the maximum of the precisions of trigram (W1,W2,W3) and word W4.
    We call the n-gram collocations identified as above fixed-n-grams.
    We also define a type of collocation called a unique generalized n-gra
