    For each of these three classifiers, Table 5 shows the percentage of articles which are misclassified by more than one grade level.

    Although this index is commonly used, perhaps due to its simplicity, it is not accurate enough for the intended application.
    Our SVM classifier also outperforms the Lexile metric.
    Lexile is a more general measure while our classifier is trained on this particular domain, so the better performance of our model is not entirely surprising.
    Importantly, however, our classifier is easily tuned to any corpus of interest.
    To test our classifier on data outside the Weekly Reader corpus, we downloaded 10 randomly selected newspaper articles from the &#8220;Kidspost&#8221; edition of The Washington Post (2005).
