ribution (conditioned on the head word) with the unlexicalized EVG smoothed-skip-head model.
  
  
    Klein and Manning (2004) strongly emphasize the importance of smart initialization in getting good performance from DMV.
    The likelihood function is full of local maxima and different initial parameter values yield vastly different quality solutions.
    They offer what they call a &#8220;harmonic initializer&#8221; which initializes the attachment probabilities to favor arguments that appear more closely in the data.
    This starts EM in a state preferring shorter attachments.
    Since our goal is to expand the model to incorporate lexical information, we want an initialization scheme which does not depend on the details of DMV.
    The method we use is to create M sets of B random initial settings and to run VB some small number of iterations (40 in all our experiments) for each initial setting.
    For each of the M sets, the model with the best free energy of the B runs is then run out until converg
