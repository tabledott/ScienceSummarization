    In a broader context, this paper promotes the combination of statistical and linguistic models in natural language processing.
    It provides an example of how a problem can be first defined in detailed linguistic terms, using an implemented linguistic tool (a syntactic parser, in our case).
    Then, having a well-defined linguistic scenario, we apply a suitable statistical model to highly informative linguistic structures.
    According to this view, a complex task, such as machine translation, should be first decomposed on a linguistic basis.
    Then, appropriate statistical models can be developed for each sub-problem.
    We believe that this approach provides a beneficial compromise between two extremes in natural language processing: either using linguistic models that ignore quantitative information, or using statistical models that are linguistically ignorant.
