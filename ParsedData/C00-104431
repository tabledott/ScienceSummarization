  In fact, the results in "Iable 3 show that the pre- dictability of the automatically determined gradability and polarity sets is better than or at least comparable to the predictability of the manually determined sets.
  Thus, tile oriented and gradable adjectives in the particular ap- plication genre can be idenlified fo," use in subjectivity recognition.
  Ou, efforts in this paper are largely exploratory, aim- ing to establish correlations among tim wlrious features examined.
  In related work, we have begun to incorporale the features developed herc into systems for recognizing flames and mining reviews in lnternel forums, extend- ing subjectivity judgments froth the sentence to the doc- ument level.
  In addition, we are seeking ways lo extend the orientation and gradability methods o that individual word occurrences, rather than word lypes, are character- ized as oriented or gradable.
