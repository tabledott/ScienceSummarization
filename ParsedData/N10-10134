solated target word singer our method produces the most similar word vocalist, while using a single prototype gives musician.
    Given the word cell in the context: &#8220;The book was published while Piasecki was still in prison, and a copy was delivered to his cell.&#8221; the standard approach produces protein while our method yields incarcerated.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives relevant background on prototype and exemplar methods for lexical semantics, Section 3 presents our multi-prototype method, Section 4 presents our experimental evaluations, Section 5 discusses future work, and Section 6 concludes.
  
  
    Psychological concept models can be roughly divided into two classes: crete set of observed instances, similar to nonparametric approaches to density estimation in statistics (Ashby and Alfonso-Reese, 1995).
    Tversky and Gati (1982) famously showed that conceptual similarity violates the triangle inequality, lending evidence for exemplar-based models i
