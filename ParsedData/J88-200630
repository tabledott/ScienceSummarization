created in recognition of an embedded narrative; or 2. it will return to the entity previously labeled TF, after completing an embedded narrative.
    Such movements are described in Section 3.3.2.
    Other movements, signaled by temporal adverbials and when clauses, are not discussed in this paper.14
  
  
    The following pair of examples illustrate maintenance and local movement of TF within a discourse segment and its link with E/S structure construction.
    The first I discussed in the previous section to illustrate el ,-conseq&#8226; The second is a variation on that example: First consider Example 13.
    The first clause (13a) evokes an event entity Ea describable as John's going into the florist shop.
    Since its tense is simple past, Ea is interpreted as prior to ST.
    Since it begins the discourse, its status is special vis-a-vis both definite NPs and tensed clauses.
    That is, since no previous TF will have been established yet, the listener takes that entity Ea to serve as TF.'
