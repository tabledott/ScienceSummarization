rminal symbol pair such as xly a couple.
    The null symbol e means that no output token is generated.
    We call x/&#8364; an Li-singleton, and cly an L2-singleton.
    Consider the simple transduction grammar fragment shown in Figure 1(a).
    (It will become apparent below why we explicitly include brackets around right-hand sides containing nonterminals, which are usually omitted with standard CFGs.)
    The simple transduction grammar can generate, for instance, the following pair of English and Chinese sentences in translation: Notice that each nonterminal derives two substrings, one in each language.
    The two substrings are counterparts of each other.
    In fact, it is natural to write the parse trees together: (2) E[E[The/e [Financial/14V Secretary/ni [NN Ni' and /fl fi/RINP INP [be/&#8364; accountable/ftrtivv [vp [sr &#8226;/.
    Is Of course, in general, simple transduction grammars are not very useful, precisely because they require the two languages to share exactly the same grammatical str
