 its accuracy is not significantly different from that of VSM (p = 0.239), whereas it is better than that of PMI-IR-06 (p = 0.043; even the bottom model, LexDM, is significantly better than the random guesser, p = 0.004).
    TypeDM is at least as good as LRA when the latter is trained on the same data and smoothed with our method, suggesting that the excellent performance of Turney&#8217;s version of LRA (LRA-06) is due to the fact that he used a much larger corpus, and/or to his more sophisticated smoothing technique, and not to the specific way in which LRA collects corpus-based statistics.
    All the algorithms with higher accuracy than TypeDM are based on much larger input corpora, except BagPack, which is, however, supervised.
    The LSA system of Quesada, Mangalath, and Kintsch (2004), which performs similarly to TypeDM, is based on a smaller corpus, but it relies on hand-coded &#8220;analogy domains&#8221; that are represented by lists of manually selected characteristic words.
