 been validated empirically.
    Recently, combination techniques have been investigated for part of speech tagging with positive results (van Halteren et al., 1998; Brill and Wu, 1998).
    In both cases the investigators were able to achieve significant improvements over the previous best tagging results.
    Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997) and named entity recognition (Borthwick et al., 1998).
    The corpus-based statistical parsing community has many fast and accurate automated parsing systems, including systems produced by Collins (1997), Charniak (1997) and Ratnaparkhi (1997).
    These three parsers have given the best reported parsing results on the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).
    We used these three parsers to explore parser combination techniques.
  
  
    We are interested in combining the substructures of the input parses to produce a better parse.
    We call this appro
