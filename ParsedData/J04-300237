m (ugen-ngram).
    Such collocations have placeholders for unique words.
    As will be seen below, these are our highest-precision features.
    To find and select such generalized collocations, we first find every word that appears just once in the corpus and replace it with a new word, UNIQUE (but remembering the part of speech of the original word).
    In essence, we treat the set of single-instance words as a single, frequently occurring word (which occurs with various parts of speech).
    Precisely the same method used for extracting and selecting n-grams above is used to obtain the potentially subjective collocations with one or more positions filled by a UNIQUE, part-of-speech pair.
    To test the ugen-n-grams extracted from the subjective-element training data using the method outlined above, we assess their precision with respect to opinion piece data.
    As with the training data, all unique words in the test data are replaced by UNIQUE.
    When a ugen-n-gram is matched against the test data,
