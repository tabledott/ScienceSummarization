    4.1 Analysis by error type and PCFG-enrichment fixes Multilevel VP adjunction errors (Figure 5) are common in models without parent annotation, although even with parent annotation the presence of VP coordination would give multilevel VP adjunction nonzero probability.
    We address this error by taking advantage of the CTB's principled VP annotation practices, marking adjunction, complementation, and coordination VP levels, which builds the flat adjunction constraint back into the structure of the head daughter.
    NP-NP modification, depicted in NNM&#177; in Figure 4, was the most common error seen; the greater prevalence of false positives is likely a result of the overall PCFG parsing preference for flatter structures.
    This type of parse ambiguity is grounded in the semantic ambiguity of compound noun interpretation.
