			h( f t, e?)||2 C is used to clip the amount of updates.A single oracle with 1-best translation is analyti cally solved without a QP-solver and is represented as the following perceptron-like update (Shimizu and Haas, 2006): ? = max ? ?
			0, min ? ?
			C, L(e?, e?; et) ?

			si( f t, e?)

			h( f t, e?)||2 ? ?
			Intuitively, the update amount is controlled by themargin and the loss between the correct and incorrect translations and by the closeness of two transla tions in terms of feature vectors.
			Indeed, Liang et al (2006) employed an averaged perceptron algorithm in which ? value was always set to one.
			Tillmann and Zhang (2006) used a different update style based on a convex loss function: ? = ?L(e?, e?; et) ?max ( 0, 1 ?
