e set of senses.
    From a similar perspective, de Loupy et al. (de Loupy et al., 1998) also investigated the potential advantages of using HMMs for disambiguation.
    More recently, variants of the generative HMM have been applied to WSD (Molina et al., 2002; Molina et al., 2004) and evaluated also on Senseval data, showing performance comparable to the first sense baseline.
    Previous work on prediction at the supersense level (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005) has focused on lexical acquisition (nouns exclusively), thus aiming at word type classification rather than tagging.
    As far as applications are concerned, it has been shown that supersense information can support supervised WSD, by providing a partial disambiguation step (Ciaramita et al., 2003).
    In syntactic parse re-ranking supersenses have been used to build useful latent semantic features (Koo and Collins, 2005).
    We believe that supersense tagging has the potential to be useful, in combination with other sources of inform
