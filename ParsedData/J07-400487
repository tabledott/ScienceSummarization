ed to the number of categories in the chart, and a more restrictive setting of the supertagger was reverted to if the limit was exceeded.
    In this article we consider the opposite approach: Start with a very restrictive setting of the supertagger, and only assign more categories if the parser cannot find an analysis spanning the sentence.
    In this way the parser interacts much more closely with the supertagger.
    In effect, the parser is using the grammar to decide if the categories provided by the supertagger are acceptable, and if not the parser requests more categories.
    The advantage of this adaptive supertagging approach is that parsing speeds are much higher, without any corresponding loss in accuracy.
    Section 10.3 gives results for the speed of the parser.
    The algorithm used to build the packed charts is the CKY chart parsing algorithm (Kasami 1965; Younger 1967) described in Steedman (2000).
    The CKY algorithm applies naturally to CCG because the grammar is binary.
    It builds
