 al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996) try to model word-to-word corresl)ondences between source and target words using an alignment nmpl)ing from source l)osition j to target position i = aj.
  We can rewrite tim t)robal)ility Pr(fille~) t) 3, in- troducing the hidden alignments ai 1 := al ...aj...a.l (aj C {0 , .

  j -1  I~ = E H Pr(fj ajlf i -"al e l ) q, j=l To allow fbr French words wlfich do not directly cor- respond to any English word an artificial empty word c0 is added to the target sentence at position i=0.
  The different alignment models we present pro- vide different decoInt)ositions of Pr(f~,a~le().
  An alignnlent 5~ for which holds a~ = argmax Pr(fi , al[eI) at for a specific model is called V i terb i  al ignment of" this model.
  In this paper we will describe extensions to tile Hidden-Markov alignment model froln (Vogel et al., 1.996) and compare tlmse to Models 1 - 4 of (Brown et al., 1993).
  We t)roI)ose to measure the quality of an alignment nlodel
