PP3 and PP4 is set to zero.
    The reader should not confuse the undirected arcs in a constraint network with the directed modification links in a dependency diagram.
    An arc in a constraint network represents the existence of a binary constraint between two nodes, and has nothing to do with the modifier-modifiee relationships.
    The possible modification relationships are represented as the modifiee part of the domain values in a constraint network.
    A constraint network contains all the information needed to produce the parsing results.
    No grammatical knowledge is necessary to recover parse trees from a constraint network.
    A simple backtrack search can generate the 14 parse trees of sentence (5) from the constraint network shown in Figure 5 at any time.
    Therefore, we regard a constraint network as a packed representation of parsing results.
    Filtering A constraint network is said to be arc consistent if, for any constraint matrix, there are no rows and no columns that contain only ze
