and the spelling clues yields a significantly better result than using each clue by itself.
    A total of 185 correct lexical entries are learned with a corpus score of 38.6%.
    Adding in the other scores, however, does not seem to be beneficial: only adding the frequency clue to the spelling clue provides some improvement.
    In all other cases, these scores are not helpful.
    Besides this linear combination of scores from the different clues, more sophisticated methods may be possible [Koehn, 2002].
  
  
    We have attempted to learn a one-to-one translation lexicon purely from unrelated monolingual corpora.
    Using identically spelled words proved to be a good starting point.
    Beyond this, we examined four different clues.
    Two of them, matching similar spelled words and words with the same context, helped us to learn a significant number of additional correct lexical entries.
    Our experiments have been restricted to nouns.
    Verbs, adjectives, adverbs and other part of speech may be t
