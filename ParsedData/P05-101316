.
    However, it can be noted that the results for the least informative encoding, Path, are almost comparable, while the third encoding, Head, gives substantially worse results for both data sets.
    We also see that the increase in the size of the label sets for Head and Head+Path is far below the theoretical upper bounds given in Table 1.
    The increase is generally higher for PDT than for DDT, which indicates a greater diversity in non-projective constructions.
  
  
    The second experiment is limited to data from PDT.5 The training part of the treebank was projectivized under different encoding schemes and used to train memory-based dependency parsers, which were run on the test part of the treebank, consisting of 7,507 sentences and 125,713 tokens.6 The inverse transformation was applied to the output of the parsers and the result compared to the gold standard test set.
    Table 5 shows the overall parsing accuracy attained with the three different encoding schemes, compared to the baseline (no s
