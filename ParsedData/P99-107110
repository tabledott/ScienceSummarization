 to a DSYNT representation.
    Functional words (determiners and auxiliaries) are eliminated from the tree and the corresponding syntactic features are updated.
    The comparison algorithm starts with all sentence trees rooted at verbs from the input DSYNT, and traverses them recursively: if two nodes are identical, they are added to the output tree, and their children are compared.
    Once a full phrase (a verb with at least two constituents) has been found, it is added to the intersection.
    If nodes are not identical, the algorithm tries to apply an appropriate paraphrasing rule from a set of rules described in the next section.
    For example, if the phrases &amp;quot;group of students&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;students&amp;quot; are compared, then the omit empty head rule is applicable, since &amp;quot;group&amp;quot; is an empty noun and can be dropped from the comparison, leaving two identical words, &amp;quot;students&amp;quot;.
    If there is no applicable paraphrasing rule, then the comparison
