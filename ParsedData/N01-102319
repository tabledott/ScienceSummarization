of representations and the complexity of sentences that are found in the Penn Treebank.
    (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) combine unlabeled and labeled data for parsing with a view towards language modeling applications.
    The goal in their work is not to get the right bracketing or dependencies but to reduce the word error rate in a speech recognizer.
    Our approach is closely related to previous CoTraining methods (Yarowsky, 1995; Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Goldman and Zhou, 2000; Collins and Singer, 1999).
    (Yarowsky, 1995) first introduced an iterative method for increasing a small set of seed data used to disambiguate dual word senses by exploiting the constraint that in a segment of discourse only one sense of a word is used.
    This use of unlabeled data improved performance of the disambiguator above that of purely supervised methods.
    (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) further embellish this approach and gave it the name of CoTraining.
    Their definition of Co-Training includes the notion (exploited i
