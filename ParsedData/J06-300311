    Budanitsky and Hirst (2001) describe semantic relatedness as follows: Recent research on the topic in computational linguistics has emphasized the perspective of semantic relatedness of two lexemes in a lexical resource, or its inverse, semantic distance.
    It&#8217;s important to note that semantic relatedness is a more general concept than similarity; similar entities are usually assumed to be related by virtue of their likeness (bank&#8211;trust company), but dissimilar entities may also be semantically related by lexical relationships such as meronymy (car&#8211;wheel) and antonymy (hot&#8211;cold), or just by any kind of functional relationship or frequent association (pencil&#8211;paper, penguin&#8211;Antarctica).
    As these examples show, semantic relatedness is the same as attributional similarity (e.g., hot and cold are both kinds of temperature, pencil and paper are both used for writing).
    Here we prefer to use the term attributional similar
