 two adjectives are similar, we expect a large number of concordances, and a small number of discordances.
    Kendall's T is defined as where pc and pd are the probabilities of observing a concordance or discordance respectively.
    T ranges from -1 to +1, with +1 indicating complete concordance, -1 complete discordance, and 0 no correlation between X and Y.
    An unbiased estimator oft is the statistic where n is the number of paired observations in the sample and C and Q are the numbers of observed concordances and discordances respectively (Wayne, 1990).
    We compute T for each pair of adjectives, adjusting for possible ties in the values of each variable, so that our statistic remains an unbiased estimator of T. We determine concordances and discordances by sorting the pairs of observations (noun frequencies) on one of the variables (adjectives), and computing how many of the (3) pairs of paired observations agree or disagree with the expected order on the other adjective.
    We normalize the result
