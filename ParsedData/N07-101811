			This section completes the description of the Gibbssampler for (t, ?) by describing a dynamic program ming algorithm for sampling trees from the set ofparses for a string generated by a PCFG.
			This algorithm appears fairly widely known: it was de scribed by Goodman (1998) and Finkel et al(2006)and used by Ding et al(2005), and is very simi lar to other dynamic programming algorithms forCFGs, so we only summarize it here.
			The algorithm consists of two steps.
			The first step con structs a standard ?inside?
			table or chart, as used in the Inside-Outside algorithm for PCFGs (Lari and Young, 1990).
			The second step involves a recursion from larger to smaller strings, sampling from theproductions that expand each string and construct ing the corresponding tree in a top-down fashion.
			In this section we take w to be a
