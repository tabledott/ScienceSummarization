    These errors are caused by the noise present in the automatically learned dictionaries and by the use of a weak word alignment model for extracting the classifier BLEU scores of the Chinese-English MT systems using bootstrapping. features.
    In an automatically learned dictionary, many words (especially the frequent, non-content ones) will have a lot of spurious translations.
    The IBM-1 alignment model takes no account of word order and allows a source word to be connected to arbitrarily many target words.
    Alignments computed using this model and a noisy, automatically learned, dictionary will contain many incorrect links.
    Thus, if two sentences share several content words, these incorrect links together with the correct links between the common content words will yield an alignment good enough to make the classifier judge the sentence pair as parallel.
    The effect of th
