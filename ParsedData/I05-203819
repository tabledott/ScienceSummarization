			The GENIA term corpus annotates the full form of a techni cal term whose part is omitted in the surface as an attribute of the ?&lt;cons&gt;?
			element indicating a technical term (Kim et al, 2003).
			In the above mentioned Pennsylvania corpus, a similar mechanism (?chaining?)
			is used for recovering the full form of named entities.
			However, in both corpora, no such information is available outside the terms/entities.
			The cases where scope of modification in coordinated phrases is problematic are few but they are more difficult in abstracts than in gen eral texts because the resolution of ambiguity needs domain knowledge.
			If term/entity annota tion is already done, that information can help resolve this type of ambiguity, but again the problem is that outside the terms/entities such information is not available.
			It would be practi cal to have the structure flat but specially marked when the tree an
