uages, our approach can even significantly improve over a hierarchical phrase-based baseline system.
    As far as we know, we are the first to show that such reordering rules benefit several SOV languages.
    We believe our rules are flexible and can cover many linguistic reordering phenomena.
    The format of our rules also makes it possible to automatically extract rules from word aligned corpora.
    In the future, we plan to investigate along this direction and extend the rules to languages other than SOV.
    The preprocessing reordering like ours is known to be sensitive to parser errors.
    Some preliminary error analysis already show that indeed some sentences suffer from parser errors.
    In the recent years, several studies have tried to address this issue by using a word lattice instead of one reordering as input (Zhang et.al., 2007; Li et.al., 2007; Elming, 2008).
    Although there is clearly room for improvements, we also feel that using one reordering during training may not be good enough
