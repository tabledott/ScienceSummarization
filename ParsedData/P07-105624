    We also showed how to correct structural correspondence misalignments by using a small amount of labeled target domain data.
    Second, we provided a method for selecting those source domains most likely to adapt well to given target domains.
    The unsupervised A-distance measure of divergence between domains correlates well with loss due to adaptation.
    Thus we can use the Adistance to select source domains to label which will give low target domain error.
    In the future, we wish to include some of the more recent advances in sentiment classification, as well as addressing the more realistic problem of ranking.
    We are also actively searching for a larger and more varied set of domains on which to test our techniques.
