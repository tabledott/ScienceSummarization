 especially suited for NLP problems, where class distributions are often highly skewed and the number of classes (e.g. in WSI) is not known beforehand.
    To relate the partitions, it is possible to set up a hierarchical version of CW in the following way: The nodes of equal class are joined to hyper-nodes.
    Edge weights between hyper-nodes are set according to the number of inter-class edges between the corresponding nodes.
    This results in flat hierarchies.
    In further works it is planned to apply CW to other graphs, such as the co-citation graph of Citeseer, the co-citation graph of web pages and the link structure of Wikipedia.
  
  
    Thanks go to Stefan Bordag for kindly providing his WSI evaluation framework.
    Further, the author would like to thank Sebastian Gottwald and Rocco Gwizdziel for a platform-independent GUI implementation of CW, which is available for download from the author&#8217;s homepage.
