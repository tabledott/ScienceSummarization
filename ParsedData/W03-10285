ist of four tokens or more, and the longest keywords have eight tokens.
    Secondly, the user must state how many keywords to extract from each document, as both algorithms, for each potential keyword, output the probability of the term being a keyword.
    This could be solved by manually setting a threshold value for the probability, but this decision should preferably be made by the extraction system.
    Finding potential terms&#8212;when no machine learning is involved in the process&#8212;by means of POS patterns is a common approach.
    For example, Barker and Cornacchia (2000) discuss an algorithm where the number of words and the frequency of a noun phrase, as well as the frequency of the head noun is used to determine what terms are keywords.
    An extraction system called LinkIT (see e.g., Evans et al. (2000)) compiles the phrases having a noun as the head, and then ranks these according to the heads&#8217; frequency.
    Boguraev and Kennedy (1999) extract technical terms based on the noun phra
