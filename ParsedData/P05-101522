abel preferences, but replace PSP with the term-overlap-based cosine (TO(cos)), performance often drops significantly.
    This result, which is in accordance with Section 4&#8217;s data, suggests that choosing an item similarity function that correlates well with label similarity is important.
    (ovaPSP ovaTO(cos) [3c]; regPSPregTO(cos) [4c]) Q: Could you explain that notation, please?
    A: Triangles point toward the significantly better algorithm for some dataset.
    For instance, &#8220;M N [3c]&#8221; means, &#8220;In the 3-class task, method M is significantly better than N for two author datasets and significantly worse for one dataset (so the algorithms were statistically indistinguishable on the remaining dataset)&#8221;.
    When the algorithms being compared are statistically indistinguishable on Average ten-fold cross-validation accuracies.
