 docu ments the same predicates are described.
			However,it is hard to collect broad-scale comparable cor pora, as the majority of texts are non-comparable.
			A complementary approach is learning from the abundant regular, non-comparable, corpora.
			Yet,in such corpora it is harder to recognize varia tions of the same predicate.
			The DIRT algorithm(Lin and Pantel, 2001) learns non-directional binary rules for templates that are paths in a depen dency parse-tree between two noun variables X and Y . The similarity between two templates t and t ? is the geometric average: DIRT (t, t ? ) = ? Lin x (t, t ? ) ? Lin y (t, t ? ) where Lin xis the Lin similarity between X?s in stantiations of t and X?s instantiations of t ? in a corpus (equivalently for Lin y ).
			Some workstake the combination of the two variable instantiations in each template occurrence as a single complex feature, e.g. {X-Y =?SCO-IBM?}, and com pare between these complex features of t and t ?
