the present system perhaps casts a small ray of light in this area.
    As we have already noted, MDL analysis makes clear what the two areas are in which an analysis can be judged: it can be judged in its ability to deal with the data, as measured by its ability to compress the data, and it can be judged on its complexity as a theory.
    While the former view is undoubtedly controversial when viewed from the light of mainstream linguistics, it is the prospect of being able to say something about the complexity of a theory that is potentially the most exciting.
    Even more importantly, to the extent that we can make these notions explicit, we stand a chance of being able to develop an explicit model of language acquisition employing these ideas.
    A natural question to ask is whether the algorithm presented here is intended to be understood as a hypothesis regarding the way in which human beings acquire morphology.
    I have not employed, in the design of this algorithm, a great deal of innate knowledge
