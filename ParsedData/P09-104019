eater than the 2n of the strictly projective transition system Sp.
    We have chosen to display results for Arabic and Danish because they are the two extremes in our sample.
    Arabic has the smallest variance and the smallest linear coefficients, and Danish has the largest variance and the largest coefficients.
    The remaining three languages all lie somewhere in the middle, with Czech being closer to Arabic and Slovene closer to Danish.
    Together, the evidence from all five languages strongly corroborates the hypothesis that the expected running time for the system Su is linear in sentence length for naturally occurring data.
    In order to assess the parsing accuracy that can be achieved with the new transition system, we trained a deterministic parser using the new transition system Su for each of the five languages.
    For comparison, we also trained two parsers using Sp, one that is strictly projective and one that uses the pseudo-projective parsing technique to recover non-projective dependen
