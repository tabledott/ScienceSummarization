., 2005a; Carreras, 2007), so we will not attempt to give a exhaustive description of the features in this section.
    Rather, we describe our features at a high level and concentrate on our methodology and motivations.
    In our experiments, we employed two different feature sets: a baseline feature set which draws upon &#8220;normal&#8221; information sources such as word forms and parts of speech, and a cluster-based feature set that also uses information derived from the Brown cluster hierarchy.
    Our first-order baseline feature set is similar to the feature set of McDonald et al. (2005a), and consists of indicator functions for combinations of words and parts of speech for the head and modifier of each dependency, as well as certain contextual tokens.1 Our second-order baseline features are the same as those of Carreras (2007) and include indicators for triples of part of speech tags for sibling interactions and grandparent interactions, as well as additional bigram features based on pairs of words
