 the same event, event coreference is processed and, based on the results, templettes are merged when necessary.
    The IE architecture in Figure 7(a) may be compared with the IE architecture with cascaded FSA represented in Figure 7(b) and reported in (Surdeanu and Harabagiu, 2002).
    Both architectures share the same NER, coreference and merging modules.
    Specific to the FSA-based architecture are the phrasal parser, which identifies simple phrases such as basic noun or verb phrases (some of them domain specific), the combiner, which builds domain-dependent complex phrases, and the event recognizer, which detects the domain-specific Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) patterns.
    An example of a pattern used by the FSA-based architecture is: DEATH-CAUSE KILL-VERB PERSON, where DEATH-CAUSE may identify more than 20 lexemes, e.g. wreck, catastrophe, malpractice, and more than 20 verbs are KILL-VERBS, e.g. murder, execute, behead, slay.
    Most importantly, each pattern must recognize up to 26 syntactic variati
