amining documents of all lengths, he finds that relevant documents tend to have more TextTiles than nonrelevant ones (95% significant by a Mann Whitney test).
    As another example of an innovative application, van der Eijk (1994) suggests using TextTiles to align parallel multilingual text corpora according to the overlap in their subtopic structure for English, German, and French text.
    This work, along with that of Nomoto and Nitta (1994), on Japanese, and Hasnah (1996), on Arabic, also provides evidence that TextTiling is applicable to a wide range of natural languages.
    There are several ways that the algorithms could be modified to attempt to improve the results.
    One way is to use thesaural relations in addition to term repetition to make better estimates about the cohesiveness of the discussion.
    Earlier work (Hearst 1993) incorporated thesaural information into the algorithms, but later experiments found that this information degrades the performance.
    This could very well be due to p
