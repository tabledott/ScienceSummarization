ependency forest is a dependency graph with two additional properties: Figure 1 shows a dependency forest taken from PDT.
    It has two roots: node 2 (corresponding to the complementizer proto) and node 8 (corresponding to the final punctuation mark).
    Some authors extend dependency forests by a special root node with position 0, and add an edge (0, i) for every root node i of the remaining graph (McDonald et al., 2005).
    This ensures that the extended graph always is a tree.
    Although such a definition can be useful, we do not follow it here, since it obscures the distinction between projectivity and planarity to be discussed in section 3.
    In contrast to acyclicity and the indegree constraint, both of which impose restrictions on the dependency relation as such, the projectivity constraint concerns the interaction between the dependency relation and the positions of the nodes in the sentence: it says that the nodes in a subtree of a dependency graph must form an interval, where an interval (wit
