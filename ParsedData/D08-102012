ent analysis, we will use only the first question (&#8220;On a scale of 1 to 5, how well written is this text?&#8221;).
    The score of an article was then the average of all the ratings it received.
    The article scores ranged from 1.5 to 4.33, with a mean of 3.2008 and a standard deviation of .7242.
    The median score was 3.286.
    We define our task as predicting this average rating for each article.
    Note that this task may be more difficult than predicting reading level, as each of these articles appeared in the Wall Street Journal and thus is aimed at the same target audience.
    We suspected that in classifying adult text, more subtle features might be necessary.
  
  
    We first computed the Pearson correlation coefficients between the simple metrics that most traditional readability formulas use and the average human ratings.
    These results are shown in Table 1.
    We tested the average number of characters per word, average number of words per sentence, maximum number of words per se
