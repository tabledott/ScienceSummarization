fic effects.
    In particular, the arc-eager strategy inherent not only in the arc-eager, stack-based algorithm but also in both versions of the list-based algorithm appears to be suboptimal for some languages and syntactic representations.
    In such cases, using the arc-standard parsing strategy, with or without pseudo-projective parsing, may lead to significantly higher accuracy.
    More research is needed to determine exactly which properties of linguistic structures and their syntactic analysis give rise to these effects.
    On the whole, however, the four algorithms investigated in this article give very similar performance both in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and several previous studies have shown that both the stack-based and the list-based algorithms can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy together with properly trained classifiers (Nivre et al. 2006; Nivre 2007; Hall et al.
    2007).
