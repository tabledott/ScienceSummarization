 a mention-pair model is a classifier that decides whether or not an active mention mk is coreferent with a candidate antecedent mj.
    Each instance i(mj, mk) represents mj and mk and consists of the 39 features shown in Table 1.
    These features have largely been employed by state-of-the-art learning-based coreference systems (e.g., Soon et al. (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002b), Bengtson and Roth (2008)), and are computed automatically.
    As can be seen, the features are divided into four blocks.
    The first two blocks consist of features that describe the properties of mj and mk, respectively, and the last two blocks of features describe the relationship between mj and mk.
    The classification associated with a training instance is either positive or negative, depending on whether mj and mk are coreferent.
    If one training instance were created from each pair of mentions, the negative instances would significantly outnumber the positives, yielding a skewed class distribution that will typically hav
