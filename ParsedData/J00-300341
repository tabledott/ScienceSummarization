can be inspected to help in understanding the role of different features and feature combinations.
    To illustrate one area in which prosody could aid our classification task, we applied trees to DA classifications known to be ambiguous from words alone.
    One frequent example in our corpus was the distinction between BACKCHANNELS and AGREEMENTS (see Table 2), which share terms such as right and yeah.
    As shown in Figure 3, a prosodic tree trained on this task revealed that agreements have consistently longer durations and greater energy (as reflected by the SNR measure) than do backchannels.
    The HMM framework requires that we compute prosodic likelihoods of the form P(F, I Lii) for each utterance Ut and associated prosodic feature values F. We have the apparent difficulty that decision trees (as well as other classifiers, such as neural networks) give estimates for the posterior probabilities, P(UT).
    The problem can be overcome by applying Bayes' rule locally: Note that P(F) does not depend on
