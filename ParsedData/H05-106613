t is well known that projective dependency pars ing using edge based factorization can be handledwith the Eisner algorithm (Eisner, 1996).
			This algorithm has a runtime of O(n3) and has been employed successfully in both generative and discrimi native parsing models (Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005).
			Furthermore, it is trivial to show that the Eisner algorithm solves the maximum projective spanning tree problem.
			The Eisner algorithm differs significantly from the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm.
			First of all, it is abottom-up dynamic programming algorithm as opposed to a greedy recursive one.
			A bottom-up al gorithm is necessary for the projective case since it must maintain the nested structural constraint, which is unnecessary for the non-projective case.
			2.3 Dependency Trees as MSTs: Summary.
			In the preceding discussion, we have shown that nat ural language dependency parsing can be reduced to finding maximum spanning trees in directed graphs.This reduction results from edge-based factoriz
