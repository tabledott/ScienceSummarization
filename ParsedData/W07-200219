usters (e.g. random2 is a random choice between two clusters).
			Random2 is only 0.1 below MFS, but as the number of clusters increases some clusters don?t get mapped, and the recall of the random baselines decrease.
	
	
			The evaluation of clustering solutions is not straightforward.
			All measures have some bias towards cer tain clustering strategy, and this is one of the reasonsof adding the supervised evaluation as a complemen tary information to the more standard unsupervised evaluation.In our case, we noticed that the FScore penal ized the systems with a high number of clusters, and favored those that induce less senses.
			Given the fact that FScore tries to balance precision (higher for large numbers of clusters) and recall (higher for small numbers of clusters), this was not expected.
			We were also surprised to see that no system could 11 System Supervised evaluation random2 78.6 random10 77.6 ramdom100 64.2 random1000 31.8 Table 7: Supervised evaluation of several random baselines.beat the ?one
