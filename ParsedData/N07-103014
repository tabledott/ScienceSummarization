    The other thing to note is that the results in general provide a lot of room for improvement &#8212; this is true for other state-of-the-art systems as well.
    The integer programming formulation we provide here has qualities which address both of these issues.
    In particular, we define two objective functions for coreference resolution to be optimized with ILP.
    The first uses only information from the coreference classifier (COREF-ILP) and the second integrates both anaphoricity and coreference in a joint formulation (JOINT-ILP).
    Our problem formulation and use of ILP are based on both (Roth and Yih, 2004) and (Barzilay and Lapata, 2006).
    For solving the ILP problem, we use lp solve, an open-source linear programming solver which implements the simplex and the Branch-and-Bound methods.3 In practice, each test document is process
