ve speed and quality of the BP approximation?
    (2) How helpful are such higherorder factors&#8212;particularly for non-projective parsing, where BP is needed to make them tractable?
    (3) Do our global constraints (e.g., TREE) contribute to the goodness of BP&#8217;s approximation?
    We built a first-order projective parser&#8212;one that uses only factors PTREE and LINK&#8212;and then compared the cost of incorporating second-order factors, GRAND and CHILDSEQ, by BP versus DP.28 Under DP, the first-order runtime of O(n3) is increased to O(n4) with GRAND, and to O(n5) when we add CHILDSEQ as well.
    BP keeps runtime down to O(n3)&#8212;although with a higher constant factor, since it takes several rounds to converge, and since it computes more than just the best parse.29 Figures 2&#8211;3 compare the empirical runtimes for various input sentence lengths.
    With only the GRAND factor, exact DP can still find the Viterbi parse (though not the MBR parse29) faster than ten iterations of the asymptotica
