uential relations between different types of emails (e.g., between requests and satisfactions thereof) to classify messages, and thus also explicitly exploit the structure of conversations.
    Previous sentiment-analysis work in different domains has considered inter-document similarity (Agarwal and Bhattacharyya, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2005; Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) or explicit inter-document references in the form of hyperlinks (Agrawal et al., 2003).
    Notable early papers on graph-based semisupervised learning include Blum and Chawla (2001), Bansal et al. (2002), Kondor and Lafferty (2002), and Joachims (2003).
    Zhu (2005) maintains a survey of this area.
    Recently, several alternative, often quite sophisticated approaches to collective classification have been proposed (Neville and Jensen, 2000; Lafferty et al., 2001; Getoor et al., 2002; Taskar et al., 2002; Taskar et al., 2003; Taskar et al., 2004; McCallum and Wellner, 2004).
    It would be interesting to investigate the application of such meth
