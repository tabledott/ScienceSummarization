often, in my experience, deflect the learning algorithm from discovering a correct two-letter suffix (e.g., the suffix -al in French).
    Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language De Marcken (1995) addresses a similar but distinct task, that of determining the correct breaking of a continuous stream of segments into distinct words.
    This problem has been addressed in the context of Asian (Chinese-Japanese-Korean) languages, where standard orthography does not include white space between words, and it has been discussed in the context of language acquisition as well.
    De Marcken describes an unsupervised learning algorithm for the development of a lexicon using a minimum description length framework.
    He applies the algorithm to a written corpus of Chinese, as well as to written and spoken corpora of English (the English text has had the spaces between words removed), and his effort inspired the work reported here.
    De Marcken's algorithm begins by taking all individu
