al., 2003; Venugopal et al., 2003) have delivered state-of-the-art performance on standard translation tasks.
    In this paper, we present a phrase-based unigram system similar to the one in (Tillmann and Xia, 2003), which is extended by an unigram orientation model.
    The units of translation are blocks, pairs of phrases without internal structure.
    Fig.
    1 shows an example block translation using five Arabic-English blocks .
    The unigram orientation model is trained from word-aligned training data.
    During decoding, we view translation as a block segmentation process, where the input sentence is segmented from left to right and the target sentence is generated from bottom to top, one block at a time.
    A monotone block sequence is generated except for the possibility to swap a pair of neighbor blocks.
    The novel orientation model is used to assist the block swapping: as shown in section 3, block swapping where only a trigram language model is used to compute probabilities between neighbo
