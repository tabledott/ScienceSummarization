trates ZKL?s insensitivity with regard to the parameter setting for the MarkovLink model.
			sulting in a final stationary distribution with more (and more meaningful) zero/non-zero pairs.
			Hence the proper setting of gamma (or alpha for skew divergence) is of greater importance.
			ZKL?s performance improves with tuning of gamma, but cosine similarity remained the more robust measure for these distributions.
	
	
			In this paper, we have introduced a new measure oflexical relatedness based on the divergence of the sta tionary distributions computed from random walks overgraphs extracted WordNet.
			We have explored the structural properties of extracted semantic graphs and characterized the distinctly different types of stationary distribu tions that result.
			We explored several distance measures on these distributions, including ZKL, a novel variant of KL-divergence.
			Our best relatedness measure is at the limit of human inter-annotator agreement and is one of the strongest measures of semantic relate
