    The learning algorithm is given a set of input sentences and their corresponding meaning representations, and learns a statistical semantic parser &#8212; a set of rules mapping lexical items and syntactic patterns to their meaning representation and a score associated with each rule.
    Given a sentence, these rules are applied recursively to derive the most probable meaning representation.
    Since semantic interpretation is limited to syntactic patterns identified in the training data, the learning algorithm requires considerable amounts of annotated data to account for the syntactic variations associated with the meaning representation.
    Annotating sentences with their MR is a difficult, time
