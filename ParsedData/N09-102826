stems we copy from Table 3.
    Here again, we mark any blindtest BLEU score that is better than the corresponding hierarchical system with confidence level above 95%.
    Note that the hierarchical systems can not use the maximum entropy based lexicalized phrase reordering models.
    Except for Hindi, applying the precedence reordering rules in a hierarchical system can achieve statistically significant improvements over a normal hierarchical system.
    We conjecture that this may be because of the simplicity of our reordering rules.
    Other than the reordering phenomena covered by our rules in Table 1, there could be still some local or long distance reordering.
    Therefore, using a hierarchical phrase-based system can improve those cases.
    Another possible reason is that after the reordering rules apply in preprocessing, English sentences in the training data are very close to the SOV order.
    As a result, EM training becomes much easier and word alignment quality becomes better.
    Therefore,
