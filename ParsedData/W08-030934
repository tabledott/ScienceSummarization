 in anyway.
    The reason for this is that altered systems will produce different translations than the ones that we have judged, so our relative rankings of sentences will no longer be applicable.
    However, the translations of short phrases are more likely to be repeated than the translations of whole sentences.
    Therefore if we collect a large number of yes/no judgments for short phrases, we could build up a database that contains information about what fragmentary translations are acceptable for each sentence in our test corpus.
    When we change our system and want to evaluate it, we do not need to manually evaluate those segments that match against the database, and could instead have people evaluate only those phrasal translations which are new.
    Accumulating these judgments over time would give a very reliable idea of what alternative translations were allowable.
    This would be useful because it could alleviate the problems associated with Bleu failing to recognize allowable variation in
