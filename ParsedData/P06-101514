) and r&#960;(p) are recursively defined, where r&#953;(i) = 1 for the manually supplied seed instances.
    Generic patterns are high recall / low precision patterns (e.g, the pattern &#8220;X of Y&#8221; can ambiguously refer to a part-of, is-a and possession relations).
    Using them blindly increases system recall while dramatically reducing precision.
    Minimally supervised algorithms have typically ignored them for this reason.
    Only heavily supervised approaches, like (Girju et al. 2006) have successfully exploited them.
    Espresso&#8217;s recall can be significantly increased by automatically separating correct instances extracted by generic patterns from incorrect ones.
    The challenge is to harness the expressive power of the generic patterns while remaining minimally supervised.
    The intuition behind our method is that in a very large corpus, like the Web, correct instances of a generic pattern will be instantiated by many of Espresso&#8217;s reliable patterns accepted in P. Recall tha
