    Preliminary studies indicate that reliability for human tagging is higher for AVM attribute tagging than for other types of discourse segment tagging (Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996). utterances that contribute to the success of the whole dialogue, such as greetings, are tagged with all the attributes.
    Since the structure of a dialogue reflects the structure of the task (Carberry, 1989; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Litman and Allen, 1990), the tagging of a dialogue by the AVM attributes can be used to generate a hierarchical discourse structure such as that shown in Figure 4 for Dialogue 1 (Figure 2).
    For example, segment (subdialogue) S2 in Figure 4 is about both depart-city (DC) and arrivalcity (AC).
    It contains segments S3 and S4 within it, and consists of utterances UI ... U6.
    Tagging by AVM attributes is required to calculate costs over subdialogues, since for any subdialogue, task attributes define the subdialogue.
    For subdialogue S4
