t is possible to employ the standard evaluation techniques for parsing directly to an evaluation of summarization quality.
    A parsingbased evaluation allows us to measure the semantic aspects of summarization quality in terms of grammaticalfunctional information provided by deep parsers.
    Furthermore, human expertise was necessary only for the creation of condensed versions of sentences, and for the manual disambiguation of parses assigned to those sentences.
    Given such a gold standard, summarization quality of a system can be evaluated automatically and repeatedly by matching the structures of the system output against the gold standard structures.
    The standard metrics of precision, recall, and F-score from statistical parsing can be used as evaluation metrics for measuring matching quality: Precision measures the number of matching structural items in the parses of the system output and the gold standard, out of all structural items in the system output&#8217;s parse; recall measures the numbe
