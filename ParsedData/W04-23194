rity to the style of interaction in the ICSI meetings.
    We found that SWBD-DAMSL [11], a system adapted from DAMSL [6], provided a fairly good fit.
    Although our meetings were natural, and thus had real agenda items, the dialog was less like human-human or human-machine task-oriented dialog added in MRDA.
    Tags in italics are based on the SWBD-DAMSL version but have had meanings modified for MRDA.
    The ordering of tags in the table is explained as follows: In the mapping of DAMSL tags to SWBD-DAMSL tags in the SWBDDAMSL manual, tags were ordered in categories such as &#8220;Communication Status&#8221;, &#8220;Information Requests&#8221;, and so on.
    In the mapping of MRDA tags to SWBD-DAMSL tags here, we have retained the same overall ordering of tags within the table, but we do not explicitly mark the higher-level SWBD-DAMSL categories in order to avoid confusion, since categorical structure differs in the two systems (see [7]).
