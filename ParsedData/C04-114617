 of the biashigh score for every measure calculated over the set of high frequency nouns and over the set of low frequency nouns.
			The standard deviations (not shown) all lie in the range [0,0.2].
			Any deviation from 0.5 of greater than 0.0234 is significant at the 1% level.
			For all measures and both sets of target nouns, there appear to be strong tendencies toselect neighbours of particular frequencies.
			Further, there appears to be three classes of mea sures: those that select high frequency nouns as neighbours regardless of the frequency of thetarget noun (cm, js, ?, cp andR); those that select low frequency nouns as neighbours regard less of the frequency of the target noun (P); and those that select nouns of a similar frequency to the target noun (ja, ja+mi, lin and hm).This can also be considered in terms of distri butional generality.
			By definition, recall preferswords that have occurred in more of the con texts that the target noun has, regardless of whether it occurs in other contexts as
