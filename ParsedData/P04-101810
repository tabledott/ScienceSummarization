 features are derived from parse trees output from a maximum entropy parser (Ratnaparkhi,1997).
    The &#8220;Count&#8221; feature calculates how many times a mention string is seen.
    For pronominal mentions, attributes such as gender, number, possessiveness and reflexiveness are also used.
    Apart from basic features in Table 1, composite features can be generated by taking conjunction of basic features.
    For example, a distance feature together with reflexiveness of a pronoun mention can help to capture that the antecedent of a reflexive pronoun is often closer than that of a non-reflexive pronoun.
    The same set of basic features in Table 1 is used in the entity-mention model, but feature definitions are slightly different.
    Lexical features, including the acronym features, and the apposition feature are computed by testing any mention in the entity against the active mention .
    Editing distance for is defined as the minimum distance over any non-pronoun mentions and the active mention.
