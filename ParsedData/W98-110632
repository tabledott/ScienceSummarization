    For example, we would merge all patterns triggered by a specific verb in its passive voice.
    For example, the patterns &amp;quot;&lt;subject&gt; was kidnapped&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;was kidnapped by &lt;noun-phrase&gt;&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;was kidnapped in &lt;noun-phrase&gt;&amp;quot; would be merged into a single case frame.
    Similarly, we would merge all patterns triggered by a specific verb in its active voice.
    For example, we would merge patterns for the active form of &amp;quot;destroyed&amp;quot; that extract the subject of &amp;quot;destroyed&amp;quot;, its direct object, and any prepositional phrases that are associated with it.
    We also merge syntactically compatible patterns that are triggered by the same noun (e.g., &amp;quot;assassination&amp;quot;) or by the same infinitive verb structure (e.g., &amp;quot;to kill&amp;quot;).
    When we merge extraction patterns into a case frame, all of the slots are simply unioned together.
