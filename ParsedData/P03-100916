 the latter (e.g.
    IB with K = 42 is 9% better).
    Clearly, allowing for multiple gold standard classes makes it easier to obtain better results with evaluation.
    In order to show that polysemy makes a nontrivial contribution in shaping the clusters, we measured the improvement that can be due to pure chance by creating randomly polysemous gold standards.
    We constructed 100 sets of random gold standards.
    In each iteration, the verbs kept their original predominant senses, but the set of additional senses was taken entirely from another verb - chosen at random.
    By doing so, we preserved the dominant sense of each verb, the total frequency of all senses and the correlations between the additional senses.
    The results included in table 3 indicate, with 99.5% confidence (3Q and above), that the improvement obtained with the polysemous gold standard is not artificial (except in two cases with 95% confidence).
    We performed qualitative analysis to further investigate the effect of polysemy
