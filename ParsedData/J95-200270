eaves nonterminals remaining after n steps, goes to 0 as n oo.
    More loosely speaking, rewriting S has to terminate after a finite number of steps with probability 1, or else the grammar is inconsistent.
    We observe that the same property holds not only for S, but for all nonterminals, if the grammar has no useless terminals.
    If any nonterminal X admitted infinite derivations with nonzero probability, then S itself would have such derivations, since by assumption X is reachable from S with nonzero probability.
    To prove the existence of RL and Ru, it is sufficient to show that the corresponding geometric series converge: Lemma 5 If G is a proper, consistent SCFG without useless nonterminals, then the powers FL' of the left-corner relation, and PIZ of the unit production relation, converge to zero as n oo.
    Entry (X, Y) in the left-corner matrix PL is the probability of generating Y as the immediately succeeding left-corner below X.
    Similarly, entry (X, Y) in the nth power PI! is the probab
