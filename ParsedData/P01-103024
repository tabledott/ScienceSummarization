 2&#8212;the translation accuracy is affected only slightly.
    In contrast, the translation speed increases with at least one order of magnitude.
    Depending on the application of interest, one may choose to use a slow decoder that provides optimal results or a fast, greedy decoder that provides non-optimal, but acceptable results.
    One may also run the greedy decoder using a time threshold, as any instance of anytime algorithm.
    When the threshold is set to one second per sentence (the greedylabel in Table 1), the performance is affected only slightly.
