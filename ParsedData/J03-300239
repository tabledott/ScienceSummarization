f resemblance (r), as defined by Broder et al. (1997) for the problem of monolingual duplicate detection, except that tsim has the advantage of being token-based rather than typebased, incorporating word frequency.
    We have demonstrated that the tsim score can be used to extract translationally equivalent English-Chinese sentence pairs from even a noisy space with high precision (Smith 2002).
    It was also shown that combining multiple sources of word-level translation information (dictionaries, word-to-word translation models, cognates) had positive effects on performance on the sentence-matching task.
    These information sources were presumed to be extremely noisy (they are so presumed here, as well), though no independent evaluation was carried out on them.
    If the ad hoc translation lexicon induction techniques used here give good performance, then better techniques might lead to further improvement.
    In addition, the competitive linking approximation was shown to perform nearly as well as MC
