ies on an assumption about the way in which relevant patterns are distributed in a document collection and may learn patterns which tend to occur in the same documents as relevant ones whether or not they are actually relevant.
    For example, we could imagine an IE scenario in which relevant documents contain a piece of information which is related to, but distinct from, the information we aim to extract.
    If patterns expressing this information were more likely to occur in relevant documents than irrelevant ones the documentcentric approach would also learn the irrelevant patterns.
    Rather than focusing on the documents matched by a pattern, an alternative approach is to rank patterns according to how similar their meanings are to those which are known to be relevant.
    This semantic-similarity approach avoids the problem which may be present in the document-centric approach since patterns which happen to co-occur in the same documents as relevant ones but have different meanings will not be ranked
