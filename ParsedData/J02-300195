ly related predicates.
    We will present results at different, successively broader levels of generalization, making use of the categorization of FrameNet predicates into frames and more general semantic domains.
    We first turn to using data from the appropriate frame when no data for the target word are available.
    Table 19 shows results for various probability distributions using a division of training and test data constructed such that no target words are in common.
    Every tenth target word was included in the test set.
    The amount of training data available for each frame varied, from just one target word in some cases to 167 target words in the &#8220;perception/noise&#8221; frame.
    The training set contained a total of 75,919 frame elements and the test set 7,801 frame elements.
    Performance broken down by abstract role.
    The third column represents accuracy when frame element boundaries are given to the system, and the fourth and fifth columns reflect finding the boundaries auto
