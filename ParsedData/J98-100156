 members of this set of words behave very differently in context: volcano is strongly related to ash, but has little or no relation to the other words in the set.
    Similarity-based methods Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993, Dagan, Pereira, and Lee 1994, and Grishman and Sterling 1993 exploit the same idea of grouping observations for similar words, but without regrouping them into fixed classes.
    Each word has a potentially different set of similar words.
    Like many class-based methods, such as Brown et al. (1992), similarity-based methods exploit a similarity metric between patterns of co-occurrence.
    Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch (1993) give the following example: the pair (chapter, describes) does not appear in their corpus; however, chapter is similar to book, introduction, and section, which are paired with describes in the corpus.
    On the other hand, the words similar to book are books, documentation, and manuals (see their Figure 1).
