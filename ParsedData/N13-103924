    The full tagger attains 93.2% accuracy (final row of Table 2).
    To facilitate comparisons with previous work, we ran a series of experiments training only on OCT27&#8217;s training and development sets, then report test results on both OCT27TEST and all of DAILY547, shown in Table 2.
    Our tagger achieves substantially higher accuracy than Gimpel et al. (2011).17 Feature ablation.
    A number of ablation tests indicate the word clusters are a very strong source of lexical knowledge.
    When dropping the tag dictionaries and name lists, the word clusters maintain most of the accuracy (row 2).
    If we drop the clusters and rely only on tag dictionaries and namelists, accuracy decreases significantly (row 3).
    In fact, we can remove all observation features except for word clusters&#8212;no word features, orthographic fea17These numbers differ slightly from those reported by Gimpel et al., due to the corrections we made to the OCT27 data, noted in Section 5.1.
    We retrained and eval
