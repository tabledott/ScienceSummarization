    Distant Supervision with Topic Models: To model unlabeled entities and their possible types, we apply LabeledLDA (Ramage et al., 2009), constraining each entity&#8217;s distribution over topics based on its set of possible types according to Freebase.
    In contrast to previous weakly supervised approaches to Named Entity Classification, for example the CoTraining and Naive Bayes (EM) models of Collins and Singer (1999), LabeledLDA models each entity string as a mixture of types rather than using a single hidden variable to represent the type of each mention.
    This allows information about an entity&#8217;s distribution over types to be shared across mentions, naturally handling ambiguous entity strings whose mentions could refer to different types.
    Each entity string in our data is associated with a bag of words found within a context window around all of its mentions, and also within the entity itself.
