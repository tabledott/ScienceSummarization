tical and rule-based systems.
    Due to many similarly performing systems, we are not able to draw strong conclusions on the question of correlation of manual and automatic evaluation metrics.
    The bias of automatic methods in favor of statistical systems seems to be less pronounced on out-of-domain test data.
    The manual evaluation of scoring translation on a graded scale from 1&#8211;5 seems to be very hard to perform.
    Replacing this with an ranked evaluation seems to be more suitable.
    Human judges also pointed out difficulties with the evaluation of long sentences.
