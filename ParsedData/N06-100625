 occurs; rather, weights are set by hand, according to human intuition.
    Finally, &#8220;learning&#8221; describes experiments in which all features are on, and feature weights are trained on the development data.
    The 4Each RTE problem is also tagged as belonging to one of seven tasks.
    Previous work (Raina et al., 2005) has shown that conditioning on task can significantly improve accuracy.
    In this work, however, we ignore the task variable, and none of the results shown in table 2 reflect optimization by task. figures reported for development data performance therefore reflect overfitting; while such results are not a fair measure of overall performance, they can help us assess the adequacy of our feature set: if our features have failed to capture relevant aspects of the problem, we should expect poor performance even when overfitting.
    It is therefore encouraging to see CWS above 70%.
    Finally, the figures reported for test data performance are the fairest basis for comparison.
