 the same underlying formalism, whose values are simply computed in different semirings.
    Other semirings lead to other interesting values.
    For HMMs, notice that the forward values are simply the forward inside values; the backward values are the reverse values of the inside semiring; and Viterbi values are the forward values of the Viterbi semiring.
    For NFAs, we can use the Boolean semiring to determine whether a string is in the language of an NFA; we can use the counting semiring to determine how many state sequences there are in the NFA for a given string; and we can use the derivation forest semiring to get a compact representation of all state sequences in an NFA for an input string.
    A single item-based description can be used to find all of these values.
    For language modeling, it may be useful to compute the prefix probability of a string.
    That is, given a string wn, we may wish to know the total probability of all sentences beginning with that string, where 01 vk represent words
