that depends only on the values of items in earlier buckets.
    For the final case, in which x is associated with a looping bucket, infinite loops may occur, when the value of two items in the same bucket are mutually dependent, or an item depends on its own value.
    These infinite loops may require computation of infinite sums.
    Still, we can express these infinite sums in a relatively simple form, allowing them to be efficiently computed or approximated.
    If an item x is not in a looping bucket, then Let us expand our notion of inner to include deduction rules: inner(a1' al) is the set of all derivation trees of the form (b: (ai .)
    (a2 .
    .)
    .
    .
    .
    (ak .
    .)).
    For any item derivation tree that is not a simple rule, there is some al ...ak,b such that D E inner(al b&amp;quot; ak).
    Thus, for any item x, Substituting this back into Equation 6, we get completing the proof.
    0 Now, we address the case in which x is an item in a looping bucket.
    This case requires co
