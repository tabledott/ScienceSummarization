nly one daughter.
    This is obvious because feature forests can represent Markov chains.
    In an analogy, CRFs correspond to HMMs, whereas feature forest models correspond to PCFGs.
    Extensions of CRFs, such as semi-Markov CRFs (Sarawagi and Cohen 2004), are also regarded as instances of feature forest models.
    This fact implies that our algorithm is applicable to not only parsing but also to other tasks.
    CRFs are now widely used for sequence-based tasks, such as parts-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition, and have been shown to achieve the best performance in various tasks (McCallum and Li 2003; McCallum, Rohanimanesh, and Sutton 2003; Pinto et al. 2003; Sha and Pereira 2003; Peng and McCallum 2004; Roark et al.
    2004; Settles 2004; Sutton, Rohanimanesh, and McCallum 2004).
    These results suggest that the method proposed in the present article will achieve high accuracy when applied to various statistical models with tree structures.
