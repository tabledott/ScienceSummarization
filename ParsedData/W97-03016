he incomplete constituent to the left.
    BUILD always processes the leftmost tree without any Start X or Join X annotation.
    Figure 5 shows an application of BUILD in which the action is Join VP.
    After BUILD, control passes to CHECK, which finds the most recently proposed constituent, and decides if it is complete.
    The most recently proposed constituent, shown in figure 6, is the rightmost sequence of trees tni .
    &#8226; &#8226; in (Tt.
    &lt; n) such that tin is annotated with Start X and t&#8222;,&#177;1 tn are annotated with Join X.
    If CHECK decides yes, then the proposed constituent takes its place in the forest as an actual constituent, on which BUILD does its work.
    Otherwise, the constituent is not finished and BUILD processes the next tree in the forest, tn+1.
    CHECK always answers no if the proposed constituent is a &amp;quot;flat&amp;quot; chunk, since such constituents must be formed in the second pass.
    Figure 7 shows the result when CHECK looks at the proposed cons
