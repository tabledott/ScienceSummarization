    For the parser we used the hybrid dependency model and the maximum recall decoder, because this obtained the highest accuracy on CCGbank, with the same parser and supertagger parameter settings as described in Section 10.2.11 The coverage of the parser on DepBank is 100%.
    The coverage of the RASP parser is also 100%: 84% of the analyses are complete parses rooted in S and the rest are obtained using a robustness technique based on fragmentary analyses (Briscoe and Carroll 2006).
    The coverage for the oracle experiments is less than 100% (around 95%) since there are some gold-standard derivations in CCGbank which the parser is unable to follow exactly, because the grammar rules used by
