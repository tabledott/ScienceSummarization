Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 2 languages and language pairs benefit from the best of both the empiricist and rationalist traditions.
    This article presents three such models, along with methods for efficiently estimating their parameters.
    Each new method is designed to account for an additional universal property of translational equivalence in bitexts: 1.
    Most word tokens translate to only one word token.
    I approximate this tendency with a one-to-one assumption.
    2.
    Most text segments are not translated word-for-word.
    I build an explicit noise model.
    3.
    Different linguistic objects have statistically different behavior in translation.
    I show a way to condition translation models on different word classes to help account for the variety Quantitative evaluation with respect to independent human judgments has shown that each of these three estimation biases significantly improves translation model accuracy over a base
