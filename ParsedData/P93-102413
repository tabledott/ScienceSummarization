e derivation so far we have treated P(nle) and p(vIc) symmetrically, corresponding to clusters not of verbs or nouns but of verb-noun associations.
    In principle such a symmetric model may be more accurate, but in this paper we will concentrate on asymmetric models in which cluster memberships are associated to just one of the components of the joint distribution and the cluster centroids are specified only by the other component.
    In particular, the model we use in our experiments has noun clusters with cluster memberships determined by p(n1c) and centroid distributions determined by p(vIc).
    The asymmetric model simplifies the estimation significantly by dealing with a single component, but it has the disadvantage that the joint distribution, p(n, v) has two different and not necessarily consistent expressions in terms of asymmetric models for the two coordinates.
    2As usual in clustering models (Duda and Hart, 1973), we assume that the model distribution and the empirical distribution are inter
