 and a list of predicates whose relative order is immaterial.
    The distinguished index identifies this as a sentence that makes a claim about a running event.
    &amp;quot;John&amp;quot; is the name of the entity that stands in the `argl ' relation to the running which took place in the past and which was fast.
    Nothing turns on these details which will differ with differing ontologies, logics, and views of semantic structure.
    What concerns us here is a procedure for generating a sentence from a structure of this general kind.
    Assume that the lexicon contains entries like those in (2) in which the italicized arguments to the semantic predicates are variables.
    (2) Words Cat Semantics John np(x) John) ran vp(x, y) argl(x, y), past(x) fast adv(x) quickly adv(x) x: fast(x) facie for the utility of these particular words for expressing ( I) can be made simply by noting that, instantiation of the variables, the semantics of each of these words subsumes (1).
