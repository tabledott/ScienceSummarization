    Their system, Termight, first extracts candidate technical terms, presenting them to a terminologist for filtering.
    Then, Termight identifies candidate translations for each occurrence of a source term by using the word alignment to find the first and last target positions aligned with any words of the source terms.
    All candidate translations for a given source term are sorted by frequency and presented to the user, along with a concordance.
    Because Termight does not use additional correlation statistics, relying instead only on the word alignment, it will find translations for infrequent terms; none of the other approaches, including Champollion, can make this claim.
    Accuracy, however, is considerably lower; the most frequent translation for a term is correct only 40% of the time (compare with Champollion's 73% accuracy).
    Since Termight is fully integrated within a translator's editor (another unique feature) and is used as an aid for human translators, it gets around the
