ucting event chronologies from this data.
  
  
    Any annotation scheme should aim to be simple enough to be executed by humans, and yet precise enough for use in various natural language processing tasks.
    Our approach (Wilson et al. 2000) has been to annotate those things that a human could be expected to tag.
    Our representation of times uses the ISO standard CC:YY:MM:DD:HH:XX:SS, with an optional time zone (ISO-8601 1997).
    In other words, time points are represented in terms of a calendric coordinate system, rather than a real number line.
    The standard also supports the representation of weeks and days of the week in the format CC:YY:Wwwd where ww specifies which week within the year (1-53) and d specifies the day of the week (1-7).
    For example, &#8220;last week&#8221; might receive the VAL 20:00:W16.
    A time (TIMEX) expression (of type TIME or DATE) representing a particular point on the ISO line, e.g., &#8220;Tuesday, November 2, 2000&#8221; (or &#8220;next Tuesday&#8221;) is repr
