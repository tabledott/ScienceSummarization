lly, the intent is to automate the process of lexical entry construction so that these errors can be avoided.
  12 The notions of demotion and promotion are not the same as the notions of demotion and advancement in the theory of relational grammar (see Perlmutter 1983).
  Dorr (1993b, pp.
  269-274) argues that, although the relational representation might be a convenient tool for illustrating the promotion and demotion operations as used in the current approach, this representation is not an appropriate vehicle for interlingual translation for a number of reasons.
  13 This relation does not mean that X replaces Z (if there is a Z), but that X retains the same structural relation with Z (i.e., Z remains an internal argument of X).
  To simplify the current description, Z is not shown in the syntactic structure of Figure 9b.
