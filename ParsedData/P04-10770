    Pearson&#8217;s Spearman&#8217;s of automatic evaluation measures vs. 4, and 12 are maximum of 1, 4, and 12 grams, NIST is the NIST ROUGE-L is LCS-based F-measure 1), ROUGE-W is weighted LCS-based F-measure = 1).
    ROUGE-S* is skip-bigram-based co-occurrence statistics with any skip distance limit, ROUGEis skip-bigram-based F-measure 1) with maximum skip distance of N, PER is position independent word error rate, and WER is word error rate.
    GTM 10, 20, and 30 are general text matcher exponents of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0.

    Correlation analysis based on two different correlastatistics, Pearson&#8217;s Spearman&#8217;s with respect to adequacy and fluency are shown in Table 1.
