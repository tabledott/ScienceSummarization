ociation between a linguistic item (left-hand side) and a non-linguistic entity (right-hand side).
    11Note that violating a discourse rule like (1) leads to more difficulty in understanding rather than clear-cut &amp;quot;ungrammaticality&amp;quot;.
    12I'm referring to the &amp;quot;surface&amp;quot; grammatical function SUBJECT.
    13The importance of SUBJECT in centering is also discussed in Grosz et. al.
    (in preparation).
    The acceptability of the Cb-shift shown in (11) above contrasts with the unacceptability of retaining the Cb with these pronominals.
    The latter in fact appeared in the above example as the nonpreferred reading of sequence (3) to (4), which is shown in (12): The following sequences in English are equivalent to those in Japanese (2) to (5): The evaluation of the third utterance parallels the Japanese example.
    This indicates that the SUBJECT-based constraint stated in (9) for Japanese is applicable to English together with all the analogous consequences discussed above
