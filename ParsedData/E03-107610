    By splitting all the words on the German side of the parallel corpus, we acquire a vast amount of splitting knowledge (for our data, this covers 75,055 different words).
    This knowledge contains for instance, that Grundrechte was split up 213 times, and kept together 17 times.
    When making splitting decisions for new texts, we follow the most frequent option based on the splitting knowledge.
    If the word has not been seen before, we use the frequency method as a back-off.
