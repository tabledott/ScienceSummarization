an English head word&#8217;s maximal span.
    This filter will eliminate constituents whose English correspondent is a head word with some (but not all) of its dependents.
    Such partial English constituents are by-products of the parsing and do not correspond to the modeled syntax.
    With good word alignments, the English parser can help disambiguate Korean phrase boundaries and overcome erroneous morphological analyses (Table 5).
    Results without and with the second filter are shown in Table 7.
    Because larger training datasets lead to larger PCFGs (with more rules), the grammar constant increases.
    Our bilingual parser implementation is on the cusp of practicality (in terms of memory requirements); when the grammar constant increased, we were unable to parse longer sentences.
    Therefore the results given for bilingual parsing are on reduced test sets, where a length filter was applied: sentences with |E |+ |F |&gt; T were removed, for varying values of T. While neither bilingual parser con
