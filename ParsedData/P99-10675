re in corresponding word order, and a low correlation when the rows and columns were in random order.
    The validity of the co-occurrence clue is obvious for parallel corpora, but &#8212; as empirically shown by Rapp &#8212; it also holds for non-parallel corpora.
    It can be expected that this clue will work best with parallel corpora, second-best with comparable corpora, and somewhat worse with unrelated corpora.
    In all three cases, the problem of robustness &#8212; as observed when applying the word-order clue to parallel corpora &#8212; is not severe.
    Transpositions of text segments have virtually no negative effect, and omissions or insertions are not critical.
    However, the co-occurrence clue when applied to comparable corpora is much weaker than the word-order clue when applied to parallel corpora, so larger corpora and well-chosen statistical methods are required.
    After an attempt with a context heterogeneity measure (Fung, 1995) for identifying word translations, Fung based her lat
