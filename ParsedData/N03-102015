ization tasks, we compute 4 different correlation statistics: Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (Spearman p), linear regression t-test (LRt, 11 degree of freedom for single document task and 13 degree of freedom for multi-document task), Pearson product moment coefficient of correlation (Pearson p), and coefficient of determination (CD) for each Ngram(i,&#65533;) evaluation metric.
    Among them Spearman p is a nonparametric test, a higher number indicates higher correlation; while the other three tests are parametric tests.
    Higher LRt, Pearson p, and CD also suggests higher linear correlation.
    Analyzing all runs according to Tables 2 and 3, we make the following observations: outperform (0.99 &#8805; Spearman p &#8805; 0.75) the weighted average of n-gram of variable length Ngram(1, 4) (0.88 &#8805; Spearman p &#8805; 0.55) in single and multiple document tasks when stopwords are ignored.
    Importantly, unigram performs especially well with Spearman p ranging from 0.88 to 0.99 that is be
