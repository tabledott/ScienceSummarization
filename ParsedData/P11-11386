    Wikipedia was first explored as an information source for named entity disambiguation and information retrieval by Bunescu and Pasca (2006).
    There, disambiguation is performed using an SVM kernel that compares the lexical context around the ambiguous named entity to the content of the candidate disambiguation&#8217;s Wikipedia page.
    However, since each ambiguous mention required a separate SVM model, the experiment was on a very limited scale.
    Mihalcea and Csomai applied Word Sense Disambiguation methods to the Disambiguation to Wikipedia task (2007).
    They experimented with two methods: (a) the lexical overlap between the Wikipedia page of the candidate disambiguations and the context of the ambiguous mention, and (b) training a Naive Bayes classiffier for each ambiguous mention, using the hyperlink information found in Wikipedia as ground truth.
    Both (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006) and (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007) fall into the local framework.
