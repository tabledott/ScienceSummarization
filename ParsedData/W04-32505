 other property worth noting is the strong influence of the brevity penalty.
    Since BLEU is a precision based method, the brevity penalty assures that a system does not only translate fragments of the test set of which it is confident, resulting in high precision.
    Is has become common practice to include a word penalty component in statistical machine translation system that gives bias to either longer or shorter output.
    This is especially relevant for the BLEU score that harshly penalizes translation output that is too short.
    To illustrate this point, see Figure 1.
    BLEU scores for both Spanish and Portuguese system drop off when a large word penalty is introduced into the translation model, forcing shorter output.
    This is not the case for a similar metric, GTM, an n-gram precision/recall metric proposed by Melamed et al. [2003] that does not have an explicit brevity penalty.
    The BLEU metric also works with multiple reference translations.
    However, we often do not have the luxur
