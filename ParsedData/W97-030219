uage processing PCFGs.
    In particular, we have found that it is more important to threshold productions than nonterminals.
    That is, rather than just noticing that a particular nonterminal VP spanning the words &amp;quot;killed the rabbit&amp;quot; is very likely, we also note that the production VP -4 V NP (and the relevant spans) is likely.
    Both the first and second pass parsing algorithms are simple variations on CKY parsing.
    In the first pass, we now keep track of each production instance associated with a node, i.e.
    A N no , computing the inside and outside probabilities of each.
    The second pass requires more changes.
    Let us denote the descendants of nonterminal X by X1...Xx.
    In the second pass, for each production 21n this paper, we will assume that each second pass nonterminal can descend from at most one first pass nonterminal in each cell.
    The grammars used here have this property.
    If this assumption is violated, multiple-pass parsing is still possible, but some
