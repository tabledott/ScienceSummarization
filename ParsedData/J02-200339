t the pair (v', n) did not occur in the training data.
    Given the set of (v, n, v') triples, the task is to decide whether (v, n) or (v', n) is the correct pair.11 We acknowledge that the task is somewhat artificial, but pseudo-disambiguation tasks of this kind are becoming popular in statistical NLP because of the ease with which training and test data can be created.
    We also feel that the pseudo-disambiguation task is useful for evaluating the different estimation methods, since it directly addresses the question of how likely a particular predicate is to take a given noun as an argument.
    An evaluation using a PP attachment task was attempted in Clark and Weir (2000), but the evaluation was limited by the relatively small size of the Penn Treebank.
    11 We note that this procedure does not guarantee that the correct pair is more likely than the incorrect pair, because of noise in the data from the parser and also because a highly plausible incorrect pair could be generated by chance.
