y to learn from large amounts of data, and their robustness when presented with unexpected inputs &#8212; would also benefit semantic analysis.
  
  
    Our integrated model represents syntax and semantics jointly using augmented parse trees.
    In these trees, the standard TREEBANK structures are augmented to convey semantic information, that is, entities and relations.
    An example of an augmented parse tree is shown in Figure 3.
    The five key facts in this example are: Here, each &amp;quot;reportable&amp;quot; name or description is identified by a &amp;quot;-r&amp;quot; suffix attached to its semantic label.
    For example, &amp;quot;per-r&amp;quot; identifies &amp;quot;Nance&amp;quot; as a named person, and &amp;quot;per-desc-r&amp;quot; identifies &amp;quot;a paid consultant to ABC News&amp;quot; as a person description.
    Other labels indicate relations among entities.
    For example, the coreference relation between &amp;quot;Nance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a paid consultant to ABC News&amp;q
