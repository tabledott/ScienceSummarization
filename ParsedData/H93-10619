 revealing deficiencies in the lexicon: not only missing words (which could be found more directly), but also missing senses and indistinguishable definitions--deficiencies that would not surface so quickly with the targeted approach.
  Since the promise of improvements in WordNet was a major motive for pursuing this research, we initially adopted the sequential approach for the bulk of our semantic tagging.
  A second advantage of the sequential pproach emerged as the work proceeded.
  One objective test of the adequacy of a lexicon is to use it to tag a sample of text, and to record the number of times it fails to have a word, or fails to have the appropriate sense for a word.
  We have found that such records for WordNet show considerable variability depend- ing on the particular passage that is tagged, but over several months the averaged estimates of its coverage have been slowly improving: coverage it is currently averaging a little better than 96%.
