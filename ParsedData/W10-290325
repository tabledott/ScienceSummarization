ally generate a set of natural language queries and response pairs {(x, r)} by executing the annotated logical forms on the database.
    Using this data we construct an automatic feedback function as described in Section 3.
    Domain knowledge Our learning approaches require an initial weight vector as input.
    In order to provide an initial starting point, we initialize the weight vector using a similar procedure to the one used in (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007) to set weights for three features and a bias term.
    The weights were developed on the training set using the feedback function to guide our choices.
    Underlying Learning Algorithms In the direct approach the base linear classifier we use is a linear kernel Support Vector Machine with squaredhinge loss.
    In the aggressive approach we define our base structured learner to be a structural Support Vector Machine with squared-hinge loss and use hamming distance as the distance function.
    We use a custom implementation to optimize the obje
