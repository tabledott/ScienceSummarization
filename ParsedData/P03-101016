e table shows that the precision (= sum of the ratios of A and B) for 1996-2001 was higher than that for 1989-1996.
    They were 0.71 for 1996-2001 and 0.44 for 1989-1996.
    This is because the English articles from 1996-2001 were translations of Japanese articles, while those from 1989-1996 were not necessarily translations as explained in Section 2.
    Although the precision for 1996-2001 was higher than that for 1989-1996, it is still too low to use them as NLP resources.
    In other words, the article alignments included many incorrect alignments.
    We want to extract alignments which will be evaluated as A or B from these noisy alignments.
    To do this, we have to sort all alignments according to some measures that determine their validity and extract highly ranked ones.
    To achieve this, AVSIM is more reliable than BM25 as is explained below.
    8The evaluations were done by the authors.
    We double checked the sample articles from 1996-2001.
    Our second checks are presented in Table 1
