a dependent verb and its candidate head.
    Unlabeled accuracy for all verbs increases from 71% to 73% and for all conjunctions from 71% to 74%.
    Unfortunately, accuracy for other word types decreases somewhat, resulting in no significant net accuracy change.
    Nevertheless, this very preliminary experiment suggests that wider-range features may be useful in improving the recognition of overall sentence structure.
    Another common verb attachment error is a switch between head and dependent verb in phrasal verb forms like dejan intrigar or qiero decir, possibly because the non-finite verb in these cases is often a main verb in training sentences.
    We need to look more carefully at verb features that may be useful here, in particular features that distinguish finite and non-finite forms.
    In doing this preliminary analysis, we noticed some inconsistencies in the reference dependency structures.
    For example, in the test sentence Lo que decia Mae West de si misma podriamos decirlo tambi&#180;en
