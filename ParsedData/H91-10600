Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights, NY 10598 The problem of quantitatively comparing tile perfor- mance of different broad-coverage rammars of En- glish has to date resisted solution.
  Prima facie, known English grammars appear to disagree strongly with each other as to the elements of even tile simplest sentences.
  For instance, the grammars of Steve Abney (Bellcore), Ezra Black (IBM), Dan Flickinger (IIewlett Packard), Claudia Gdaniec (Logos), Ralph Grishman and Tomek Strzalkowski (NYU), Phil Harrison (Boe- ing), Don tfindle (AT&amp;T), Bob Ingria (BBN), and Mitch Marcus (U. of Pennsylvania) recognize in com- mon only the following constituents, when each gram- marian provides the single parse which
