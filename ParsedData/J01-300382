    They conclude that the thesis put forth by Levin (1985) is only partially supported.
    Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi (1996) show further isolated examples meant to illustrate that lexical syntax and semantics are not in a one-to-one relation.
    Many recent results, however, seem to converge in supporting the view that the relation between lexical syntax and semantics can be usefully exploited (Aone and McKee 1996; Dorr 1997; Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg 1995; Dorr and Jones 1996; Lapata and Brew 1999; Schulte im Walde 2000; Siegel 1998; Siegel 1999).
    Our work in particular underscores the relation between the syntactic manifestations of argument structure, and lexical semantic class.
    In light of these recent successes, the conclusions in Boguraev and Briscoe (1989) are clearly too pessimistic.
    In fact, their results do not contradict the more recent ones.
    First of all, it is not the case that if an implicatio
