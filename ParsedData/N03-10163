ed, certainly in the recent statistical parsing literature, apparently because of difficulty in conceptualizing and computing effective admissible estimates.
    The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate effective ways of doing this, by precomputing grammar statistics which can be used as effective A* estimates.
    The A* formulation provides three benefits.
    First, it substantially reduces the work required to parse a sentence, without sacrificing either the optimality of the answer or the worst-case cubic time bounds on the parser.
    Second, the resulting parser is structurally simpler than a FOM-driven best-first parser.
    Finally, it allows us to easily prove the correctness of our algorithm, over a broad range of control strategies and grammar encodings.
    In this paper, we describe two methods of constructing A* bounds for PCFGs.
    One involves context summarization, which uses estimates of the sort proposed in Corazza et al. (1994), but considering richer summaries.
    The other inv
