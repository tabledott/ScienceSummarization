  Methods For Using Textual Entailment In Open-Domain Question Answering
  
    Work on the semantics of questions has argued that the relation between a question and its answer(s) can be cast in terms of logical entailment.
    In this paper, we demonstrate how computational systems to recognize entailment can be used to enhance the accuracy of current open-domain automatic question answering (Q/A) systems.
    In our experiments, we show that when textual entailment information is used to either filter or rank answers returned by a Q/A system, accuracy can be increased by as much as 20% overall.
  
  
    Open-Domain Question Answering (Q/A) systems return a textual expression, identified from a vast document collection, as a response to a question asked in natural language.
    In the quest for producing accurate answers, the open-domain Q/A problem has been cast as: (1) a pipeline of linguistic processes pertaining to the processing of questions, relevant passages and candidate answers, interconnected by
