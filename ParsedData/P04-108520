e believe this model can as well be used to capture salient interactional patterns specific to meetings with different social dynamics.
    We will next discuss our choice of a statistical model to classify sequence data that can deal with non-local label dependencies, such as the ones tested in our empirical study.
    Extensive research has targeted the problem of labeling sequence information to solve a variety of problems in natural language processing.
    Hidden Markov models (HMM) are widely used and considerably well understood models for sequence labeling.
    Their drawback is that, as most generative models, they are generally computed to maximize the joint likelihood of the training data.
    In order to define a probability distribution over the sequences of observation and labels, it is necessary to enumerate all possible sequences of observations.
    Such enumeration is generally prohibitive when the model incorporates many interacting features and long-range dependencies (the reader can find
