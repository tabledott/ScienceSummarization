ad automaton grammars or equivalent bilexical CFGs, we replace the 0(n3) algorithm of (Eisner, 1997) by one with a smaller grammar constant.
    Note that, e.g., all senses would restore the g 2 factor.
    Indeed, this approach gives added flexibility: a word's sense, unlike its choice of flip state, is visible to the HA that reads it. three models in (Collins, 1997) are susceptible to the 0(n3) method (cf.
    Collins's 0(n5)).
    Our dynamic programming techniques for cheaply attaching head information to derivations can also be exploited in parsing formalisms other than rewriting systems.
    The authors have developed an 0(n7)-time parsing algorithm for bilexicalized tree adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992), improving the naive 0(n8) method.
    The results mentioned in &#167;6 are related to the closure property of CFGs under generalized sequential machine mapping (Hoperoft and Ullman, 1979).
    This property also holds for our class of bilexical CFGs.
