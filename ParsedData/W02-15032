 and backgrounds of the project groups, the ParGram grammars achieve a high level of parallelism.
    This parallelism applies to the syntactic analyses produced, as well as to grammar development itself: the sharing of templates and feature declarations, the utilization of common techniques, and the transfer of knowledge and technology from one grammar to another.
    The ability to bundle grammar writing techniques, such as templates, into transferable technology means that new grammars can be bootstrapped in a relatively short amount of time.
    There are a number of other large-scale grammar projects in existence which we mention briefly here.
    The LS-GRAM project (Schmidt et al., 1996), funded by the EU-Commission under LRE (Linguistic Research and Engineering), was concerned with the development of grammatical resources for nine European languages: Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.
    The project started in January 1994 and ended in July 1996.
