    's (for nouns in English) and the signature NULL.ed.s (or NULL.ed.ing.$) are not assigned to single clusters.12 That is, in English both nouns and verbs freely occur with the suffixes NULL and -s, and while -ed and -'s disambiguate the two cases, it is very difficult to find a statistical and morphological basis for this knowledge.'
    Jacquemin (1997) explores an additional source of evidence regarding clustering of hypothesized segmentation of words into stems and suffixes; he notes that the hypothesis that there is a common stem gen in gene and genetic, and a common stem express in expression and expressed, is supported by the existence of small windows in corpora containing the word pair genetic.

    . expressed (as indicated, the words need not be adjacent in order to provide evidence for the relationship).
    As this example suggests, Jacquemin's work is situated within th
