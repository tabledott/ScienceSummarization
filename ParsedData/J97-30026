is of inflectional morphology (Koskenruiemi 1983), text-to-speech conversion (Kaplan and Kay 1994), and nominal, number, and temporal phrase normalization (Gazdar and Mellish 1989).
    FSTs may also be used to parse restricted classes of context-free grammars (Pereira 1991; Roche 1994; Laporte 1996).
    However, the bilingual corpus analysis tasks we consider in this paper are quite different from the tasks for which FSTs are apparently well suited.
    Our domain is broader, and the model possesses very little a priori specific structural knowledge of the language.
    As a stepping stone to inversion transduction grammars, we first consider what a context-free model known as a simple transduction grammar (Lewis and Stearns 1968) would look like.
    Simple transduction grammars (as well as inversion transduction grammars) are restricted cases of ,the general class of context-free syntax-directed transduction grammars (Aho and Ullman 1969a, 1969b, 1972); however, we will avoid the term syntax-directed here
