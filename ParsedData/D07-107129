992).
			In contrast, our ap proach is integrated into a learning framework.
	
	
			The main focus of our experiments is on the ATIS travel planning domain.
			For development, we used4978 sentences, split into a training set of 4500 ex amples, and a development set of 478 examples.
			Fortest, we used the ATIS NOV93 test set which con tains 448 examples.
			To create the annotations, wecreated a script that maps the original SQL annotations provided with the data to lambda-calculus ex pressions.
			He and Young (2006) previously reported results on the ATIS domain, using a learning approachwhich also takes sentences paired with semantic annotations as input.
			In their case, the semantic struc tures resemble context-free parses with semantic (asopposed to syntactic) non-terminal labels.
			In our experiments we have used the same split into training and test data as He and Young (2006), ensur ing that our results are directly comparable.
			He and Young (2006) report partial match figures for their parser,
