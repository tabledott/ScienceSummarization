, in press), an architecture was adopted that &amp;quot;factors out&amp;quot; language-specific elements of the algorithm.
    We have integrated RAP into McCord's (1989a, 1989b) Logic-Based Machine Translation System (LMT).
    (We are grateful to Michael McCord and Ullrike Schwa11 for their help in implementing this integration.)
    When the algorithm identifies the antecedent of a pronoun in the source language, the agreement features of the head of the NP corresponding to the antecedent in the target language are used to generate the pronoun in the target language.
    Thus, for example, neuter third person pronouns in English are mapped into pronouns with the correct gender feature in German, in which inanimate nouns are marked for gender.
    RAP operates primarily on a clausal representation of the Slot Grammar analysis of the current sentence in a text (McCord et al. 1992).
    The clausal representation consists of a set of Prolog unit clauses that provide information on the head&#8212;argument and
