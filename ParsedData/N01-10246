n, Goldsmith's algorithm is otherwise knowledge-free.
    His algorithm, Linguistica, is freely available on the Internet.
    Goldsmith applies his algorithm to various languages but evaluates in English and French.
    In our earlier work, we (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)) generated a list of N candidate suffixes and used this list to identify word pairs which share the same stem but conclude with distinct candidate suffixes.
    We then applied Latent Semantic Analysis (Deerwester, et al., 1990) as a method of automatically determining semantic relatedness between word pairs.
    Using statistics from the conditions of circumfixing or infixing, nor are they applicable to other language types such as agglutinative languages (Sproat, 1992).
    Additionally, most approaches have centered around statistics of orthographic properties.
    We had noted previously (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), however, that errors can arise from strictly orthographic systems.
    We had observed in other systems such errors as inap
