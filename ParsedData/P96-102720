ry word in the string and showing which of those words the edge covers.
    There is no longer any notion of adjacency so that there would be no indexing by string position.
    Interesting interactions occur between pairs of edges whose bit vectors have empty intersections, indicating that they cover disjoint sets of words.
    There can now be as many edges as bit-vectors and, not surprisingly, the computational complexity of the parsing process increases accordingly.
  
  
    A parser is a transducer from strings to structures or logical forms.
    A generator, for our purposes, is the inverse.
    One way to think of it, therefore, is as a parser of structures or logical forms that delivers analyses in the form of strings.
    This view has the apparent disadvantage of putting insignificant differences in the syntax of a logical forms, such as the relative order of the arguments to symmetric operators, on the same footing as more significant facts about them.
    We know that it will not generally be pos
