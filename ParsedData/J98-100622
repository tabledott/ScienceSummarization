s demonstrates that it is possible to produce accurate predictions of precision and recall as a function of for new test sets.
    When the threshold is set to a large value, precision approaches 100%.
    The criterion thus provides a way to locate those cases that can be identified automatically with very high accuracy.
    When TLC uses a high criterion for assigning senses, it can be used to augment the training examples by automatically collecting new examples from the test corpus.
    In summary, the results obtained with TLC support the following preliminary conclusions: (a) improvement with training levels off after about 100 training examples for the least frequent sense; (b) the high predictive power of local context for the verb and adjective indicate that the local parameters effectively capture syntactically mediated relations, e.g., the subject and object or complement of verbs, or the noun that an adjective modifies; (c) nouns may be more &amp;quot;topical&amp;quot; than verbs and adjectives, a
