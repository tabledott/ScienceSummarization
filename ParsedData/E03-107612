lation.
    This data was extracted from the Europarl corpus [Koehn, 20021, with the help of a German and English statistical parser.
    This limitation is purely for computational reasons, since we expect most compounds to be nouns.
    An evaluation of full sentences is expected to show similar results.
    We evaluate the performance of the described methods on a blind test set of 1000 NP/PPs, which contain 3498 words.
    Following good engineering practice, the methods have been developed with a different development test set.
    This restrains us from over-fitting to a specific test set.
    Recall that our first objective is to break up German words into parts that have a one-to-one translation correspondence to English words.
    To judge this, we manually annotated the test set with correct splits.
    Given this gold standard, we can evaluate the splits proposed by the methods.
    The results of this evaluation are given in Table 1.
    The columns in this table mean: correct split: words that sh
