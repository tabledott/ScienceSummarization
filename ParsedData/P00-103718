nguage model with our best error model gives a 73.6% error reduction compared to using a language model with the CG error model.
    Rescoring the 20-best output of the CG model instead of the 5-best only improves the 1-best accuracy from 90.9% to 91.0%.
  
  
    We have presented a new error model for noisy channel spelling correction based on generic string to string edits, and have demonstrated that it results in a significant improvement in performance compared to previous approaches.
    Without a language model, our error model gives a 52% reduction in spelling correction error rate compared to the weighted DamerauLevenshtein distance technique of Church and Gale.
    With a language model, our model gives a 74% reduction in error.
    One exciting future line of research is to explore error models that adapt to an individual or subpopulation.
    With a rich set of edits, we hope highly accurate individualized spell checking can soon become a reality.
