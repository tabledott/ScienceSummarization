ised Word Sense Induction and Discrimination (WSID, also known as corpus-based unsupervised systems) has followed this line of think ing, and tries to induce word senses directly fromthe corpus.
			Typical WSID systems involve clustering techniques, which group together similar examples.
			Given a set of induced clusters (which repre sent word uses or senses1), each new occurrence of the target word will be compared to the clusters and the most similar cluster will be selected as its sense.
			One of the problems of unsupervised systems isthat of managing to do a fair evaluation.
			Most of cur rent unsupervised systems are evaluated in-house, with a brief comparison to a re-implementation of aformer system, leading to a proliferation of unsuper vised systems with little ground to compare amongthem.
			The goal of this task is to allow for comparison across sense-induction and discrimination systems, and also to compare these systems to other su pervised and knowledge-based systems.
