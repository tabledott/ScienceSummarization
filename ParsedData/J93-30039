case study demonstrating the importance of intonational information to language understanding and generation.
    In Section 2 we review previous work on cue phrases and discuss the general problem of distinguishing between discourse and sentential uses.
    In Section 3 we introduce the theory of English intonation adopted for our prosodic analysis (Pierrehumbert 1980; Beckman and Pierrehumbert 1986).
    In Section 4 we present our initial empirical studies, which focus on the analysis of the cue phrases now and well in multispeaker spontaneous speech.
    In Section 5 we demonstrate that these results generalize to other cue phrases, presenting results of a larger and more comprehensive study: an examination of all cue phrases produced by a single speaker in a 75-minute presentation.
    Finally, in Section 6 we discuss the theoretical and practical applications of our findings.
  
  
    The critical role that cue phrases play in understanding and generating discourse has often been noted in the computati
