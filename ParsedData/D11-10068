   For all data sets we used the predefined training and testing splits.
    Our approach relies on a consistent set of partof-speech tags across languages and treebanks.
    For this we used the universal tagset from Petrov et al. (2011), which includes: NOUN (nouns), VERB (verbs), ADJ (adjectives), ADV (adverbs), PRON (pronouns), DET (determiners), ADP (prepositions orpostpositions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), PUNC (punctuation marks) and X (a catch-all tag).
    Similar tagsets are used by other studies on grammar induction and projection (Naseem et al., 2010; Zeman and Resnik, 2008).
    For all our experiments we replaced the language specific part-of-speech tags in the treebanks with these universal tags.
    Like all treebank projection studies we require a corpus of parallel text for each pair of languages we study.
    For this we used the Europarl corpus version 5 (Koehn, 2005).
    The corpus was preprocessed in standard ways and word aligned by running six iterations of
