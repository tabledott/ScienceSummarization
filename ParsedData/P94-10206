lues of the d variables.
    Let pi be the probability that the ith event (i.e., the jth possible combination of the values of all variables) occurs on any trial and let xi be the number of times that the i event occurs in the random sample.
    Then (xl, x2,.. , xg) has a multinomial distribution with parameters N and pi, ,p9.
    For a given sample size, N, the likelihood of selecting any particular random sample is defined once the population parameters, that is, the pi's or, equivalently, the E[xi]'s (where E[xi] is the mean frequency of event i), are known.
    Log-linear models express the value of the logarithm of each E[xi] or pi as a linear sum of a smaller (i.e., less than q) number of new population parameters that characterize the effects of individual variables and their interactions.
    The theory of log-linear models specifies the sufficient statistics (functions of x) for estimating the effects of each variable and of each interaction among variables on E[x].
    The sufficient statistics are
