data are well-studied data sets for discriminative word alignment (Taskar et al., 2005; Cherry and Lin, 2006; Lacoste-Julien et al., 2006).
    For this data set, it is not clear that improving alignment error rate beyond that of GIZA++ is useful for translation (Ganchev et al., 2008).
    Table 1 illustrates results for the Hansards data set.
    The first row uses dice and the same distance features as Taskar et al. (2005).
    The first two rows repeat the experiments of Taskar et al. (2005) and Cherry and Lin (2006), but adding ITG models that are trained to maximize conditional likelihood.
    The last row includes the posterior of the jointly-trained HMM of Liang et al. (2006) as a feature.
    This model alone achieves an AER of 5.4.
    No model significantly improves over the HMM alone, which is consistent with the results of Taskar et al. (2005).
    Chinese-English alignment is a much harder task than French-English alignment.
    For example, the HMM aligner achieves an AER of 20.7 when using the
