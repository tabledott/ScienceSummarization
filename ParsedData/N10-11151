    The result is a determinbest-first, which is significantly more accurate than best-first transition based parsers, and nears the performance of globally optimized parsing models.
  
  
    Dependency parsing has been a topic of active research in natural language processing in the last several years.
    An important part of this research effort are the CoNLL 2006 and 2007 shared tasks (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007), which allowed for a comparison of many algorithms and approaches for this task on many languages.
    Current dependency parsers can be categorized into three families: local-and-greedy transitionbased parsers (e.g., MALTPARSER (Nivre et al., 2006)), globally optimized graph-based parsers (e.g., MSTPARSER (McDonald et al., 2005)), and hybrid systems (e.g., (Sagae and Lavie, 2006b; Nivre and McDonald, 2008)), which combine the output of various parsers into a new and improved parse, and which are orthogonal to our approach.
    Transition-based parsers scan the input from le
