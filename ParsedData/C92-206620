capable not only to de- rive any lexicalized tree-adjoining language, but also to impose ally binary bracketing over the strings of the language.
			The latter property is important as we would like to be able to use bracketing information in the ilL- put corpus as in (Pereira and Schabes, 1992).
			The worst case complexity of tim reestimation algo- r ithm given iu Section 4 with respect o the length of the input string (O(NS)) makes this approach in gen- eral impractical for LNF grammars.
			However, if only trees of the form fit a' and a~" (or only of tile form /~' and a~) , the language generated is a context-free language and can be handled more efficiently by the reestimation algorithnL 9Adjoining constraints can be u~d in tiffs normal form, They will be reflected in the SLIG eq~vaient grammar.
			Indices have been added on S nodes in order to be able to uniquely refer to each node in the granunar.
