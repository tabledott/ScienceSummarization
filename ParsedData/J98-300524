passed through a sentence generator, implemented using the FUF / SURGE language generation system (Elhadad 1993; Robin 1994).
    FUF is a functional unification formalism that uses a large systemic grammar of English, called SURGE, to fill in syntactic constraints, build a syntactic tree, choose closed class words, and eventually linearize the tree as a sentence.
    The right side of the figure shows how proper nouns and their descriptions are extracted from past news.
    An entity extractor identifies proper nouns in the past newswire archives, along with descriptions.
    Descriptions are then categorized using the WordNet hierarchy.
    Finally, an FD or functional description (Elhadad 1993) for the description is generated so that it can be reused in fluent ways in the final summary FDs mix functional, semantic, syntactic, and lexical information in a recursive attribute-value format that serves as the basic data structure for all information within FUF /SURGE.
