ged sentences, without human engineering of complex rules.
    The recent emphasis on corpus based NLP has resulted in much work on WSD of unconstrained realworld texts.
    One line of research focuses on the use of the knowledge contained in a machine-readable dictionary to perform WSD, such as (Wilks et al., 1990; Luk, 1995).
    In contrast, LEXAS uses supervised learning from tagged sentences, which is also the approach taken by most recent work on WSD, including (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Miller et al., 1994; Leacock et al., 1993; Yarowsky, 1994; Yarowsky, 1993; Yarowsky, 1992).
    The work of (Miller et al., 1994; Leacock et al., 1993; Yarowsky, 1992) used only the unordered set of surrounding words to perform WSD, and they used statistical classifiers, neural networks, or IR-based techniques.
    The work of (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) used parts of speech (POS) and morphological form, in addition to surrounding words.
    However, the POS used are abbreviated POS, and only in a window of &#177;2 words.
