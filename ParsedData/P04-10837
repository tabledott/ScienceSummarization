    A Scan inference can fire for theth word in component for every terminal production in the grammar where appears in the th component.
    Each Scan consequent has exactly one active d-span, and that d-span always has the form because such items always span one word, so the distance between the item&#8217;s boundaries is always one.
    The Compose inference in Logic C is the same as in Melamed&#8217;s Parser A, using slightly different notation: In Logic C, the function represents the value that the grammar assigns to the nonterminal production .
    Parser C can compose two items if their labels appear on the RHS of a production rule in the grammar, and if the contiguity and relative order of their intervals is consistent with the role templates of that production rule.
    These constraints are enforced by the d-span operators and .
    Parser C is conceptually simpler than the synchronous parsers of Wu (1997), Alshawi et al. (2000), and Melamed (2003), because it uses only one kind of item, and
