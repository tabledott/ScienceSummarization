n Probability (Essen and Steinbiss, 1992), Hindle's Mutual Information(MI)-Based Measure (Hindle, 1990) and Lin's MI-Based Measure (Lin, 1998).
    Further, there is no clear way of deciding which is the best measure.
    Application-based evaluation tasks have been proposed, yet it is not clear (Weeds and Weir, 2003) whether there is or should be one distributional similarity measure which outperforms all other distributional similarity measures on all tasks and for all words.
    We take a generic approach that does not directly reduce distributional similarity to a single dimension.
    The way dimensions are combined together will depend on parameters tuned to the demands of a given application.
    Further, different parameter settings will approximate different existing similarity measures as well as many more which have, until now, been unexplored.
    The contributions of this paper are four-fold.
    First, we propose a general framework for distributional similarity based on the concepts of precisio
