ef if no NP in FICU, corefers with an NP in the FICU,_1; the infer feature is -infer if no NP in FICU, is inferentially linked to an NP in FICU,_1; the global.pro feature is -global.pro if FICU, contains no third person definite pronoun coreferring with an NP in any prior FICU up to the last boundary assigned by the algorithm.
    If any feature has a positive value, no boundary is assigned; if all have negative values, (FICUi_i,FICU,) is classified as a boundary.
    The column headed NP in Figure 10 indicates boundaries assigned by the NP algorithm.
    No boundaries are assigned by NP.
    The first three phrases in Figure 7 correspond directly to three consecutive FICUs, and each FICU has an NP coreferring with an NP in the next; likewise the global.pro feature is present.
    However, phrase 23.3 is the onset of an FICU that continues through 23.4, so phrase 23.3 is not coded for NP features.
    The coref and global.pro features are present in the FICU that ends in 23.4, due to coreference of a pronomin
