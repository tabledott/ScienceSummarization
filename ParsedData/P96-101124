t; in &#167;4.1&#8212;it is contingent on a kind of lexical coincidence, namely that a type-raised subject commutes with a (generically) type-raised object.
    Such ambiguities are left to future work.
  
  
    The main contribution of this work has been formal: to establish a normal form for parses of &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; Cornbinatory Categorial Grammar.
    Given a sentence, every reading that is available to the grammar has exactly one normal-form parse, no matter how many parses it has in toto.
    A result worth remembering is that, although TAG-equivalent CCG allows free interaction among forward, backward, and crossed composition rules of any degree, two simple constraints serve to eliminate all spurious ambiguity.
    It turns out that all spurious ambiguity arises from associative &amp;quot;chains&amp;quot; such as A/B B/C C or A/B/C C/D D/E\F/G G/H.
    (Wit8 5 tenburg, 1987; Hepple &amp; Morrill, 1989) anticipate this result, at least for some fragments of CCG, but leave the proof to future w
