    We will refer to such models as unstructured DSMs, because they do not use the linguistic structure of texts to compute co-occurrences, and only record whether the target occurs in or close to the context element, without considering the type of this relation.
    For instance, an unstructured DSM might derive from a sentence like The teacher eats a red apple that eat is a feature shared by apple and red, just because they appear in the same context window, without considering the fact that there is no real linguistic relation linking eat and red, besides that of linear proximity.
    In structured DSMs, co-occurrence statistics are collected instead in the form of corpus-derived triples: typically, word pairs and the parser-extracted syntactic relation or lexico-syntactic pattern that links them, under the assumption that the surface connection between two words should cue their semantic relation (Grefenstette 1994; Lin 1998a; Curran and Moens 2002; Almuhareb and Poesio 2004; Turney 2006b; Pad&#180;o
