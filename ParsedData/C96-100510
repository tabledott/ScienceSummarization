ments was to decide among different variants of the Conceptual Density formula.
  Results are given averaging the results of the four files.
  Partial disambiguation is treated as failure to disambiguate.
  Precision (that is, the percentage of actual answers which were correct) and recall (that is, the percentage ofpossible answers which were correct) are given in terms of polysemous nouns only.
  Graphs are drawn against the size of the context 3 .
  meronymy does  not  improve per fo rmance  as expected.
  A priori, the more relations are taken in account (e.i.
  meronymic relations, in addition to the hypo/hypernymy relation) the better density would capture semantic relatedness, and therefore better esults can be expected.
