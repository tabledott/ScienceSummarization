on as the expected counts ignoring nodes deeper than depth k (i.e. the roots are all the root symbol, so c0(root) = 1).
    In our experiments this method converged within around 25 iterations; this is unsurprising, since the treebank contains few nodes deeper than 25 and our base grammar G seems to have captured this property.
    Once we have the expected counts of symbols in G, the expected counts of their projections mated directly using similar recurrences, or given by one-step equations: This process very rapidly computes the estimates for a projection of a grammar (i.e. in a few seconds for our largest grammars), and is done once during initialization of the parser.
    Recall that our final state-split grammars G come, by their construction process, with an ontogeny of grammars Gi where each grammar is a (partial) splitting of the preceding one.
    This gives us a natural chain of projections &#960;i&#8594;j which projects backwards along this ontogeny of grammars (see Fig.
    1).
    Of course, tra
