possible value of Ti (0 to 7), based on partitioning the sum of squares in the numerator of Q into distinct samples (Cochran 1950).
    Partitioning Q by the 8 values of T1 shows that Q1 is significant at the p -= .0001 level for each distinct Ti &gt; 4 across all narratives.
    Probabilities become more significant for higher levels of TI, and the converse.
    At Ti = 3, p is significant at the .01 level on 19 narratives, and for the remaining narrative p = .0192.
    When we look at correlation of segment boundaries with linguistic features, we use both thresholds Tj &gt; 4, and Tj &gt; 3 to select a set of empirically justified boundaries.
    On average, this gives us 12 (T) &gt; 4) or 20 (TI &gt; 3) boundaries for a 100-phrase narrative. data set, for example, across conditions or across subjects.
    Recently, discourse studies have used reliability metrics designed for evaluating classification tasks to determine whether coders can classify various phenomena in discourse corpora, as discussed in Sect
