tion 4 describes the SMT system and the adaptation techniques that were investigated; Section 5 presents and discusses experimental results; and Section 6 provides conclusions.
  
  
    Domain adaptation in SMT has been investigated only recently.
    In (Eck et al., 2004) adaptation is limited to the target language model (LM).
    The background LM is combined with one estimated on documents retrieved from the WEB by using the input sentence as query and applying crosslanguage information retrieval techniques.
    Refinements of this approach are described in (Zhao et al., 2004).
    In (Hildebrand et al., 2005) information retrieval techniques are applied to retrieve sentence pairs from the training corpus that are relevant to the test sentences.
    Both the language and the translation models are retrained on the extracted data.
    In (Foster and Kuhn, 2007) two basic settings are investigated: cross-domain adaptation, in which a small sample of parallel in-domain text is assumed, and dynamic adaptatio
