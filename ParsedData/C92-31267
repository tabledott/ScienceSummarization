rewrite rules will never be able to acconunodate all statistical dependencies.
  Optimal statistical estimations can only be achieved if tile statistics are applied to different kinds of units than rewrite rules.
  It is interesting to note that also in the field of theoretical linguistics tile necessity to use other kinds of structural units has been put forward.
  The clearest articulation of this idea is found in the work of [Fillmore 1988].
  From a linguistic point of view that emphasizes the syntactic complexities caused by idiomatic and semi-idiomatic expressions, Fillmore et al.
  arrive at the proposal to describe language not by means of a set of rewrite rules, but by meaus of a set of constructions.
  A construction is a tree-strncture: a fragment of a constituent-structure that can comprise more than one level.
  This tree is labeled with syntactic, semantic and pragnmtic ategories and feature-values.
  Lexical items can be specified as part of a construction.
  Constructions can be idiomatic in n
