inguishing graph can never contain both a dog and a chihuahua edge, since there will always be a cheaper distinguishing graph omitting one of the two edges.
    In sum, we can recast the incremental algorithm quite easily in terms of graphs.
    The original incremental algorithm operates only on properties (looped edges in graph terminology).
    Recall that when all edges in a scene graph are of the looping variety, testing for subgraph isomorphism becomes trivial.
    The graph-theoretical reformulation of the incremental algorithm does not fully exploit the possibilities offered by the graph framework and the use of cost functions.
    First, from the graph-theoretical perspective, the generation of relational descriptions poses no problems.
    Note that the use of a cost function to simulate subsumption hierarchies for properties carries over directly to relations; for instance, the costs of adding an edge labeled next to should be less than those of adding one labeled left of or right of.
    Hence, ne
