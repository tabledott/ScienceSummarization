sh and French analyzers and by including mor- phological categories directly as part of that representation, we have eliminated the need for additional annotations in the lexical structure that are common in exist- ing Kimmo systems.
  We can treat he letter tree as a simple finite-state network in which all morphological information is carried on the branches of the tree and not on the leaves.
  Taking this idea one step further, we may think of the lexicon as a trivial first stage in a cascade of transducers that maps between the lexical and the surface levels.
  The second stage is the two-level rule sys- tem.
  In the case of our analyzers for English and French, the rule system starts out with three levels but reduces to two by intersection and composition.
  The final stage is the composition of the rule system with the lexicon.
