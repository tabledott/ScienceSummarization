ogical generation that is closely related to that of inflectional preference is consonant doubling.
    This phenomenon, occurring mainly in British English, involves the doubling of a consonant at the end of a lemma when the lemma is inflected.
    For example, the past tense/participle inflection of the verb to travel is travelled in British English, where the final consonant of the lemma is doubled before the suffix is attached.
    In American English the past tense/participle inflection of the verb to travel is usually spelt traveled.
    Consonant doubling is triggered on the basis of both orthographic and phonological information: when a word ends in one vowel 2ftu1e choice based on ordering in the description can in fact be overridden by arranging for the second or subsequent match to cover a larger part of the input so that the longest match heuristic applies (Levine et al., 1992).
    Hut note that the rules in (1) and (2) will always match the same input span_ 3Flex does not allow the use of rules
