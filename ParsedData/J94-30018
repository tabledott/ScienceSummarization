rn of English (Chomsky and Halle 1968), were equivalent in power to finite-state devices despite a superficial resemblance to general rewriting systems.
    Phonologists in the SPE tradition, as well as the structuralists that preceded them, had apparently honored an injunction against rules that rewrite their own output but still allowed the output of a rule to serve as context for a reapplication of that same rule.
    Johnson realized that this was the key to limiting the power of systems of phonological rules.
    He also realized that basic rewriting/rules were subject to many alternative modes of application offering different expressive possibilities to the linguist.
    He showed that phonological grammars under most reasonable modes of application remain within the finite-state paradigm.
    We observed independently the basic connections between rewriting-rule grammars and finite-state transducers in the late 1970s and reported them at the 1981 meeting of the Linguistic Society of America (Kaplan an
