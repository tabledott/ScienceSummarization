uishing entire articles from one another when they are concatenated into a single file.
    They find that it &amp;quot;fails to detect any significant pattern in the corpus&amp;quot; (p. 1148).
    I recast Youmans' algorithm into the TextTiling framework, renaming it the vocabulary introduction method.
    Figure 3(b) illustrates.
    The text is analyzed, and the positions at which terms are first introduced are recorded (shown in black circles in the figure).
    A moving window is used again, as in the blocks algorithm, and this window corresponds to Youmans' interval.
    The number of new terms that occur on either side of the midpoint, or the sentence gap of interest, are added together and plotted against sentence gap number.
    This approach differs from that of Youmans (1991) and Nomoto and Nitta (1994) in two main ways.
    First, Nomoto and Nitta (1994) use too large an interval-300 words&#8212; because this is approximately the average size needed for their implementation of the blocks version
