g corpus we back off to the part of speech of the word and use the most frequent supertag associated with that part of speech as the supertag for the word. the previously discussed two sets of data.
    The words are first assigned standard parts of speech using a conventional tagger (Church 1988) and then are assigned supertags according to the unigram model.
    A word in a sentence is considered correctly supertagged if it is assigned the same supertag as it is associated with in the correct parse of the sentence.
    The results of these experiments are tabulated in Table 4.
    Although the performance of the unigram model for supertagging is significantly lower than the performance of the unigram model for part-of-speech tagging (91% accuracy), it performed much better than expected considering the size of the supertag set is much larger than the size of part-of-speech tag set.
    One of the reasons for this high performance is that the most frequent supertag for the most frequent words&#8212; determin
