learning.'
    A second difference is that the work reported here uses inferential rather than descriptive statistics.
    In other words, it uses statistical methods to infer facts about the language as it exists in the minds of those who produced the corpus.
    Many other projects have used statistics in a way that summarizes facts about the text but does not draw any explicit conclusions from them (Finch and Chater 1992; Hindle 1990).
    On the other hand, Hindle (1991) does use inferential statistics, and Brill (1992) recognizes the value of inference, although he does not use inferential statistics per se.
    Finally, many other projects in machine learning of natural language use input that is annotated in some way, either with part-of-speech tags (Brill 1992; Brill and Marcus 1992; Magerman and Marcus 1990) or with syntactic brackets (Pereira and Schabes 1992).
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
