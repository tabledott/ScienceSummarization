oposed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002) by introducing a parameter &#963; which enables the ST or the SST evaluation.
    Given the set of fragments {f1, f2, ..I = F, we defined the indicator function Ii(n) which is equal 1 if the target fi is rooted at node n and 0 otherwise.
    We define where NT1 and NT2 are the sets of the T1&#8217;s and T2&#8217;s nodes, respectively and A(n1, n2) = where &#963; E 10, 11, nc(n1) is the number of the children of n1 and cjn is the j-th child of the node n. Note that, since the productions are the same, nc(n1) = nc(n2).
    When &#963; = 0, A(n1, n2) is equal 1 only if bj A(cjn1, cjn2) = 1, i.e. all the productions associated with the children are identical.
    By recursively applying this property, it follows that the subtrees in n1 and n2 are identical.
    Thus, Eq.
    1 evaluates the subtree (ST) kernel.
    When &#963; = 1, A(n1, n2) evaluates the number of SSTs common to n1 and n2 as proved in (Collins and Duffy, 2002).
    Additionally, we study some variations of the
