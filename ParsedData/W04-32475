e graphs that correspond to the adjacency matrix derived by assuming the pair of sentences that have a similarity above and , respectively, in Figure 1 are similar to each other.
    We define degree centrality as the degree of each node in the similarity graph.
    As seen in Table 1, the choice of cosine threshold dramatically influences the interpretation of centrality.
    Too low thresholds may mistakenly take weak similarities into consideration while too high thresholds may lose much of the similarity relations in a cluster.
  
  
    When computing degree centrality, we have treated each edge as a vote to determine the overall prestige value of each node.
    This is a totally democratic method where each vote counts the same.
    However, this may have a negative effect in the quality of the summaries in some cases where several unwanted sentences vote for each and raise their prestiges.
    As an extreme example, consider a noisy cluster where all the documents are related to each other, but only on
