 log probability greater than &#8212;2.19 would be included).
    This reduced the ambiguity for known words from 1.93 tags per word to 1.23, and for unknown words, from 15.2 to 2.0.
    However, the negative side of using cutoffs is that the correct tag may be excluded.
    Note that a threshold of 2.0 would exclude the correct tag for the word &amp;quot;Controls&amp;quot; above.
    By changing the threshold to 4.0, we are sure to include all the correct tags in this example, but the ambiguity for known words increases from 1.23 to 1.24, and for unknown words from 2.0 to 3.7, for an ambiguity rating of 1.57 overall.
    We are continuing experiments to determine the most effective way of limiting the number of tags returned, and hence decreasing ambiguity, while ensuring that the correct tag is likely to be in the set.
    Balancing the tradeoff between ambiguity and accuracy is very dependent on the use the tagging will be put to.
    It is dependent both on the component that the tagged text directly feed
