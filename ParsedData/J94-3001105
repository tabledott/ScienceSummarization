ule did not apply, then the last element in the batch output string is a state, not the special character $.
    We must formulate a rule that will &amp;quot;bleed&amp;quot; the derivation, producing no output at all if its input ends in a state-symbol instead of $.
    We can achieve this with an anomalous obligatory rule whose output would be infinitely long if its input ever satisfies the conditions for its application.
    The following rule behaves in this way: It has the effect of filtering strings that do not represent transitions to a final state by forcing indefinitely many insertions of $ when no single $ is present.
    The output of this rule will be all and only the strings that came from a previous application of a Final rule.
    The last rule of the grammar is a trivial clean-up rule that produces the grammar's final output strings: This completes the proof of the theorem.
    We have constructed for any regular relation an ordered sequence of four rules (including a batch rule with finitely m
