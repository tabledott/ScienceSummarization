 combination with a discriminative parsing model.
    Size and Growth of Instantiated Syntactic Rule Set.
    Statistical CCG parsers such as Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002) or Clark and Curran (2004) are trained on counts of specific instantiations of combinatory rule schemata by category-types.
    It is therefore instructive to consider the frequency distribution of these category-instantiated rules.
    The grammar for sections 02-21 has 3,262 instantiations of general syntactic combinatory rules like those in (3) with specific categories.
    Of these, 1146 appear only once, and 2,027 appear less than five times.
    Although there is some noise, many of the CCG rules that appear only once are linguistically correct and should be used by the parser.
    They include certain instantiations of type-raising, coordination, or punctuation rules, or rules involved in argument cluster coordinations, pied-piping constructions, or questions, all of which are rare in the Wall Street Journal.
    As can be seen fro
