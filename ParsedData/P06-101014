998).
    However, our motivation is propagating scores to exploit cooccurrences, so we do not necessarily want the equation to converge.
    Indeed, our results show that although the initial iterations always help improve accuracy, too many iterations actually would decrease the performance.
  
  
    We use a comparable English-Chinese corpus to evaluate our methods for Chinese transliteration.
    We take one day&#8217;s worth of comparable news articles (234 Chinese stories and 322 English stories), generate about 600 English names with the entity recognizer (Li et al., 2004) as described above, and find potential Chinese transliterations also as previously described.
    We generated 627 Chinese candidates.
    In principle, all these 600 x 627 pairs are potential transliterations.
    We then apply the phonetic and time correlation methods to score and rank all the candidate Chinese-English correspondences.
    To evaluate the proposed transliteration methods quantitatively, we measure the accuracy of
