s).
			Another information-based clustering measure is variation of information (V I) (Meila, 2007), V I(C,K) = H(C|K)+H(K|C).
			V I is presented 414 as a distance measure for comparing partitions (or clusterings) of the same data.
			It therefore does notdistinguish between hypothesized and target cluster ings.
			V I has a number of useful properties.
			First, it satisfies the metric axioms.
			This quality allowsusers to intuitively understand how V I values combine and relate to one another.
			Secondly, it is ?con vexly additive?.
			That is to say, if a cluster is split, the distance from the new cluster to the original is the distance induced by the split times the size of the cluster.
			This property guarantees that all changes to the metric are ?local?: the impact of splitting ormerging clusters is limited to only those clusters in volved, and its size is relative to the size of these clusters.
			Third, VI is n-invariant: the number of data points in the cluster do not affect the value of the mea
