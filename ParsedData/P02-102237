which aims to assist the develeopment of robust tools and resources for NLP.
    One future direction is the integration of processing resources which learn in the background while the user is annotating corpora in GATE's visual environment.
    Currently, statistical models can be integrated but need to be trained separately.
    We are also extending the system to handle language generation modules, in order to enable the construction of applications which require language production in addition to analysis, e.g. intelligent report generation from IE data.
