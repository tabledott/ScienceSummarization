bstitutions is 1)ound(d by the length of the sentence.
    In practice, in our sentences S ranges between 0 and 10 with a mean of 1.583.)
    Finally, it is also plausible that longer sentences are more difficult to understand. so that length has a (small) negative coefficient.
    We now turn to model for quality.
    Normalized quality = 1.2134*simple tree accuracy - 0.0839*substitutions - 0.0280 * length - 0.0689.
    This model was also significant: F(3,19) = 7.23. p &lt; 0.005.
    The model is plotted in Figure 4, with the data point representing the removed outlier at the top of the diagram.
    The quality model is plausible for the same reasons that the understanding model is.
    A further goal of these experiments was to obtain one or two metrics which can be automatically computed, and which have been shown to significantly correlate with relevant human judgments.
    We use as a starting point the two linear models for normalized understanding and quality given above, but we make two changes.
