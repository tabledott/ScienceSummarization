ins the same data except that the first column is computed using Pearson's X2 test statistic.
    The overestimate of the significance of items that occur only a few times is dramatic.
    In fact, the entire first portion of the table is dominated by bigrams rare enough to occur only once in the current sample of text.
    The misspelling in the bigram 'sees posibilities' is in the original text.
    Out of 2693 bigrams analyzed, 2682 of them fall outside the scope of applicability of the normal X2 test.
    The 11 bigrams that were suitable for analysis with the X2 test are listed in Table 4.
    It is notable that all of these bigrams contain the word the, which is the most common word in English.
  
  
    Statistics based on the assumption of normal distribution are invalid in most cases of statistical text analysis unless either enormous corpora are used, or the analysis is restricted to only the very most common words (that is, the ones least likely to be of interest).
    This fact is typically ignore
