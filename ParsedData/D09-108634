gual features only for directly projected links, with no features for head-swapping, grandparents, etc.
    When using 1-best English parses, parsers trained only with direct-projection and monolingual features performed worse; when using gold English parses, parsers with directprojection-only features performed better when trained with more Chinese trees.
  
  
    The two related problems of parser adaptation and projection are often approached in different ways.
    Many adaptation methods operate by simple augmentations of the target feature space, as we have done here (Daume III, 2007).
    Parser projection, on the other hand, often uses a multi-stage pipeline 7It would be useful to explore whether the techniques of &#167;3 above could be used to improve English accuracy by domain adaptation.
    In theory a model with QG features trained to perform well on Chinese should not suffer from an inaccurate, but consistent, English parser, but the results in Figure 3 indicate a significant benefit to be had f
