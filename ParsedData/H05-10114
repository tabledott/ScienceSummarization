are weights.
			We optimize the model weights using a modified version of averaged perceptron learning as describedby Collins (2002).
			This is fast to train, because selecting the feature weights is the last step in build ing the model and the ?online?
			nature of perceptronlearning allows the parameter optimization to con verge quickly.
			Furthermore, no generative story has to be invented to explain how the features generate the data, so new features can be easily added without having to change the overall structure of the model.In theory, a disadvantage of a discrimintative ap proach compared to a generative approach is that it requires annotated data for training.
			In practice, however, effective discriminative models for word alignment require only a few parameters, which can be optimized on a set of annotated sentence pairs comparable in size to what is needed to tune the free parameters used in the generative approach.
			As we will show, a simple sequence of two such models can achieve alignment
