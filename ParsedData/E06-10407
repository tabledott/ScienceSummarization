core 1 (unless there is only one reference text).
    There are several other variants of the ROUGE metric, and ROUGE-2, along with ROUGESU (based on skip bigrams and unigrams), were among the official scores for the DUC 2005 summarisation task.
    The SUMTIME project (Reiter et al., 2005) developed an NLG system which generated textual weather forecasts from numerical forecast data.
    The SUMTIME system generates specialist forecasts for offshore oil rigs.
    It has two modules: a content-determination module that determines the content of the weather forecast by analysing the numerical data using linear segmentation and other data analysis techniques; and a microplanning and realisation module which generates texts based on this content by choosing appropriate words, deciding on aggregation, enforcing the sublanguage grammar, and so forth.
    SUMTIME generates very high-quality texts, in some cases forecast users believe SUMTIME texts are better than human-written texts (Reiter et al., 2005).
