raints is modular because they are defined in class definitions and all the instances of the class and its subclasses inherit these constraints.
    The object-oriented paradigm allows the subclasses to modify the constraints.
    The implementation of the parser has been tested with example sentences from Chapters 410, 15-18 of (van Riemsdijk and Williams, 1986).
    The chapters left out are mostly about logical form and Binding Theory, which have not yet been implemented in the parser.
    The average parsing time for sentences with 5 to 20 words is below half of a second on a SPARCstation ELC.
  
  
    The attribute vectors used here are similar to those in unification based grammars/parsers.
    An important difference, however, is that the attribute vectors used here satisfy the unit closure condition (Barton, Jr. et al., 1987, p.257).
    That is, nonatomic attribute values are vectors that consist only of atomic attribute values.
    For example: (7a) satisfies the unit closure condition, whereas (7b
