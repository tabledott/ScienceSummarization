  com Abst ract Previous stochastic approaches to generation do not include a tree-based representation of syntax.
  While this may be adequate or even advantageous for some applications, other ap- plications profit from using as much syntactic knowledge as is available, leaving to a stochas- tic model only those issues that are not deter- mined by the grammar.
  We present initial re- suits showing that a tree-based model derived from a tree-annotated corpus improves on a tree model derived from an unannotated corpus, and that a tree-based stochastic model with a hand- crafted grammar outpertbrms both.
  1 I n t roduct ion For many apt)lications in natural anguage gen~ eration (NLG), the range of linguistic expres- sions that must be generated is quite restricted, and a grammar tbr generation can be flt
