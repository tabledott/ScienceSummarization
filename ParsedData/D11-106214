original English sentences (ENG) are modified through (monolingual) generation HITs asking Turkers to: i) preserve the meaning of the original sentences using different surface forms, or ii) slightly change their meaning by adding or removing content.
    Our assumption, in line with (Bos et al., 2009), is that 10Starting from parallel sentences in n languages, the n corpora obtained without recurring to translations can be augmented, by means of translation HITs, to create the full set of language combinations.
    Each round of translation adds 1 monolingual corpus, and n-1 CLTE corpora. another way to think about entailment is to consider whether one text T1 adds new information to the content of another text T: if so, then T is entailed by T1.
    The result of this phase is a set of texts (ENG1) that can be of three types: Step2: TE Annotation.
    Entailment pairs composed of the original sentences (ENG) and the modified ones (ENG1) are used as input of (monolingual) annotation HITs asking Turkers to de
