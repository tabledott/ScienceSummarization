nted through the nodes of the decision tree.
    Only if the homogeneity termination condition is satisfied before all three content words are compared, the decision is based on less than a full quadruple.
    The decision tree therefore represents a very useful mechanism for determining the semantic level at which the decision on the PP attachment is made.
    Collins and Brooks' have also demonstrated the importance of low count events in training data by an experiment where all counts less than 5 were put to zero.
    This effectively made their algorithm ignore low count events which resulted in the decrease of accuracy from 84.1 to 81.6%.
    This important feature is maintained in our approach by small homogenous leaves at higher levels of the decision tree, which usually accommodate the low count training examples.
    Figure 3 shows an interesting aspect of learning the prepositional phrase attachment from a huge corpus.
    We have selected five most common prepositions and compared their learning cu
