221; indicates results on PropBank&#8217;s numbered arguments (ARG0...ARG5) only, and &#8220;all&#8221; includes numbered arguments as well as the ArgM roles.
    Most of the numbered arguments (in particular ARG0 and ARG1) correspond to arguments that the CCG category of the verb directly subcategorizes for.
    The CCG-based system outperforms the system based on the Collins parser on these core arguments, and has comparable performance when all PropBank labels are considered.
    We believe that the superior performance of the CCG system on this core arguments is due to its ability to recover long-distance dependencies, whereas we attribute its lower performance on non-core arguments mainly to the mismatches between PropBank and CCGbank.
    The importance of long-range dependencies for our task is indicated by the fact that the performance on the Penn Treebank gold standard without traces is significantly lower than that on the Penn Treebank with trace information.
    Long-range dependencies are especial
