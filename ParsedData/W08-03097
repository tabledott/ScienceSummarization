nd we are please to have attracted many smaller groups, some as small as a single graduate student and her adviser.
    The 30 submitted systems represent a broad range of approaches to statistical machine translation.
    These include statistical phrase-based and rulebased (RBMT) systems (which together made up the bulk of the entries), and also hybrid machine translation, and statistical tree-based systems.
    For most language pairs, we assembled a solid representation of the state of the art in machine translation.
    In addition to individual systems being entered, this year we also solicited a number of entries which combined the results of other systems.
    We invited researchers at BBN, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Edinburgh to apply their system combination algorithms to all of the systems submitted to shared translation task.
    We designated the translations of the Europarl set as the development data for combination techniques which weight each system.3 CMU combined the F
