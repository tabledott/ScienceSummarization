 and the variance of this ratio.
    This probabilistic score is used in a dynamic programming framework in order to find the maximum likelihood alignment of sentences.
    It is remarkable that such a simple approach can work as well as it does.
    An evaluation was performed based on a trilingual corpus of 15 economic reports issued by the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in English, French, and German (14,680 words, 725 sentences, and 188 paragraphs in English and corresponding numbers in the other two languages).
    The method correctly aligned all but 4% of the sentences.
    Moreover, it is possible to extract a large subcorpus that has a much smaller error rate.
    By selecting the best-scoring 80% of the alignments, the error rate is reduced from 4% to 0.7%.
    There were more errors on the English&#8212;French subcorpus than on the English&#8212;German subcorpus, showing that error rates will depend on the corpus considered; however, both were small enough for us to hope that the method will be us
