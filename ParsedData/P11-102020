 of the generated paraphrases.
    We also investigated the pros and cons of collecting paraphrases using video annotation rather than directly eliciting them.
    We built 4 paraphrase systems by training English to English translation models using Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) with the default settings.
    Using our paraphrase corpus to train and to test, we divided the sentence clusters associated with each video into 90% for training and 10% for testing.
    We restricted our attention to sentences produced from the Tier-2 tasks in order to avoid excessive noise in the datasets, resulting in 28,785 training sentences and 3,367 test sentences.
    To construct the training examples, we randomly paired each sentence with 1, 5, 10, or all parallel descriptions of the same video segment.
    This corresponds to 28K, 143K, 287K, and 449K training pairs respectively.
    For the test set, we used each sentence once as the source sentence with all parallel descriptions as references (there were 16 references on av
