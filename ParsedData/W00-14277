    With the input stimulus-f-s_N, the output is stimuli rather than the incorrect *stimuluses that would follow from the application of the more general rule in (1).
    By ensuring that this rule precedes the rule in (1) in the description, nouns such as stimutus get the correct plural form inflection.
