another if they have an entity in common (of course, there are other kinds of elaborations, but we would want to model them differently).
    There seem to be three main approaches to controlling the search for a good RS tree (or something similar).
    One is to restrict what relations can appear in the nucleus and satellite of others (for instance, using Hovy's [Hovy 90] idea of &amp;quot;growth points&amp;quot;).
    This is a step towards creating &amp;quot;schemas&amp;quot; &#8226;for larger pieces of text.
    It can therefore be expected that it will produce very good results in restricted domains where limited text patterns are used, but that it will be hard to extend it to freer text types.
    The second idea is to use information about goals to limit possibilities.
    This is an element of Hovy's work but is more apparent in the planning work of Moore and Paris [Moore and Paris 93].
    This second approach will work well if there are strong goals in the domain which really can influence textual d
