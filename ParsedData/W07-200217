hat the1c1word baseline is equivalent to MFS in this setting.
			We will review the random baseline in the dis cussion section below.
			Further Results Table 5 shows the results of the best systems from the lexical sample subtask of task 17.
			The best sense induction system is only 6.9 percentage points belowthe best supervised, and 3.5 percentage points be low the best (and only) semi-supervised system.
			If the sense induction system had participated, it would be deemed as semi-supervised, as it uses, albeit in ashallow way, the training data for mapping the clusters into senses.
			In this sense, our supervised evalu ation does not seek to optimize the available training data.After the official evaluation, we realized that con trary to previous lexical sample evaluation exercises task 17 organizers did not follow a random train/test split.
			We decided to produce a random train/testsplit following the same 82/18 proportion as the of ficial split, and re-evaluated the systems.
			The results are presen
