    They went to a movie.
    This class of coreference is quite challenging because the plural anaphor 'they' must be able to collect a set of antecedents from the prior discourse--but how far should it look back, and once it has found two antecedents, should it continue to look for more?
    Event reference is a class of coreference that will also prove to be quite challenging.
    For example: The computer won the match.

    Currently the system uses no verb semantics to try and constrain possible coreference.
    While the Winograd sentences are too difficult for current robust lexical semantic systems, simpler generalizations about what can fill an argument are possible, consider: The price of a
