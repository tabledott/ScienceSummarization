 then termight is likely to identify a translation that overlaps with the correct one, directing the user quickly to correctly aligned concordance lines.
    Even if all the words of the term were not aligned by word_align it is still likely that most concordance lines are aligned correctly based on other words in the near context.
    Termight motivates future improvements in word alignment quality that will increase recall and precision of the candidate list.
    In particular, taking into account local syntactic structures and phrase boundaries will impose more restrictions on alignments of complete terms.
    Finally, termight can be extended for verifying translation consistency at the proofreading (editing) step of a translation job, after the document has been translated.
    For example, in an English-German document pair the tool identified the translation of the term Controls menu as Menu Steuerung in 4 out of 5 occurrences.
    In the fifth occurrence word_align failed to align the term correctly b
