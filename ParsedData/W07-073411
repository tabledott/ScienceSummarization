s slightly more &#8220;weight&#8221; when optimizing correlation with fluency judgments (versus when optimizing correlation with adequacy).
    Recall, however, is still given more weight than precision.
    Another interesting observation is that the value of y is higher for fluency optimization.
    Since the fragmentation penalty reflects word-ordering, which is closely related to fluency, these results are consistent with our expectations.
    When optimizing correlation with the sum of adequacy and fluency, optimal values fall in between the values found for adequacy and fluency.
    Similar to English, we trained parameters for Spanish, French and German on the available WMT06 training data.
    We optimized for maximum correlation with human judgments of adequacy, fluency and for the sum of the two.
    Resulting parameters are shown in Table 4.3.2.
    For all three languages, the parameters that were found to be optimal were quite different than those that were found for English, and using the langua
