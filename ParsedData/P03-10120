  A Probability Model To Improve Word Alignment
  
    Word alignment plays a crucial role in statistical machine translation.
    Word-aligned corpora have been found to be an excellent source of translation-related knowledge.
    We present a statistical model for computing the probability of an alignment given a sentence pair.
    This model allows easy integration of context-specific features.
    Our experiments show that this model can be an effective tool for improving an existing word alignment.
  
  
    Word alignments were first introduced as an intermediate result of statistical machine translation systems (Brown et al., 1993).
    Since their introduction, many researchers have become interested in word alignments as a knowledge source.
    For example, alignments can be used to learn translation lexicons (Melamed, 1996), transfer rules (Carbonell et al., 2002; Menezes and Richardson, 2001), and classifiers to find safe sentence segmentation points (Berger et al., 1996).
