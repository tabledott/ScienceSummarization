iang, 2007) does not require explicit syntactic representation on either side of the rules.
    Both source and target are strings with NTs.
    Decoding is solved as chart parsing.
    Hiero can be viewed as a hierarchical string-to-string model.
    Ding and Palmer (2005) and Quirk et al. (2005) followed the tree-to-tree approach (Shieber and Schabes, 1990) for translation.
    In their models, dependency treelets are used to represent both the source and the target sides.
    Decoding is implemented as tree transduction preceded by source side dependency parsing.
    While tree-to-tree models can represent richer structural information, existing tree-totree models did not show advantage over string-totree models on translation accuracy due to a much larger search space.
    One of the motivations of our work is to achieve desirable trade-off between model capability and search space through the use of the so called wellformed dependency structures in rule representation.
    Dependency trees reveal long-di
