 the proposal will be introduced as needed in the following discussion.
  
  
    In Section 5, I demonstrated how most of the lexical semantics research has concentrated on verbal semantics.
    This bias influences our analyses of how to handle ambiguity and certain noncompositional structures.
    Therefore, the only way to relate the different senses for the verbs in the examples below was to posit separate entries.
    8 This proposal is an extension of ideas explored by Bach (1986), Higginbotham (1985), and Allen (1984).
    For a full discussion, see Pustejovsky (1988, 1991).
    See Tenny (1987) for a proposal on how aspectual distinctions are mapped to the syntax.
    A similar philosophy has lead linguists to multiply word senses in constructions involving Control and Equi-verbs, where different syntactic contexts necessitate different semantic types.'
    Normally, compositionality in such structures simply refers to the application of the functional element, the verb, to its arguments.
    Yet, su
