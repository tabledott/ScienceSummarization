 The rules presented here may be considered less cumbersome and more intuitive.
    In a way that is similar to Brill &amp; Ngai's system, our rules were translated into Perl regular expressions and evaluated on the corpus.
    New rules are appended onto the end of the list and each rule applied in order, in the paradigm of a transformation-based rule list.
    The rule-writing experiments were conducted by a group of 17 advanced computer science students, using the identical test set as in the annotation experiments and the same initial 100 gold standard sentences for both initial bracketing standards guidance and rule-quality feedback throughout their work.
    The time that the students spent on the task varied widely, from a minimum of 1.5 hours to a maximum of 9 hours, with an average of 5 hours.
    Because we captured and saved every change the students made to their rule list and logged every mouse click they made while doing the experiment, it was possible for us to trace the performance of the syst
