 the two mentions.
    We thus measure distance (quantized as multiple boolean features of the form [distance &gt; i]) for all i up to the distance and less than some maximum, using units of compatible mentions, and whether the mentions are in the same sentence.
    We also detect apposition (mentions separated by a comma).
    For details, see Table 3.
    We determine the relationship of any pair of modifiers that share a hypernym.
    Each aligned pair may have one of the following relations: match, substring, synonyms, hypernyms, antonyms, or mismatch.
    Mismatch is defined as none of the above.
    We restrict modifiers to single nouns and adjectives occurring before the head noun phrase.
    Modifier Names If the mentions are both modified by other proper names, use a basic coreference classifier to determine whether the modifiers are coreferential.
    This basic classifier is trained using Mention Types, String Relations, Semantic Features, Apposition, Relative Pronoun, and Both Speak.
