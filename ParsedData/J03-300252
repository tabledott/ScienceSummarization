 for the English page and the URL for the Arabic page, assuming the language ID information associated with each URL confirmed it was in the proper language.19 At this point, the candidate generation process is complete.
    The final step is to apply STRAND&#8217;s filtering step to each candidate pair, an operation that can itself be parallelized, since each candidate pair can be processed independently.
    The filtering pass will eliminate those page pairs (roughly 10% in our experience) whose URLs show similarity to each other but whose content and/or structure do not.
    It is interesting to note that by taking advantage of the Archive&#8217;s p2 cluster computing tool, together with its simple flat-text representations, adapting STRAND&#8217;s candidate generation process resulted in a dramatic reduction in the size of the program, cutting it literally in half, as measured in lines of code.
