, in our case, X and Y are highly asymmetric; a &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; value (and a 1-1 match) is much more informative than a &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; value (or 0-0 match).
    Therefore, we should select a similarity measure that is based only on 1-1 matches and mismatches.
    0-0 matches should be completely ignored; otherwise, they would dominate the similarity measure, given the overall relatively low frequency of any particular word or word group in our corpus.
    The Dice coefficient satisfies the above requirement of asymmetry: adding 0-0 matches does not change any of the absolute frequencies fxY, fx, and fy, and so does not affect Dice(X,Y).
    On the other hand, average mutual information depends only on the distribution of X and Y and not on the actual values of the random variables.
    In fact, I(X, Y) is a completely symmetric measure.
    If the variables X and Y are transformed so that every &amp;quot;1&amp;quot; is replaced with a &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; and vice versa, the average mutual infor
