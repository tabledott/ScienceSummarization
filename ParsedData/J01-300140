    In this example, John has been identified as a named entity and marked as human, so the subject restriction is not broken.
    Note that, if the restriction were broken, then the verb sense run(1) would be marked as incorrect by this partial tagger and no further attempt would be made to resolve its restrictions.
    As this was not the case, we consider the direct-object slot, which places the restriction abstract on the noun which fills it. course(2) fulfils this criterion, course is modified by hilly which expects a noun of type nonmovable solid.

    Therefore, assuming that run is being used in its second sense leads to a situation in which there is no set of senses which comply with all the restrictions placed on them; therefore run(1) is not the correct sense of run and the partial tagger marks this sense as wr
