mbiguous target word is then classified by finding all collocations that match its context.
    Each collocation provides some degree of evidence for each word in the confusion set.
    This evidence is combined using Hayes' rule.
    In the end, the wi with the highest probability, given the evidence, is selected.
    A new complication arises for collocations, however, in that collocations, unlike context words, cannot be assumed independent.
    Consider, for example, the following collocations for desert: PREP the in the the These collocations are highly interdependent &#8212; we will say they conflict.
    To deal with this problem, we invoke our earlier observation that there is no need to use all the evidence.
    If two pieces of evidence conflict, we simply eliminate one of them, and base our decision on the rest of the evidence.
    We identify conflicts by the heuristic that two collocations conflict if they overlap.
    The overlapping portion is the factor they have in common, and thus represents
