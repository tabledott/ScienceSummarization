he basic equation for computing forward values not involved in loops was At this point, for conciseness, we introduce a nonstandard notation.
    We will soon be using many sequences of the form 1, 2, .
    ..,j-2,j-1,j+1,j+ 2, .. k&#8212; 1,k.
    We denote such sequences by 1, k. By extension, we will also write f(1), (k) to indicate a sequence of the form f (1),f (2), ,f(j &#8212; 2),f(j &#8212; 1) , f(j + 1), f(j + 2),.
    ,f (k &#8212; 1) , f (k).
    Now, we can give a simple formula for computing reverse values Z(x) not involved in loops: Theorem 5 For items x E B where B is nonlooping, The simple case is when x is the goal item.
    Since an outer tree of the goal item is a derivation of the goal item, with the goal item and its children removed, and since we assumed in Section 2.2 that the goal item can only appear in the root of a derivation tree, the outer trees of the goal item are all empty.
    Thus, As mentioned in Section 2.1, the value of the empty product is the multiplicative identity.
