lish.
    The paper will discuss solutions to these language-level mismatches, and will illustrate that at the level of noun-phrase structure and core part-of-speech tags, essential annotations can be projected with remarkable effectiveness and coverage in many cases.
    Finally, the paper will empirically evaluate two major questions for each of the tasks:
  
  
    The approach and general algorithms investigated in this paper were initiated in conjunction with the EGYPT project of the 1999 Johns Hopkins summer machine translation workshop (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).
    Previously, tools for automatic wordalignment of bilingual corpora were not widely available outside IBM, the research group pioneering statistical machine translation with the Candide system (Brown et al, 1990).
    The researchers who developed independent word-alignment tools (e.g.
    Dagan et al, 1993; Fung and Church, 1994; Wu, 1994; Melamed, 1999; Och and Ney, 2000) tended to focus on translation model applications for their word-ali
