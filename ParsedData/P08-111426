bstantial improvements in translation performance when integrated into the Hiero framework.
    We accomplished this using constraints that not only distinguish among constituent types, but which also distinguish between the benefit of matching the source parse bracketing, versus the cost of using phrases that cross relevant bracketing boundaries.
    We demonstrated improvements for ChineseEnglish translation, and succeed in obtaining substantial gains for Arabic-English translation, as well.
    Our results contribute to a growing body of work on combining monolingually based, linguistically motivated syntactic analysis with translation models that are closely tied to observable parallel training data.
    Consistent with other researchers, we find that &#8220;syntactic constituency&#8221; may be too coarse a notion by itself; rather, there is value in taking a finergrained approach, and in allowing the model to decide how far to trust each element of the syntactic analysis as part of the system&#8217;s opt
