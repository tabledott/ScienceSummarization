is employed to assess accuracy while (Ng and Lee, 1996) train and test using 100 randomly sampled sets of data.
    Similar differences in training and testing methodology exist among the other studies.
    Still, the results in this paper are encouraging due to the simplicity of the approach.
    The interest data was first studied by (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994).
    They employ a representation of context that includes the part-of-speech of the two words surrounding interest, a morphological feature indicating whether or not interest is singular or plural, and the three most statistically significant cooccurring words in the sentence with interest, as determined by a test of independence.
    These features are abbreviated as p-o-s, morph, and co-occur in Table 5.
    A decomposable probabilistic model is induced from the sense-tagged corpora using a backward sequential search where candidate models are evaluated with the log-likelihood ratio test.
    The selected model was used as a probabilistic classifier o
