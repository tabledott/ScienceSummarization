 a beam of 80 while incorporating the features of a third-order graph-based model.
    Experiments were performed on a computer with an Intel i7-3960X CPU (3.3 GHz and 6 cores).
    These performance values are preliminary since we are still working on the speed-up of the parser.
    In order to better understand the benefits of the joint model, we performed an error analysis for German parts of speech in German with F-scores for the left-handside category.
    ADJ* (ADJD or ADJA) = adjective; ADV = adverb; ART = determiner; APPR = preposition; NE = proper noun; NN = common noun; PRELS = relative pronoun; VVFIN = finite verb; VVINF = non-finite verb; VAFIN = finite auxiliary verb; VAINF = non-finite auxiliary verb; VVPP = participle; XY = not a word.
    We use &#945;* to denote the set of categories with &#945; as a prefix. and English, where we compared the baseline and the joint model with respect to F-scores for individual part-of-speech categories and dependency labels.
    For the part-of-speech categor
