ative relational evaluation schemes have been developed (e.g.
    Carroll et al., 1998; Lin, 1998).
    However, until recently, no WSJ data has been carefully annotated to support relational evaluation.
    King et al. (2003) describe the PARC 700 Dependency Bank (hereinafter DepBank), which consists of 700 WSJ sentences randomly drawn from section 23.
    These sentences have been annotated with syntactic features and with bilexical head-dependent relations derived from the F-structure representation of Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG).
    DepBank facilitates comparison of PCFG-like statistical parsers developed from the PTB with other parsers whose output is not designed to yield PTB-style trees, using an evaluation which is closer to the protypical parsing task of recovering predicate-argument structure.
    Kaplan et al. (2004) compare the accuracy and speed of the PARC XLE Parser to Collins&#8217; Model 3 parser.
    They develop transformation rules for both, designed to map native output to a subset
