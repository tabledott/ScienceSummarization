    Varying N between 50 and 150 results in no significant change in the estimated error rates.
    One way to judge the value of the estimation and hypothesis-testing methods is to examine the false positives.
    Three of the five false positives result from errors in verb detection that are not distributed uniformly across verbs.
    In particular, shock, board, and near are used more often as nonverbs than as verbs.
    This creates many opportunities for nonverbal occurrences of these words to be mistaken for verbal occurrences.
