NG MODEL-THEORETIC RECALL How then can we turn this notion of minimal missing links into a computationall y effective scoring procedure that works in the general case?
  Roughly stated, the scorin g mechanism for recall must form the equivalence sets generated by the key, and then determine for each such key set how many subsets the response partitions the key set into.
  The score then follows by simple arithmetic .
  Getting a bit more formal (but not much), let us define recall using these notions .
  First, let S be an equivalence set generated by the key, and let R1 .
  .Rm be equivalent classe s generated by the response.
  Then we define the following functions over S : ?
  p(S) is a partition of S relative to the response .
  Each subset of S in the partition is formed by intersecting S and those response sets Ri that overlap S .
  Note that the equivalence classes defined by the response may include implicit singleton sets ?
  these correspond to elements that are mentioned in the key but not in the
