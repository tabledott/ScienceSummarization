an SIM in discriminating between correct and incorrect alignments.
    We first sorted the one-to-one alignments in decreasing order of SIM and randomly sampled 100 alignments from the top-150,000 alignments.
    We classified the samples into A or D. The number of A&#8217;s was 93, and that of D&#8217;s was 7.
    The precision was 0.93.
    However, in Table 6, the number of A&#8217;s was 491 and D&#8217;s was 9, for the 500 samples extracted from the top-150,000 alignments.
    The precision was 0.982.
    Thus, the precision of SntScore was higher than that of SIM and this difference is statistically significant at 1% based on a one-sided proportional test.
    We then sorted the one-to-many alignments by SIM and sampled 100 alignments from the top 38,090 and judged them.
    There were 89 A&#8217;s and 11 D&#8217;s.
    The precision was 0.89.
    However, in Table 7, there were 98 A&#8217;s and 2 D&#8217;s for samples from the top 38,090 alignments.
    The precision was 0.98.
    This difference is als
