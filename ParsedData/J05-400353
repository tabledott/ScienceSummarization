ure 7); for other domains, this can be replaced with a more appropriate indication of where the parallel sentences are likely to be found.
    For example, if the domain were that of technical manuals, one would cluster printer manuals and aircraft manuals separately.
    It is important to note that our work assumes that the comparable corpus does contain parallel sentences (which is the case for our data).
    Whether this is true for comparable corpora from other domains is an empirical question outside the scope of this article; however, both our results and those of Resnik and Smith (2003) strongly indicate that good data is available on the Web.
    Lack of parallel corpora is a major bottleneck in the development of SMT systems for most language pairs.
    The method presented in this paper is a step towards the important goal of automatic acquisition of such corpora.
    Comparable texts are available on the Web in large quantities for many language pairs and domains.
