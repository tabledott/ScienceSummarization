of the dependency graphs offered by the SD scheme, arguing that this is the kind of graph one would find most useful in an information extraction project.
    Although Clegg and Shepherd (2007) also favor dependency graph representations for parser evaluation, they advocate retention of parse trees so information lost in the dependency structures can be accessed.
    In essence, any existing dependency scheme could be adopted as the gold-standard for evaluation.
    However if one believes in ultimately valuing extrinsic task-based evaluation, a dependency representation which proposes a suitable design for users and user tasks is probably the best surrogate for intrinsic evaluation.
    Moreover, the existence of tools for automatically generating and converting dependency representations has aided greatly in making parser comparison possible across different formalisms.
    We believe that the SD scheme approaches these goals.
    If one accepts the goals set here, in order to enforce uniformity between app
