    preposed adjuncts = 2/73 (2.7%) conjoined S = 3/73 (4%) conjoined VP = 20/73 (27%)
  
  
    relative clauses = 29/817 (3.5%) determiners = 205/817 (25%); of these, only 171 were &#8220;a&#8221; or &#8220;the&#8221; (21% overall)

    The first step relies on what is referred to as the Projection Principle in linguistic theory (Chomsky, 1981): Predicates project a subject (both dominated by S) in the surface structure.
    Our human-generated headlines always conformed to this rule; thus, we adopted it as a constraint in our algorithm.
    An example of the application of step 1 above is the following, where boldfaced material from the parse tree representation is retained and italicized material is eliminated: with government]] officials said Tuesday.]
    Output of step 1: Rebels agree to talks with government.
    When the parser produces a correct tree, this
