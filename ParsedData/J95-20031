 correspond in part to the inference demands made by different types of referring expressions, given a particular attentional state.
    It demonstrates that the attentional state properties modeled by centering can account for these differences.
    Preface Our original paper (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) on centering claimed that certain entities mentioned in an utterance were more central than others and that this property imposed constraints on a speaker's use of different types of referring expressions.
    Centering was proposed as a model that accounted for this phenomenon.
    We argued that the coherence of discourse was affected by the compatibility between centering properties of an utterance and choice of referring expression.
    Subsequently, we revised and expanded the ideas presented therein.
    We defined various centering constructs and proposed two centering rules in terms of these constructs.
    A draft manuscript describing this elaborated centering framework and presenting some in
