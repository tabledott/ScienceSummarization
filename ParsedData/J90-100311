ince f (x, y) encodes linear precedence.
    (Recall thatf (x, y) denotes the number of times that word x appears before y in the window of w words, not the number of times the two words appear in either order.)
    Although we could fix this problem by redefining f (x, y) to be symmetric (by averaging the matrix with its transpose), we have decided not to do so, since order information appears to be very interesting.
    Notice the asymmetry in the pairs in Table 2 (computed from 44 million words of 1988 AP text), illustrating a wide variety of biases ranging from sexism to syntax.
    Second, one might expect f (x, y) f(x) and f (x, y) f (y), but the way we have been counting, this needn't be the case if x and y happen to appear several times in the window.
    For example, given the sentence, &amp;quot;Library workers were prohibited from saving books from this heap of ruins,&amp;quot; which appeared in an AP story on April 1, 1988, f(prohibited) = 1 and f ( prohibited, from) = 2.
    This problem can be f
