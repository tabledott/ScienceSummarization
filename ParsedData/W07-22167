include the work of Neuhaus and B&#168;oker (1997) showing that the recognition problem for a minimal dependency grammar is hard.
    In addition, the work of Kahane et al. (1998) provides a polynomial parsing algorithm for a constrained class of nonprojective structures.
    Non-projective dependency parsing can be related to certain parsing problems defined for phrase structure representations, as for instance immediate dominance CFG parsing (Barton et al., 1987) and shake-and-bake translation (Brew, 1992).
    Independently of this work, Koo et al. (2007) and Smith and Smith (2007) showed that the MatrixTree Theorem can be used to train edge-factored log-linear models of dependency parsing.
    Both studies constructed implementations that compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.
    The work of Meil&#728;a and Jaakkola (2000) is also of note.
    In that study they use the Matrix Tree Theorem to develop a tractable bayesian learning algorithms for tree belief networks, which in many ways are closely r
