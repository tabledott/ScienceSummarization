ces x1, ... , xi&#8722;1.
    When making the prediction for token instance xi, we record the label assignment distribution for all token instances for the same token type in the previous 1000 words.
    That is, if the token instance is &#8220;Australia&#8221;, and in the previous 1000 tokens, the token type &#8220;Australia&#8221; was twice assigned the label L-ORG and three times the label U-LOC, then the prediction history feature will be: (L &#8722; ORG : 25; U &#8722; LOC: 35).
    Table 3 summarizes the results.
    Surprisingly, no single technique outperformed the others on all datasets.
    The extended prediction history method was the best on CoNLL03 data and MUC7 test set.
    Context aggregation was the best method for MUC7 development set and two-stage prediction was the best for Webpages.
    Non-local features proved less effective for MUC7 test set and the Webpages.
    Since the named entities in Webpages have less context, this result is expected for the Webpages.
    However, we are unsur
