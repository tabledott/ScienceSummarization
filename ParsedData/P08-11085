 equivalent to finding the highest scoring directed spanning tree in the complete graph over the input sentence, which can be solved in O(n2) time (McDonald et al., 2005b).
    Additional parameterizations are possible that take more than one arc into account, but have varying effects on complexity (McDonald and Satta, 2007).
    An advantage of graph-based methods is that tractable inference enables the use of standard structured learning techniques that globally set parameters to maximize parsing performance on the training set (McDonald et al., 2005a).
    The primary disadvantage of these models is that scores &#8211; and as a result any feature representations &#8211; are restricted to a single arc or a small number of arcs in the graph.
    The specific graph-based model studied in this work is that presented by McDonald et al. (2006), which factors scores over pairs of arcs (instead of just single arcs) and uses near exhaustive search for unlabeled parsing coupled with a separate classifier to label ea
