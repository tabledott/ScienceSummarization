two unigrams together if at least one sense of each word belongs to the same synset in WordNet* Intuitively, this implies that at least one sense of each of the two words represent the same concept* This can be thought of as a poor-man's synonymy detection algorithm that does not disambiguate the words being tested for synonymy* Note that the METEOR scores used to compute correlations in the other tables (1 through 4) used exactly this sequence of stages* Tables 6 and 7 show the correlations between METEOR scores produced in each of these experiments and human assessments for both the Arabic and the Chinese datasets* On both data sets, adding either stemming modules to simply using One problem with conducting correlation experiments with human assessment scores at the sentence level is that the human scores are noisy &#8212; that is, the levels of agreement between human judges on the actual sentence level assessment scores is not extremely high* To partially address this issue, the human assessment scores we
