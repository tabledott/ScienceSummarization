ns than for facts (around 50%).
    While words and n-grams had little performance effect for the opinion class, they increased the recall for the fact class around five fold compared to the approach by Wiebe et al. (1999).
    In general, the additional features helped the classifier; the best performance is achieved when words, bigrams, trigrams, part-of-speech, and polarity are included in the feature set.
    Further, using multiple classifiers to automatically identify an appropriate subset of the data for training slightly increases performance.
    Polarity Classification Using the method of Section 5.1, we automatically identified a total of 39,652 (65,773), 3,128 (4,426), 144,238 (195,984), and 22,279 (30,609) positive (negative) adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs, respectively.
    Extracted positive words include inspirational, truly, luck, and achieve.
    Negative ones include depraved, disastrously, problem, and depress.
