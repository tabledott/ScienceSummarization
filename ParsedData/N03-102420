 As the statistics in Table 4 show, there is little difference between the average entropy of the original sentences and the average entropy of the paraphrase sentences we produce.
    To better calibrate this result, we compare it with the average entropy of 6 corresponding machine translation outputs (ent(MTS)), which were also made available by LDC in conjunction with the same corpus.
    As one can see, the difference between the average entropy of the machine produced output and the average entropy of the original 11 sentences is much higher than the difference between the average entropy of the FSA-produced outputs and the average entropy of the original 11 sentences.
    Obviously, this does not mean that our FSAs only produce well-formed sentences.
    But it does mean that our FSAs produce sentences that look more like human produced sentences than machine produced ones according to a language model.
    Not surprisingly, the language model we used in Section 4.2.1 is far from being a perfect judge o
