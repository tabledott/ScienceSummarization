en an input phrase sequence xK1 we now associate a unique jump sequence bK1 with each per missible output phrase sequence yK1 . The jump bk measures the displacement of the kth phrase xk, i.e. xk ? yk+bk , k ? {1, 2, ...,K}.
			(3) The jump sequence bK1 is constructed such that yK1is a permutation of xK1 . This is enforced by con structing all models so that ?K k=1 bk = 0.
			We now redefine the model in terms of the jump sequence P (yK1 |x K 1 , u K 1 ) (4) = { P (bK1 |x K 1 , u K 1 ) yk+bk = xk ?k 0 otherwise, 162 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5x 1 y 2 y 3 y 4 y 5y 1 3b = 01b = +12b = ?1 4b = 0 5b = 0 doivent de_25_%exportations fl?chir exportations grains de_25_%doivent fl?chir grains Figure 2: Phrase reordering and jump sequence.
