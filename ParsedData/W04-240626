ur bigram feature set by using some other larger training source like a corpus drawn from the Web.
    Table 3 shows the results of using the Repeated Bisections algorithm in vector space (PB) against that of using UPGMA method in similarity space.
    This table shows the number of Nouns, Adjectives and Verbs SENSEVAL-2 words that performed better (rbr&gt;upgma), worse (rbr&lt;upgma), and equal (rbr=upgma) when using Repeated Bisections clustering versus the UPGMA technique, on first (PB) and second (SC) order vectors.
    In short, Table 3 compares PB1 against PB2 and SC1 against SC2.
    From this, we observe that with both first order and second order context vectors Repeated Bisections is more effective than UPGMA.
    This suggests that it is better suited to deal with very small amounts of sparse data.
    Table 4 summarizes the overall performance of each of these experiments compared with the majority class.
    This table shows the number of words for which an experiment performed better than the th
