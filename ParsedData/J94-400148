Ss.
    Here the underlined bunsetsus are KBs.
    The incorrectly calculated scope of a CS is enclosed by square brackets, and the correct scope is enclosed by curly brackets.
    &#8226; Our assumption that both conjuncts contain about the same number of bunsetsus is useful in detecting most CSs.
    Even if the number of bunsetsus of two conjuncts is somewhat different, a correct CS can be obtained with the help of the penalty points, which reduces the possibility that a CS contains high SL bunsetsus, and with the extension of the pre-conjunct, and so on.
    However, it is difficult to recognize a CS that is extremely unbalanced.
