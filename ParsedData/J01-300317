s, as in (2a); the transitive counterpart for these verbs also exhibits a causative alternation, as in (2b).
    This is the &amp;quot;causative/inchoative alternation&amp;quot; (Levin, 1993).
    Like unergatives, the subject of a transitive unaccusative is marked as the Agent of Causation.
    Unlike unergatives, though, the alternating argument of an unaccusative (the subject of the intransitive form that becomes the object of the transitive) is an entity undergoing a change of state, without active participation, and is therefore a Theme.
    The resulting pattern of thematic assignments is indicated in the second row of Table 3.
    The sentences in (3) use an object-drop verb, play.
    These are activity verbs that exhibit a non-causative diathesis alternation, in which the object is simply optional.
    This is dubbed &amp;quot;the unexpressed object alternation&amp;quot; (Levin 1993), and has several subtypes that we do not distinguish here.
    The thematic assignment for these verbs is simply Agent
