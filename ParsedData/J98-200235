g the observed frequency of a noun between all the nodes containing that noun.
    Finally, when an internal node contained nouns actually occurring in the data, we assigned the .frequencies of all the nodes below it to that internal node, and excised the whole subtree (subgraph) below it.
    The last of these measures, in effect, defines the &amp;quot;starting cut&amp;quot; of the thesaurus from which to begin generalizing.
    Since (word senses of) nouns that occur in natural language tend to concentrate in the middle of a taxonomy, the starting cut given by this method usually falls around the middle of the thesaurus.1&#176; Figure 9 shows the starting cut and the resulting cut in WordNet for the direct object slot of eat with respect to the data in Table 6, where (...) denotes a node in WordNet.
    The starting cut consists of nodes (plant ...),(food),etc, which are the highest nodes containing values of the direct object slot of eat.
    Since (food) has significantly higher frequencies than its neigh
