unctions (i.e., it takes value 1 if a certain combination as the ones listed in Table 2 is present, 0 otherwise), while feature 6 is real valued.
    Features that do not appear more than once in the training set are discarded.
  
  
    Our evaluations were performed on two corpora, GEOQUERY and ROBOCUP.
    The GEOQUERY corpus contains MR defined by a Prolog-based language used in querying a database on U.S. geography.
    The ROBOCUP corpus contains MR defined by a coaching language used in a robot coaching competition.
    There are in total 880 and 300 instances for the two corpora respectively.
    Standard 10-fold cross validations were performed and the micro-averaged results are presented in this section.
    To make our system directly comparable to previous systems, all our experiments were based on identical training and test data splits of both corpora as reported in the experiments of Wong and Mooney (2006).
    Given a training set, we first run a variant of IBM alignment model 1 (Brown et al.,
