.
    On the other hand, because long nodes will tend to have low inside probabilities, taking the minimum of all scores strongly favors sequences of short nodes.
    Furthermore, their algorithm requires time 0(n3) to run just once.
    This is acceptable if the algorithm is run only after the first level, but running it more often would lead to an overall run time of 0(0).
    Finally, we hoped to find an algorithm that was somewhat less heuristic in nature.
    Our global thresholding technique thresholds out node N if the ratio between the most probable sequence of nodes including node N and the overall most probable sequence of nodes is less than some threshold, T. Formally, denoting sequences of nodes by L, we threshold node N if Now, the hard part is determining P(L), the probability of a node sequence.
    Unfortunately, there is no way to do this efficiently as part of the intermediate computation of a bottom-up chart parser.'
    We will approximate P(L) as follows: 'Some other parsing techniques, s
