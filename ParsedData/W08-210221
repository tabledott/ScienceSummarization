 or r-adjunction.
    For the spine features e(x, (i, &#951;)), we use feature templates that are sensitive to the identity of the spine &#951;, together with contextual features of the string x.
    These features consider the identity of the words and part-of-speech tags in a window that is centered on xi and spans the range x(i&#8722;2) ... x(i+2).
    In the experiments in this paper, the following three-step process was used: (1) derivations were extracted from a training set drawn from the Penn WSJ treebank, and then used to train a parsing model; (2) the test data was parsed using the resulting model, giving a derivation for each test data sentence; (3) the resulting test-data derivations were mapped back to Penn-treebank style trees, using the method described in section 2.1.
    To achieve step (1), we first apply a set of headfinding rules which are similar to those described in (Collins, 1997).
    Once the head-finding rules have been applied, it is straightforward to extract
