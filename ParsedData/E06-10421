    In this paper, we propose TroFi (Trope Finder), a nearly unsupervised clustering method for separating literal and nonliteral usages of verbs.
    For example, given the target verb &#8220;pour&#8221;, we would expect TroFi to cluster the sentence &#8220;Custom demands that cognac be poured from a freshly opened bottle&#8221; as literal, and the sentence &#8220;Salsa and rap music pour out of the windows&#8221; as nonliteral, which, indeed, it does.
    We call our method nearly unsupervised.
    See Section 3.1 for why we use this terminology.
    We reduce the problem of nonliteral language recognition to one of word-sense disambiguation by redefining literal and nonliteral as two different senses of the same word, and we adapt an existing similarity-based word-sense disambiguation method to the task of separating usages of verbs into literal and nonliteral clusters.
    This paper focuses on the algorithmic enhancements necessary to facilitate this transformation from word-sense
