tion of first in prosodic phrase, are highly correlated with the discourse uses of these words.
    As shown in Figure 11, we developed a baseline segmentation algorithm based on a simplification of these results, using the value of the single cue phrase feature cuei.
    That is, if a cue word occurs at the beginning of the prosodic phrase after the potential boundary site, the usage is assumed to be discourse.
    Thus the potential boundary site is classified as boundary and the phrase is taken to be the beginning of a new segment.
    Figure 10 shows boundaries (CUE) assigned by the algorithm.
    Table 4 shows the average performance of the cue word algorithm.
    Recall is 72% (a = .027; max = .88; mm = .40), precision is 15% (a = .003; max = .23; mm =-- .04), fallout is 53% (a = .006 max = .60; mm = .42) and error is 50% (a = .005 max = .60; mm -= .40).
    While recall is quite comparable to human performance (row 4), the precision is low while fallout and error are quite high. as input information ab
