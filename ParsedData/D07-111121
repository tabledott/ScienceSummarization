significantly, and it is likely that improvements would also be obtained in other languages.
			In addition, other learning approaches, such as memory-based lan guage processing (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 2005), could be used.
			A drawback of adding more models that became obvious in our experiments was the increased cost of both training (for example, the SVM parsers we used required significant ly longer to train than the MaxEnt parsers) and run-time (parsing with MBL models can be several times slower than with MaxEnt, or even SVM).
			A similar idea that may be more effective, but requires more effort, is to add parsers based on dif ferent approaches.
			For example, using MSTParser (McDonald and Pereira, 2005), a large-margin all pairs parser, in our domain adaptation procedure results in significantly improved accuracy (83.2 LAS).
			Of course, the use of different approaches used by different groups in the CoNLL 2006 and 2007 shared tasks represents great opportunity for parser ensembles.
