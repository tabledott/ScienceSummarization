he path is horizontal (a(i, j), a(i, j &#8212; 1)), the element's points a(i, j &#8212; 1) are not added to the path score (Figures 3b and 3c).1 3.
    Since a pair of conjunctive phrases/clauses often exhibit structural similarity, we hypothesize that analyses of CSs which maximize corresponding bunsetsus tend to lead to a correct resolution of the conjunctive scope.
    By this hypothesis, we impose penalty points on the pairs of elements in the path that cause one to multiple bunsetsu correspondence, giving priority to CSs that are constructed of components of the same size.
    Penalty points for (a (p&#8222; j), a (p,&#177;1, j &#8212; 1)) calculated by the following formula are subtracted from the path score (Figure 4): Note that these penalty points are also symmetrical, as shown in Figures 3b and 3c.

    Since each phrase in the CS has a certain coherence of meaning, special words that separate different meanings in a sentence often limit the scope of a CS.
