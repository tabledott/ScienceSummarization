handles multi-word units.
    Whereas for previous approaches the evaluation has been performed over mostly single word paraphrases, our results are reported exclusively over units of between 2 and 4 words.
    &#8226; Because we use a much more abundant source of data, our method can be used for a much wider range of text genres than previous approaches, namely any for which parallel data is available.
    One crucial thing to note is that we have demonstrated our paraphrases to be of higher quality when the alignments used to produce them are improved.
    This means that our method will reap the benefits of research that improvements to automatic alignment techniques (Callison-Burch et al., 2004), and will further improve as more parallel data becomes available.
    In the future we plan to: crease coverage for statistical machine translation when translating into &#8220;low-density&#8221; languages which have small parallel corpora.
