ines Agency (EMEA) corpus (Tiedemann, 2009) as IN, and the Europarl (EP) corpus (www.statmt.org/europarl) as OUT, for English/French translation in both directions.
    The dev and test sets were randomly chosen from the EMEA corpus.
    Figure 1 shows sample sentences from these domains, which are widely divergent.
    The second setting uses the news-related subcorpora for the NIST09 MT Chinese to English evaluation8 as IN, and the remaining NIST parallel Chinese/English corpora (UN, Hong Kong Laws, and Hong Kong Hansard) as OUT.
    The dev corpus was taken from the NIST05 evaluation set, augmented with some randomly-selected material reserved from the training set.
    The NIST06 and NIST08 evaluation sets were used for testing.
    (Thus the domain of the dev and test corpora matches IN.)
    Compared to the EMEA/EP setting, the two domains in the NIST setting are less homogeneous and more similar to each other; there is also considerably more IN text available.
    The corpora for both settings are summ
