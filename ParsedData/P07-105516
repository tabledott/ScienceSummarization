nstraints are chosen for the optimization.
    Typically these constraints are the k highest scoring labelings under the current weight vector.
    However, early experiments showed that the model quickly learned to discard any labeling with an incorrect document label for the instances in the training set.
    As a result, the constraints were dominated by labelings that only differed over sentence labels.
    This did not allow the algorithm adequate opportunity to set parameters relative to incorrect document labeling decisions.
    To combat this, k was divided by the number of document labels, to get a new value k'.
    For each document label, the k' highest scoring labelings were To this point, we have focused solely on a model for two-level fine-to-coarse sentiment analysis not only for simplicity, but because the experiments in Section 3 deal exclusively with this scenario.
    In this section, we briefly discuss possible extensions for more complex situations.
    For example, longer documents might
