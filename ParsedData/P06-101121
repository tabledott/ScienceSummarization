ce pairs from each document pair.
    This enables them to find sentences from fairly dissimilar documents, and to handle any amount of reordering, which makes the method applicable to truly comparable corpora.
    The research reported by Fung and Cheung (2004a; 2004b), Cheung and Fung (2004) and Wu and Fung (2005) is aimed explicitly at &#8220;very non-parallel corpora&#8221;.
    They also pair each source document with several target ones and examine all possible sentence pairs; but the list of document pairs is not fixed.
    After one round of sentence extraction, the list is enriched with additional documents, and the system iterates.
    Thus, they include in the search document pairs which are dissimilar.
    One limitation of all these methods is that they are designed to find only full sentences.
    Our methodology is the first effort aimed at detecting sub-sentential correspondences.
    This is a difficult task, requiring the ability to recognize translationally equivalent fragments even in non-
