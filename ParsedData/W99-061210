    Two bipartite graph structures are created in this way by these links.
    For reasons that will be explained later, raw counts are kept for the distributions.
    The probability of a token/context as being in or indicating a class is computed along the whole path from the root to the terminal node of the token/context.
    In this way, effective smoothing is realized for rare tokens or contexts.
    Considering a token/context formed from characwhere Ai E [0,1] and E Ai = 1 It is reasonable to expect that smaller lambdas should correspond to smaller indices, or even that Ai &lt; A2 &lt; &lt; An.
    In order to keep the number of parameters low, we used the following model: where a,13 E (0, 1), i3 having a small value The symbol F is used instead of P since we have raw distributions (frequencies) and a normalization step is needed to compute the final probability distribution.
    A simpler model can use just one parameter (setting /3 = an), but this has limited flexibility in optimizing the hierarchic
