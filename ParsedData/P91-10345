 here as Figure 1.)
    In a Viterbi alignment, a French word that is connected by a line to an English word is said to be aligned with that English word.
    Thus, in Figure 1, Les is aligned with The, propositions with proposal, and so on.
    We call a pair of aligned words obtained in this wa.y a connection.
    From the Viterbi alignments for 1,002,165 pairs of short French and English sentences from the Canadian Hansard data [Brown et al., 1990], we have extracted a set of 12,028,485 connections.
    Let p(e, f) be the probability that a connection chosen at random from this set will connect the English word e to the French word f. Because each French word gives rise to exactly one connection, the right marginal of this distribution is identical to the distribution of French words in these sentences.
    The left marginal, however, is not the same as the distribution of English words: English words that tend to produce several French words at a time are overrepresented while those that tend to produce n
