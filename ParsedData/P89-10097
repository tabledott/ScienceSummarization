  In addition, the verb case frame used to construct he utterance speci- fies whether or not the linguistic realization of the entity filling each case role is obligatory: as we will see below, this allows us to model a common linguistic phenomenon in recipes (recipe contezt empty objects, after Massam and Roberge (1989)).
  For a case role whose surface realization is obliga- tory, the resulting deep semantic structure is then as follows: D$ = i nde :  : : [ N~en = + statttm : e.cntrs : t sem : oblig -~ + "Pec = [ "PC=q)  I This will be realized as either a pronoun or an elided NP, generated from a surface semantic struc- ture which is constructed in accordance with the following rules: ?
  If the status includes the features [centre, +] and [oblig, +], then there should be a cor- responding element in the surface semantic structure, with a null value specified for the descriptiv
