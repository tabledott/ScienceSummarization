each of the relevant conditions in turn, keeping in mind that the only transitions that modify the graph are LEFT-ARCpl and RIGHT-ARCpl .
    Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 4 graph non-projective only if there is a node k such that i &lt; k &lt; j or j &lt; k &lt; i and neither i &#8594;* k nor j &#8594;* k. Let C0,m be a configuration sequence for x = (w0, w1, ... , wn) and let &#928;(p, i, j) (for 0 &lt; p &lt; m, 0 &#8804; i &lt; j &#8804; n) be the claim that, for every k such that i &lt; k &lt; j, i &#8594;* k or j &#8594;* k in Gcp.
    To prove that no arc can be non-projective, we need to prove that, if cp &#8712; C0,m and cp = (&#955;1|i, &#955;2,j |&#946;,Ac ), then &#928;(p,i,j).
    (If cp = (&#955;1 |i,&#955;2,j|&#946;,Acp) and &#928;(p,i,j), then &#928;(p', i, j) for Z p' such that p &lt; p', because in cp every node k such that i &lt; k &lt; j must already have a head.)
    We prove this by induction over the number &#8710;(p) of transitions leading to cp from the first configurati
