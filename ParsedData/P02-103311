the entire task, and to help offset the possible tendency of any single MT system to be unnaturally consistent in its lexical selection.
    The English BCSV1SV2WSJ was translated into French and Spanish, resulting in four parallel corpora: BCSV1SV2WSJ paired with the French GL translation (yielding parallel corpus FRGL), with French SYS translation (FRSYS), with Spanish GL (SPGL), and with Spanish SYS (SPSYS).4 Each of the four parallel corpora just described (FRGL, FRSYS, SPGL, SPSYS) represents a separate experimental variant.
    Consistent with Diab (2000), we added one more variant for each language in order to more closely approach the variability associated with multiple translations: in Step 2 we combined the target sets from the two MT systems.
    For example, if the word types shore, bank are in the target set of orilla in SPGL, and coast, bank, and shore are in the target set for orilla in SPSYS, the union of the target sets is taken and the result is a merged target set for orilla containing {ba
