    The verbs were to be classified into the three target classes&#8212;unergative, unaccusative, and object-drop&#8212; which were described in the instructions.

    Table 16 shows an analysis of the results, reporting both percent agreement and pairwise agreement (according to the Kappa statistic) among the experts and the program.'
    Assessing the percentage of verbs on which the experts agree gives us an intuitive measure.
    However, this measure does not take into account how much the experts agree over the expected agreement by chance.
    The latter is provided by the Kappa statistic, which we calculated following Klauer (1987, 55-57) (using the z distribution to determine significance; p &lt; 0.001 for all reported results).
    The Kappa value measures the experts', a
