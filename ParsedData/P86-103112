ws that the choice of the Cb-realizing zero pronominal depends entirely on the preceding discourse context.
    On the other hand, if some inherent property of a zero pronominal (e.g., subject/object) independently decides which one realizes the Cb, the previous context need not be considered.
    For instance, if a zero-subject is always more closely associated with the Cb than a zero-object, the discourse sequence (3) to (4) changes the Cb from Rosa to Mary.
    In the extension (5), Rosa (the previous Cb) is mentioned with a full name while the single zero pronominal picks out a previous non-Cb, Mary.
    If Rosa is still the Cb here, this utterance violates the basic Centering rule, so the rule predicts unacceptability, which is indeed the case following the sequence (2).n The same rule, however, provides no clue for the puzzling acceptability of the same extension following the sequence (3).
    Moreover, it is possible that Rosa is no longer the Cb in (5), in which case, rule (1) simply does not apply.
