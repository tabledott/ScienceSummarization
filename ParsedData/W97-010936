 than the correct ones, i.e. most of the incorrect attachments are marked as less certain.
    &#8226; The prepositional statistics indicates that there were no matches found for the given quadruple and the attachment was decided based on the statistical frequency of the given preposition.
    Adjectival default was used in three cases when the preposition was not found in the training set.
    The certainty between 0.5 and 0.8 accounts mostly for the examples whose attachment was made through the decision tree, but there was either a small number of examples that participated on the creation of the tree branch or the examples were not sufficiently representative (e.g. contradictory examples).
    Most of the examples in this category possibly require a wider sentential context for further improvement of accuracy.
    The certainty bigger than 0.8 and smaller than .1.0 accounts for the situations when the decision was based on a leaf whose further expansion was terminated by the homogeneity termination condit
