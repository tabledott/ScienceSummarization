    The structure of scientific articles does not reflect relevance this explicitly.
    Instead, the introduction often starts with general statements about the importance of the topic and its history in the field; the actual contribution of the paper itself is often given much later.
    The length of scientific articles presents another problem.
    Let us assume that our overall summarization strategy is first to select relevant sentences or concepts, and then to synthesize summaries using this material.
    For a typical 10- to 20-sentence news wire story, a compression to 20% or 30% of the source provides a reasonable input set for the second step.
