 uniform: a(i = (I + 1)-1 for all i.
    Generation.
    Equations (75)-(78) describe the following process for producing f from e: Useful Formulae.
    Just as for Model 1, the independence assumptions allow us to calculate the sum over alignments (52) in closed form: By assumption (77) the connections of a are independent given the length m of f. Using Equation (81) we find that they are also independent given f: where Viterbi Alignment.
    For this model, and thus also for Model 1, we can express in closed form the Viterbi alignment V(f I e) between a pair of strings (f, e): Parameter Reestimation Formulae.
    We can find the parameter values 0 that maximize the relative objective function R(Po, Po) by applying the considerations of Section B.2.
    The counts c(w; a, f, e) of Equation (58) are We obtain the parameter reestimation formulae for t(f I e) and a(i I j,l,m) by using these counts in Equations (62)&#8212;(66).
    Equation (64) requires a sum over alignments.
    If PO satisfies as is the case
