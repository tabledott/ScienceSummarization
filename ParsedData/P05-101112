    We used an HPSG grammar derived from Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) Section 02-21 (39,832 sentences) by our method of grammar development (Miyao et al., 2004).
    The training data was the HPSG treebank derived from the same portion of the Penn Treebank3.
    For the training, we eliminated sentences with no less than 40 words and for which the parser could not produce the correct parse.
    The resulting training set consisted of 33,574 sentences.
    The treebanks derived from Sections 22 and 23 were used as the development (1,644 sentences) and final test sets (2,299 sentences).
    We measured the accuracy of predicate-argument dependencies output by the parser.
    A dependency is defined as a tuple (7, wh, a, wa), where 7 is the predicate type (e.g., adjective, intransitive verb), wy, is the head word of the predicate, a is the argument label (MODARG, ARG1, ..., ARG4), and wa is the head word of the argument.
    Labeled precision/recall (LP/LR) is the ratio
