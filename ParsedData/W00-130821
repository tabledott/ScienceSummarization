ve been instantiated for the different models as well as the total number of features each model has.
    It can be seen that the features which help disambiguate verb forms, which look at capitalization and the first of the feature templates for particles are a very small number as compared to the features of the other kinds.
    The improvement in classification accuracy therefore comes at the price of adding very few parameters to the maximum entropy model and does not result in increased model complexity.
  
  
    Even when the accuracy figures for corpus-based part-of-speech taggers start to look extremely similar, it is still possible to move performance levels up.
    The work presented in this paper explored just a few information sources in addition to the ones usually used for tagging.
    While progress is slow, because each new feature applies only to a limited range of cases, nevertheless the improvement in accuracy as compared to previous results is noticeable, particularly for the individual d
