e the authors&#8217; claims, they offer no quantitative evaluation comparing their paraphrases with those from Lin and Pantel (2001) or from Barzilay and McKeown (2001).
    It is also possible to find correspondences between the parallel sentences using a more direct approach instead of relying on distributional similarity.
    Pang, Knight, and Marcu (2003) propose an algorithm to align sets of parallel sentences driven entirely by the syntactic representations of the sentences.
    The alignment algorithm outputs a merged lattice from which lexical, phrasal, and sentential paraphrases can simply be read off.
    More specifically, they use the Multiple-Translation Chinese corpus that was originally developed for machine translation evaluation and contains 11 human-written English translations for each sentence in a news document.
    Using several sentences explicitly equivalent in semantic content has the advantage of being a richer source for paraphrase induction.
    As a pre-processing step, any group
