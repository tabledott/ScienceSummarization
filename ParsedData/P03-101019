;sig.&#8221; column mean that the difference in averages for AVSIM is statistically significant at 1% and 5% based on a one-sided Welch test.
    In these tables, except for the differences in the averages for B and C in Table 4, all differences in averages are statistically significant.
    This indicates that AVSIM can discriminate between differences in judgment.
    In other words, the AVSIM values correspond well with human judgment.
    We then tried to determine why B and C in Table 4 were not separated by inspecting the article alignments and found that alignments evaluated as C in Table 4 had relatively large overlaps compared with alignments judged as C in Table 3.
    It was more difficult to distinguish B or C in Table 4 than in Table 3.
    We next classified all article alignments in 19962001 and 1989-1996 based on the thresholds in Tables 3 and 4.
    The numbers of alignments are in Table 5.
    It shows that the number of alignments estimated to be A or B was 46738 (= 31495 + 15243).
