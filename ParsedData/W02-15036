but are experimenting with incorporating different kinds of information into the grammar.
    The Norwegian grammar includes a semantic projection; their analyses produce not only c- and f-structures, but also semantic structures.
    The Urdu grammar has implemented a level of argument structure and is testing various theoretical linguistic ideas.
    However, even when the grammars are used for different purposes and have different additional features, they have maintained their basic parallelism in analysis and have profited from the shared grammar writing techniques and technology.
    Table (1) shows the size of the grammars.
    The first figure is the number of left-hand side categories in phrase-structure rules which compile into a collection of finite-state machines with the listed number of states and arcs.
  
  
    Maintaining parallelism in grammars being developed at different sites on typologically distinct languages by grammar writers from different linguistic traditions has proven successful.
