e the generation abilities of our algorithm.
    Second, themes for which the RFA was unable to create a reference sentence were also removed from the test set.
    As mentioned above, Simfinder does not always produce accurate themes,12 and therefore, the RFA could choose not to generate a reference sentence if the theme sentences had too little in common.
    An example of a theme for which no sentence was generated is shown in Table 6.
    As a result of this filtering, 34% of the sentences were removed.
    4.1.3 Baselines.
    In addition to the system-generated sentence, we also included in the evaluation a fusion sentence generated by another human (hereafter, RFA2) and three baselines.
    (Following the DUC terminology, we refer to the baselines, our system, and the RFA2 as peers.)
    The first baseline is the shortest sentence among the theme sentences, which is obviously grammatical, and it also has a good chance of being representative of common topics conveyed in the input.
    The second baseli
