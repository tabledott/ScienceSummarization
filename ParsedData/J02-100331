    Phase 3.
    Based on the Values of L and C coming out of Phase 2, perform D&amp;RPlural using all properties of the form P+/_ U P+/_ U P+/_.
    If this is successful, then stop; otherwise, go to Phase 4.
    Etc.
    One can require without loss of generality that no property, considered at any phase, may have different occurrences of the same atom.
    (For example, it is useless to consider the property P1 U P2 U P1, which must be true of any element in the domain, or the property P1 U P2 U P1, which is equivalent to the earlier-considered property P1 U P2.)
    Therefore, since at phase n there is room for properties of length n, the maximal number of phases equa
