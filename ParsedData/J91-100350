nt analogies (diamond 3).
    The basic mappings in collation are paths found by a graph search algorithm that operates over the sense-network.
    Five types of network path are distinguished.
    Two types of path, called ancestor and same, denote kinds of &amp;quot;inclusion,&amp;quot; e.g., that the class of vehicles includes the class of cars (this is an ancestor relationship).
    Satisfied Substitu e metonym for source or target 2 applicable metonymic inference rule preferences are indicated by network paths denoting inclusion, also known as &amp;quot;inclusive&amp;quot; paths (see diamond 1 in Figure 4).
    The other three types of network path, called sister, descendant, and estranged, denote &amp;quot;exclusion,&amp;quot; e.g., that the class of cars does not include the class of vehicles (this is a descendant relationship).
    Violated preferences are network paths denoting exclusion, also known as &amp;quot;exclusive&amp;quot; paths.
    These paths are used to build more complex mappings found
