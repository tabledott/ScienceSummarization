WSM weblog data set and evaluation with wikipedia event lists at the same period as weblogs demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed temporal collocation model and event detection algorithms.
			Currently, we do not consider user groups and locations.
			This methodology will be extended to model the collocations over time and location, and the relationship between the user-preferred usage of collocations and the profile of users.
