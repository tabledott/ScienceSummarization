    Related research in the CLTE direction is reported in (Negri and Mehdad, 2010), which describes the creation of an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE-3 dataset by translating the English hypotheses into Spanish.
    Translations have been crowdsourced adopting a methodology based on translation-validation cycles, defined as separate HITs.
    Although simplifying the CLTE corpus creation problem, which is recast as the task of translating already available annotated data, this solution is relevant to our work for the idea of combining gold standard units and &#8220;validation HITS&#8221; as a way to control the quality of the collected data at runtime.
  
  
    The design of data acquisition HITs has to take into account several factors, each having a considerable impact on the difficulty of instructing the workers, the quality and quantity of the collected data, the time and overall costs of the acquisition.
    A major distinction has to be made
