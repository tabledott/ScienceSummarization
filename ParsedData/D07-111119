ntly differ ent, with both labeled attachment scores at about 77.3 (the SVM model score was 76.1, and the final combination score on development data was 79.3).
			In Turkish, however, the backward score was sig nificantly higher than the forward score, 75.0 and 72.3, respectively.
			The forward SVM score was 73.1, and the combined score was 75.8.
			In expe riments performed after the official submission of results, we evaluated a backward SVM model (which was trained after submission) on the same development set, and found it to be significantly more accurate than the forward model, with a score of 75.7.
			Adding that score to the combination raised the combination score to 77.9 (a large im provement from 75.8).
			The likely reason for this difference is that over 80% of the dependencies in the Turkish data set have the head to the right of 1048 the dependent, while only less than 4% have the head to the left.
			This means that the backward model builds much more partial structure in the stack as it con
