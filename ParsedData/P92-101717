   The initial grammar consists of all 4095 possible CNF rules over 15 nonterminals (the same number as in the tree bank) and 48 terminal symbols for part-of-speech tags.
    A random initial grammar was trained separately on the unbracketed and bracketed versions of the training corpus, yielding grammars GR and GB two stabilize at very close values: after 75 iterations, ii(W, GB)'A,' 2.97 and f/(W, GB) ^4 2.95.
    However, the analyses assigned by the resulting grammars to the test set are drastically different. pus With the training and test data described above, the bracketing accuracy of GB, after 75 iterations was only 37.35%, in contrast to 90.36% bracketing accuracy for GB.
    Plotting bracketing accuracy against iterations (Figure 3), we see that unbracketed training does not on the whole improve accuracy.
    On the other hand, bracketed training steadily improves accuracy, although not monotonically.
    It is also interesting to look at some the differences between GR and GB, as seen from the mos
