d its result as a sentence: In the theory of CCG, basic categories are regarded as complex objects that include syntactic features such as number, gender, and case.
    For the grammars in this article, categories are augmented with some additional information, such as head information, and also features on S categories which distinguish different types of sentence, such as declarative, infinitival, and wh-question.
    This additional information will be described in later sections.
    Categories are combined in a derivation using combinatory rules.
    In the original Categorial Grammar (Bar-Hillel 1953), which is context-free, there are two rules of functional application: where X and Y denote categories (either basic or complex).
    The first rule is forward application (&gt;) and the second rule is backward application (&lt;).
    Figure 1 gives an example derivation using these rules.
    CCG extends the original Categorial Grammar by introducing a number of additional combinatory rules.
