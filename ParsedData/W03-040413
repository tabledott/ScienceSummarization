hor did this labeling; this person did not look at or run tests on the experiment corpus.
    We classified the words as StrongSubjective, WeakSubjective, or Objective.
    Objective terms are not subjective at all (e.g., &#8220;chair&#8221; or &#8220;city&#8221;).
    StrongSubjective terms have strong, unambiguously subjective connotations, such as &#8220;bully&#8221; or &#8220;barbarian&#8221;.
    WeakSubjective was used for three situations: (1) words that have weak subjective connotations, such as &#8220;aberration&#8221; which implies something out of the ordinary but does not evoke a strong sense of judgement, (2) words that have multiple senses or uses, where one is subjective but the other is not.
    For example, the word &#8220;plague&#8221; can refer to a disease (objective) or an onslaught of something negative (subjective), (3) words that are objective by themselves but appear in idiomatic expressions that are subjective.
    For example, the word &#8220;eyebrows&#8221; was labeled WeakSubjecti
