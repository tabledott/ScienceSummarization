actor or object must perform or be subjected to the same action, or be the subject of the same description.
    For example, Figure 1 shows three input text fragments (paragraphs) taken from the TDT pilot corpus (see Section 5.1), all from the same topic on the forced landing of a U.S. helicopter in North Korea.
    We consider units (a) and (b) in Figure 1 to be similar, because they both focus on the same event (loss of contact) with the same primary participant (the helicopter).
    On the other hand, unit (c) in Figure 1 is not similar to either (a) or (b).
    Although all three refer to a helicopter, the primary focus in (c) is on the emergency landing rather than the loss of contact.
    We discuss an experimental validation of our similarity definition in Section 5.2, after we introduce the corpus we use in our experiments.
  
  
    Although there is related empirical research on determining text similarity, primarily in the information retrieval community, there are two major differences between the
