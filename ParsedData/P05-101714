method, such as Bethe approximation (Tanaka et al., 2003).
    The theory tells us which update rule to use.
    We also have a notion of magnetization, which can be used for hyperparameter estimation.
    We can use a plenty of knowledge, methods and algorithms developed in the field of statistical mechanics.
    We can also extend our model to a multiclass model (Q-Ising model).
    Another interesting point is the relation to maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996), which is popular in the natural language processing community.
    Our model can be obtained by maximizing the entropy of the probability distribution Q(x) under constraints regarding the energy function.
  
  
    We used glosses, synonyms, antonyms and hypernyms of WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to construct an English lexical network.
    For part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization of glosses, we used TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).
    35 stopwords (quite frequent words such as &#8220;be&#8221; and &#8220;have&#8221;) are removed from the lexical
