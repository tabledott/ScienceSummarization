ecisions.
    This is not always the case.
    For instance, in our ILEX domain [Mellish et al 98] the system's goal is something very general like &amp;quot;say interesting things about item X,' subject to length and coherence constraints&amp;quot;.
    The third approach, most obviously exemplified by [Marcu 97], is to use some form of explicit search through possible trees, guided by heuristics about tree quality.
    Marcu first of all attempts to find the best ordering of the facts.
    For every relation that could be indicated, constraints are generated saying what the order of the two facts involved should be and that the facts should be adjacent.
    The constraints are weighted according to attributes of rhetorical relations that have been determined empirically.
    A standard constraint satisfaction algorithm is used to find the linear sequence such that the total weight of the satisfied constraints is maximal.
    Once the sequence of facts is known, a general algorithm [Marcu 96] is used to cons
