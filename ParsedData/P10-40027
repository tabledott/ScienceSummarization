s in the input.
    Figure 3 illustrates two example hypergraphs, one generated using a SCFG model and other from a phrase-based model.
    Edges are associated with exactly one synchronous production in the source and target language, and alternative translation possibilities are expressed as alternative edges.
    Edges are further annotated with feature values, and are annotated with the source span vector the edge corresponds to.
    An edge&#8217;s output label may contain mixtures of terminal symbol yields and positions indicating where a child node&#8217;s yield should be substituted.
    2The parser is smart enough to detect the left-branching grammars generated by lexical translation and tagging models, and use a more efficient intersection algorithm. specifies what path is taken from the input (one of the bold ovals) to a unified translation hypergraph.
    The highlighted path is the workflow used in the test reported in &#167;7.
    In the case of SCFG grammars, the edges correspond simply to rule
