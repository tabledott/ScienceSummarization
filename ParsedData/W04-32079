e templates used by our model are shown in Table 2.
    The first feature corresponds to the fully-described child-generation event; others are similar but less informative.
    These &#8220;overlapping&#8221; features offer a kind of backoff, so that each child-generation event&#8217;s weight receives a contribution from several granularities of description.
    Feature selection is done by simple thresholding: if a feature is observed 5 times or more in the training set, its weight is estimated; otherwise its weight is locked at Model Formalism Estimation Role English syntax (&#167;3.1) bilexical dependency discriminative estimation combines with Korean grammar syntax for bilingual parsing Korean morphology (&#167;3.2) two-sequence discriminative estimation best analysis used as input trigram model over a lattice to TM training and to parsing Korean syntax (&#167;3.3) PCFG smoothed MLE combines with English syntax for bilingual parsing Translation model (&#167;3.4) IBM models 1&#8211;4, unsupervised estimat
