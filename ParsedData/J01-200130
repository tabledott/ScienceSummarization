 suffixes is modified (in some cases by a shift of a single letter, in others by an unconstrained shift to another location within the word) to form a new grammar.
    In one experiment described by Kazakov, the population was set to 800, and 2,000 generations were modeled.
    On a Pentium 90 and a vocabulary of 120 items, the computation took over eight hours.
    Work by Michael Brent (1993) and Carl de Marcken (1995) has explored analyses of the fourth type as well.
    Researchers have been aware of the utility of the informationtheoretic notion of compression from the earliest days of information theory, and there have been efforts to discover useful, frequent chunks of letters in text, such as Radhakrishnan (1978), but to my knowledge, Brent's and de Marcken's works were the first to explicitly propose the guiding of linguistic hypotheses by such notions.
    Brent's work addresses the question of determining the correct morphological analysis of a corpus of English words, given their syntactic categor
