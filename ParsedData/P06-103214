ise correct.
    However, changes in upper and lower case and punctuation were ignored.
    The 55.28% per-sentence score for Whole matches in the system trained on the 45K data set means that it correctly proposed full corrections in 61.8% of locations where corrections needed to be made.
    The percentage of Missed errors, i.e., targeted errors that were ignored by the system, is correspondingly low.
    On the 45K training data set, the system performs nearly on a par with Word in terms of not inducing corrections on forms that did not require replacement, as shown in the Correctly Left column.
    The dip in accuracy in the 30K sentence pair training set is an artifact of our extraction methodology: the relatively small lexical set that we are addressing here appears to be oversensitive to random variation in the engineered training data.
    This makes it difficult to set a meaningful lower bound on the amount of training data that might be needed for adequate coverage.
    Nonetheless, it is evident fr
