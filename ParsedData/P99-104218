    Finally, we plan to do similar human labeling experiments for semantic class identification, to determine the potential effect of this knowledge source.
    Our results reveal that different questiontypes behave very differently, as shown in Figure 4.
    Why questions are by far the hardest (performance around 20%) because they require understanding of rhetorical structure and because answers tend to be whole clauses (often occurring as stand-alone sentences) rather than phrases embedded in a context that matches the query closely.
    On the other hand, who and when queries benefit from reliable person, name, and time extraction.
    Who questions seem to benefit most dramatically from perfect name tagging combined with filtering and pronoun resolution.
    What questions show relatively little benefit from the various linguistic techniques, probably because there are many types of what question, most of which are not answered by a person, time or place.
    Finally, where question results are qu
