problem of accuracy by presenting the sorted list of translations to the translator for a choice.
    In all cases, the correct translation was found in this list and translators were able to speed up both the task of identifying technical terminology and translating terms.
    Other recent related work aims at using statistical techniques to produce translations of single words (Fung and McKeown 1994; Wu and Xia 1994; Fung 1995b) as opposed to collocations or phrases.
    Wu and Xia (1994) employed an estimationmaximization technique to find the optimal word alignment from previously sentencealigned clean parallel corpora2, with additional significance filtering.
    The work by Fung and McKeown (1994) and Fung (1995b) is notable for its use of techniques suitable to Asian/Romance language pairs as well as Romance language pairs.
    Given that Asian languages differ considerably in structure from Romance languages, statistical methods that were previously proposed for pairs of European languages do not work
