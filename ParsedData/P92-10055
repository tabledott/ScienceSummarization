some kinds of reference resolution in an earlier QLF formalism).
    For concreteness, we present a few illustrative examples of monotonic QLF resolution2.
    We do not attempt to describe the mechanism by which the resolutions are chosen.
    It will become evident that the notation is closer to (the syntactic structure of) natural language than is the case for traditional logical formalisms.
    For example, terms usually correspond to noun phrases, with information about whether e.g. they are pronominal, quantified or proper names included in the term's category.
    This makes the QLF representation easier to read than it might seem at first, once its initial unfamiliarity is overcome.
    Quantification: Every boy met a tall girl illustrates the representation of quantification.
    The basic QLF analysis might be (ignoring tense): _s :meet (term(+b, &lt;type=q,lex=every&gt; ,boy , _q, _x) , term(+g,&lt;type=q,lex=a&gt;, Y'and(girl(Y),tall(Y)),_r,_y)).
    A resolved structure could be obtained by insta
