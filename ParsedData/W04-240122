 features from the two arguments; (3) some patterns extracted from the sentence or between the two arguments.
    Some features in category (3) are &#8220;the number of words between arg1 and arg2 &#8221;, &#8220;whether arg1 and arg2 are the same word&#8221;, or &#8220;arg1 is the beginning of the sentence and has words that consist of all capitalized characters&#8221;, where ar$1 and ar$2 represent the first and second argument entities respectively.
    In addition, Table 1 presents some patterns we use.
    The learning algorithm used is a variation of the Winnow update rule incorporated in SNoW (Roth, 1998; Roth and Yih, 2002), a multi-class classifier that is specifically tailored for large scale learning tasks.
    SNoW learns a sparse network of linear functions, in which the targets (entity classes or relation classes, in this case) are represented as linear functions over a common feature space.
    While SNoW can be used as a classifier and predicts using a winner-take-all mechanism over the activa
