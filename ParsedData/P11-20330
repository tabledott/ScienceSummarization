  Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Rich Non-local Features
  
    Transition-based dependency parsers generally use heuristic decoding algorithms but can accommodate arbitrarily rich feature representations.
    In this paper, we show that we can improve the accuracy of such parsers by considering even richer feature sets than those employed in previous systems.
    In the standard Penn Treebank setup, our novel features improve attachment score form 91.4% to 92.9%, giving the best results so far for transitionbased parsing and rivaling the best results overall.
    For the Chinese Treebank, they give a signficant improvement of the state of the art.
    An open source release of our parser is freely available.
  
  
    Transition-based dependency parsing (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2006b; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Huang and Sagae, 2010) utilize a deterministic shift-reduce process for making structural predictions.
    Compared to graph-based dependency parsing, it typically offers line
