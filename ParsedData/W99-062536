have to explore additional or more informative indicators of similarity.
  
  
    We compute a feature vector over a pair of textual units, where features are either primitive, consisting of one characteristic, or composite, consisting of pairs of primitive features.
    Our features draw on a number of linguistic approaches to text analysis, and are based on both single words and simplex noun phrases (head nouns preceded by optional premodifiers but with no embedded recursion).
    Each of these morphological, syntactic, and semantic features has several variations.
    We thus consider the following potential matches between text units: identified using the ALEMBIC tool set [Aberdeen et al. 1995].
    Variations on proper noun matching include restricting the proper noun type to a person, place, or an organization (these subcategories are also extracted with ALEMBIC's named entity finder).
    In order to normalize for text length and frequency effects, we experimented with two types of optional normalizat
