inite descriptions on the other (first-mention).
    Splitting things this way did result in an agreement of K = 0.76, i.e., almost a good reliability, although not quite as strong an agreement as we would have expected.
    The alternative of putting in one class all discourse-related definite descriptions&#8212;coreferential and bridging references&#8212;and putting larger situation and unfamiliar definite descriptions in a second class resulted in a worse agreement, although not by much (K = 0.73).
    This suggests that our subjects did reasonably well at distinguishing first-mention from subsequent-mention entities, but not at drawing more complex distinctions.
    They were particularly bad at distinguishing bridging references from other definite descriptions: dividing the classifications into bridging definites, on the one hand, and all other definite descriptions, on the other, resulted in a very low agreement (K = 0.24).
    We obtained about the same results by computing the per-class percentage of
