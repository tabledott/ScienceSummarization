    For the rest of the paper, we restrict our attention to binary derivations, except where explicitly noted otherwise.
    To measure the number of gaps needed to generate a given word alignment, we used a bottom-up hierarchical alignment algorithm to infer a binary synchronous parse tree that was consistent with the alignment, using as few gaps as possible.
    A hierarchical alignment algorithm is a type of synchronous parser where, instead of constraining inferences by the production rules of a grammar, the constraints come from word alignments and possibly other sources (Wu, 1997; Melamed and Wang, 2005).
    A bottom-up hierarchical aligner begins with word-to-word links as constituents, where some of the links might be to nothing (&#8220;NULL&#8221;).
    It then repeatedly composes constituents with other constituents to make larger ones, trying to find a constit
