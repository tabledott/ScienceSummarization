(Section 7) with a summary of the most important observations and interesting directions for future research.
  
  
    In recent years there has been an explosion of research in machine learning on finding ways to improve the accuracy of supervised classifier learning methods.
    An important finding is that a set of classifiers whose individual decisions are combined in some way (an ensemble) can be more accurate than any of its component classifiers if the errors of the individual classifiers are sufficiently uncorrelated (see Dietterich [1997], Chan, Stolfo, and Wolpert [1999] for overviews).
    There are several ways in which an ensemble can be created, both in the selection of the individual classifiers and in the way they are combined.
    One way to create multiple classifiers is to use subsamples of the training examples.
    In bagging, the training set for each individual classifier is created by randomly drawing training examples with replacement from the initial training set (Breiman 1996a).
