    Table 7 compares all methods covered so far - baseline, two component methods, and two hybrid methods.
    (A sixth method, trigrams, is included as well - it will be discussed in Section 4.)
    The table shows that the Bayesian hybrid method does at least as well as the previous four methods for almost every confusion set.
    Occasionally it scores slightly less than collocations; this appears to be due to some averaging effect where noisy context words are dragging it down.
    Occasionally too it scores less than decision lists, but never by much; on the whole, it yields a modest but consistent improvement, and ill the case of {between, among}, a sizable improvement.
    We believe the improvement is due to considering all of the evidence, rather than just the single strongest piece, which makes the method more robust to inaccurate judgements about which piece of evidence is &amp;quot;strongest&amp;quot;.
