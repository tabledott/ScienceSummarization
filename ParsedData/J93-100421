troduced here so that adding distances will produce desirable results.
    This distance measure is based on the assumption that each character in one language, L1, gives rise to a random number of characters in the other language, L2.
    We assume these random variables are independent and identically distributed with a normal distribution.
    The model is then specified by the mean, c, and variance, s2, of this distribution. c is the expected number of characters in L2 per character in L1, and s2 is the variance of the number of characters in L2 per character in L1.
    We define 6 to be (12 &#8212; lic)/V/i s2 so that it has a normal distribution with mean zero and variance one (at least when the two portions of text under consideration actually do happen to be translations of one another).
    Figure 2 is a check on the assumption that 6 is normally distributed.
    The figure is constructed using the parameters c and s2 estimated for the program.
    Variance is modeled proportional to length.
