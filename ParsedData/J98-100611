t.
    In Section 3, we consider how they can be used for unsupervised training.
    Examples where the target was part of a proper noun were also removed; for example, Japan Air Lines was not taken as an example of line. first 25, 50, 100, and 200 examples of the least frequent sense, and examples from the other senses in numbers that reflected their relative frequencies in the corpus.
    As an illustration, in the smallest training set for hard, there were 25 examples of the least frequent sense, 37 examples of the second most frequent sense, and 256 examples of the most frequent sense.
    The test sets were of fixed size: each contained 150 of the least frequent sense and examples of the other senses in numbers that reflected their relative frequencies.
    The operation of TLC consists of preprocessing, training, and testing.
    During preprocessing, examples are tagged with a part-of-speech tagger (Brill 1994); special tags are inserted at sentence breaks; and each open-class word found in WordNet is
