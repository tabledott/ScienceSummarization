mensions across the fiber labels (in the DM formalism, this would amount to finding commonalities across w1, l, and w2 elements).
    Another possible use for smoothing would be to propagate &#8220;link mass&#8221; across parts of speech.
    Our tensors, being based on POS tagging and dependency parsing, have 0 values for noun-link-noun tuples such as (city, obj, destruction) and (city, subj tr, destruction).
    In a smoothed tensor, by the influence of tuples such as (city, obj, destroy) and (city, sbj tr, destroy), these tuples will get some non-0 weight that, hopefully, will make the object relation between city and destruction emerge.
    This is at the moment just a conjecture, but it constitutes an exciting direction for further work focusing on tensor decomposition within the DM framework.
  
  
    A general framework for distributional semantics should satisfy the following two requirements: (1) representing corpus-derived data in such a way as to capture aspects of meaning that have so far been mo
