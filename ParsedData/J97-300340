guesser.
    In our experiments the category of unknown proper nouns had a larger share (6364%) than we expect in real life because all the capitalized words with frequency less than 20 were taken out of the lexicon.
    The cascading guesser also helped to improve the accuracy on unknown proper nouns by about 1% in comparison to Brill's guesser and about 3&#176;/0 in comparison to Xerox's guesser.
    The cascading guesser outperformed the other two guessers on every subcorpus of the Brown Corpus.
    Table 5 shows the distribution of the workload and the tagging accuracy among the different rule sets of the cascading guesser.
    The default assignment of the NN tag to unguessed words performed very poorly, having the error rate of 44%.
    When we compared this distribution to that of the Xerox guesser we saw that the accuracy of the Xerox guesser itself was only about 6.5% lower than that of the cascading guesser' and the fact that it could handle 6% fewer unknown words than the cascading guesser resulted
