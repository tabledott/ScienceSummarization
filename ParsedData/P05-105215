 type of entity and a GPE or LOC entity.
    In this section we will describe the kernels designed for different syntactic sources and explain the intuition behind them.
    We define two kernels to match relation examples at surface level.
    Using the notation just defined, we can write the two surface kernels as follows: KT is a kernel that matches two tokens.
    I(x, y) is a binary string match operator that gives 1 if x=y and 0 otherwise.
    Kernel &#936;1 matches attributes of two entity arguments respectively, such as type, subtype and lexical head of an entity.
    This is based on the observation that there are type constraints on the two arguments.
    For instance PER-SOC is a relation mostly between two person entities.
    So the attributes of the entities are crucial clues.
    Lexical information is also important to distinguish relation types.
    For instance, in the phrase U.S. president there is an EMP-ORG relation between president and U.S., while in a U.S. businessman there is a GPE-AF
