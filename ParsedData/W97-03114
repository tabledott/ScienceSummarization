tect word sequences that are often paraphrased in translation, but have perfectly compositional meanings in the monolingual sense.
    For example, &amp;quot;tax system&amp;quot; is most often translated into French as &amp;quot;regime fiscale.&amp;quot; Each new batch of validated NCCs raises the value of the objective function for the given application, as demonstrated in Section 8.
    You can skip ahead to Table 4 for a random sample of the NCCs that the method validated for use in a machine translation task.
    The NCC detection method makes some assumptions about the properties of statistical translation models, but no assumptions about the data from which the models are constructed.
    Therefore, the method is applicable to parallel data other than parallel texts.
    For example, Section 8 applies the method to orthographic and phonetic representations of English words to discover the NCCs of English orthography.
  
  
    A translation model can be constructed automatically from texts that exist in
