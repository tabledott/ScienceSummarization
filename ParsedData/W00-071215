00) by using CELEX's (Baayen, et al., 1993) suffixes as a gold standard.
    CELEX is a hand-tagged, morphologicallyanalyzed database of English words.
    CELEX has limited coverage of the words from our data set (where our data consists of over eight million words from random subcollections of TREC data (Voorhees, et a1,1997/8)), so we only considered words with frequencies of 10 or more.
    Morphological relationships can be represented graphically as directed graphs (see Figure 3, where three separate graphs are depicted).
    Developing a scoring algorithm to compare directed graphs is likely to be prone to disagreements.
    Therefore, we score only the vertex sets of directed graphs.
    We will refer to these vertex sets as conflation sets.
    For example, concern's conflation set contains itself as well as &amp;quot;concerned,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;concerns,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;concerning&amp;quot; (or, in shorthand notation, the set is fa,b,c,d1).
    To evaluate an algorithm, we sum the number
