    The problem is to recover the omitted modifiers that depend on a bunsetsu in the post-conjunct except the EB.
    The key point is that Y and Y' in Figure 14b have a great similarity because they contain not only similar bunsetsus, KB and EB, but also very similar bunsetsus that originally governed the same modifier X.
    Therefore, we can detect the possibility of modifier ellipsis by checking the similarity score of the CS obtained when detecting its scope.
    When the extension operation is performed on the pre-conjunct of a CS that is a strong CS, we recover the omitted modifiers by interpreting a bunsetsu that depends on a bun
