    In JWS, the frequency-based pruning does not work well.
    Although we can reduce the size of Q by half, the accuracy is also reduced (97.94%&#8594;97.83%).
    It implies that, in JWS, features even with frequency of one contribute to the final decision hyperplane. classification; building Kx(K&#8722;1)/2 classifiers considering all pairs of classes, and final class decision was given by majority voting.
    The values in this column are averages over all pairwise classifiers.)
  
  
    There have been several studies for efficient classification of SVMs.
    Isozaki et al. propose an XQK (eXpand the Quadratic Kernel) which can make their Named-Entity recognizer drastically fast (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002).
    XQK can be subsumed into PKE.
    Both XQK and PKE share the basic idea; all feature combinations are explicitly expanded and we convert the kernel-based classifier into a simple linear classifier.
    The explicit difference between XQK and PKE is that XQK is designed only for Q
