atural to assume that a description is always expressed by a single noun phrase: if several sentences are needed, then so be it.
    After summarizing the Incremental Algorithm in Section 2, in Section 3 we take a closer look at the algorithm in its standard, &#8220;intersective&#8221; form, in which it identifies an object by intersecting a number of atomic properties.
    We discuss cases in which this algorithm fails to find an adequate description even though such a description exists, and we propose a number of possible remedies.
    Having extablished a completeness result for a version of the intersective Incremental Algorithm, we turn to questions of completeness that involve more complex Boolean combinations in Section 4.
    In Section 5, we summarize the main results of our exploration and put them in perspective.
  
  
    The Incremental Algorithm of Dale and Reiter (1995) singles out a target object from among some larger domain of entities.
    It does this by logically conjoining a number of p
