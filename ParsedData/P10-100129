-order parsing algorithms would be an interesting topic for future research.
    For example, Models 1 and 2 obtain results comparable to the semi-supervised parsers of Koo et al. (2008), and additive gains might be realized by applying their cluster-based feature sets to our enriched factorizations.
    In order to better understand the contributions of the various feature types, we ran additional ablation experiments; the results are listed in Table 3, in addition to the scores of Model 0 and the emulated Carreras (2007) parser (see Section 4.3).
    Interestingly, grandchild interactions appear to provide important information: for example, when Model 2 is used without grandchild-based features (&#8220;Model 2, no-G&#8221; in Table 3), its accuracy suffers noticeably.
    In addition, it seems that grandchild interactions are particularly useful in Czech, while sibling interactions are less important: consider that Model 0, a second-order grandchild parser with no sibling-based features, can easily outperf
