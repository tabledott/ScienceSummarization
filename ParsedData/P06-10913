ining algorithm presented in this paper is actually most similar to work on training algorithms presented for these task, e.g. the on-line training algorithm presented in (McDonald et al., 2005) and the perceptron training algorithm presented in (Collins, 2002).
    The current approach does not use specialized probability features as in (Och, 2003) in any stage during decoder parameter training.
    Such probability features include language model, translation or distortion probabilities, which are commonly used in current SMT approaches 1.
    We are able to achieve comparable performance to (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005).
    The novel algorithm differs computationally from earlier work in discriminative training algorithms for SMT (Och, 2003) as follows: No additional development data set is necessary as the weight vector is trained on bilingual training data only.
    The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the baseline block sequence model and the feature representation.
    Section 3 present
