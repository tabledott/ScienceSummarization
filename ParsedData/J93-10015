new text, a major improvement over earlier technologies that ignored lexical probabilities and other preferences that can be estimated statistically from corpus evidence.
    In Section 3, we discuss a number of frequency-based preferences such as collocations and word associations.
    Although often ignored in the computational linguistics literature because they are difficult to capture with traditional parsing technology, they can easily overwhelm syntactic factors (as any psycholinguist knows).
    Four articles in this special issue take a first step toward preference-based parsing, an empirical alternative to the rational tradition of principle-based parsing, ATNs, unification, etc.
    In Section 4, we discuss entropy and evaluation issues, which have become relatively important in recent years.
    In Section 5, we discuss the application of noisy channel models to bilingual applications such as machine translation and bilingual lexicography.
    In Section 6, we discuss the use of empirical methods
