he closed class words are not considered at this stage and the other Data structure maintained at stage one by Xtract. words, such as &amp;quot;shareholders,&amp;quot; are rejected because they are more than five words away from &amp;quot;takeover.&amp;quot; For each of the above word pairs, we maintain the associated data structure as indicated in Figure 5.
    For takeover pill, for example, we would increment freqpin, and the p4 column in the histogram.
    Table 2 shows the output for the adjective collocates of the word &amp;quot;takeover.&amp;quot; Input: Output of Step 1.2, i.e., a list of words w, with information on how often and how w and wz co-occur.
    See Table 2 for an example input.
    Output: Significant word pairs, along with some statistical information describing how strongly the words are connected and how rigidly they are used together.
    A separate (but similar) statistical analysis is done for each syntactic category of collocates.
    See Table 4 for an example output.
