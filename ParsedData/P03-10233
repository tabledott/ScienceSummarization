the competition criterion for the antecedent candidates.
    In such a model, a classifier is trained based on the instances formed by an anaphor and a pair of its antecedent candidates.
    The classifier is then used to determine the preference between any two candidates of an anaphor encountered in a new document.
    The candidate that wins the most comparisons is selected as the antecedent.
    In order to reduce the computational cost and data noises, our approach also employs a candidate filter to eliminate the invalid or irrelevant candidates.
    The layout of this paper is as follows.
    Section 2 briefly describes the single-candidate model and analyzes its limitation.
    Section 3 proposes in details the twin-candidate model and Section 4 presents our coreference resolution approach based on this model.
    Section 5 reports and discusses the experimental results.
    Section 6 describes related research work.
    Finally, conclusion is given in Section 7.
