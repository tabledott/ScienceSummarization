le the non integer solution is called rounding, which finds an integer point that is close to the non integer solution.
    Under some conditions of cost functions, which do not hold here, a well designed rounding algorithm can be shown that the rounded solution is a good approximation to the optimal solution (Kleinberg and Tardos, 1999; Chekuri et al., 2001).
    Nevertheless, in general, the outcomes of the rounding procedure may not even be a legal solution to the problem.
    Branch and bound is the method that divides an ILP problem into several LP subproblems.
    It uses LPR as a subroutine to generate dual (upper and lower) bounds to reduce the search space, and finds the optimal solution as well.
    When LPR finds a non integer solution, it splits the problem on the non integer variable.
    For example, suppose variable xi is fractional in an non integer solution to the ILP problem min{cx : x &#8712; S, x &#8712; {0,1}n}, where S is the linear constraints.
    The ILP problem can be split into two
