translations from automatically aligned corpora and uses them in conjunction with a word-for-word statistical translation system.
    However, none of these approaches learn simultaneously the translation of phrases/templates and the translation of words.
    As a consequence, there is a chance that the learning procedure will not discover phrase-level patterns that occur often in the data.
    In our approach, phrases are not treated differently from individual words, and as a consequence the likelihood of the EM algorithm converging to a better local maximum is increased.
    Working with phrase translations that are learned independent of a translation model can also affect the decoder performance.
    For example, in our previous work (Marcu, 2001), we have used a statistical translation memory of phrases in conjunction with a statistical translation model (Brown et al., 1993).
    The phrases in the translation memory were automatically extracted from the Viterbi alignments produced by Giza (Al-Onaizan e
