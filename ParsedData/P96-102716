e first and third edges in (17) to be added to the agenda.
    The first interacts with the active edge originally introduced by the verb &amp;quot;saw&amp;quot; producing the fourth entry in (17).
    The label on this edge matches the first item on the right-hand side of rule (12) and the active edge that we show in the second entry is also introduced.
    The final interaction is between the first and second edges in (17) which give rise to the edge in (18).
    This procedure confirms perfectly to the standard algorithm schema for chart parsing, especially in the version that makes predictions immediately following the recognition of the first constituent of a phrase, that is, in the version that is essentially a caching left-corner parser.
