    For example in the correct candidate answer for the question, &#8220;When was Microsoft established?&#8221;, Microsoft is referred to as Microsoft Corp. An axiom is built such that each noun of the complex nominal takes on the identifying argument of the complex nominal: all x1 x2 x3 ( microsoft nn(x1) &amp; corp nn(x2) &amp; nn nnc(x3,x1,x2) microsoft nn(x3) &amp; corp nn(x3)) Similar axioms are used for coordinated conjunctions detected in the answer and the question.
    These are considered weak axioms, and any proof that uses them will be penalized by being given a lower score than those that do not.
  
  
    A candidate answer for a question may use an apposition to describe the subject/object of the answer.
