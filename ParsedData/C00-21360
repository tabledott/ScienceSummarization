  This has generally involved the manual analysis and, in some cases, the anno- tation of large quantities of text involving these events.
  This paper presents an alternative ap- proach, based on an automatic discovery pro- cedure, ExDIsCO, which identifies a set; of rele- wmt documents and a set of event patterns from un-annotated text, starting from a small set of "seed patterns."
  We evaluate ExDIScO by com- paring the pertbrmance of discovered patte
