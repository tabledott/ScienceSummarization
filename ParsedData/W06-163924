experiments, we created finite-weight agreement links, so that speech segments appearing in pairs flagged by our (imperfect) agreement detector can potentially receive different labels.
    We also experimented with forcing such speech segments to receive the same label, either through infinite-weight agreement links or through a speech-segment concatenation strategy similar to that described in the previous subsection.
    Both strategies resulted in clear degradation in performance on both the development and test sets, a finding that validates our encoding of agreement information as &#8220;soft&#8221; preferences.
    We have seen several cases in which the method that performs best on the development set does not yield the best test-set performance.
    However, we felt that it would be illegitimate to change the train/development/test sets in a post hoc fashion, that is, after seeing the experimental results.
    Moreover, and crucially, it is very clear that using agreement information, encoded as pref
