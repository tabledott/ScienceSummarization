    We thank Felix Hageloh (Hageloh, 2006) for providing us with this version. proposed in (Tsarfaty, 2006).
    In our third model GTppp we also add the distinction between general PPs and possessive PPs following Goldberg and Elhadad (2007).
    In our forth model GTnph we add the definiteness status of constituents following Tsarfaty and Sima&#8217;an (2007).
    Finally, model GTv = 2 includes parent annotation on top of the various state-splits, as is done also in (Tsarfaty and Sima&#8217;an, 2007; Cohen and Smith, 2007).
    For all grammars, we use fine-grained PoS tags indicating various morphological features annotated therein.
    Evaluation We use 8 different measures to evaluate the performance of our system on the joint disambiguation task.
    To evaluate the performance on the segmentation task, we report SEG, the standard harmonic means for segmentation Precision and Recall F1 (as defined in Bar-Haim et al. (2005); Tsarfaty (2006)) as well as the segmentation accuracy SEGTok measu
