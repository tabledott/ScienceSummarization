erformance across the MUC and ACE data sets.
    In the next section, we take a closer look at the coreference resolution task, analyzing the impact of various subtasks irrespective of the data set differences.
  
  
    Coreference resolution is a complex task that requires solving numerous non-trivial subtasks such as syntactic analysis, semantic class tagging, pleonastic pronoun identification and antecedent identification to name a few.
    This section examines the role of three such subtasks &#8212; named entity recognition, anaphoricity determination, and coreference element detection &#8212; in the performance of an end-to-end coreference resolution system.
    First, however, we describe the coreference resolver that we use for our study.
    We use the RECONCILE coreference resolution platform (Stoyanov et al., 2009) to configure a coreference resolver that performs comparably to state-of-the-art systems (when evaluated on the MUC and ACE data sets under comparable assumptions).
    This system is a
