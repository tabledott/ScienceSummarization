 constructing Q.
    It then considers edges from the node i to the node j.
    Now, assume that there is only a single edge from i to j and that that edge has a weight of 1.
    Furthermore assume that this edge is the only edge directed into the node j.
    In this case Q should be modified so that Qjj = 1, Qij = &#8722;1, and Qi0j = 0, Vi' =&#65533; i, j (by the Matrix Tree Theorem).
    The value of Zx under this new Q will be equivalent to the weight of all trees containing the single edge from i to j with a weight of 1.
    For a specific edge (i, j)k its expectation is simply wk ijZx, since we can factor out the weight 1 edge from i to j in all the trees that contribute to Zx and multiply through the actual weight for the edge.
    The algorithm then reconstructs Q and continues.
    Following the work of Koo et al. (2007) and Smith and Smith (2007), it is possible to compute all expectations in O(n3 + |L|n2) through matrix inversion.
