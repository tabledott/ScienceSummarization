de a clause in the clause conjunction, relative clauses, and some elements within a clause (such as adverbs and prepositions).
    For example, this procedure transforms the lattice in Figure 6 into the pruned basis lattice shown in Figure 7 by deleting the clause the clash erupted and the verb phrase to better protect Israeli forces.
    These phrases are eliminated because they do not appear in the other sentences of the theme and at the same time their removal does not interfere with the well-formedness of the fusion sentence.
    Once these subtrees are removed, the fusion lattice construction is completed.
    The final stage in sentence fusion is linearization of the fusion lattice.
    Sentence generation includes selection of a tree traversal order, lexical choice among available alternatives, and placement of auxiliaries, such as determiners.
    Our generation method utilizes information given in the input sentences to restrict the search space and then chooses among remaining alternatives using a l
