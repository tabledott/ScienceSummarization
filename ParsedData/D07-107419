 We then extract all the entity references in the entity page.
  For example, from the article on Texas (band), for which a snippet in Wikitext is shown below, we extract as contexts the references pop music, Glasgow, Scotland, and so on: Texas is a [[pop music]] band from [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], [[United Kingdom]].
  They were founded by [[Johnny McElhone]] in [[1986 in music|1986]] and had their performing debut in [[March]] [[1988]] at [?]
  Reciprocally, we also extract from the same ar- ticle that the entity Texas (band) is a good context for pop music, Glasgow, Scotland, etc.
  The number of contexts extracted in this manner is overwhelming and had to be reduced to a man- ageable size.
  In our development experiments, we explored various ways of reducing the context in- formation, for example, by extracting only entities with a certain number of mentions in an article, or by discarding mentions with low TF*IDF scores (Salton, 1989).
  In the end, we chose a strategy in which we employ as contexts fo
