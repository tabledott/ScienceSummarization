		A particu- larly convenient implementation f discourse referents is to represent them as objects in the Common Lisp Object System, with slots which encode the following information parameters (where ADJUNCT and EMBED indicate whether a discourse referent was observed in either of the two syntactic ontexts discussed above): TEXT: text form TYPE: referential type (e.g., REF, PRO, RFLX) AGR: person, number, gender GFUN: grammatical function ADJUNCT: T o r NIL EMBED: T o r NIL POS: text position Note that each discourse referent contains information about itself and the context in which it appears, but the only information about its relation to other dis- course referents is in the form of precedence r lations (as determined by text position).
			The absence of explicit information about configurational relations marks the crucial difference between our algorithm and the Lap- pin/Leass algorithm.
			(Lappin and Leass, 1994) use configurational information in two ways: as a factor in the determination of the sal
