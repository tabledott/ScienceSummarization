om selection.
    A more informative figure is the success rate of a naive method that always selects the most frequent sense (the Word Frequencies method in our evaluations).
    The success rate of this naive method is higher than that of random selection and thus provides a tighter lower bound for the desired precision of a proposed disambiguation method.
    An important practical issue in evaluation is how to get the test examples, which should be tagged with the correct sense.
    In most papers (including ours) the tagging of the test data was done by hand, which limits the size of the testing set.
    Preparing one test set by hand may still be reasonable, though time consuming.
    However, it is useful to have more than one set, such that results will be reported on a new, unseen, set, while another set is used for developing and tuning the system.
    One useful source of tagged examples is an aligned bilingual corpus, which can be used for testing any sense disambiguation method, including methods
