n in training, but they are difficult to represent in generative models.
    The sequential classification approach can handle many correlated features, as demonstrated in work on maximum-entropy (McCallum et al., 2000; Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and a variety of other linear classifiers, including winnow (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001), AdaBoost (Abney et al., 1999), and support-vector machines (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).
    Furthermore, they are trained to minimize some function related to labeling error, leading to smaller error in practice if enough training data are available.
    In contrast, generative models are trained to maximize the joint probability of the training data, which is 'Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) used transformation-based learning (Brill, 1995), which for the present purposes can be tought of as a classification-based method. not as closely tied to the accuracy metrics of interest if the actual data was not generated by the model, as is always the case in practice.
    However, since sequential cla
