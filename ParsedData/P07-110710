ters, we now have an infinite Q.
    However, most draws will have weights which decay exponentially quickly in the prior (though not necessarily in the posterior).
    Therefore, there is a natural penalty for each cluster which is actually used.
    With Z observed during sampling, we can integrate out Q and calculate P(Zi,j|Z&#8722;i,j) analytically, using the Chinese restaurant process representation: where znew is a new entity index not used in Z&#8722;i,j and nz is the number of mentions that have entity index z.
    Aside from this change, sampling is identical to the finite mixture case, though with the number of clusters actually occupied in each sample drifting upwards or downwards.
    This model yielded a 54.5 Fi on our development data.6 This model is, however, hopelessly crude, capturing nothing of the structure of coreference.
    Its largest empirical problem is that, unsurprisingly, pronoun mentions such as he are given their own clusters, not labeled as coreferent with any non-pronominal men
