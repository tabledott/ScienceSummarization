ustness and efficiency, on the other.
			Thus, whereas a complete dependency structure provides a fully disambiguated analysisof a sentence, this analysis is typically less complex than in frameworks based on constituent analysis and can therefore often be computed determin istically with reasonable accuracy.
			Deterministicmethods for dependency parsing have now been ap plied to a variety of languages, including Japanese (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000), English (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003), Turkish (Oflazer, 2003), and Swedish (Nivre et al, 2004).
			For English, the interest in dependency parsing has been weaker than for other languages.
			To some extent, this can probably be explained by the strong tradition of constituent analysis in Anglo-American linguistics, but this trend has been reinforced by the fact that the major treebank of American English,the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993), is anno tated primarily with constituent analysis.
			On the other hand, the best available parsers trained on thePenn T
