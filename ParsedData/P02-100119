or for one path is hard enough, but it is the E step&#8217;s job to find the expected value of this vector&#8212;an average over the infinitely log-linear model of P(v  |u) for u E E'*, v E 0'*.
    Then the predicted count vector contributed by h is Ei EuE&#931;,&#8727; P(u xi, yi) &#183; ech(u, 0'*).
    The term Ei P(u  |xi, yi) computes the expected count of each u E E'*.
    It may be found by a variant of &#167;4 in which path values are regular expressions over E'*. many paths &#960; through Fig.
    2 in proportion to their posterior probabilities P(&#960;  |xi, yi).
    The results for all (xi, yi) are summed and passed to the M step.
    Abstractly, let us say that each path &#960; has not only a probability P(&#960;) E [0, 1] but also a value val(&#960;) in a vector space V , which counts the arcs, features, or coin flips encountered along path &#960;.
    The value of a path is the sum of the values assigned to its arcs.
    The E step must return the expected value of the unknown path that genera
