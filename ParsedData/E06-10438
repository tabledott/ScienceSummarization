 syntactically) similar word generally does not result in another VNIC, but in an invalid or a literal expression.
    One way of measuring lexical fixedness of a given verb+noun combination is thus to examine the idiomaticity of its variants, i.e., expressions generated by replacing one of the constituents by a similar word.
    This approach has two main challenges: (i) it requires prior knowledge about the idiomaticity of expressions (which is what we are developing our measure to determine); (ii) it needs information on &#8220;similarity&#8221; among words.
    Inspired by Lin (1999), we examine the strength of association between the verb and noun constituents of the target combination and its variants, as an indirect cue to their idiomaticity.
    We use the automatically-built thesaurus of Lin (1998) to find similar words to the noun of the target expression, in order to automatically generate variants.
    Only the noun constituent is varied, since replacing the verb constituent of a VNIC with a seman
