    Meta-Bootstrapping (Riloff and Jones, 1999) and Basilisk (Thelen and Riloff, 2002) are bootstrapping algorithms that use automatically generated extraction patterns to identify words belonging to a semantic category.
    We hypothesized that extraction patterns could also identify subjective words.
    For example, the pattern &#8220;expressed &lt;direct object&gt;&#8221; often extracts subjective nouns, such as &#8220;concern&#8221;, &#8220;hope&#8221;, and &#8220;support&#8221;.
    Furthermore, these bootstrapping algorithms require only a handful of seed words and unannotated texts for training; no annotated data is needed at all.
    In this paper, we use the Meta-Bootstrapping and Basilisk algorithms to learn lists of subjective nouns from a large collection of unannotated texts.
    Then we train a subjectivity classifier on a small set of annotated data, using the subjective nouns as features along with some other previously identified subjectivity features.
