mall set of seed words of known sentiment value (positive or negative).
			This list is augmented during thefirst pass by adding synonyms, antonyms and hy ponyms of the seed words supplied in WordNet.
			This step brings on average a 5-fold increase in the size of the original list with the accuracy of the resulting list comparable to manual annotations (78%, similar to HM vs. GI-H4 accuracy).
			At the second pass, the system goes through all WordNet glosses and identifies the entries that contain in their definitions the sentiment-bearing words from the extended seed list and adds these head words (or rather, lexemes) to the corresponding category ? positive, negative or neutral (the remainder).
