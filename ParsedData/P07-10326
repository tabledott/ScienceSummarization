    The major weakness of these evaluations is that there is no measure of the difficultly of the conversion process for each of the parsers.
    Kaplan et al. (2004) clearly invested considerable time and expertise in mapping the output of the Collins parser into the DepBank dependencies, but they also note that &#8220;This conversion was relatively straightforward for LFG structures ...
    However, a certain amount of skill and intuition was required to provide a fair conversion of the Collins trees&#8221;.
    Without some measure of the difficulty &#8212; and effectiveness &#8212; of the conversion, there remains a suspicion that the Collins parser is being unfairly penalised.
    One way of providing such a measure is to convert the original gold standard on which the parser is based and evaluate that against the new gold standard (assuming the two resources are based on the same corpus).
    In the case of Kaplan et al. (2004), the testing procedure would include running their
