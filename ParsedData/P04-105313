erns for parallel expressions and expressions peculiar to The New York Times as ignorable context.
    We set the maximum context word length to 5 words and set the frequency threshold of co-occurring NE pairs to 30 empirically.
    We also used the patterns, &#8220;,.
    *,&#8221;, &#8220;and&#8221; and &#8220;or&#8221; for parallel expressions, and the pattern &#8220;) --&#8221; (used in datelines at the beginning of articles) as peculiar to The New York Times.
    In our experiment, the norm threshold was set to 10.
    We also used stop words when context vectors are made.
    The stop words include symbols and words which occurred under 3 times as infrequent words and those which occurred over 100,000 times as highly frequent words.
    We applied our proposed method to The New York Times 1995, identified the NE pairs satisfying our criteria, and extracted the NE pairs along with their intervening words as our data set.
    In order to evaluate the relations detected automatically, we analyzed the data
