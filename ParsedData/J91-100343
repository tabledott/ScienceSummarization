eart.&amp;quot; Anomalous relations have neither the semantic relationships of a metonymic relation nor the relevant analogy of a metaphorical relation.
    Hence the semantic relation between 'idea' and 'drink' is anomalous in (21) because 'idea' is not a preferred agent of 'drink' and no metonymic link or relevant analogy can be found between animals (the preferred agent) and ideas; that is, 'idea' in (21) does not use up a liquid like 'car' does in (20).
    This is not to say that an anomalous relation is uninterpretable or that no analogy can possibly be found in one.
    In special circumstances (for example, in a poem), search for analogies might be expanded to permit weaker analogies, thereby allowing &amp;quot;ideas drinking&amp;quot; to be interpreted metaphorically.
    The topology of the flow chart in Figure 1 results from needing to satisfy a number of observations about the preference-based phenomena, particularly metonymy: Hence a preference-based semantic relation can be either a single relat
