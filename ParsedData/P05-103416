 t' from the candidate translation list5 of each child s'.
    Each such interleaving is scored using the models previously described and added to the candidate translation list for that input node.
    The resultant translation is the best scoring candidate for the root input node.
    As an example, see the example dependency tree in Figure 4a and treelet translation pair in 4b.
    This treelet translation pair covers all the nodes in 4a except the subtrees rooted at software and is.
    We first compute (and cache) the candidate translation lists for the subtrees rooted at software and is, then construct full translation candidates by attaching those subtree translations to install&#233;s in all possible ways.
    The order of sur relative to install&#233;s is fixed; it remains to place the translated subtrees for the software and is.
    Note that if c is the count of children specified in the mapping and r is the count of subtrees translated via recursive calls, then there are (c+r+1)!/(c+1)! orderings.
