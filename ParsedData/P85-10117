  F.~xample 2.3: Let G ,m (I,A) where $ I @ #t = #= = S T I   I m T a S II II I I   I I b S c b T c 8,3 The precise definition of L(G) is as follows: L(G) =- L t =.
  ca / n &gt; o, w is a string of as and bs such that (1) the number o( us I=, the number o( bs - -  n, and (2) for any initial subetriag of w, the number of as &gt; the number o( bs. }
  L I is a strictly context-sensitive language (i.e., s context,, sensitive language that i, not context-free).
  This can be shown as follows.
  Intersecting L with the regular language a* b* ?

  The result of intersecting a context-free language with a regular language is always a context-free language; hence, L t is not a context-free
