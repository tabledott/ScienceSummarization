    Going through the results for individual languages, it is clear that the arc-standard algorithm has a higher variance than the other algorithms.
    For Bulgarian, Dutch, and Spanish, the accuracy is considerably lower than for the other algorithms, in most cases by more than one percentage point.
    But for Arabic, Czech, and Slovene, we find exactly the opposite pattern, with the arc-standard parsers sometimes outperforming the other parsers by more than two percentage points.
    For the remaining languages, the arc-standard algorithm performs on a par with the other algorithms.13 In order to explain this pattern we need to consider the way in which properties of the algorithms interact with properties of different languages and the way they have been annotated syntactically.
    First of all, it is important to note that the two list-based algorithms and the arceager variant of the stack-based algorithm are all arc-eager in the sense that an arc (i,l, j) is always added at the earliest po
