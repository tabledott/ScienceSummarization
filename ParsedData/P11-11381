    Recently, Wikification has been shown to form a valuable component for numerous natural language processing tasks including text classification (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007b; Chang et al., 2008), measuring semantic similarity between texts (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007a), crossdocument co-reference resolution (Finin et al., 2009; Mayfield et al., 2009), and other tasks (Kulkarni et al., 2009).
    Previous studies on Wikification differ with respect to the corpora they address and the subset of expressions they attempt to link.
    For example, some studies focus on linking only named entities, whereas others attempt to link all &#8220;interesting&#8221; expressions, mimicking the link structure found in Wikipedia.
    Regardless, all Wikification systems are faced with a key Disambiguation to Wikipedia (D2W) task.
    In the D2W task, we&#8217;re given a text along with explicitly identified substrings (called mentions) to disambiguate, and the goal is to output
