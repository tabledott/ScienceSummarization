    Both in traditional grammar and modern syntactic theory, a distinction is made between arguments and adjuncts.
    In sentence (2), John is an argument and in the bathroom is an adjunct: (2) Mary berated John in the bathroom.
    Arguments fill semantic slots licensed by a particular verb, while adjuncts provide information about sentential slots (such as time or place) that can be filled for any verb (of the appropriate aspectual type).
    While much work has been done on the argument/adjunct distinction (see the survey of distinctions in Pollard and Sag (1987, pp.
    134-139)), and much other work presupposes this distinction, in practice, it gets murky (like many things in linguistics).
    I will adhere to a conventional notion of the distinction, but a tension arises in the work presented here when judgments of argument/adjunct status reflect something other than frequency of cooccurrence &#8212; since it is actually cooccurrence data that a simple learning program like mine uses.
