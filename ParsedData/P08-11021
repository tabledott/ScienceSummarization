Entropy Model (ME) (Ratnaparkhi and Adwait, 1996), and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001).
    CRFs have the advantage of flexibility in representing features compared to generative ones such as HMM, and usually behaves the best in the two tasks.
    Another widely used discriminative method is the perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002), which achieves comparable performance to CRFs with much faster training, so we base this work on the perceptron.
    To segment and tag a character sequence, there are two strategies to choose: performing POS tagging following segmentation; or joint segmentation and POS tagging (Joint S&amp;T).
    Since the typical approach of discriminative models treats segmentation as a labelling problem by assigning each character a boundary tag (Xue and Shen, 2003), Joint S&amp;T can be conducted in a labelling fashion by expanding boundary tags to include POS information (Ng and Low, 2004).
    Compared to performing segmentation and POS tagging one at a time, Joint
