lternatives maybe possible, cf.
    Engl. hope + d vs. hop + ed, (past tense of to hope).
    Instead, we utilized an existing tool for providing a morphological analysis, although not a segmentation, of words, based on the two-level morphology of Koskenniemi (1983).
    The analyzer is a finite-state transducer that reads a word form as input and outputs the base form of the word together with grammatical tags.
    Sample analyses are shown in Figure 3.
    The tag set consists of tags corresponding to morphological affixes and other tags, for example, part-of-speech tags.
    We preprocessed the analyses by removing other tags than those corresponding to affixes, and further split compound base forms (marked using the # character by the analyzer) into their constituents.
    As a result, we obtained for each word a sequence of labels that corresponds well to a linguistic morphemic analysis of the word.
    A label can often be considered to correspond to a single word segment, and the labels appear in the o
