alue of P(E), the lower the value of r..
    Example 3 and Example 4 in Figure 3 show two coders agreeing on 90 out of 100 occurrences of Okay, that is, P(A) = 0.9.
    However, r. ranges from &#8722;0.048 to 0.80, and from not significant to significant (the values of r.S&amp;C for Examples 3 and 4 are the same as the values of r.Co).3 The differences in r. are due to the difference in the relative prevalence of the two categories Accept and Ack.
    In Example 3, the distribution is skewed, as there are 190 Accepts but only 10 Acks across the two coders; in Example 4, the distribution is even, as there are 100 Accepts and 100 Acks, respectively.
    These results do not depend on the size of the sample; that is, they are not due to the fact Contingency tables illustrating the bias effect on &#954;Co.
    Example 3 and Example 4 are small.
    As the computations of P(A) and P(E) are based on proportions, the same distributions of categories in a much larger sample, say, 10,000 items, will result in exactly
