364;:#] at the beginning of the four-level cascade and compose its inverse at the end.
    As we mentioned before, the two-level grammars with boundary-context rules are the ones that Ritchie (1992) showed were complete for the regular relations.
    In reasoning about these systems, it is important to keep clearly in mind the distinction between the outer and inner relations.
    Ritchie (1992), for example, also proved that the &amp;quot;languages&amp;quot; generated by two-level grammars with regular contexts are closed under intersection, but this result does not hold if a grammar's language is taken to be its outer relation.
    Suppose that G1 has the set {a :b, 0 :c} as its feasible pairs and the vacuous a:b = as its only rule, and that G2 has the pairs {a :c, 0:b} and rule a:c = .
    The domain of both outer (0-free) relations is a*.
    A string a&amp;quot; is mapped by G1 into strings containing n b's with c's freely intermixed and by G2 into strings containing n c's with b's freely intermixed.
