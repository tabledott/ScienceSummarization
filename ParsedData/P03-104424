 show that counter-training is an effective way to combat the otherwise unlimited expansion in unsupervised search.
    Counter-training is applicable in settings where a set of data points has to be categorized as belonging to one or more target categories.
    The main features of counter-training are: Training several simple learners in parallel; Competition among learners; Convergence of the overall learning process; Termination with good recall-precision tradeoff, compared to the single-trained learner.
