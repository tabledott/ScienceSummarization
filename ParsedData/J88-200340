    It is not clear where along this nucleus the culmination of the sun set could be situated: it is not easy to imagine that it is a functional part of the preparatory process typically associated with a breakdown, and it is similarly hard to imagine that it can be a part of the consequent state, so under most imaginable circumstances, the utterance remains bizarre.
