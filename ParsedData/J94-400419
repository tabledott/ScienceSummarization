These routines are defined formally here: Definition 5 The ~?T4 systematically relates syntactic positions from Definition 1 and lexical- semantic positions from Definition 4 as follows: 1.
  Qm Example 5 The correspondence b tween the LCS of Example 1 and the syntactic structure of Example 4 (i.e., for the sentence John went happily to school) is (1) X ~ = GOLoc 4=~ X = Iv went]; (2) W = JOHN 4=~ W = [N-MAX John]; (3) Z = TOcoc 4~ Z = [pp to .
  ]; and (4) Q = HAPPILY ~ Q ~--~[ADV happily].
  Definition 6 The CST4 systematically relates a lexical-semantic type T(~) to a syntactic ategory CAT(h), where ~t is a CLCS constituent related to the syntactic onstituent ?&gt; by the ~?~.
  Example 6 The LCS type Thing corresponds to the syntactic ategory N, which is ultimately projected up to a maximal level (i.e., N-MAX).
  The full range of realization possibilities is given in Figure 7.
