    Consistent with Imamura [2002], we define a syntactic phrase as a word sequence that is covered by a single subtree in a syntactic parse tree.
    We collect syntactic phrase pairs as follows: We wordalign a parallel corpus, as described in Section 3.1.
    We then parse both sides of the corpus with syntactic parsers [Collins, 1997; Schmidt and Schulte im Walde, 2000].
    For all phrase pairs that are consistent with the word alignment, we additionally check if both phrases are subtrees in the parse trees.
    Only these phrases are included in the model.
    Hence, the syntactically motivated phrase pairs learned are a subset of the phrase pairs learned without knowledge of syntax (Section 3.1).
    As in Section 3.1, the phrase translation probability distribution is estimated by relative frequency.
    Marcu and Wong [2002] proposed a translation model that assumes that lexical correspondences can be established not only at the word level, but at the phrase level as well.
    To learn such co
