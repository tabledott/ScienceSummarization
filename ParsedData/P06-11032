, and use them to develop an algorithm that extracts pairs of NEs across languages.
    Specifically, given a bilingual corpora that is weakly temporally aligned, and a capability to annotate the text in one of the languages with NEs, our algorithm identifies the corresponding NEs in the second language text, and annotates them with the appropriate type, as in the source text.
    The first observation is that NEs in one language in such corpora tend to co-occur with their counterparts in the other.
    E.g., Figure 1 shows a histogram of the number of occurrences of the word Hussein and its Russian transliteration in our bilingual news corpus spanning years 2001 through late 2005.
    One can see several common peaks in the two histograms, largest one being around the time of the beginning of the war in Iraq.
    The word Russia, on the other hand, has a distinctly different temporal signature.
    We can exploit such weak synchronicity of NEs across languages to associate them.
