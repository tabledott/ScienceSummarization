rd sequence and a dictionary of legal tags for each word type.
    The goal is to tag each word token so as to maximize accuracy against a gold tag sequence.
    Whether this is a realistic problem set-up is arguable, but an interesting collection of methods and results has accumulated around it, and these can be clearly compared with one another.
    We use the standard test set for this task, a 24,115-word subset of the Penn Treebank, for which a gold tag sequence is available.
    There are 5,878 word types in this test set.
    We use the standard tag dictionary, consisting of 57,388 word/tag pairs derived from the entire Penn Treebank.1 8,910 dictionary entries are relevant to the 5,878 word types in the test set.
    Per-token ambiguity is about 1.5 tags/token, yielding approximately 106425 possible ways to tag the data.
    There are 45 distinct grammatical tags.
    In this set-up, there are no unknown words.
    Figure 1 shows prior results for this problem.
    While the methods are quite different,
