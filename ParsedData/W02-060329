 which favors the Recursive MDL method.
    The final number of morphs in the codebook (#morphs in codebook) is a measure of the size of the morph &#8220;vocabulary&#8221;.
    The relative codebook cost gives the share of the total MDL cost that goes into coding the codebook.
    The alignment distance is the total distance computed over the sequence of morph/morphemic label pairs in the test data.
    The unseen aligned pairs is the percentage of all aligned morph/label pairs in the test set that were never observed in the training set.
    This gives an indication of the generalization capacity of the method to new word forms. not allow representation of contextual dependencies, i.e., that some morphs appear only in particular contexts (allomorphy).
    Moreover, languages have rules regarding the ordering of stems and affixes (morphotax).
    However, the current model has no way of representing such contextual dependencies.
