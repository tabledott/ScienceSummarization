inition, do not fit; consequently their treatment has implications for the treatment of the normal flow of discourse.
    Interruptions may take many forms &#8212; some are not at all relevant to the content and flow of the interrupted discourse, others are quite relevant, and many fall somewhere in between these extremes.
    A theory must differentiate these cases and explain (among other things) what connections exist between the main discourse and the interruption, and how the relationship between them affects the processing of the utterances in both.
    The importance of distinguishing between intentional structure and attentional state is evident in the three examples considered in Subsections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.
    The distinction also permits us to explain a type of behavior deemed by others to be similar &#8212; so-called semantic returns &#8212; an issue we examine in Subsection 5.5.
    These examples do not exhaust the types of interruptions that can occur in discourse.
    There are other ways t
