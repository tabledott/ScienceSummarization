estigated the correlation of our intention-based discourse segmentations with referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses.
    We developed segmentation algorithms based on the use of each of these linguistic cues, and quantitatively evaluated their performance in identifying the statistically validated boundaries independently produced by our subjects.
    We found that compared to human performance, the recall of the three algorithms was comparable, the precision was much lower, and the fallout and error of only the noun phrase algorithm was comparable.
    We also found a tendency for recall to increase and precision to decrease with exact boundary strength, suggesting that the cognitive salience of boundaries is graded.
    While our initial results are promising, there is certainly room for improvement.
    In future work on our data, we will attempt to maximize the correlation of our segmentations with linguistic cues by improving the performance of our individual algorithms, and by investigating wa
