    The tools we are using in this project include the LKB system (Copestake 2002) for grammar development, [incr tsdb()] (Oepen &amp; Carroll 2000) for testing the grammar and tracking changes, and PET (Callmeier 2000), a very efficient HPSG parser, for processing.
    We also use the ChaSen tokenizer and POS tagger (Asahara &amp; Matsumoto 2000).
    While couched within the same general framework (BPSG), our approach differs from that of Kanayama et al (2000).
    The work described there achieves impressive coverage (83.7% on the EDR corpus of newspaper text) with an underspecified grammar consisting of a small number of lexical entries, lexical types associated with parts of speech, and six underspecified grammar rules.
    In contrast, our grammar is much larger in terms of the number of lexical entries, the number of grammar rules, and the constraints on both,1 and takes correspondingly more effort to bring up to that level of coverage.
