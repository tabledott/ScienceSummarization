   (In our case, the number of nodes in the input DSyntS is equal to the number of words in the output string.)
    The row labeled &amp;quot;Sec&amp;quot; represents average execution time (over several test runs) for the sentence of the given input length, in seconds, on a PC with a 150MHz Pentium processor and 32 Megs of RAM.
    Length 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 Sec .11 .17 .20 .28 .44 .58 .72 We also tested the system on the syntactically rather varied and complex input of Figure 2 (which is made up of 20 words).
    The average runtime for this input is 0.31 seconds, which is comparable to the runtime reported above for the 20 word sentence.
    We conclude that the uniformity of the syntactic constructions found in the sentences used in the above test sequence does not influence the results.
    The complexity of the generation algorithm derives primarily from the tree traversals which must be performed twice, when passing from DSyntS to SSyntS, and from SSyntS to the DMorphS.
