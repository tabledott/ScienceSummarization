 with exact parsing algorithms, which can be attained in the projective setting.
    Results are shown in Table 1.
    We can see that there is clearly an advantage in introducing second-order features.
    In particular, the complete tree metric is improved considerably.
    For the Czech data, we used the predefined training, development and testing split of the Prague Dependency Treebank (Haji&#711;c et al., 2001), and the automatically generated POS tags supplied with the data, which we reduce to the POS tag set from Collins et al. (1999).
    On average, 23% of the sentences in the training, development and test sets have at least one non-projective dependency, though, less than 2% of total edges are actually non-projective.
    Results are shown in Table 2.
    McDonald et al. (2005c) showed a substantial improvement in accuracy by modeling nonprojective edges in Czech, shown by the difference between two first-order models.
    Table 2 shows that a second-order model provides a comparable accuracy boos
