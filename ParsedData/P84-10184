straightforwardly reduce the number of interpreters to two, one for analysis and one for synthesis.
    Furthermore, the explanatory value of a theory clearly rests on a great deal more than the restriciveness of its formal base.
    In particular, the possiblity of encompassing what had hitherto been thought to require altogether different kinds of treatment within a single framework could be theoretically interesting.
    Another clear improvement on the classical design would 'result from merging &#8226;the two interpreters associated with a formalism.
    The most obvious advantage to be hoped for with this move would be that the overall structure of the translating machine would be greatly simplified, though this would not necessarily happen.
    It is also reasonable to hope that the machine would be more robust, easier to modify and maintain, and altogether more perspicuous.
    This is because a device to which analysis and synthesis look essentially the same is one that is fundamentally less time dep
