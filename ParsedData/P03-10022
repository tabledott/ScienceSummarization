ch literature covers methods of automatically acquiring IE patterns.
    Some of the most recent methods were reported in (Riloff, 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000).
    To process texts efficiently and fast, domain patterns are ideally implemented as finite state automata (FSAs), a methodology pioneered in the FASTUS IE system (Hobbs et al., 1997).
    Although this paradigm is simple and elegant, it has the disadvantage that it is not easily portable from one domain of interest to the next.
    In contrast, a new, truly domain-independent IE paradigm may be designed if we know (a) predicates relevant to a domain; and (b) which of their arguments fill templette slots.
    Central to this new way of extracting information from texts are systems that label predicate-argument structures on the output of full parsers.
    One such augmented parser, trained on data available from the PropBank project has been recently presented in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002).
    In this paper we describe a domain-independent IE paradi
