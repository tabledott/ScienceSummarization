 and the reference corpus string.
    Simple accuracy is the number of insertion (I), deletion (D) and substitutions (S) errors between the reference strings in the test corpus and the strings produced by the generation model.
    An alignment algorithm using substitution, insertion and deletion of tokens as operations attempts to match the generated string with the reference string.
    Each of these operations is assigned a cost value such that a substitution operation is cheaper than the combined cost of a deletion and an insertion operation.
    The alignment algorithm attempts to find the set of operations that minimizes the cost of aligning the generated string to the reference string.
    The metric is summarized in Equation (1).
    R. is the number of tokens in the target string.
    Consider the following example.
    The target sentence is on top, the generated sentence below.
    The third line represents the operation needed to. transform one sentence into another; a period is used to indicate th
