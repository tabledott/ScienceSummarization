y, there is nothing inherent in our formulation that disallows their combination.
    The proposal is not merely notational.
    One potential drawback of multiplicative models is the effect of components with value zero.
    Since the product of zero with any number is itself zero, the presence of zeroes in either of the vectors leads to information being essentially thrown away.
    Combining the multiplicative model with an additive model, which does not suffer from this problem, could mitigate this problem: pi = &#945;ui +&#946;vi +&#947;uivi (11) where &#945;, &#946;, and &#947; are weighting constants.
  
  
    We evaluated the models presented in Section 3 on a sentence similarity task initially proposed by Kintsch (2001).
    In his study, Kintsch builds a model of how a verb&#8217;s meaning is modified in the context of its subject.
    He argues that the subjects of ran in The color ran and The horse ran select different senses of ran.
    This change in the verb&#8217;s sense is equated to a shift
