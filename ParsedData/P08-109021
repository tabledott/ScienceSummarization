ity rules to the hand labeled data.
    The following is an example of the applied transitive rule: if run BEFORE fall and fall BEFORE injured then run BEFORE injured This increases the number of relations from 37519 to 45619.
    Perhaps more importantly for our task, of all the added relations, the before relation is added the most.
    We experimented with original vs. expanded Timebank and found the expanded performed slightly worse.
    The decline may be due to poor transitivity additions, as several Timebank documents contain inconsistent labelings.
    All reported results are from training without transitivity.
    We classify the Gigaword Corpus in two stages, once for the temporal features on each event (tense, grammatical aspect, aspectual class), and once between all pairs of events that share arguments.
    This allows us to classify the before/other relations between all potential narrative events.
    The first stage is trained on Timebank, and the second is trained using the approach describe
