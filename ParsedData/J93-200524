g techniques for building sublanguage lexicons via syntactic and statistical corpus analysis coupled with analytic techniques based on the tenets of generative lexicon theory.
    To understand fully the experiments described in the next two sections, we will refer to several semantic notions introduced in previous sections.
    These include type coercion, where a lexical item requires a specific type specification for its argument, and 11 As one reviewer correctly pointed out, more than simple argument binding is involved here.
    For example, the model must know that paper can enclose shredded tobacco, but not the reverse.
    Such information, typically part of commonsense knowledge, is well outside the domain of lexical semantics, as envisioned here.
    One approach to this problem, consistent with our methodology, is to examine the corpus and the collocations that result from training on specific qualia relations.
    Further work will hopefully clarify the nature of this problem, and whether it is be
