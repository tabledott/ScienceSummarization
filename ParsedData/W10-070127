			The result is a data set that isstill effective for comparing MT systems in an eval uation.
			Ambati and Vogel create corpora with 100 sentences and 3 translations per sentence for all the language pairs between English, Spanish, Urdu and Telugu.
			This demonstrates the feasibility of creating cheap corpora for high and low resource languages.Two papers focused on the creation and evaluation of paraphrases.
			Denkowski et al (2010) generated and evaluated 728 paraphrases for Arabic English translation.
			MTurk was used to identify correct and fix incorrect paraphrases.
			Over 1200 high quality paraphrases were created.
			Buzek et al.
			(2010) evaluated error driven paraphrases forMT.
			In this setting, paraphrases are used to sim plify potentially difficult to translate segments of text.
			Turkers identified 1780 error regions in 1006 English/Chinese sentences.
			Turkers provided 4821 paraphrases for these regions.
			External resources can be an important part of an MT system.
