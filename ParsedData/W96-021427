xamining Bod's data, we find he removed &#8364; productions.
    We also assume that Bod made the same choice we did and eliminated unary productions, given the difficulty of correctly parsing them.
    Bod himself does not know which technique he used for n-ary productions, since the chart parser he used was written by a third party (Bod, personal communication).
    The n-ary productions can be parsed in a straightforward manner, by converting them to binary branching form; however, there are at least three different ways to convert them, as illustrated in Table 3.
    In method &amp;quot;Correct&amp;quot;, the nary branching productions are converted in such a way that no overgeneration is introduced.
    A set of special non-terminals is added, one for each partial right hand side.
    In method &amp;quot;Continued&amp;quot;, a single new non-terminal is introduced for each original non-terminal.
    Because these non-terminals occur in multiple contexts, some overgeneration is introduced.
    However, th
