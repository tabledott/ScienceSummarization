ining both words and logic.
    Lu et al. (2008) (Lu08) developed a generative model that builds a single hybrid tree of words, syntax and meaning representation.
    These algorithms are all language independent but representation specific.
    Other algorithms have been designed to recover lambda-calculus representations.
    For example, Wong &amp; Mooney (2007) developed a variant of WASP (A-WASP) specifically designed for this alternate representation.
    Zettlemoyer &amp; Collins (2005, 2007) developed CCG grammar induction techniques where lexical items are proposed according to a set of hand-engineered lexical templates.
    Our approach eliminates this need for manual effort.
    Another line of work has focused on recovering meaning representations that are not based on logic.
    Examples include an early statistical method for learning to fill slot-value representations (Miller et al., 1996) and a more recent approach for recovering semantic parse trees (Ge &amp; Mooney, 2006).
