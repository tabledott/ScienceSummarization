    Most manual subjectivity annotation research has focused on annotating words, out of context (e.g., (Heise, 2001)), or sentences and phrases in the context of a text or conversation (e.g., (Wiebe et al., 2005)).
    The new annotations in this paper are instead targeting the annotation of word senses.
  
  
    To explore our hypothesis that subjectivity may be associated with word senses, we developed a manual annotation scheme for assigning subjectivity labels to WordNet senses,3 and performed an inter-annotator agreement study to assess its reliability.
    Senses are classified as S(ubjective), O(bjective), or B(oth).
    Classifying a sense as S means that, when the sense is used in a text or conversation, we expect it to express subjectivity; we also expect the phrase or sentence containing it to be subjective.
    We saw a number of subjective expressions in Section 2.
    A subset is repeated here, along with relevant WordNet senses.
    In the display of each sense, the first par
