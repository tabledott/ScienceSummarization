h problem, i.e. the generation of the output sentence in the target language.
    According to Bayes&#8217; decision rule, we can equivalently to Eq.
    1 perform the following maximization: This approach is referred to as source-channel approach to statistical MT.
    Sometimes, it is also referred to as the &#8216;fundamental equation of statistical MT&#8217; (Brown et al., 1993).
    Here, Pr(eI1) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr(fJ1 |eI1) is the translation model.
    Typically, Eq.
    2 is favored over the direct translation model of Eq.
    1 with the argument that it yields a modular approach.
    Instead of modeling one probability distribution, we obtain two different knowledge sources that are trained independently.
    The overall architecture of the source-channel approach is summarized in Figure 1.
    In general, as shown in this figure, there may be additional transformations to make the translation task simpler for the algorithm.
    Typically, training is performed b
