uirements of the supertag.
    The probability with which a supertag depends on another supertag is collected from a corpus of sentences annotated with derivation structures.
    Given a set of supertags for each word and the dependency information between pairs of supertags, the objective of the dependency model is to compute the most likely dependency linkage that spans the entire string.
    The result of producing the dependency linkage is a sequence of supertags, one for each word of the sentence along with the dependency information.
    Since first reported in Joshi and Srinivas (1994), we have not continued experiments using this model of supertagging, primarily for two reasons.
    We are restrained by the lack of a large corpus of LTAG parsed derivation structures that is needed to reliably estimate the various parameters of this model.
    We are currently in the process of collecting a large LTAG parsed WSJ corpus, with each sentence annotated with the correct derivation.
