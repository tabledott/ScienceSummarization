    Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et al. 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings), which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English).
