are encapsulated in two rules: .
  RULES For each Ui in a discourse segment U1, .
  ,  Urn: If some element of Cf(Ui- l )  is realized as a pronoun in Ui, then so is Cb(Ui).
  Transition states are ordered.
  CONTINUE is preferred to RETAIN is preferred to SMOOTH-SHIFT is preferred to ROUGH-SHIFT.
  7 Rule (1) captures the intuition that pronominal ization is one way to indicate dis- course salience.
  It follows from Rule (1) that if there are multiple pronouns in an utterance, one of these must  be the Cb.
  In addition, if there is only one pronoun, then that pronoun must  be the Cb.
  For Japanese, we extend this rule directly to zeros, assuming that zeros in Japanese correspond to destressed pronouns in English.
  Rule (2) states that model ing attentional state depends on analyzing adjacent ut- terances according to a set of transitions that measure the coherence of the discourse segment in which the utterance occurs.
  Measuring coherence is based on an estimate of the hearer s  inference load, but thi
