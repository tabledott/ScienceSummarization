  When the sit- uation requires the negotiation of a collaborative plan, these theories must account for the interact- ing beliefs and intentions of multiple participants.
  ~,From apractical perspective, there is ample evi- dence that limited mixed-initiative has contributed to lack of system usability.
  Many researchers have noted that the absence of mixed-initiative gives rise to two problems with expert systems: They dont allow users to participate in the rea- soning process, or to ask the questions they want answered[PHW82, Kid85, FL89].
  In addition, ques- tion answering systems often fail to take account of the systems role as a conversational partner.

  In this paper we focus on interactive discourse.
  We model mixed-initiative using an utterance type classific
