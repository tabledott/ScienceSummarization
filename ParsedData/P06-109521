.
    This can result in the classifier producing an inconsistently annotated text.
    The machine learning approach of (Cohen et al. 1999) addresses this, but their approach is limited to total orderings involving BEFORE, whereas TLINKs introduce partial orderings involving BEFORE and five other relations.
    Future research will investigate methods for tighter integration of temporal reasoning and statistical classification.
    The only closely comparable machinelearning approach to the problem of TLINK extraction was that of (Boguraev and Ando 2005), who trained a classifier on Timebank 1.1 for event anchoring for events and times within the same sentence, obtaining an F-measure (for tasks A and B together) of 53.1.
    Other work in machine-learning and hand-coded approaches, while interesting, is harder to compare in terms of accuracy since they do not use common task definitions, annotation standards, and evaluation measures.
    (Li et al. 2004) obtained 78-88% accuracy on ordering within-sentence t
