&amp;quot;, although that-clause in the sentence may have a complicated structure and the parser gets it wrong, the reduction system is not necessarily affected since it may decide in this case to keep that-clause as it is, as humans often do, so the parsing errors will not matter in this example.
  
  
    The reduction algorithm we present assumes generic summarization; that is, we want to generate a summary that includes the most important information in an article.
    We can tailor the reduction system to queries-based summarization.
    In that case, the task of the reduction is not to remove phrases that are extraneous in terms of the main topic of an article, but phrases that are not very relevant to users' queries.
    We extended our sentence reduction program to query-based summarization by adding another step in the algorithm to measure the relevance of users' queries to phrases in the sentence.
    In the last step of reduction when the system makes the final decision, the relevance of a phrase t
