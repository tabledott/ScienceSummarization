e two confusion matrices in Figures 7(b) and 7(c), which display the number of errors of each type that the model made.
    The first confusion matrix concentrates on CORE arguments and merges all modifying argument labels into a single ARGM label.
    The second concentrates on confusions among modifying arguments.
    From the confusion matrix in Figure 7(b), we can see that the largest number of errors are confusions of argument labels with NONE.
    The number of confusions between pairs of core arguments is low, as is the number of confusions between core and modifier labels.
    If we ignore the column and row corresponding to NONE in Figure 7(b), the number of off-diagonal entries is very small.
    This corresponds to the high F-Measures Performance measures for local model using all local features and enforcing the non-overlapping constraint.
    Results are on Section 23 using gold standard parse trees. on COARSEARGM CLS and CORE CLS, 98.1 and 98.0 respectively, shown in Figure 7(a).
