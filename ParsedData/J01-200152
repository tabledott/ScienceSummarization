ber of words in the corpus (token count) that are morphologically analyzed, and refer to this set as WA; this consists of all words except those that are analyzed as having no suffix (see item (ii) in (2), below).
    (perhaps work-ing) did not appear independently as a freestanding word in the corpus; we will refer to these inferred words as being &amp;quot;virtual&amp;quot; words with virtual counts.
    MDL thus provides a figure of merit that we wish to minimize, and we will seek heuristics that modify the morphological analysis in such a fashion as to decrease this figure of merit in a large proportion of cases.
    In any given case, we will accept a modification to our analysis just in case the description length decreases, and we will suggest that this strategy coincides with traditional linguistic judgment in all clear cases.
  
  
    The MDL model designed in the preceding section will be of use only if we can provide a practical means of creating one or more plausible morphologies for a given corp
