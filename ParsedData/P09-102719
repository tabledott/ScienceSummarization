strong baselines because the transductive SVM has been widely used for improving the classification accuracy by leveraging additional unlabeled examples.
    In the experiments, we first compare the proposed co-training approach (I=40 and p=n=5) with the eight baseline methods.
    The three parameters in the co-training approach are empirically set by considering the total number (i.e.
    1000) of the unlabeled Chinese reviews.
    In our empirical study, the proposed approach can perform well with a wide range of parameter values, which will be shown later.
    Table 1 shows the comparison results.
    Seen from the table, the proposed co-training approach outperforms all eight baseline methods over all metrics.
    Among the eight baselines, the best one is TSVM(ENCN2), which combines the results of two transductive SVM classifiers.
    Actually, TSVM(ENCN2) is similar to CoTrain because CoTrain also combines the results of two classifiers in the same way.
    However, the co-training approach can train t
