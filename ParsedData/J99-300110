ally only sketchily dealt with in the centering literature, e.g., by asserting that the entity in question &amp;quot;is realized but not directly realized&amp;quot; (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995, 217).
    Furthermore, the distinction between these two kinds of realization is not part of the centering mechanisms but delegated to the underlying semantic theory.
    We will develop arguments for how to discern inferable discourse entities and relate them properly to their antecedent at the center level.
    The ordering constraints we supply account for all of the types of anaphora mentioned above, including (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn 1995; Hahn and Strube 1996).
    This claim will be validated by a substantial body of empirical data in Section 5.
    Our third contribution relates to the way the results of centering-based anaphora resolution are usually evaluated.
    Basically, we argue that rather than counting resolution rates for anaphora or comparing isolated transition types holding amon
