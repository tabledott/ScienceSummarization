ss bootstrapping for four semantic categories: U.S. states, countries, singers, and fish.
    The first two categories are relatively small, closed sets (our gold standard contains 50 U.S. states and 194 countries).
    The singers andfish categories are much larger, open sets (see Section 4 for details). quality deteriorates rapidly as bootstrapping progresses.
    Figure 2 shows the recall and precision curves for countries and states.
    High precision is achieved only with low levels of recall for countries.
    Our initial hypothesis was that such a specific pattern would be able to maintain high precision because non-class members would be unlikely to cooccur with the pattern.
    But we were surprised to find that many incorrect entries were generated for reasons such as broken expressions like &#8220;Merce -dez&#8221;, misidentified list constructions (e.g., &#8220;In countries such as China U.S. Policy is failing...&#8221;), and incomplete proper names due to insufficient length of the retrieved tex
