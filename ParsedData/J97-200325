e of string-to-weight transducers, which are also used in many areas of computational linguistics.
    We consider string-to-weight transducers, namely transducers with input strings and output weights.
    These transducers are used in various domains, such as language modeling, representation of word or phonetic lattices, etc., in the following way: one reads and follows a path corresponding to a given input string and outputs a number obtained by combining the weights along this path.
    In most applications to natural language processing, the weights are simply added along the path, since they are interpreted as (negative) logarithms of probabilities.
    In case the transducer is not sequential, that is, when it does not have a deterministic input, one proceeds in the same way for all the paths corresponding to the input string.
    In natural language processing, specifically in speech processing, one keeps the minimum of the weights associated to these paths.
    This corresponds to the Viterbi approx
