results for the English setting, even with a relatively small dictionary.
    Furthermore, while recent work report results on a reduced English tagset of 17 PoS tags, we also present results for the complete 45 tags tagset of the WSJ corpus.
    This considerably raises the bar of the EM-HMM baseline.
    We also report state-of-the-art results for Hebrew full morphological disambiguation.
    Our primary conclusion is that the problem of learning effective stochastic classifiers remains primarily a search task.
    Initial conditions play a dominant role in solving this task and can rely on linguistically motivated approximations.
    A robust learning method (EM-HMM) combined with good initial conditions based on a robust feature set can go a long way (as opposed to a more complex learning method).
    It seems that computing initial conditions is also the right place to capture complex linguistic intuition without fear that over-generalization could lead a learner to diverge.
