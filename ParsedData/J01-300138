y an adjective.
    Stevenson (1998) describes an evaluation of this system in which the relations identified were compared with those derived from Penn TreeBank parses (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).
    It was found that the parser achieved 51% precision and 69% recall.
    The preference resolution algorithm begins by examining a verb and the nouns it dominates.
    Each sense of the verb applies a preference to those nouns such that some of their senses may be disallowed.
    Some verb senses will disallow all senses for a particular noun it dominates and these senses of the verb are immediately rejected.
    This process leaves us with a set of verb senses that do not conflict with the nouns that verb governs, and a set of noun senses licensed by at least one of those verb senses.
    For each noun, we then check whether it is modified by an adjective.
    If it is, we reject any senses of the adjectives which do not agree with any of the remaining noun senses.
    This approach is rather co
