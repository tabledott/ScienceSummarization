    When the algorithm assigned the same similarity to all of the choices for a given question, that question was skipped.
    The precision was 120/(120 + 224) and the recall was 120/(120 + 224 + 30).
    The first five algorithms in Table 4 are implemented in Pedersen&#8217;s WordNetSimilarity package.2 The sixth algorithm (Turney 2001) used the Waterloo MultiText System (WMTS), as described in Terra and Clarke (2003).
    The difference between the lowest performance (Jiang and Conrath 1997) and random guessing is statistically significant with 95% confidence, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990).
    However, the difference between the highest performance (Turney 2001) and the VSM approach (Turney and Littman 2005) is also statistically significant with 95% confidence.
    We conclude that there are enough near analogies in the 374 SAT questions for attributional similarity to perform better than random guessing, but not enough near analogies for attributional similarity to pe
