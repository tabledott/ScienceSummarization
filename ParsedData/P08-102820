    The study was conducted remotely over the Internet using Webexp4, a software package designed for conducting psycholinguistic studies over the web.
    49 unpaid volunteers completed the experiment, all native speakers of English.

    First, we examined whether participants gave high ratings to high similarity sentence pairs and low ratings to low similarity ones.
    Figure 2 presents a box-and-whisker plot of the distribution of the ratings.
    As we can see sentences with high similarity landmarks are perceived as m
