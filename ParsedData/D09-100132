on will require running DIRT on the GENIA text, but we were not able to obtain the source code.
    We thus resorted to using the latest DIRT database released by the author, which contains paths extracted from a large corpus with more than 1GB of text.
    This puts DIRT in a very advantageous position compared with other systems.
    In our experiments, we used the top three similar paths, as including more results in very low precision.
    USP: We built a system for knowledge extraction and question answering on top of USP.
    It generated Stanford dependencies (de Marneffe et al., 2006) from the input text using the Stanford parser, and then fed these to USP-Learn11, which produced an MLN with learned weights and the MAP semantic parses of the input sentences.
    These MAP parses formed our knowledge base (KB).
    To answer questions, the system first parses the questions12 using USP-Parse with the learned MLN, and then matches the question parse to parses in the KB by testing subsumption (i.e., a que
