alled the Catalan Numbers (Knuth 1975, pp.
    388-389, 531-533).6 This section will describe Catalan numbers and their relation to parsing.
    The first few Catalan numbers are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 469, 1430, 4862.
    They are generated by the closed form expression:7 This formula can be explained in terms of parenthesized expressions, which are equivalent to trees.
    Cat, is the number of ways to parenthesize a formula of length n. There are two conditions on parenthesization: (a) there must be the same number of open and close parentheses, and (b) they must be properly nested so that an open parenthesis precedes its matching close parenthesis.
    The first term counts the number of 6 This fact was first pointed out to us by V. Pratt.
    We suspect that it is a generally well-known result in the formal language community, though its origin is unclear. where a! is equal to the product of all integers between 1 and a. Binomial coefficients are very common in combinatorics where they are interpreted
