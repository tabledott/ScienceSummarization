    Another advantage of VOLSUNGA is that it requires little inherent linguistic knowledge.
    Probabilities may be acquired simply through counting instances of collocation.
    The results will increase in accuracy as more input text is seen.
    Previous algorithms, on the other hand, have included extensive manually generated lists of rules or exceptions.
