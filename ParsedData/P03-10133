been reported for English.
    Learning curves show that the poor performance of the lexicalized models is not due to lack of training data.
    Section 5 presents an error analysis for Collins&#8217;s (1997) lexicalized model, which shows that the head-head dependencies used in this model fail to cope well with the flat structures in Negra.
    We propose an alternative model that uses sister-head dependencies instead.
    This model outperforms the two original lexicalized models, as well as the unlexicalized baseline.
    Based on this result and on the review of the previous literature (Section 6), we argue (Section 7) that sister-head models are more appropriate for treebanks with very flat structures (such as Negra), typically used to annotate languages with semifree wordorder (such as German).
  
  
    German exhibits a number of syntactic properties that distinguish it from English, the language that has been the focus of most research in parsing.
    Prominent among these properties is the semi-free
