bsets containing that feature.
    The first observation-that more features perform better-is confirmed overall, in all subsets.
    Looking at the first data column of Table 10, we can observe that, on average, larger sets of features perform better than smaller sets.
    Furthermore, as can be seen in the following individual feature columns, individual features perform better in a bigger set than in a smaller set, without exception.
    The second observation-that the performance of individual features is not always a predictor of their performance in combination-is confirmed by comparing the average performance of each feature in subsets of different sizes to the average across all subsets of each size.
    We can observe, for instance, that the feature CAUS, which performs very well alone, is average in feature combinations of size 3 or 4.
    By contrast, the feature ANIM, which is the worst if used alone, is very effective in combination, with above average performance for all subsets of size 2 or grea
