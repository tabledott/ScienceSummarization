amp;quot; category, all of which are correctly disambiguated by the method reported here.
    When no disambiguation is carried out, the algorithm described simply chooses the first sense and so the results are the same for both methods.
    The only condition under which choosing the first sense is more effective than using part-of-speech information is when the part-of-speech tagger makes an error and all the homographs with the correct part of speech are removed from consideration.
    In most cases this means that the correct homograph cannot be chosen; however, in a small number of cases, this is equivalent to choosing the most frequent sense, since if all possible homographs have been removed from consideration, the algorithm reverts to using the simpler heuristic of choosing the word's first homograph.4 Although this result may seem intuitively obvious, there have, we believe, been no other attempts to quantify the benefit to be gained from the application of a part-ofspeech tagger in WSD (see Wilks an
