hat include the word being disambiguated, there is no requirement that this be the case.
    Decision trees have been used in supervised learning approaches to word sense disambiguation, and have fared well in a number of comparative studies (e.g., (Mooney, 1996), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997)).
    In the former they were used with the bag of word feature sets and in the latter they were used with a mixed feature set that included the part-of-speech of neighboring words, three collocations, and the morphology of the ambiguous word.
    We believe that the approach in this paper is the first time that decision trees based strictly on bigram features have been employed.
    The decision list is a closely related approach that has also been applied to word sense disambiguation (e.g., (Yarowsky, 1994), (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998), (Yarowsky, 2000)).
    Rather than building and traversing a tree to perform disambiguation, a list is employed.
    In the general case a decision list may suffer from less fragmentation
