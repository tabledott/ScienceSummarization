e then used as seeds for the next stage, where the unclustered documents are assigned to the seed with the closest distance measure (Figure 3).
    An alternative to this form of cluster refactoring would be to initially cluster only pages with extracted features.
    This would yield a set of cluster seeds, divided by features, which could then be used for further clustering.
    However, this method relies on having a number of pages with extracted features that overlap from each referent.
    This can only be Figure 3: nnp+feat+eztfeat+mi Clustering Visualization for DAVIS/HARRELSON pseudoname assured when the feature set is rich, or a large document space is assumed.
  
  
    To test these clustering methods, we collected web pages by making requests to the Google website for a set of target personal names (up to a maximum of 1000 pages per name).
    There was no requirediscography solos ment that the web page be focused on that name, nor was there a minimum number of name occurrences.
    As a result,
