ocal trees, i.e. single level rules with limited means of information percolation, or with restricted fragments, as in Stochastic Tree-Adjoining Grammar (Schabes 1992; Chiang 2000) that do not include nonlexicalized fragments.
    However, during the last few years we can observe a shift towards using more and larger corpus fragments with fewer restrictions.
    While the models of Collins (1996) and Eisner (1996) restricted the fragments to the locality of head-words, later models showed the importance of including context from higher nodes in the tree (Charniak 1997; Johnson 1998a).
    The importance of including nonheadwords has become uncontroversial (e.g.
    Collins 1999; Charniak 2000; Goodman 1998).
    And Collins (2000) argues for &amp;quot;keeping track of counts of arbitrary fragments within parse trees&amp;quot;, which has indeed been carried out in Collins and Duffy (2002) who use exactly the same set of (all) tree fragments as proposed in Bod (1992).
    Thus the major innovations of DOP are:
