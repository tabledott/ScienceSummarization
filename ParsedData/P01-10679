possible values for , , and , respectively.
    In summary, the probability of getting a French sentence given an English parse tree is P Str where and , P and P , decide the behavior of the translation model, and these are the probabilities we want to estimate from a training corpus.
    To estimate the model parameters, we use the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).
    The algorithm iteratively updates the model parameters to maximize the likelihood of the training corpus.
    First, the model parameters are initialized.
    We used a uniform distribution, but it can be a distribution taken from other models.
    For each iteration, the number of events are counted and weighted by the probabilities of the events.
    The probabilities of events are calculated from the current model parameters.
    The model parameters are re-estimated based on the counts, and used for the next iteration.
    In our case, an event is a pair of a value of a random variable (such as,, or) and a feature value (such as , , or
