he database of retrieved descriptions only, thus reducing search time, as no connections will be made to external news sources at the time of the query.
    Only when a suitable stored description cannot be found will the system initiate search of additional text. dictionary.
    This resulted in a list of 421 unique entity names that we used for the automatic description extraction stage.
    All 421 entity names retrieved by the system are indeed proper nouns.
    5.1.2 Extraction of Descriptions.
    There are two occasions on which we extract descriptions using finite-state techniques.
    The first case is when the entity that we want to describe was already extracted automatically (see Section 5.1.1) and exists in the database of descriptions.
    The second case is when we want a description to be retrieved in real time based on a request from the generation component.
