is collection of features will eventually be employed in our final model.
    If we had a training sample of infinite size, we could determine the &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; expected value for a candidate feature f E ,T simply by computing the fraction of events in the sample for which f (x, y) = 1.
    In real-life applications, however, we are provided with only a small sample of N events, which cannot be trusted to represent the process fully and accurately.
    Specifically, we cannot expect that for every feature f EF, the estimate of /3(f) we derive from this sample will be close to its value in the limit as n grows large.
    Employing a larger (or even just a different) sample of data from the same process might result in different estimates of P(f) for many candidate features.
    We would like to include in the model only a subset S of the full set of candidate features F. We will call S the set of active features.
    The choice of S must capture as much information about the random process as possib
