at, for both English and German, we see significant F-score improvements for the core grammatical functions subject (91.3 &#8212;* 92.1 for German, 95.6 &#8212;* 96.1 for English) and object (86.9 &#8212;* 87.9 for German, 90.2 &#8212;* 91.9 for English).
  
  
    Our work is most closely related to Lee et al. (2011), Li et al.
    (2011) and Hatori et al. (2011), who all present discriminative models for joint tagging and dependency parsing.
    However, all three models only perform unlabeled parsing, while our model incorporates dependency labels into the parsing process.
    Whereas Lee et al. (2011) and Li et al.
    (2011) take a graph-based approach to dependency parsing, Hatori et al. (2011) use a transition-based model similar to ours but limited to projective dependency trees.
    Both Li et al. (2011) and Hatori et al.
    (2011) only evaluate their model on Chinese, and of these only Hatori et al. (2011) report consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy.
    Like our system, the
