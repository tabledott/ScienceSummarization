			The output of the memory-based learner is a classifier that predicts the next transition (including dependency type), given the current state of the parser.
			The quality of thisclassifier has been evaluated with respect to both predic tion accuracy and parsing accuracy.Prediction accuracy refers to the quality of the clas sifier as such, i.e. how well it predicts the next transitiongiven the correct parser state, and is measured by the clas sification accuracy on unseen transition data (using a 0-1loss function).
			We use McNemar?s test for statistical sig nificance.
			Parsing accuracy refers to the quality of the classifier as a guide for the deterministic parser and is measured by the accuracy obtained when parsing unseen sentence data.
			More precisely, parsing accuracy is measured by the attachment score, which is a standard measure used in studies of dependency parsing (Eisner, 1996; Collins et al, 1999).
			The attachment score is computed as theproportion o
