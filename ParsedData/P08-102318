, and have been shown to be helpful in tree-based systems (Galley et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).
    The final results are shown in Table 1, where TR denotes translation rule only, and TR+BP denotes the inclusion of bilingual phrases.
    The BLEU score of forest decoder with TR is 0.2839, which is a 1.7% points improvement over the 1-best baseline, and this difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01).
    Using bilingual phrases further improves the BLEU score by 3.1% points, which is 2.1% points higher than the respective 1-best baseline.
    We suspect this larger improvement is due to the alternative constituents in the forest, which activates many syntactic phrases suppressed by the 1-best parse.
  
  
    We have presented a novel forest-based translation approach which uses a packed forest rather than the 1-best parse tree (or k-best parse trees) to direct the translation.
    Forest provides a compact data-structure for efficient handling of exponentially many tree structures, and is shown
