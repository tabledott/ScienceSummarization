ymbols are ignored, we define a two-level left-context operator so that Leftcontext(Ak , &lt;k) enforces the requirement that every &lt;k pair be preceded by an instance of Ak.
    This is simpler than the rewriting left-context operator because not every instance of A must be marked&#8212;only the ones that precede T, and those are picked out independently by the iterative union.
    That is why this uses a one-way implication instead of a biconditional.
    As in the rewriting case, the ignoring provides for overlapping instances of A.
    The right-context operator can be defined symmetrically using If-P-then-S or by reversing the left-context operator: Auxiliary marks are freely introduced on the lexical string.
    Those marks are appropriately constrained so that matching brackets enclose every occurrence of T, and each bracket marks an occurrence of the associated context relation.
    The marks are removed at the end.
    Note that there are only same-length relations in the intermediate expression, a
