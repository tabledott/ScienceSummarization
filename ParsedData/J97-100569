viously considered by ourselves or others, and result in algorithms that exhibit marked improvements in performance.
    We present our results using two sets of statistically validated boundaries: those derived using a significance level of .0001 (corresponding to Ti &gt; 4 subjects, as in the previous section), and those derived using a less conservative level of .02 (corresponding to Tj &gt; 3 subjects).
    4.3.1 Error Analysis.
    To improve performance, we analyzed the two types of IR errors, defined in Figure 8 above, made by the original NP algorithm on the training data (Passonneau and Litman 1993).
    Type &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; errors, misclassification of nonboundaries, were reduced by redefining the coding features pertaining to clauses and NPs.
    Most &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; (like previous research) shows that pauses preceding boundaries have average longer durations.
    For Tj &gt; 3, the average pause duration is .64 (a .65) before boundaries, and .39 (cr =-- 1.70) before noriboundaries; for
