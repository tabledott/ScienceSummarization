    The fourth is that our scrubbing action can take a number of different forms: we can choose to scrub just a word, a whole synset, or even an entire feature set.
    In addition, we can either move the offending item to the opposite feedback set or remove it altogether.
    Moving synsets or feature sets can add valuable content to one feedback set while removing noise from the other.
    However, it can also cause unforeseen contamination.
    We experimented with a number of these options to produce a whole complement of feedback set learners for classifying the target sentences.
    Ideally this will allow the different learners to correct each other.
    For Learner A, we use phrasal/expression verbs and overlap as indicators to select whole WordNet synsets fo
