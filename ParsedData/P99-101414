beling.
    Fig.
    6 shows two verbs v for which the most probable class label is 5, a class which we earlier described as communicative action, together with the estimated frequencies of f (n)pe(cln) for those ten nouns n for which this estimated frequency is highest.
    Fig.
    7 shows corresponding data for an intransitive scalar motion sense of increase.
    Fig.
    8 shows the intransitive verbs which take 17 as the most probable label.
    Intuitively, the verbs are semantically coherent.
    When compared to Levin (1993)'s 48 top-level verb classes, we found an agreement of our classification with her class of &amp;quot;verbs of changes of state&amp;quot; except for the last three verbs in the list in Fig.
    8 which is sorted by probability of the class label.
    Similar results for German intransitive scalar motion verbs are shown in Fig.
    9.
    The data for these experiments were extracted from the maximal-probability parses of a 4.1 million word corpus of German subordinate clauses, yiel
