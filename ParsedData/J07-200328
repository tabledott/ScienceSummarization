aking the LM into account) or something acceptably close to it.
    5.3.2 Intersection.
    A more principled solution would be to calculate the LM probabilities online.
    To do this, we view an m-gram LM as a weighted finite state machine M in which each state corresponds to a sequence of (m &#8722; 1) English terminal symbols.
    We can then intersect the English side of our weighted CFG G with this finite-state machine to produce a new weighted CFG that incorporates M. Thus PLM would be part of the rule weights (22) just like the other features.
    (For notational consistency, however, we write the LM probabilities separately from the rule weights.)
    In principle this method should admit no search errors, though in practice the blow-up in the effective size of the grammar necessitates pruning of the search space, which can cause search errors.
    The classic construction for intersecting a (non-synchronous) CFG with a finitestate machine is due to Bar-Hillel, Perles, and Shamir (1964), but we use a
