tion.
    Finally, our method was evaluated by simulating realistic machine translation lexicons, on randomly selected examples, and yielded high performance in two different broad domains (foreign news articles and a software manual).
    It is therefore expected that the results reported here will be reproduced in other domains and systems.
    To improve the performance of target word selection further, our method may be combined with other sense disambiguation methods.
    As discussed in Section 6.2, it is possible to increase the applicability (coverage) of the selection method by considering word co-occurrence in a limited context and/or by using similarity-based methods that reduce the problem of data sparseness.
    To a lesser extent, the use of a bilingual corpus may further increase the precision of the selection (see Section 6.3).
    A practical strategy may be to use a bilingual corpus for enriching the bilingual lexicon, while relying mainly on co-occurrence statistics from a larger monolingua
