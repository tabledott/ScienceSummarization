).
    This score is slightly lower than the scores reported by Ng and Cardie (2002a) for another data set (MUC).
    Table 1 summarizes the results, in terms of recall (R), precision (P), and f-score (F) on the three ACE data sets.
    As can be seen, the AC-CASCADE system generally provides slightly better precision at the expense of recall than the COREF-PAIRWISE system, but the performance varies across the three datasets.
    The source of this variance is likely due to the fact that we applied a uniform anaphoricity threshold of .5 across all datasets; Ng (2004) optimizes this threshold for each of the datasets: .3 for BNEWS and NWIRE and .35 for NPAPER.
    This variance reinforces our argument for determining anaphoricity and coreference jointly.
    The limitations of the cascade approach are also shown by the oracle results.
    Even if we had a system that can pick the correct antecedents for all truly anaphoric mentions, it would have a maximum recall of roughly 70% for the different datasets.
