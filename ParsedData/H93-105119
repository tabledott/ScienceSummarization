  Therefore, we hypothesized degree of polysemy to be a major factor for performance.
  We were surprised to find that in the six-sense task, all three classifiers degraded only slightly from the three- sense task, with a mean of 73% correct.
  Although the addition of three new senses to the task caused consistent degradation, the degradation is relatively slight.
  Hence, we conclude that some senses are harder to resolve than others, and it appears that overall accuracy is a function of the difficulty of the sense rat
