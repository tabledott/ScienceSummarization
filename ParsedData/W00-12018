erations: substitution, adjunction, and sister-adjunction.
    Figure 2 illustrates all three of these operations, al is an initial tree which substitutes at the leftmost node labeled NP,I.
    ; 13 is an auxiliary tree which adjoins at the node labeled VP.
    See (Joshi and Schabes, 1997) for a more detailed explanation.
    Sister-adjunction is not a standard TAG operation, but borrowed from D-Tree Grammar (Rambow et al., 1995).
    In Figure 2 the modifier tree 7 is sister adjoined between the nodes labeled VB and NI4.
    Multiple modifier trees can adjoin at the same place, in the spirit of (Schabes and Shieber, 1994).
    In stochastic TAG, the probability of generating an elementary tree depends on the elementary tree itself and the elementary tree it attaches to.
    The parameters are as follows: where a ranges over initial trees, /3 over auxiliary trees, 7 over modifier trees, and n over nodes.
    Pi(a) is the probability of beginning a derivation with a; Ps(a j ) is the probability of substitutin
