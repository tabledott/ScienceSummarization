naphora-annotated portion of the American National Corpus (ANC) used in Bergsma (2005), containing 1270 anaphoric pronouns4.
    We test on the ANC Test set (1291 instances) also used in Bergsma (2005) (highest resolution accuracy reported: 73.3%), the anaphoralabelled portion of AQUAINT used in Cherry and Bergsma (2005) (1078 instances, highest accuracy: 71.4%), and the anaphoric pronoun subset of the MUC7 (1997) coreference evaluation formal test set (169 instances, highest precision of 62.1 reported on all pronouns in (Ng and Cardie, 2002)).
    These particular corpora were chosen so we could test our approach using the same data as comparable machine-learned systems exploiting probabilistic information sources.
    Parameters were set using cross-validation on the training set; test sets were used only once to obtain the final performance values.
    Evaluation Metric: We report results in terms of accuracy: Of all the anaphoric pronouns in the test set, the proportion we resolve correctly.
