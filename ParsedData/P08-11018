and POS tagging model that uses exactly the same source of information as the baseline system, by applying the feature templates from the baseline word segmentor and POS tagger.
    No extra knowledge is used by the joint model.
    However, because word segmentation and POS tagging are performed simultaneously, POS information participates in word segmentation.
    We formulate joint word segmentation and POS tagging as a single problem, which maps a raw Chinese sentence to a segmented and POS tagged output.
    Given an input sentence x, the output F(x) satisfies: where GEN(x) represents the set of possible outputs for x.
    Score(y) is computed by a feature-based linear model.
    Denoting the global feature vector for the tagged sentence y with 4b(y), we have: where w&#65533; is the parameter vector in the model.
    Each element in w&#65533; gives a weight to its corresponding element in 4b(y), which is the count of a particular feature over the whole sentence y.
    We calculate the w&#65533; value by
