d formalisms.
    More speculatively. schemes for scheduling LH parsers to yield p.irses ill preference order might be modified for complex-foal ure-kisod formalisms, and even timed by means of the restrictor.
    Finally, restriction can be used in areas of parsing other than top-down prediction and filtering.
    For instance, in many parsing schemes, edges are indexed by a category symbol for efficient retrieval.
    In the case of Earley's algorithm. active edges can be indexed by the category of the constituent following the dot in the (lotted rule.
    However, this again forces the primacy and atomicity of major category information.
    Once again, restriction can be used to solve the problem.
    Indexing by the restriction of the dag associated with the need pgrmits efficient retrieval that can be tuned to the particular grammar, yet does not affect the completeness or correctness of the algorithm.
    The indexing can be done by discrimination nets, or specialized hashing functions akin to the part
