    Computational linguists have recognized the need to account for referential ambiguities in discourse and have developed various theories centered around the notion of discourse focus (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1983).
    In a seminal paper, Grosz and Sidner (1986) wrapped up the results of their research and formulated a model in which three levels of discourse coherence are distinguished&#8212;attention, intention, and discourse segment structure.
    While this paper gives a comprehensive picture of a complex, yet not explicitly spelled-out theory of discourse coherence, the centering model (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1983, 1995) marked a major step in clarifying the relationship between attentional states and (local) discourse segment structure.
    More precisely, the centering model accounts for the interactions between local coherence and preferential choices of referring expressions.
    It relates differences in coherence (in part) to varying demands on inferences as requi
