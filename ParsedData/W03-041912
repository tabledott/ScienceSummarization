at only used gazetteers seem to gain more than systems that have used unannotated data for other purposes than obtaining capitalization information.
    However, the gain differences between the two approaches are most obvious for English for which better gazetteers are available.
    With the exception of the result of Zhang and Johnson (2003), there is not much difference in the German results between the gains obtained by using gazetteers and those obtained by using unannotated data.
    A baseline rate was computed for the English and the German test sets.
    It was produced by a system which only identified entities which had a unique class in the training data.
    If a phrase was part of more than one entity, the system would select the longest one.
    All systems that participated in the shared task have outperformed the baseline system.
    For all the F0=1 rates we have estimated significance boundaries by using bootstrap resampling (Noreen, 1989).
    From each output file of a system, 250 random
