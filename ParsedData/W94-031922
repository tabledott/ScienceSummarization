on).
    In other words, it does not use an integrated `lexicogrammar', which systemic theorists in particular (e.g., [Matthiessen, 19911) have argued for, and which is implicit in some unification-based approaches, such as the semantic head-driven algorithm [Shieber et al., 19901.
    Despite these theoretical arguments, none of the systems examined used an integrated lexicogrammar, including unification-based FUF and systemic-based PENMAN.3 In contrast, earlier unification-based sys'Even though I have previously argued against structure-mapping because it does not do a good job of handling lexical preferences [Reiter, 1991], I nevertheless ended up using this technique when I moved from my Ph.D research to the more applications-oriented IDAS project.
    Perhaps this is another example of engineering considerations overriding theoretical arguments. terns, such as the tactical component of McKeown's TEXT system [McKeown, 1985], did integrate lexical and syntactic processing in a single 'tactical generator';
