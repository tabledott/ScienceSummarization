le to reorder phrases hierarchically.
    To create a maximum entropy based reordering model, the first step is learning reordering examples from training data, similar to the lexicalized reordering model.
    But in our way, any evidences of reorderings will be extracted, not limited to reorderings of bilingual phrases of length less than a predefined number of words.
    Secondly, features will be extracted from reordering examples according to feature templates.
    Finally, a maximum entropy classifier will be trained on the features.
    In this paper we describe our system and the MaxEnt-based reordering model with the associated algorithm.
    We also present experiments that indicate that the MaxEnt-based reordering model improves translation significantly compared with other reordering approaches and a state-of-the-art distortion-based system (Koehn, 2004).
  
  
    Under the BTG scheme, translation is more like monolingual parsing through derivations.
    Throughout the translation procedure, three
