    Jenson and Binot (1987) describe the use of dictionary definitions for disambiguation, but dictionaries are typically rather uneven in their coverage.
    In the Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner study (1990), the judgment of attachment preferences had to be made by hand for the cases that their study covered; no precompiled list of lexical preferences was available.
    Thus, we are posed with the problem of how we can get a good list of lexical preferences.
    Our proposal is to use co-occurrence of verbs and nouns with prepositions in a large body of text as an indicator of lexical preference.
    Thus, for example, the preposition to occurs frequently in the context send NP_, that is, after the object of the verb send.
    This is evidence of a lexical association of the verb send with to.
    Similarly, from occurs frequently in the context withdrawal_, and this is evidence of a lexical association of the noun withdrawal with the preposition from.
    This kind of associatio
