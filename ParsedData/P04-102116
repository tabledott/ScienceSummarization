    In CLIR or multilingual corpus alignment (Virga and Khudanpur, 2003), N-best results will be very helpful to increase chances of correct hits.
    In this paper, we adopted an N-best stack decoder (Schwartz and Chow, 1990) in both TM and NCM experiments to search for N-best results.
    The algorithm also allows us to apply higher order n-gram such as trigram in the search.
    In this experiment, we conduct both open and closed tests for TM and NCM models under DOM paradigm.
    Results are reported in Table 3 and In word error report, a word is considered correct only if an exact match happens between transliteration and the reference.
    The character error rate is the sum of deletion, insertion and Hp ) where WT is the total .
    Clearly, lower perplexity means that the model describes better the data.
    It is easy to understand that closed test always gives lower perplexity than open test. substitution errors.
    Only the top choice in N-best results is used
