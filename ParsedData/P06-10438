 to NANC for BROWN, we cannot perform the opposite scenario and adapt BROWN to WSJ.
    The BROWN corpus (Francis and Ku&#711;cera, 1979) consists of many different genres of text, intended to approximate a &#8220;balanced&#8221; corpus.
    While the full corpus consists of fiction and nonfiction domains, the sections that have been annotated in Treebank II bracketing are primarily those containing fiction.
    Examples of the sections annotated include science fiction, humor, romance, mystery, adventure, and &#8220;popular lore.&#8221; We use the same divisions as Bacchiani et al. (2006), who base their divisions on Gildea (2001).
    Each division of the corpus consists of sentences from all available genres.
    The training division consists of approximately 80% of the data, while held-out development and testing divisions each make up 10% of the data.
    The treebanked sections contain approximately 25,000 sentences (458,000 words).
