e distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that a nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer&#8217;s purpose than a satellite.
    Discourse trees can be represented graphically in the style shown in Figure 1.
    The arrows link the satellite to the nucleus of a rhetorical relation.
    Arrows are labeled with the name of the rhetorical relation that holds between the linked units.
    Horizontal lines correspond to text spans, and vertical lines identify text spans which are nuclei.
    In this paper, we introduce two probabilistic models that can be used to identify elementary discourse units and build sentence-level discourse parse trees.
    We show how syntactic and lexical information can be exploited in the process of identifying elementary units of discourse and building sentence-level discourse trees.
    Our evaluation indicates that the discourse parsing model we propose is sophisticated enough to achieve near-human levels of performance on the tas
