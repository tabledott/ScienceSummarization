observation made in 2009.
    It is interpreted as follows: the role of computer scientists may be emphasized in part due to the fact that the task requires complex computational modeling, demanding particular efforts in framework design and implementation and computational resources.
    The &#8217;09 column suggests that previous experience in the task may have affected to the performance of the teams, especially in a complex task like the GE task.
    Table 5 shows the profile of the systems.
    A notable observation is that four teams developed their systems based on the model of UTurku09 (Bj&#168;orne et al., 2009) which was the winning system of BioNLP-ST 2009.
    It may show an influence of the BioNLP-ST series in the task.
    For syntactic analyses, the prevailing use of Charniak Johnson re-ranking parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) using the self-trained biomedical model from McClosky (2008) (McCCJ) which is converted to Stanford Dependency (de Marneffe et al., 2006) is notable, which may also be
