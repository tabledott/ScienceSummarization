    Our solution to this problem was to convert the gold standard dependencies from CCGbank into GRs and use these to develop the transformation.
    So we did inspect the annotation in DepBank, and compared it to the transformed CCG dependencies, but only the gold-standard CCG dependencies.
    Thus the parser output was never used during this process.
    We also ensured that the dependency mapping and the post processing are general to the GRs scheme and not specific to the test set or parser. and %f is the head of the constituent filling the argument slot.
    Note that the order of %l and %f varies according to whether the GR represents a complement or modifier, in line with the Briscoe and Carroll annotation.
    For many of the CCG dependencies, the mapping into GRs is straightforward.
    For example, the first two rows of Table 2 show the mapping for the transitive verb category (S[dcl]\NP1)/NP2: argument slot 1 is a non-clausal subject and argument slot 2 is a direct object.
