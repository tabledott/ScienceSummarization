ve examples can be seen as a request to find any transition event associated with the noun.
    As we saw above, the qualia structure contains just this kind of information.
    We can imagine the qualia roles as partial functions from a noun denotation into its subconstituent denotations.
    For our present purposes, we abbreviate these functions as QF, Qc, QT, QA.
    When applied, they return the value of a particular qualia role.
    For example, the purpose of a novel is for reading it, shown in 47(a), while the mode of creating a novel is by writing it, represented in 47(b).
    As the expressions in 47 suggest, there are, in fact, two obvious interpretations for this sentence in 42(c). a. John began to read a novel. b. John began to write a novel.
    One of these is selected by the coercing verb, resulting in a complement that has a event-predicate interpretation, without any syntactic transformations (cf.
    Pustejovsky [1989a] for details).21 The derivation in 49(a) and the structure in 49(b) show
