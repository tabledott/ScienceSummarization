ith a RF training on 100 tagged sentences.
    Having shown that ML training is able to improve the uniform model, we then wanted to know if it was also able to improve more accurate models.
    We therefore took as the initial model each of the models obtained previously by RF training and, for each one, performed ML training using all of the training word sequences.
    The results are shown graphically in Figure 2 and numerically in Table 2.
    These results show that, when we use few tagged data, the model obtained by relative frequency is not very good and Maximum Likelihood training is able to improve it.
    However, as the amount of tagged data increases, the models obtained by Relative Frequency are more accurate and Maximum Likelihood training improves on the initial iterations only, but after deteriorates.
    If we use more than 5,000 tagged sentences, even the first iteration of ML training degrades the tagging.
    (This number is of course dependent on both the particular system of tags and th
