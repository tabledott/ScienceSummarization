;, as a unit, to &#8220;de explorer la question&#8221;.
    However, possibly due to an error during the coding of the alignment, &#8220;work&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; align with &#8220;de&#8221; (indicated by the solid lines) while &#8220;this&#8221; and &#8220;matter&#8221; do not.
    This causes the phrasal translation heuristic to fail resulting in a crossing where there should be none.
    Also, due to the annotation guidelines, P alignments are not as consistent as would be ideal.
    Recall that in cases of annotator disagreement, the P alignment is taken to be the union of the P alignments of both annotators.
    Thus, it is possible for the P alignment to contain two mutually conflicting alignments.
    These composite alignments will likely generate crossings even where the alignments of each individual annotator would not.
    While reflecting genuine ambiguity, an SMT system would likely pursue only one of the alternatives and only a portion of the crossings would come into play.
