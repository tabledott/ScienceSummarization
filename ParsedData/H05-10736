			Determining emotion of a linguistic unit can be cast as a multi-class classification problem.
			Forthe flat case, let T denote the text, and s an em bedded linguistic unit, such as a sentence, where s ? T . Let k be the number of emotion classes E = {em1, em2, .., emk}, where em1 denotes the special case of neutrality, or absence of emotion.
