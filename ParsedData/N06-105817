    However, these methods present sensible comcompared to BLEU as well as our method for one reference.
    Two triangles indicates significant at the 99% confidence level, one triangle at the 95% confidence level and X not significant.
    Triangles point towards the better method. parison points for understanding the relationship between paraphrase quality and its impact on automatic evaluation.
    Table 3 shows synthetic references produced by the different paraphrasing methods.
    The standard way to analyze the performance of an evaluation metric in machine translation is to compute the Pearson correlation between the automatic metric and human scores (Papineni et al., 2002; Koehn, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004; Stent et al., 2005).
    Pearson correlation estimates how linearly dependent two sets of values are.
    The Pearson correlation values range from 1, when the scores are perfectly linearly correlated, to -1, in the case of inversely correlated scores.
    To calculate the Pearson correlation, we c
