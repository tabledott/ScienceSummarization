cific versions of TINA have been implemented.
    The first version (TIMIT) was developed for the 450 phonetically rich sentences of the TIMIT database (Lamel et al. 1986).
    The second version (RM) concerns the Resource Management task (Pallett 1989) that has been popular within the DARPA community in recent years.
    The third version (VOYAGER) serves as an interface both with a recognizer and with a functioning database back-end (Zue et al. 1990).
    The VOYAGER system can answer a number of different types of questions concerning navigation within a city, as well as provide certain information about hotels, restaurants, libraries, etc., within the region.
    A fourth domain-specific version is under development for the ATIS (Air Travel Information System) task, which has recently been designated as the new common task for the DARPA community.
