ecoder, very long distance reordering is not allowed because of efficiency considerations.
    Therefore, it is very difficult in general to translate English into Korean with proper word order.
    However, knowing the dependency parse trees of the English sentences may simplify the reordering problem significantly.
    In the simple example in Figure 1, if we analyze the English sentence and know that &#8220;John&#8221; is the subject, &#8220;can hit&#8221; is the verb and &#8220;the ball&#8221; is the object, we can reorder the English into SOV order.
    The resulting sentence &#8220;John the ball can hit .&#8221; will only need monotonic translation.
    This motivates us to use a dependency parser for English to perform the reordering.
  
  
    Figure 2 shows the dependency tree for the example sentence in the previous section.
    In this parse, the verb &#8220;hit&#8221; has four children: a subject noun &#8220;John&#8221;, an auxiliary verb &#8220;can&#8221;, an object noun &#8220;ball&#8221; and a
