we must realize that part of the meaning of a word is how it translates the underlying semantic representations into expressions that are utilized by the syntax.
    This is what many have called the argument structure for a lexical item.
    I will build on Grimshaw's recent proposals (Grimshaw 1990) for how to define the mapping from the lexicon to syntax. to a particular vocabulary of primitives, a lexical semantics should provide a method for the decomposition and composition of lexical items.
    7 Some of these roles are reminiscent of descriptors used by various computational researchers, such as Wilks (1975b), Hayes (1979), and Hobbs et al. (1987).
    Within the theory outlined here, these roles determine a minimal semantic description of a word that has both semantic and grammatical consequences.
    This provides us with an answer to the question of what levels of semantic representation are necessary for a computational lexical semantics.
    In sum, I will argue that lexical meaning can best be c
