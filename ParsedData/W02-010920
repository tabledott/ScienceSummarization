    The project extended these, adding a new probabilistic parsing interface, and using subclasses to create a probabilistic version of the context free grammar data structure.
    These new components were used in conjunction with several existing components, such as the chart data structure, to define two implementations of the probabilistic parsing interface.
    Finally, a tutorial was written that explained the basic motivations and concepts behind probabilistic parsing, and described the new interfaces, data structures, and parsers.
  
  
    We used NLTK as a basis for the assignments and student projects in CIS-530, an introductory computational linguistics class taught at the University of Pennsylvania.
    CIS-530 is a graduate level class, although some advanced undergraduates were also enrolled.
    Most students had a background in either computer science or linguistics (and occasionally both).
    Students were required to complete five assignments, two exams, and a final project.
