ited amounts of unlabeled data.
    In the experiment reported here, we use 9695 sentences of bracketed data (234467 word tokens).
    Such methods are attractive for the following reasons: In this paper we introduce a new approach that combines unlabeled data with a small amount of labeled (bracketed) data to train a statistical parser.
    We use a CoTraining method (Yarowsky, 1995; Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Goldman and Zhou, 2000) that has been used previously to train classifiers in applications like word-sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), document classification (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) and named-entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999) and apply this method to the more complex domain of statistical parsing.
    2 Unsupervised techniques in language processing While machine learning techniques that exploit annotated data have been very successful in attacking problems in NLP, there are still some aspects which are considered to be open issues: In the particular domain of statistical parsing ther
