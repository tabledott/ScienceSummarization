he smallest morph lexicon (codebook), and the codebook naturally occupies a small part of the total cost.
    It is best also in terms of the linguistic measure, the total alignment distance on test data.
    Linguistica, on the other hand, employs a more restricted segmentation, which leads to a larger codebook and to the fact that the codebook occupies a large part of the total MDL cost.
    This also appears to lead to a poor generalization ability to new word forms.
    The linguistic alignment distance is the highest, and so is the percentage of aligned morph/morphemic label pairs that were never observed in the training set.
    On the other hand, Linguistica is the fastest program10.
    Also for English, the Recursive MDL method achieves the best alignment, but here Linguistica achieves nearly the same result.
    The rate of compression follows the same pattern as for Finnish, in that Linguistica produces a much larger morph lexicon than the methods presented in this paper.
    In spite of this fact,
