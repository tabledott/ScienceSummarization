but we expect that the &#8220;best&#8221; WSJ+NANC parser will not perform very well.
    However, suppose one does self-training on a biology textbook instead of the LA Times.
    One might hope that such a text will split the difference between more &#8220;normal&#8221; newspaper articles and the specialized medical text.
    Thus, a selftrained parser based upon such text might do much better than our standard &#8220;best.&#8221; This is, of course, highly speculative.
