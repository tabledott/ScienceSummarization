    While the results so far can only be seen as indicative, this breed of non-extractive summarization holds a great deal of promise, both because of its potential to integrate many types of information about source documents and intended summaries, and because of its potential to produce very brief coherent summaries.
    We expect to improve both the quality and scope of the summaries produced in future work.
