st three college students, each of whom was given unlimited time to read the texts and perform the ratings.2 Subjects were asked the following questions: For each question, they provided a rating between 1 and 5, with 5 being the best and 1 being the worst.
    1One of the selected articles was missing from the Penn Treebank.
    Thus, results that do not require syntactic information (Tables 1, 2, 4, and 6) are over all thirty articles, while Tables 3, 5, and 7 report results for the twenty-nine articles with Treebank parse trees.
    2(Lapata, 2006) found that human ratings are significantly correlated with self-paced reading times, a more direct measure of processing effort which we plan to explore in future work.
    After collecting the data, it turned out that most of the time subjects gave the same rating to all questions.
    For competent language users, we view text readability and text coherence as equivalent properties, measuring the extent to which a text is well written.
    Thus for all subsequ
