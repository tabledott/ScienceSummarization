    To take a commonplace example, given that &amp;quot;John has red hair&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Mr. Jones has black hair&amp;quot;, one can be sure that John is not Mr. Jones.
    But if one is told &amp;quot;John has red hair&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Mr. Jones wears glasses&amp;quot; and nothing more about either John or Mr. Jones, then it is impossible to tell whether John is or is not Mr. Jones.
    In the domain of syntax, if a D-theory description says that and nothing else is stated about W, X, Y or Z, then it cannot be determined whether X and Z are aliases for the same NP node or are names for two distinct nodes.
    If an additional statement is added to the description that 'Y dominates Z&amp;quot;, then it must be the case that X and Z name distinct entities.
    We will show in what follows that the use of names has important ramifications for linguistic theory and the theory of parsing.
    The structure of the rest of this paper is roughly as follows: We will first sketch the computatio
