and examine the performance of the method.
    Incorporating variable context length model In our experiments, we simply use the socalled fixed context length model.
    We believe that we can achieve higher accuracy by selecting appropriate context length which is actually needed for identifying individual chunk tags.
    Sassano and Utsuro(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000) introduce a variable context length model for Japanese named entity identification task and perform better results.
    We will incorporate the variable context length model into our system.
    Considering more predictable bound In our experiments, we introduce new types of voting methods which stem from the theorems of SVMs &#8212; VC bound and Leave-OneOut bound.
    On the other hand, Chapelle and Vapnik introduce an alternative and more predictable bound for the risk and report their proposed bound is quite useful for selecting the kernel function and soft margin parameter(Chapelle and Vapnik, 2000).
    We believe that we can obtain higher
