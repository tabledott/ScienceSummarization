secondly how we can incorporate morphological information.
    We are particularly interested in rare words: as (Rosenfeld, 2000, pp.1313-1314) points out, it is most important to cluster the infrequent words, as we will have reliable information about the frequent words; and yet it is these words that are most difficult to cluster.
    We accordingly focus both in our algorithms and our evaluation on how to cluster words effectively that occur only a few times (or not at all) in the training data.
    In addition we are interested primarily in inducing small numbers of clusters (at most 128) from comparatively small amounts of data using limited or no sources of external knowledge, and in approaches that will work across a wide range of languages, rather than inducing large numbers (say 1000) from hundreds of millions of words.
    Note this is different from the common task of guessing the word category of an unknown word given a pre-existing set of parts-of-speech, a task which has been studied extensively
