 sense that maximizes the association score.
    The first set of results is given in Table 5.
    Our technique is referred to as the &#8220;similarity class&#8221; technique, and the approach using the association score is referred to as &#8220;Assoc.&#8221; The results are given for a range of &#945; values and demonstrate clearly that the performance of similarity class varies little with changes in &#945; and that similarity class outperforms both MDL and Assoc.12 We also give a score for our approach using a simple generalization procedure, which we call &#8220;low class.&#8221; The procedure is to select the first class that has a count greater than zero (relative to the verb and argument position), which is likely to return a low level of generalization, on the whole.
    The results show that our generalization technique only narrowly outperforms the simple alternative.
    Note that, although low class is based on a very simple generalization method, the estimation method is still using our class-ba
