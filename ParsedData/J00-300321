 than words; discourse grammars will be discussed in detail in Section 4.
    The computation of likelihoods P(EIU) depends on the types of evidence used.
    In our experiments we used the following sources of evidence, either alone or in combination: Transcribed words: The likelihoods used in Equation 1 are P(WI U), where W refers to the true (hand-transcribed) words spoken in a conversation.
    Recognized words: The evidence consists of recognizer acoustics A, and we seek to compute P(A I U).
    As described later, this involves considering multiple alternative recognized word sequences.
    Prosodic features: Evidence is given by the acoustic features F capturing various aspects of pitch, duration, energy, etc., of the speech signal; the associated likelihoods are P(F1U).
    For ease of reference, all random variables used here are summarized in Table 4.
    The same variables are used with subscripts to refer to individual utterances.
    For example, Wi is the word transcription of the ith utterance
