  For the translation experiments we used a differ- ent training and an illdetmndent test corpus (Table 4).

  and the Subjective Sentence Error Rate (SSEll,) (Niefien et al., 2000).
  The WEll, corre- spomls to the edit distance t)etween the produced translation and one t)redefined reference translation.
  To obtain the SSER the translations are classified by human experts into a small number of quality classes ranging from "l)ertbet" to "at)solutely wrong".
  In comparison to the WEll,, this criterion is more mean- ingflfl, but it is also very exl)ensive to measure.
  The translations are produced by the aligmnent template system mentioned in t
