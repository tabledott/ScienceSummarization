ng problem is reduced to a classification problem by using pairwise samples.
    In (Shen and Joshi, 2004), we have introduced a new perceptron-like ordinal regression algorithm for parse reranking.
    In that algorithm, pairwise samples are used for training and margins are defined as the distance between parses of different ranks.
    In addition, the uneven margin technique has been used for the purpose of adapting ordinal regression to reranking tasks.
    In this paper, we apply this algorithm to MT reranking, and we also introduce a new perceptron-like reranking algorithm for MT.
    In the field of machine learning, a class of tasks (called ranking or ordinal regression) are similar to the reranking tasks in NLP.
    One of the motivations of this paper is to apply ranking or ordinal regression algorithms to MT reranking.
    In the previous works on ranking or ordinal regression, the margin is defined as the distance between two consecutive ranks.
    Two large margin approaches have been used.
