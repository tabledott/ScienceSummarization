against a baseline NOUN de NOUN reordering module that never swaps the word order.
    Predictions of the NOUN de NOUN interchange model on phrases selected from a corpus unseen during the training process.
    Table 12 shows some randomly-chosen NOUN de NOUN phrases extracted from this test suite along with p(interchange1x), the probability assigned by the model to inversion.
    On the right are phrases such as saison d'hiver for which the model strongly predicted an inversion.
    On the left are phrases the model strongly prefers not to interchange, such as somme d'argent, abus de privilege and chambre de commerce.
    Perhaps most intriguing are those phrases that lie in the middle, such as faux d'inflation, which can translate either to inflation rate or rate of inflation.
  
  
    We began by introducing the building blocks of maximum entropy modeling&#8212;realvalued features and constraints built from these features.
    We then discussed the maximum entropy principle.
    This principle instructs u
