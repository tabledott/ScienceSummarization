s on manually choosing the appropriate analysis from among the multiple analyses rendered by AraMorph, a sophisticated rule based morphological analyzer by Buckwalter.3 Morphological analysis may be characterized as the process of segmenting a surface word form into its component derivational and inflectional morphemes.
    In a language such as Arabic, which exhibits both inflectional and derivational morphology, the morphological tags tend to be fine grained amounting to a large number of tags &#8212; AraMorph has 135 distinct morphological labels &#8212; in contrast to POS tags which are typically coarser grained.
    Using AraMorph, the choice of an appropriate morphological analysis entails clitic tokenization as well assignment of a POS tag.
    Such morphological labels are potentially useful for NLP applications, yet the necessary manual choice renders it an expensive process.
    On the other hand, Khoja (Khoja, 2001) reports preliminary results on a hybrid, statistical and rule based, POS tagger, AP
