tal algorithm.
    After the first iteration the solver uses its last state to efficiently search for solutions in the presence of new constraints.
    Some solvers allow the specification of an initial solution as a starting point, thus it is expected that significant improvements in terms of speed can be made by using the CLE algorithm to provide an initial solution.
    Our approach uses a generic algorithm to solve a complex task.
    Thus other applications may benefit from it.
    For instance, Germann et al. (2001) present an ILP formulation of the Machine Translation (MT) decoding task in order to conduct exact inference.
    However, their model suffers from the same type of exponential blow-up we observe when we add all our cycle constraints in advance.
    In fact, the constraints which cause the exponential explosion in their graphically formulation are of the same nature as our cycle constraints.
    We hope that the incremental approach will allow exact MT decoding for longer sentences.
