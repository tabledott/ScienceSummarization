l adaptation alone.
    Directly concatenating the phrase tables into one larger one isn&#8217;t strongly motivated; identical phrase pairs within the resulting table can lead to unpredictable behavior during decoding.
    Nakov (2008) handled identical phrase pairs by prioritizing the source tables, however in our experience identical entries in phrase tables are not very common when comparing across domains.
    Foster and Kuhn (2007) interpolated the in- and general-domain phrase tables together, assigning either linear or log-linear weights to the entries in the tables before combining overlapping entries; this is now standard practice.
    Lastly, Koehn and Schroeder (2007) reported improvements from using multiple decoding paths (Birch et al., 2007) to pass both tables to the Moses SMT decoder (Koehn et al., 2003), instead of directly combining the phrase tables to perform domain adaptation.
    In this work, we directly compare the approaches of (Foster and Kuhn, 2007) and (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007) o
