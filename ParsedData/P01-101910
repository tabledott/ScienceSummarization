se operations can be proved to form an algebra (E, opsubj, opcomp1, .
    .
    .) in a similar way to the unlabelled case shown in Theorem 1.
    A little more work is needed to prove that opl is closed on E. In particular, with respect to clause 2 of the above definition, it is necessary to prove that opl(a1, a2) = L or for all labels l', |holel,(opl(a1, a2)) |&lt; 1, but it is straightforward to see this is the case.
    These operations can be extended in a straightforward way to handle simple constituent coordination of the kind that is currently dealt with in the ERG (e.g., Kim sleeps and talks and Kim and Sandy sleep); such cases involve daughters with non-empty holes of the same label, and the semantic operation equates these holes in the mother SEMENT.
  
  
    The algebra with labelled holes is sufficient to deal with simple grammars, such as that in Sag and Wasow (1999), but to deal with scope, more is needed.
    It is now usual in constraint based grammars to allow for underspecification of quan
