e &#163;h.
    This automaton must also incorporate the factor &#952;0 of each word.
    This can be accomplished by intersecting the unweighted lattice with the automaton accepting (E/&#952;0)*.
    The resulting MBR automaton computes the total expected gain of each path.
    A path in this automaton that corresponds to the word sequence E' has cost: &#952;0jE'j+EwcAr &#952;w#w(E)p(wj&#163;) (expression within the curly brackets in Equation 6).
    Finally, we extract the best path from the resulting automaton4, giving the lattice MBR candidate translation according to the gain function (Equation 6).
  
  
    Our Lattice MBR formulation relies on the decomposition of the overall gain function as a sum of local gain functions (Equation 5).
    We here describe a linear approximation to the log(BLEU score) (Papineni et al., 2001) which allows such a decomposition.
    This will enable us to rewrite the log(BLEU) as a linear function of n-gram matches and the hypothesis length.
    Our strategy will be to use
