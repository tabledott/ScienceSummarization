our test conditions.
    &#8220;BROWN tuned&#8221; indicates that BROWN training data was used to tune the parameters (since the normal held-out section was being used for testing).
    For &#8220;WSJ tuned,&#8221; we tuned the parameters from section 24 of WSJ.
    Tuning on BROWN helps the parser, but not for the reranking parser. ment.
    The reranking parser used the WSJ-trained reranker model.
    The BROWN parsing model is naturally better than the WSJ model for this task, but combining the two training corpora results in a better model (as in Gildea (2001)).
    Adding small amounts of NANC further improves the models. test.
    The WSJ+NANC parser with the WSJ reranker comes close to the BROWN-trained reranking parser.
    The BROWN reranker provides only a small improvement over its WSJ counterpart, which is not statistically significant. parser with the WSJ reranker and the BROWN parser with the BROWN reranker.
    Complete match is how often the two reranking parsers returned the exact same parse.
