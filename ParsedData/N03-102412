oesn&#8217;t really matter if we output a few syntactically incorrect paraphrases, as long as we produce a large number of semantically correct ones.
    If we want to use the FSA for MT evaluation (for example, comparing a sentence to be evaluated with the possible paths in FSA), we would want all paths to be relatively good (which we will focus on in this paper), while in some other applications, we may only care about the quality of the best path (not addressed in this paper).
    Section 4.1 concentrates on evaluating the paraphrase pairs that can be extracted from the FSAs built by our system, while Section 4.2 is dedicated to evaluating the FSAs directly.
    By construction, different paths between any two nodes in the FSA representations that we derive are paraphrases (in the context in which the nodes occur).
    To evaluate our algorithm, we extract paraphrases from our FSAs and ask human judges to evaluate their correctness.
    We compare the paraphrases we collect with paraphrases that are deriva
