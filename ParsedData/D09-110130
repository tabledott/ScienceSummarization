ll three scorers.7 Similar trends can be observed for system mentions, where the F-scores between the two models are statistically indistinguishable across the board.
    While the insignificant performance difference is somewhat surprising given the improved expressiveness of entitymention models over mention-pair models, similar trends have been reported by Luo et al. (2004).
    The mention-ranking baseline.
    Our third baseline is the mention-ranking coreference model, trained using the ranker-learning algorithm in SVMlight.
    To identify discourse-new mentions, we employ two methods.
    In the first method, we adopt a pipeline architecture, where we train an SVM classifier for discourse-new detection independently of the mention ranker on the training set using the 26 features described in Section 3.3.
    We then apply the resulting classifier to each test text to filter discourse-new mentions prior to coreference resolution.
    Results of the mention ranker are shown in row 3 of Tables 3 and 4.
