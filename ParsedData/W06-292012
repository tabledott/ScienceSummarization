n ignored during the conversion of the much smaller Slovene data.
    For the Arabic data, sentences with missing annotation were filtered out during the conversion.
    The Turkish treebank posed a special problem because it analyzes each word as a sequence of one or more inflectional groups (IGs).
    Each IG consists of either a stem or a derivational suffix plus all the inflectional suffixes belonging to that stem/derivational suffix.
    The head of a whole word is not just another word but a specific IG of another word.16 One can easily map this representation to one in which the head of a word is a word but that treebank for us.
