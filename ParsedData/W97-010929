  We can argue that the insufficient disambiguation context, sparse data problem and empirically set iteration step in the disambiguating algorithm lead to an unreliable disambiguation.
    However, it is necessary to maintain the understanding that it is the PP attachment rather than the sense disambiguation that is our primary goal.
    Additionally, because the words of the input sentences for the PP attachment are to be assigned senses in the same manner, the sense disambiguation error is concealed.
    Alhouhg the disambiguation of the training set is computationally the most expensive part of the system, it is done only once.
    The disambiguation of unseen (testing) examples is done by the same algorithm which is modified to exclude the SDT iteration cycles.
    It is therefore reasonably fast even for real-life applications.
    The PP attachment using the decision tree is extremely efficient and reliable.
    We have induced the decision tree separately for each preposition in the training corpus, c
