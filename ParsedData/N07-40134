s representing the same relation.
    Also, as with all information extraction systems, it can extract multiple names for the same object.
    The RESOLVER system performs an unsupervised clustering of TEXTRUNNER's extractions to create sets of synonymous entities and relations.
    RESOLVER uses a novel, unsupervised probabilistic model to determine the probability that any pair of strings is co-referential, given the tuples that each string was extracted with.

    TEXTRUNNER builds an inverted index of the extracted tuples, and spreads it across a cluster of machines.
    This architecture supports fast, interactive, and powerful relational queries.
    Users may enter words in a relation or entity, and TEXTRUNNER quickly returns the entire set of extractions matching the query.
    For example, a query for &#8220;Newton&#8221; will return tuples like (Newton, invented, calculus).
    Users may opt to query for all tuples matching synonyms of the keyword input, and may al
