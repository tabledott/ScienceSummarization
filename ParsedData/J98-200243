ach data set, we extracted (verb, prep) and (noun, prep) doubles, and (verb, prep, noun2) and (nounl, prep, noun2) triples using tools we developed ourselves.
    We also extracted quadruples from the training data as before.
    We then applied 12 heuristic rules to further preprocess the data, which include (1) changing the inflected form of a word to its stem form, (2) replacing numerals with the word number, (3) replacing integers between 1,900 and 2,999 with the word year, (4) replacing co., ltd., etc. with the words company, limited, etc.11 After preprocessing there still remained some minor errors, which we did not remove further, due to the lack of a good method for doing so automatically.
    Table 12 shows the number of different types of data obtained by the above process.
    Experimental Procedure.
    We first compared the accuracy and coverage for each of the three disambiguation methods based on unsupervised learning: MDL, SA, and LA.
    11 The experimental results obtained here are better th
