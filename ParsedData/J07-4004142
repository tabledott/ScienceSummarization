 and we have answered the question of whether efficent estimation and parsing algorithms can be defined for models which use these derivations.
    We have also defined a new parsing algorithm for CCG which maximizes expected recall of predicate&#8211;argument dependencies.
    This algorithm, when combined with normal-form constraints, gives the highest parsing accuracy to date on CCGbank.
    We have also given competitive results on DepBank, outperforming a nonCCG parser (RASP), despite the considerable difficulties involved in evaluating on a gold standard which uses a different annotation scheme to the parser.
    There has perhaps been a perception in the NLP community that parsing with CCG is necessarily ineffficient because of CCG&#8217;s &#8220;spurious&#8221; ambiguity.
    We have demonstrated, using state-of-the-art statistical models, that both accurate and highly efficient parsing is practical with CCG.
    Linguistically motivated grammars can now be used for large-scale NLP applications.12
