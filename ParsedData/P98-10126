quot;John Perry&amp;quot; in the first.
    And it is this fact which actually helps VSM-Disambiguate decide that the two John Perrys in doc.36 and doc.38 are the same person.
  
  
    The vector space model used for disambiguating entities across documents is the standard vector space model used widely in information retrieval (Salton 89).
    In this model, each summary extracted by the SentenceExtractor module is stored as a vector of terms.
    The terms in the vector are in their morphological root form and are filtered for stop-words (words that have no information content like a, the, of, an, ...).
    If Si and S2 are the vectors for the two summaries extracted from documents D1 and D21 then their similarity is computed as: where tj is a term present in both Si and S2, W1j is the weight of the term t3 in S1 and w23 is the weight of ti in S2.
    The weight of a term tj in the vector St for a summary is given by: where t f is the frequency of the term t3 in the summary, N is the total number of docume
