  Note that if n partial fimetion satisties a description then so will any function above it.
  We let U(F) stm]d for the collection of upward closed subsets of F. Expressions are interpreted relative to an envirmnnent (since we have variables as cxpressions, wc need to consider environments which map eratables to a member of U(F)).
  Functimm get interpreted as continuous functions in tim space U(/;) -~ U(F), with the enviromncnt mapping fimetion variables to fimctions on U(P).
  Note that the ordering on U(F) is the inverse of set inclusion, since more functions atisfy the description of a more general featnre structure.
  Because of space limitations, we cannot go into the details of the interpretations function.
  [{onghly, the interpretation is as follows.
  We interpret he expression a as the set containing just the atom "a"; the expressiou 1 : e is interl)reted as tire set of fnnctions which map / to
