ric information about word senses and semantic relations so that it will be able to handle texts spanning more than a single domain.
    While having an extensive grammar and lexicon is essential for any system's domain independence, this increased flexibility also introduces degrees of ambiguity not frequently addressed by current NLP work.
    Typically, the system will have to choose from several senses for each word.
    For example, we found that TRUMP's base of nearly 10,000 root senses and 10,000 derivations provides an average of approximately four senses for each word of a sentence taken from the Wall Street Journal.
    The potential for combinatoric explosion resulting from such ambiguity makes it critical to resolve ambiguities quickly and reliably.
    It is unrealistic to assume that word sense discrimination can be left until parsing is complete, as suggested, for example, by Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler (1989) and Janssen (1990).
    No simple recipe can resolve the general problem of lexic
