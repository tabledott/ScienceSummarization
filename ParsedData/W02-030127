it the nonentity class by using POS information.
    In addition, we explored the new types of features, word cache and HMM states, to avoid the data sparseness problem.
    In the experiments, we have shown that the class splitting technique not only makes training feasible but also improves the accuracy.
    We have also shown that the proposed new features also improve the accuracy and the SVM system with the polynomial kernel function outperforms the ME-based system.
  
  
    We would like to thank Dr. Jin-Dong Kim for providing us easy-to-use preprocessed training data.
