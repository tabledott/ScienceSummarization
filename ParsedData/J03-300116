    In the U.S.
    Declaration of Independence, the occurs 84 times.
    We predict that the Declaration is about 84 &#215; 100/7 = 1,200 words long.
    In fact, the text contains about 1,500 words.
    Using the frequency of one word gives a first approximation.
    A better result can be obtained by using more data points.
    From the first megabyte of the German text found in the European Corpus Initiative Multilingual Corpus,5 we extracted frequencies for function words and other short, common words.
    We removed from the list words that were also common words in other languages.6 AltaVista provided, on its results pages, along with a page count for a query, the number of times that each query word was found on the Web.7 Table 2 shows the relative frequency of the words from our known corpus, the index frequencies that AltaVista gave (February 2000), and the
