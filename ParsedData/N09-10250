  11001 New Features for Statistical Machine Translation
  
    We use the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm of Crammer et al. to add a large number of new features to two machine translation systems: the Hiero hierarchical phrasebased translation system and our syntax-based translation system.
    On a large-scale Chinese- English translation task, we obtain statistically improvements of respectively.
    We analyze the impact of the new features and the performance of the learning algorithm.
  
  
    What linguistic features can improve statistical machine translation (MT)?
    This is a fundamental question for the discipline, particularly as it pertains to improving the best systems we have.
    Further: In this paper, we address these questions by experimenting with a large number of new features.
    We add more than 250 features to improve a syntaxbased MT system&#8212;already the highest-scoring single system in the NIST 2008 Chinese-English common-data track&#8212;by +1.1 BLEU.
    We also add more
