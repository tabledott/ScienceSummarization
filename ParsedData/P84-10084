operations are performed.
    They all become the same graph at the end.
    If graphs A and B contain the same attribute but have incompatible values for it, they cannot be unified.
    If A and B are compatible, then (Unify A B) contains every attribute that appears only in A or only in B with the value it has there.
    If some attribute appears both in A and B, then the value of that attribute in (Unify A B) is the unification of the two values.
    For example, = [agreement: [number: pa] Simple cases of grammatical concord, such as number, case and gender agreement between determiners and nouns in many languages, can be expressed straight-forwardly by stating that the values of these features must unify.
    Another useful operation on feature matrices is generalization.
    It is closely related to set intersection.
    The generalization of two simple matrices A and B consists of the attribute-value pairs that A and B have in common.
    If the values themselves are complex, we take the generalization
