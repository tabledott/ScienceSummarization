f a collection of discrete random variables representing binary relations and their arguments; we seek an optimal assignment to the variables in the presence of the constraints on the binary relations between variables and the relation types.
    The key insight to this solution comes from recent techniques developed for approximation algorithms (Chekuri et al., 2001).
    Following this work, we model inference as an optimization problem, and show how to cast it as a linear program.
    Using existing numerical packages, which are able to solve very large linear programming problems in a very short time1, inference can be done very quickly.
    Our approach could be contrasted with other approaches to sequential inference or to general Markov random field approaches (Lafferty et al., 2001; Taskar et al., 2002).
    The key difference is that in these approaches, the model is learned globally, under the constraints imposed by the domain.
    In our approach, predictors do not need to be learned in the context
