    We now deviate from the usual by claiming that while the K&amp;M model works very well, there is a technical problem with formulating the task in this way.
    We start by making our noisy channel notation a original: Many debugging features, including user-defined break points and variable-watching and message-watching windows, have been added. human: Many debugging features have been added.
    K&amp;M: Many debugging features, including user-defined points and variable-watching and message-watching windows, have been added. supervised: Many features, including user-defined break points and variable-watching and windows, have been added. super (+ extra rules, constraints): Many debugging features have been added. unsuper (+ constraints): Many debugging features, including user-defined break points and variable-watching and message-watching windows, have been added. semi-supervised (+ const
