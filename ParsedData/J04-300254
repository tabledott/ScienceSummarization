ce in the manually annotated subjective-element data, not based on performance in the test data.
    For example, the entry in the first row, first column (T, W = 10, 20) is the parameter pair giving the highest frequency in the top precision interval of WSJ-SE-M (frequency and precision in WSJ-SE-M, using the process of Figure 3).
    Thus, the relative precisions and frequencies of the parameter pairs are carried over from the training to the test data.
    This is quite a strong result, given that the PSEs in the training data are from manual annotations, while the PSEs in the test data are our automatically identified features.
    To assess the subjectivity of sentences with high-density PSEs, we extracted the 133 sentences in corpus OP2 that contain at least one high-density PSE and manually annotated them.
    We refer to these sentences as the system-identified sentences.
    We chose the density-parameter pair (T, W = 12,30), based on its precision and frequency in OP1.
