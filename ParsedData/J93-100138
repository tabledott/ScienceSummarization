    Briscoe and Carroll's contribution is very much in the spirit of the Inside&#8212;Outside algorithm, whereas Hindle and Rooth's contribution, for example, takes an approach that is much closer to the concerns of lexicography, and makes use of preferences involving words, rather than preferences that ignore words and focus exclusively on syntactic structures.
    Hindle and Rooth show how co-occurrence statistics can be used to improve the performance of the parser on sentences such as: ( ) wanted She placed the dress on the rack. put where lexical preferences are crucial to resolving the ambiguity of prepositional phrase attachment (Ford, Bresnan, and Kaplan 1982).
    Hindle and Rooth show that a parser can enforce these preferences by comparing the statistical association of the verbpreposition (want.. . on) with the association of the object-preposition (dress.
