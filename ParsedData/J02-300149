an the lattice-based system on the held-out test set, but not on the data used to set the weights in the EM-based system.
    We return to an analysis of which roles are hardest to classify in Section 9.1.
    Three of our features, position, gov, and path, attempt to capture the syntactic relation between the target word and the constituent to be labeled, and in particular to differentiate the subjects from objects of verbs.
    To compare these three features directly, experiments were performed using each feature alone in an otherwise identical sysLattice structures for comparing grammatical-function features. tem.
    Results are shown in Table 7.
    For the first set of experiments, corresponding to the first column of Table 7, no voice information was used, with the result that the remaining distributions formed the lattice of Figure 8a.
