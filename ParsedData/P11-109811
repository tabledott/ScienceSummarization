 that detonate and destroy belong in the same cluster representing a bombing.
    Vector-based approaches are often adopted to represent words as feature vectors and compute their distance with cosine similarity.
    Unfortunately, these approaches typically learn clusters of synonymous words that can miss detonate and destroy.
    Our goal is to instead capture world knowledge of cooccuring events.
    We thus adopt an assumption that closeness in the world is reflected by closeness in a text&#8217;s discourse.
    We hypothesize that two patterns are related if they occur near each other in a document more often than chance.
    Let g(wi, wj) be the distance between two events (1 if in the same sentence, 2 in neighboring, etc).
    Let %dist(wi, wj) be the distance-weighted frequency of where d is a document in the set of all documents D. The base 4 logarithm discounts neighboring sentences by 0.5 and within the same sentence scores 1.
    Using this definition of distance, pointwise mutual information meas
