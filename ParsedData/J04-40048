ach of the left- and right-modifying nonterminals are generated from the head outward.
    The modifying nonterminals L; and R; are generated conditioning on P and H, as well as a distance metric (based on what material intervenes between the currently generated modifying nonterminal and H) and an incremental subcategorization frame feature (a multiset containing the arguments of H that have yet to be generated on the side of H in which the currently generated nonterminal falls).
    Note that if the modifying nonterminals were generated completely independently, the model would be very impoverished, but in actuality, because it includes the distance and subcategorization frame features, the model captures a crucial bit of linguistic reality, namely, that words often have well-defined sets of complements and adjuncts, occurring with some well-defined distribution in the right-hand sides of a (context-free) rewriting system.
    The process proceeds recursively, treating each newly generated modifier as a pare
