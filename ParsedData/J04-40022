asal translations, the feature functions used, and the search algorithm.
    The evaluation of this approach is performed on three different tasks.
    For the German&#8211;English speech VERBMOBiL task, we analyze the effect of various system components.
    On the French&#8211;English Canadian HANSARDS task, the alignment template system obtains significantly better results than a single-word-based translation model.
    In the Chinese&#8211;English 2002 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) machine translation evaluation it yields statistically significantly better NIST scores than all competing research and commercial translation systems.
  
  
    Machine translation (MT) is a hard problem, because natural languages are highly complex, many words have various meanings and different possible translations, sentences might have various readings, and the relationships between linguistic entities are often vague.
    In addition, it is sometimes necessary to take world knowledge into account.
