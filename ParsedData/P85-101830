ial-match retrieval techniques designed for use in Prolog implementations [161.
  
  
    We have presented a general technique of restriction with many applications in the area of manipulating complexfeature-based grammar formalisms.
    As a particular example, we presented a complete, correct, terminating extension of Earley's algorithm that uses restriction to perform top-down filtering.
    Our implementation demonstrates the drastic elimination of chart edges that can be achieved by this technique.
    Finally, we described further uses for the technique&#8212;including parsing other grammar formalisms, including definite-clause grammars; extending other parsing algorithms, including LR methods and syntactic preference modeling algorithms; and efficient indexing.
    We feel that the restriction technique has great potential to make increasingly powerful grammar formalisms computationally feasible.
