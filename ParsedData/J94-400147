ly. e We analyzed sentences of considerable length, consisting of many bunsetsus (the average number of bunsetsus in a sentence was 14.3).
    There are many candidate heads for each bunsetsu in such a sentence, making the possibility for incorrect headdependent relations in the dependency structure of a sentence significant.
    Considering these conditions and comparing results using our method with those using the conventional method, the total success ratio for determining correct dependency structures for a complete sentence, 65%, can be considered to be fairly good.
    Although one-third of the dependency structures after this analysis process included some errors, their major structures, that is, their conjunctive structures and basic dependency structures, were detected correctly in most cases.
    This can be seen from the high scores in Table 4.
    It is possible to classify some of the causes of incorrect analyses arising from our method.
    Table 6 gives some examples of errors in recognizing C
