use PPM had been trained on only a small fraction of the amount of text needed for the word-based scheme.
    The same example was used by Ponte and Croft (1996), and the improved performance of the character-based method is evident even in this small example.
    Although the word Micronite does not occur in the Brown Corpus, it was correctly segmented using PPM.
    Likewise, inits was correctly split into in and its.
    PPM makes just two mistakes.
    First, a space was not inserted into Loews Corp because the single &amp;quot;word&amp;quot; requires only 54.3 bits to encode, whereas Loews Corp requires 55.0 bits.
    Second, an extra space was added to crocidolite because that reduced the number of bits required from 58.7 to 55.3.
    Our first series of experiments used part of Guo Jin's Mandarin Chinese PH corpus, containing one million words of newspaper stories from the Xinhua news agency of PR China written between January 1990 and March 1991.
    It is represented in the standard GB coding scheme.
