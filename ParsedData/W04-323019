segmented with HMMs or rulebased analyzers.
    Figure 3 illustrates the sentences which are incorrectly segmented by Uchimoto&#8217;s MEMMs.
    The correct paths are indicated by bold boxes.
    Uchimoto et al. concluded that these errors were caused by nonstandard entries in the lexicon.
    In Figure 3, &#8220;&#12525;&#12510; &#12531;&#12399;&#8221; (romanticist) and &#8220;&#12394;&#12356;&#24515;&#8221; (one&#8217;s heart) are unusual spellings and they are normally written as &#8220;&#12525;&#12510;&#12531;&#27966;&#8221; and &#8220;&#20869;&#24515;&#8221; respectively.
    However, we conjecture that these errors are caused by the influence of the length bias.
    To support our claim, these sentences are correctly segmented by CRFs, HMMs and rule-based analyzers using the same lexicon as (Uchimoto et al., 2001).
    By the length bias, short paths are preferred to long paths.
    Thus, single token &#8220;&#12525;&#12510;&#12531;&#12399;&#8221; or &#8220;&#12394;&#12356;&#24515;&#8221; is likely to
