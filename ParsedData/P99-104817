 coreference resolution algorithm.
    Incorrectly removing an anaphoric NP means that the coreference resolver would never have a chance to resolve it, on the other hand, non-anaphoric NPs that slip through can still be ruled as non-anaphoric by the coreference resolver.
    We first evaluated our system using only the syntactic heuristics, which produced only 43% recall, but 92% precision.
    Although the syntactic heuristics are a reliable way to identify existential definite NPs, they miss 57% of the true existentials.
  
  
    We expected the Si, EHP, and DO methods to increase coverage.
    First, we evaluated each method independently (on top of the syntactic heuristics).
    The results appear in rows 2-4 of Figure 7.
    Each method increased recall to between 61-69%, but decreased precision to 8487%.
    All of these methods produced a substantial gain in recall at some cost in precision.
    Next, we tried combining the methods to make sure that they were not identifying exactly the same set of e
