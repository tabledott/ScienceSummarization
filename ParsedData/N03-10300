  Sentence Level Discourse Parsing Using Syntactic And Lexical Information
  
    We introduce two probabilistic models that can be used to identify elementary discourse units and build sentence-level discourse parse trees.
    The models use syntactic and lexical features.
    A discourse parsing algorithm that implements these models derives discourse parse trees with an error reduction of 18.8% over a state-ofthe-art decision-based discourse parser.
    A set of empirical evaluations shows that our discourse parsing model is sophisticated enough to yield discourse trees at an accuracy level that matches near-human levels of performance.
  
  
    By exploiting information encoded in human-produced syntactic trees (Marcus et al., 1993), research on probabilistic models of syntax has driven the performance of syntactic parsers to about 90% accuracy (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000).
    The absence of semantic and discourse annotated corpora prevented similar developments in semantic/discourse parsing.
