  Automatic Identification Of Non-Compositional Multi-Word Expressions Using Latent Semantic Analysis
  
    Making use of latent semantic analysis, we explore the hypothesis that local linguistic context can serve to identify multi-word expressions that have noncompositional meanings.
    We propose that vector-similarity between distribution vectors associated with an MWE as a whole and those associated with its constitutent parts can serve as a good measure of the degree to which the MWE is compositional.
    We present experiments that show that low (cosine) similarity does, in fact, correlate with non-compositionality.
  
  
    Identifying non-compositional (or idiomatic) multi-word expressions (MWEs) is an important subtask for any computational system (Sag et al., 2002), and significant attention has been paid to practical methods for solving this problem in recent years (Lin, 1999; Baldwin et al., 2003; Villada Moir&#180;on and Tiedemann, 2006).
    While corpus-based techniques for identifying coll
