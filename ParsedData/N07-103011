 ACE corpus (Phase 2).
    This corpus is divided into three parts, each corresponding to a different genre: newspaper texts (NPAPER), newswire texts (NWIRE), and broadcasted news transcripts (BNEWS).
    Each of these is split into a train part and a devtest part.
    Progress during the development phase was determined by using crossvalidation on only the training set for the NPAPER (COREF-PAIRWISE), the anaphoricity-coreference cascade system (AC-CASCADE), and the oracle which performs perfect linkage (ORACLE-LINK).
    The first two systems make strictly local pairwise coreference decisions. section.
    No human-annotated linguistic information is used in the input.
    The corpus text was preprocessed with the OpenNLP Toolkit2 (i.e., a sentence detector, a tokenizer, a POS tagger, and a Named Entity Recognizer).
    In our experiments, we consider only the true ACE mentions.
    This is because our focus is on evaluating pairwise local approaches versus the global ILP approach rather than on building a
