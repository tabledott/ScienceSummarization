text, such as Roman letters, numerals, and special symbols.
    Note that hanzi that are not grouped into dictionary words (and are not identified as singlehanzi words), or into one of the other categories of words discussed in this paper, are left unattached and tagged as unknown words.
    Other strategies could readily An abstract example illustrating the segmentation algorithm.
    The transitive closure of the dictionary in (a) is composed with Id(input) (b) to form the WFST (c).
    The segmentation chosen is the best path through the WFST, shown in (d).
    (In this figure eps is c.) be implemented, though, such as a maximal-grouping strategy (as suggested by one reviewer of this paper); or a pairwise-grouping strategy, whereby long sequences of unattached hanzi are grouped into two-hanzi words (which may have some prosodic motivation).
    We have not to date explored these various options.
    Word frequencies are estimated by a re-estimation procedure that involves applying the segmentation algorith
