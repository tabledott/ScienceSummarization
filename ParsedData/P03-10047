    The Polynomial Kernel of degree d can be rewritten as
  
  
    In this section, we introduce two fast classification algorithms for the Polynomial Kernel of degree d. Before describing them, we give the baseline classifier (PKB): where 3 X &#180; cd(r) will be referred as a subset weight of the Polynomial Kernel of degree d. This function gives a prior weight to the subset s, where |s |= r. Example 1 Quadratic and Cubic Kernel Given sets X = {a, b, c, d} and Y = {a, b, d, e}, the Quadratic Kernel K2(X, Y ) and the Cubic Kernel K3(X, Y ) can be calculated in an implicit form as: K2(X,Y ) = (1 + |X n Y |)2 = (1 + 3)2 = 16, K3(X,Y ) = (1 + |X n Y |)3 = (1 + 3)3 = 64.
    Using Lemma 1, the subset weights of the Quadratic Kernel and the Cubic Kernel can be calculated as c2(0) = 1, c2(1) = 3, c2(2) = 2 and c3(0)=1, c3(1)=7, c3(2)=12, c3(3)=6.
    In addition, subsets Pr(X n Y ) (r = 0, 1, 2, 3) are given as follows: P0(X n Y ) = The complexity of PKB is O(|X |&#183; |SV |), since
