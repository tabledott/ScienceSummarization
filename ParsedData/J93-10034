ldt 1990) has not addressed the statistical reliability of the internal processing.
    They do, however, use good statistical methods to analyze the overall effectiveness of their approach.
    Even such well-accepted techniques as inverse document frequency weighting of terms in text retrieval (Salton and McGill 1983) is generally only justified on very sketchy grounds.
    The goal of this paper is to present a practical measure that is motivated by statistical considerations and that can be used in a number of settings.
    This measure works reasonably well with both large and small text samples and allows direct comparison of the significance of rare and common phenomena.
    This comparison is possible because the measure described in this paper has better asymptotic behavior than more traditional measures.
    In the following, some sections are composed largely of background material or mathematical details and can probably be skipped by the reader familiar with statistics or by the reader in a hurry
