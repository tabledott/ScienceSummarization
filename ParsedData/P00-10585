 the root of a modifier tree is added as a new daughter to any other node.
    (Note that as it stands sister-adjunction is completely unconstrained; it will be constrained by the probability model.)
    We introduce this operation simply so we can derive the flat structures found in the Penn Treebank.
    Following (Schabes and Shieber, 1994), multiple modifier trees can be sister-adjoined at a single site, but only one auxiliary tree may be adjoined at a single node.
    Figure 1 shows an example grammar and the derivation of the sentence &amp;quot;John should leave tomorrow.&amp;quot; The derivation tree encodes this process, with each arc corresponding to a composition operation.
    Arcs corresponding to substitution and adjunction are labeled with the Gorn address1 of the substitution or adjunction site.
    An arc corresponding to the sister-adjunction of a tree between the ith and i + 1th children of rl (allowing for two imaginary children beyond the leftmost and rightmost children) is labeled rl; i.
