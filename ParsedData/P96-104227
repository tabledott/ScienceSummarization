l, showing a significant reduction in model size.
    Our results suggest applying committee-based sample selection to other statistical NLP tasks which rely on estimating probabilistic parameters from an annotated corpus.
    Statistical methods for these tasks typically assign a probability estimate, or some other statistical score, to each alternative analysis (a word sense, a category label, a parse tree, etc.
    ), and then select the analysis with the highest score.
    The score is usually computed as a function of the estimates of several 'atomic' parameters, often binomials or multinomials, such as: &#8226; In word sense disambiguation (Hearst, 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1993): P(slf), where s is a specific sense of the ambiguous word in question w, and f is a feature of occurrences of w. Common features are words in the context of w or morphological attributes of it.
    &#8226; In prepositional-phrase (PP) attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1993): P(alf), where a is a possible attachment, such a
