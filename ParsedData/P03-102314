the twin-candidate model always chooses a candidate as the antecedent, even though all of the candidates are &#8220;low-qualified&#8221;, that is, unlikely to be coreferential to the non-pronoun under consideration.
    In fact, the twin-candidate model in itself can identify the qualification of a candidate.
    We can compare every candidate with a virtual &#8220;standard candidate&#8221;, C0.
    Only those better than C0 are deemed qualified and allowed to enter the &#8220;round robin&#8221;, whereas the losers are eliminated.
    As we have discussed in Section 3.5, the classifier on the pairs of a candidate and C0 is just a singlecandidate classifier.
    Thus, we can safely adopt the single-candidate classifier as our candidate filter.
    The candidate filtering algorithm during resolution is as follows:
  
  
    Our coreference resolution approach is evaluated on the standard MUC-6 (1995) and MUC-7 (1998) data set.
    For MUC-6, 30 &#8220;dry-run&#8221; documents annotated with coreference informat
