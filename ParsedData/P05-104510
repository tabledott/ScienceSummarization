al set of states that renders a state conditionally independent of all other states) consists of the two neighboring states and the observation sequence, all of which are observed.
    The conditional distribution at position i can then be computed simply as where the factor tables F in the clique chain are already conditioned on the observation sequence.
  
  
    We test the effectiveness of our technique on two established datasets: the CoNLL 2003 English named entity recognition dataset, and the CMU Seminar Announcements information extraction dataset.
    This dataset was created for the shared task of the Seventh Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL),4 which concerned named entity recognition.
    The English data is a collection of Reuters newswire articles annotated with four entity types: person (PER), location (LOC), organization (ORG), and miscellaneous (MISC).
    The data is separated into a training set, a development set (testa), and a test set (testb).
