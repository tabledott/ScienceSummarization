ons of word sense disambiguation, the lack of resources like WordNet, and the lack of general knowledge in a form suitable for automatic inference tasks.To introduce an element of robustness into our ap proach, we use the models as produced by the modelbuilders to measure the ?distance?
			from an entail ment.
			The intuition behind it is as follows.
			If His entailed by T, the model for T+H is not informa tive compared to the one for T, and hence does not introduce new entities.
			Put differently, the domain size for T+H would equal the domain size of T. Incontrast, if T does not entail H, H normally intro duce some new information (except when it contains negated information), and this will be reflected in the domain size of T+H, which then is larger than the domain size of T. It turns out that this differencebetween the domain sizes is a useful way of measur ing the likelihood of entailment.
			Large differences are mostly not entailments, small differences mostly are.
			Consider the following example:
