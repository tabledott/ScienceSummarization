M1, as used in BBN's IdentiFinder, which models the original process that generates the NE-class annotated words from the original NE tags.
    Another difference is that our model assumes mutual information independence (2-2) while traditional HMM assumes conditional probability independence (I-1).
    Assumption (2-2) is much looser than assumption (I-1) because assumption (I-1) has the same effect with the sum of assumptions (2-2) and (I-3)2.
    In this way, our model can apply more context information to determine the tag of current token.
    From equation (2-4), we can see that: We will not discuss both the first and second items further in this paper.
    This paper will focus on difference between our tagger and other traditional HMM-based taggers, as used in BBN's IdentiFinder.
    Ideally, it can be estimated by using the forward-backward algorithm [Rabiner89] recursively for the 1st-order [Rabiner89] or 2nd -order HMMs [Watson+92].
    However, an alternative back-off modeling approach is applied
