or SSN-Freq 200, and 2 minutes per sentence for SSN-Freq 20 (on a 502 MHz Sun Blade computer, average 22.5 words per sentence).
    But by reducing the number of alternatives considered in the search for the most probable parse, we can greatly increase parsing speed without much loss in accuracy.
    With the SSN-Freq 200 model, accuracy slightly better than (Collins, 1999) can be achieved at 2.7 seconds per sentence, and accuracy slightly better than (Ratnaparkhi, 1999) can be achieved at 0.5 seconds per sentence (Henderson, 2003) (on validation sentences at most 100 words long, average 23.3 words per sentence).
  
  
    To investigate the role which induced history representations are playing in this parser, we trained a number of and F-measure on the validation set for different versions of the SSN-Freq 200 model. additional SSNs and tested them on the validation set.6 The middle panel of table 2 shows the performance when some of the induced history representations are replaced with the label of their as
