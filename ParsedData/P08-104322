t our main results on this split.
    To facilitate the comparison of our results to those reported by (Cohen and Smith, 2007) we use their data set in which 177 empty and &#8220;malformed&#8221;7 were removed.
    The first 3770 trees of the resulting set then were used for training, and the last 418 are used testing.
    (we ignored the 419 trees in their development set.)
    Morphological Analyzer Ideally, we would use an of-the-shelf morphological analyzer for mapping each input token to its possible analyses.
    Such resources exist for Hebrew (Itai et al., 2006), but unfortunately use a tagging scheme which is incompatible with the one of the Hebrew Treebank.s For this reason, we use a data-driven morphological analyzer derived from the training data similar to (Cohen and Smith, 2007).
    We construct a mapping from all the space-delimited tokens seen in the training sentences to their corresponding analyses.
    Lexicon and OOV Handling Our data-driven morphological-analyzer proposes analyses for un
