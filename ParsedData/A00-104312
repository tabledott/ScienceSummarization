    Finally, we The goal of sentence reduction is to &amp;quot;reduce without major loss&amp;quot;; that is, we want to remove as many extraneous phrases as possible from an extracted sentence so that it can be concise, but without detracting from the main idea the sentence conveys.
    Ideally, we want to remove a phrase from an extracted sentence only if it is irrelevant to the main topic.

    (1) The corpus.
    One of the key features of the system is that it uses a corpus consisting of original sentences and their corresponding reduced forms written by humans for training and testing purpose.
    This corpus was created using an automatic program we have developed to automatically analyze human-written abstracts.
    The program, called
