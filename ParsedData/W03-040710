    There are various ways to select the labelled examples for each tagger.
    A typical approach is to select those examples assigned a high score by the relevant classifier, under the assumption that these examples will be the most reliable.
    A score-based selection method is difficult to apply in our experiments, however, since TNT does not provide scores for tagged sentences.
    We therefore tried two alternative selection methods.
    The first is to simply add all of the cache labelled by one tagger to the training data of the other.
    We refer to this method as naive co-training.
    The second, more sophisticated, method is to select that subset of the labelled cache which maximises the agreement of the two taggers on unlabelled data.
    We call this method agreement-based cotraining.
    For a large cache the number ofpossible subsets makes exhaustive search intractable, and so we randomly sample the subsets.
    The pseudo-code for the agreement-based selection method is given in F
