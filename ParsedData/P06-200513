ran sformations through the normalization pair ( , ) with the mapping probability P s &#65533; k &#65533; e~ a k lowings show the scenarios in which the three transformations occur.
    The statistics in our training corpus shows that by selecting appropriate phrase segmentation, the position re-ordering at the phrase level occurs rarely.
    It is not surprising since most of the English words or phrases in normal English text are replaced with lingoes in SMS messages without position change to make SMS text short and concise and to retain the meaning.
    Thus we need to consider only monotone alignment at phrase level, i.e., k , as in equation (4).
    In addition, = &#65533; ak the word-level reordering within phrase is learned during training.
    Now we can further derive equation (4) as follows: The mapping probability P(s&#65533;k  |e&#65533;k) is estimated via relative frequencies as follows: Here, N(s&#65533;k, e&#65533;k) denotes the frequency of the normalization pair ( s &#65533; k , e &#65533; k
