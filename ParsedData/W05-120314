hree baselines: (1) A random baseline created by randomly choosing a true or false value for each text pair; (2) A lexical matching baseline, which only counts the number of matching words between the two text segments, while still applying the weighting and normalization factors from equation 7; and (3) A vectorial similarity baseline, using a cosine similarity measure as traditionally used in information retrieval, with tf.idf term weighting.
    For comparison, we also evaluated the corpus-based similarity obtained through LSA; however, the results obtained were below the lexical matching baseline and are not reported here.
    For paraphrase identification, we use the bidirectional similarity measure, and determine the similarity with respect to each of the two text segments in turn, and then combine them into a bidirectional similarity metric.
    For entailment identification, since this is a directional relation, we only measure the semantic similarity with respect to the hypothesis (the text that is e
