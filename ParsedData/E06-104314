 1999; Dagan et al., 1994).
    Moreover, the asymmetry is not an issue here since we are concerned with the relative distance of several posterior distributions from the same prior.
    VNICs are hypothesized to be, in most cases, both lexically and syntactically more fixed than literal verb+noun combinations (see Section 2).
    We thus propose a new measure of idiomaticity to be a measure of the overall fixedness of a given pair.
    We define as: where weights the relative contribution of the measures in predicting idiomaticity.
  
  
    To evaluate our proposed fixedness measures, we determine their appropriateness as indicators of idiomaticity.
    We pose a classification task in which idiomatic verb&#8211;noun pairs are distinguished from literal ones.
    We use each measure to assign scores to the experimental pairs (see Section 4.2 below).
    We then classify the pairs by setting a threshold, here the median score, where all expressions with scores higher than the threshold are labeled as idiomat
