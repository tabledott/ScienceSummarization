pus, e.g., (Chouelca, 1988) and (Smadja, 1993).
    They do not, however, make a distinction between compositional and noncompositional collocations.
    Mutual information has often been used to separate systematic associations from accidental ones.
    It was also used to compute the distributional similarity between words (Hindle, 1990; Lin, 1998).
    A method to determine the compositionality of verb-object pairs is proposed in (Tapanainen et al., 1998).
    The basic idea in there is that &amp;quot;if an object appears only with one verb (of few verbs) in a large corpus we expect that it has an idiomatic nature&amp;quot; (Tapanainen et al., 1998, p.1290).
    For each object noun o, (Tapanainen et al., 1998) computes the distributed frequency DF(o) and rank the non-compositionality of o according to this value.
    Using the notation introduced in Section 3, DF(o) is computed as follows: where {vi, V2, vn} are verbs in the corpus that took o as the object and where a and b are constants.
