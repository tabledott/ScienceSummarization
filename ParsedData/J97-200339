o show by induction on I wl that the subsets constructed by the algorithm are the sets 62 (i2, W E E*, such that: Notice that the size of a subset never exceeds I Qi I: card(62(i2, w)) &lt; I Qi.
    A state q belongs at most to one pair of a subset, since for all paths reaching q, only the minimum of the residual outputs is kept.
    Notice also that, by definition of mm, in any subset there exists at least one state q with a residual output c(q, w) equal to 0.
    A string w is accepted by Ti iff there exists q E F1 such that q E 61(Ii,w).
    Using equations 15, it is accepted if 62(i2, w) contains a pair (q,c(q,w)) with q E Fi.
    This is exactly the definition of the final states F2 (line 7).
    So 7-1 and T2 accept the same set of strings.
    Let w E E* be a string accepted by ri and T2.
    The definition of p2 in the algorithm of figure 10, line 9, gives: The power series determinization algorithm is equivalent to the usual determinization of automata when the initial weight, the final weights, and
