ber of terms assigned on average per document is 5.04 and 3.05 without and with the tag feature respectively.
    The actual number of terms assigned per document is 100 to 0 (for three documents) without the tag feature, and 46 to 0 (for four documents) with the tag feature.
    The median is 30 and 12 respectively.
  
  
    In this paper I have shown how keyword extraction from abstracts can be achieved by using simple statistical measures as well as syntactic information from the documents, as input to a machine learning algorithm.
    If first considering the term selecdocument; the number of correct (Corr.) terms in total and mean per document; precision; recall; and Fscore.
    The highest value is shown in bold.
    The total number of manually assigned terms present in the abstracts is 3 816, and the mean is 7.63 terms per document. tion approaches, extracting NP-chunks gives a better precision, while extracting all words or sequences of words matching any of a set of POS tag patterns gives a higher
