t c-object, which subsumes roughly half the knowledge base, has a low specificity value (1).
    In contrast, the concept noun_hammer 1, which subsumes only a single entity, has a high specificity value (10).
    Concept strength is inversely proportional to concept size because a preference for a very general (large) concept often indicates that either there is no strong expectation at all or there is a gap in the system's knowledge.
    In either case, a concept that subsumes only a few senses is stronger information than a concept that subsumes more.
    The preference score for a complex concept, formed by combining simpler concepts with the connectives AND, OR, and NOT, is a function of the number of senses subsumed by both, either, or neither concept, respectively.
    Similarly, the score for a cluster is the specificity of that cluster (as defined in Section 3.4).
    (If a sense belongs to more than one active cluster, then only the most specific one is considered.)
