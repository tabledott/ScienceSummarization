dencies is not at all straightforward.
  
  
    88,962 (spelling,context) pairs were extracted as training data.
    1,000 of these were picked at random, and labeled by hand to produce a test set.
    We chose one of four labels for each example: location, person, organization, or noise where the noise category was used for items that were outside the three categories.
    The numbers falling into the location, person, organization categories were 186, 289 and 402 respectively.
    123 examples fell into the noise category.
    Of these cases, 38 were temporal expressions (either a day of the week or month of the year).
    We excluded these from the evaluation as they can be easily identified with a list of days/months.
    This left 962 examples, of which 85 were noise.
    Taking /V, to be the number of examples an algorithm classified correctly (where all gold standard items labeled noise were counted as being incorrect), we calculated two measures of accuracy: See Tab.
