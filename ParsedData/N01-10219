tions compatible with the prefix seen so far.
    By the correspondence between derivations and Earley paths, one would need only to compute the sum of all paths that are constrained by the observed prefix.
    But this can be done in the course of parsing by storing the current prefix probability in each state.
    Then, when a new state is added by some parser operation, the contribution from each antecedent state &#8211; each previous state linked by some parser operation &#8211; is summed in the new state.
    Knowing the prefix probability at each state and then summing for all parser operations that result in the same new state efficiently counts all possible derivations.
    Predicting a rule corresponds to multiplying by that rule&#8217;s probability.
    Scanning does not alter any probabilities.
    Completion, though, requires knowing y, the inside probability, which records how probable was the inner structure of some recognized phrasal node.
    When a state is completed, a bottom-up confirmation
