form classes of unlabeled observations that minimize their respective distance measures between class members.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    First, we present introductions to Ward's and McQuitty's methods (Section 2) and the EM algorithm (Section 3).
    We discuss the thirteen words (Section 4) and the three feature sets (Section 5) used in our experiments.
    We present our experimental results (Section 6) and close with a discussion of related work (Section 7).
  
  
    In general, clustering methods rely on the assumption that classes occupy distinct regions in the feature space.
    The distance between two points in a multi&#8212;dimensional space can be measured using any of a wide variety of metrics (see, e.g.
    (Devijver and Kittler, 1982)).
    Observations are grouped in the manner that minimizes the distance between the members of each class.
    Ward's and McQuitty's method are agglomerative clustering algorithms that differ primarily in how they compute the distanc
