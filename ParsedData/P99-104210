nalizing incorrect answers would help guide development in that regard.
    While we were initially concerned that adapting the system to multiple-choice questions would endanger the goal of real-world applicability, we have experimented with minor changes to handle the multiple choice format.
    Initial experiments indicate that we can use essentially the same system architecture for both short-answer and multiple choice tests.
  
  
    The process of taking short-answer reading comprehension tests can be broken down into the following subtasks: A crucial component of all three of these subtasks is the representation of information in text.
    Because our goal in designing our system was to explore the difficulty of various reading comprehension exams and to measure baseline performance, we tried to keep this initial implementation as simple as possible.
    Our system represents the information content of a sentence (both question and text sentences) as the set of words in the sentence.
    The word sets
