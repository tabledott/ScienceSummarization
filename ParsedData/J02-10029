count is scaled between 0 and 1 by dividing by the number of measurements taken.
    An algorithm that assigns all boundaries correctly receives a score of 0.
    Beeferman, Berger, and Lafferty (1999) state as part of An illustration of how the Pk metric handles false negatives.
    The arrowed lines indicate the two poles of the probe as it moves from left to right; the boxes indicate sentences or other units of subdivision; and the width of the window (k) is four, meaning four potential boundaries fall between the two ends of the probe.
    Solid lines indicate no penalty is assigned; dashed lines indicate a penalty is assigned.
    Total penalty is always k for false negatives. the justification for this metric that, to discourage &#8220;cheating&#8221; of the metric, degenerate algorithms&#8212;those that place boundaries at every position, or place no boundaries at all&#8212;are assigned (approximately) the same score.
    Additionally, the authors define a false negative (also referred to as a miss) as
