le, and that the domain relation Part-of can be expressed with the grammatical possessive, e.g., the car's engine.
    Given this dictionary, the structure-mapping algorithm iteratively replaces semantic structures by linguistic ones, until the entire semantic net has been recoded into a linguistic structure.
    There may be several ways of recoding a semantic representation into a linguistic one, which means structure-mapping systems have a choice between using the first acceptable reduction they find, or doing a search for a reduction that maximizes some optimality criterion (e.g., fewest number of words).
    The papers I read were not very clear on this issue, but I believe that while most of the systems surveyed use the first acceptable reduction found, FUF in some cases searches for an optimal reduction. choice from surface realization The consensus architecture clearly separates lexical choice of content words (done during sentence planning) from syntactic processing (performed during surface generati
