 used as training examples of category (not Negative).
    Approach III consists instead in viewing Positive, Negative, and Objective as three categories with equal status, and in learning a ternary classifier that classifies each term into exactly one among the three categories.
    There are several differences among these three approaches.
    A first difference, of a conceptual nature, is that only Approaches I and III view Objective as a category, or concept, in its own right, while Approach II views objectivity as a nonexistent entity, i.e. as the &#8220;absence of subjectivity&#8221; (in fact, in Approach II the training examples of Objective are only used as training examples of the complements of Positive and Negative).
    A second difference is that Approaches I and II are based on standard binary classification technology, while Approach III requires &#8220;multiclass&#8221; (i.e.
    1-of-m) classification.
    As a consequence, while for the former we use well-known learners for binary classific
