  Domain Adaptation With Structural Correspondence Learning
  
    Discriminative learning methods are widely used in natural language processing.
    These methods work best when their training and test data are drawn from the same distribution.
    For many NLP tasks, however, we are confronted with new domains in which labeled data is scarce or non-existent.
    In such cases, we seek to adapt existing models from a resourcerich source domain to a resource-poor domain.
    We introduce learning automatically induce correspondences among features from different domains.
    We test our technique on part of speech tagging and show performance gains for varying amounts of source and target training data, as well as improvements in target domain parsing accuracy using our improved tagger.
  
  
    Discriminative learning methods are ubiquitous in natural language processing.
    Discriminative taggers and chunkers have been the state-of-the-art for more than a decade (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Sha and Pereira, 2003
