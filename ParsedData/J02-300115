    Thus, the focus of the project was on completeness of examples for lexicographic needs, rather than on statistically representative data.
    Sentences from each subcorpus were then annotated by hand, marking boundaries of each frame element expressed in the sentence and assigning tags for the annotated constituent&#8217;s frame semantic role, syntactic category (e.g., noun phrase or prepositional phrase), and grammatical function in relation to the target word (e.g., object or complement of a verb).
    In the final phase of the process, the annotated sentences for each target word were checked for consistency.
    In addition to the tags just mentioned, the annotations include certain other information, which we do not make use of in this work, such as word sense tags for some target words and tags indicating metaphoric usages.
    Tests of interannotator agreement were performed for data from a small number of predicates before the final consistency check.
