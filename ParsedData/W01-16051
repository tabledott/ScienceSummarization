    In this paper, we recount our experience in developing a large resource with discourse-level annotation for NLP research.
    Our main goal in undertaking this effort was to create a reference corpus for community-wide use.
    Two essential considerations from the outset were that the corpus needed to be consistently annotated, and that it would be made publicly available through the Linguistic Data Consortium for a nominal fee to cover distribution costs.
    The paper describes the challenges we faced in building a corpus of this level of complexity and scope &#8211; including selection of theoretical approach, annotation methodology, training, and quality assurance.
