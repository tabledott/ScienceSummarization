uns in premoclification because it works directly off the parsed version of the Treebank, without looking at part-of-speech tags. often involve discourse-new descriptions.
    We developed the following heuristic for handling copula constructions.
    If a description occurs in subject position, the system looks at the VP.
    If the head of the VP is the verb to be, to seem, or to become, and the complement of the verb is not an adjectival phrase, the system classifies the description as discourse-new.
    Two examples correctly handled by this heuristic are shown in (26); the syntactic representation of these cases in the Penn Treebank I is shown in (27).
    If the complement of the verb is an adjective, the subject is typically interpreted referentially and should not be considered discourse-new on the basis of its complement (e.g., The president of the US is tall).
    Adjectival complements are represented as follows in the Treebank: The first appearance of these definite descriptions in the text is usu
