c module generates a sequence E of entities.
    E is in principle infinite, though during inference only a finite number are ever instantiated.
    A discourse module generates a vector Z which assigns an entity index ZZ to each mention position i.
    Finally, a mention generation module independently renders the sequence of mentions (M) from their underlying entities.
    The syntactic position and structure of mentions are treated as observed, including the mention forms (pronominal, etc.).
    We use X to refer to this ungenenerated information.
    Our model decomposes as follows: We detail each of these components in subsequent sections.
    The semantic module is responsible for generating a sequence of entities.
    Each entity E is generated independently and consists of a type indicator T, as well as a collection {Lr}rE7Z of word lists for each property.
    These elements are generated as follows: Draw entity type T &#8212; 0 For each mention property r E R, Fetch {(fr, Br)} for TT Draw word list
