    On average, about statistical methods in word sense disambiguation in the context of machine translation.
    However, they only looked at assigning at most two senses to a word, and their method only asked a single question about a single word of context.
    Li and Li (2002) investigated a bilingual bootstrapping technique, which differs from the method we implemented here.
    Their method also does not require a parallel corpus.
    The research of (Chugur et al., 2002) dealt with sense distinctions across multiple languages.
    Ide et al. (2002) investigated word sense distinctions using parallel corpora.
    Resnik and Yarowsky (2000) considered word sense disambiguation using multiple languages.
    Our present work can be similarly extended beyond bilingual corpora to multilingual corpora.
    The research most similar to ours is the work of Diab and Resnik (2002).
    However, they used machine translated parall
