bracketed NPs in the Penn Treebank, we now describe our initial experiments on how this additional level of annotation can be exploited.
    The obvious first task to consider is noun phrase bracketing itself.
    We implement a similar system to Lauer (1995), described in Section 3, and report on results from our own data and Lauer&#8217;s original set.
    First, we extracted three word noun sequences from all the ambiguous NPs.
    If the last three children are nouns, then they became an example in our data set.
    If there is a NML node containing the first two nouns then it is left-branching, otherwise it is right-branching.
    Because we are only looking at the right-most part of the NP, we know that we are not extracting any nonsensical items.
    We also remove all items where the nouns are all part of a named entity to eliminate flat structure cases.
    Statistics about the new data set and Lauer&#8217;s data set are given in Table 4.
    As can be seen, the Penn Treebank based corpus is signific
