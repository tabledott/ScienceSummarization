			Starting with all features, again using 10-fold cross-validation forthe separated tuning-evaluation condition sep-tuneeval, one additional feature group was removed un til none remained.
			The feature groups are listed intable 8.
			Figure 2 on the next page shows the accuracy at each step of the cumulative subtraction process.
			While some feature groups, e.g. syntactic, ap peared less important, the removal order mattered;e.g. if syntactic features were removed first, accuracy decreased.
