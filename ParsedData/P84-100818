    It is obvious that the desired effect can be obtained in any feature system that uses the fewest features to mark 1st person, some additional feature for 2nd person, and yet another for 3rd person.
    Because generalization of 1st and 2nd, for example, yields only the features that two have in common, the one with fewest features wins.
    Any such solution can probably be implemented easily in the framework outlined above.
    However, this proposal has one very counterintuitive aspect: markedness hierarchy is the reverse of what traditionally has been assumed.
    Designating something as 3rd person requires the greatest number of feature specifications.
    In the Sag et al. system, 3rd person is the most highly marked member and 1st person the least marked member of the trio.
    Traditionally, 3rd person has been regarded as the unmarked case.
    In our system, there is a rather simple solution under which the value of person feature in coordinate NPs is derived by generalization, just as Sag it et
