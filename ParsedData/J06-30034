 attributional and relational similarity.
    In analogies such as mason:stone::carpenter:wood, it seems that relational similarity can be reduced to attributional similarity, since mason and carpenter are attributionally similar, as are stone and wood.
    In general, this reduction fails.
    Consider the analogy traffic:street::water:riverbed.
    Traffic and water are not attributionally similar.
    Street and riverbed are only moderately attributionally similar.
    Many algorithms have been proposed for measuring the attributional similarity between two words (Lesk 1969; Resnik 1995; Landauer and Dumais 1997; Jiang and Conrath 1997; Lin 1998b; Turney 2001; Budanitsky and Hirst 2001; Banerjee and Pedersen 2003).
    Measures of attributional similarity have been studied extensively, due to their applications in problems such as recognizing synonyms (Landauer and Dumais 1997), information retrieval (Deerwester et al. 1990), determining semantic orientation (Turney 2002), grading student essays (Rehder et
