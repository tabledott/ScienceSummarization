    Concordance lines.
    To decide whether a candidate term is indeed a term, and to identify multiword terms that are missing from the candidate list, one must view relevant lines of the document.
    For this purpose we present a concordance line for each occurrence of a term (a text line centered around the term).
    If, however, a term, ti, (like 'point') is contained in a longer term, t2, (like 'insertion point' or 'decimal point') then occurrences of t2 are not displayed for ti.
    This way, the occurrences of a general term (or a head word) are classified into disjoint sets corresponding to more specific terms, leaving only unclassified occurrences under the general term.
    In the case of 'point', for example, five specific terms are identified that account for 61 occurrences of 'point', and accordingly, for 61 concordance lines.
    Only 20 concordance lines are displayed for the wo
