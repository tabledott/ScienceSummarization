greement, by reannotating the first section, and by comparing against the sub-NP structure in DepBank (King et al., 2003).
    We also give an analysis of our extended Treebank, quantifying how much structure we have added, and how it is distributed across NPs.
    Finally, we test the utility of the extended Treebank for training statistical models on two tasks: NP bracketing (Lauer, 1995; Nakov and Hearst, 2005) and full parsing (Collins, 1999).
    This new resource will allow any system or annotated corpus developed from the Penn Treebank, to represent noun phrase structure more accurately.
  
  
    Many approaches to identifying base noun phrases have been explored as part of chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), but determining sub-NP structure is rarely addressed.
    We could use multi-word expressions (MWEs) to identify some structure.
    For example, knowing stock market is a MWE may help bracket stock market prices correctly, and Named Entities (NEs) can be used the same way.
    However, this onl
