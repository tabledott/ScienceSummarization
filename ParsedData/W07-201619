			3.3 Discussion.
			Given that only two systems participated in the task, it is difficult to form any strong conclusions.
			It should be noted that since there was no additional VerbNet role data to be used by the Open system, the performance of that on PropBank arguments as well as VerbNet roles is exactly identical.
			It can be seenthat there is almost no difference between the perfor mance of the Open and Closed systems for tagging PropBank arguments.
			The reason for this is the factthat all the instances of the lemma under consider ation was selected from the Propbank corpus, and probably the number of training instances for each lemma as well as the fact that the predicate is such an important feature combine to make the difference negligible.
			We also realized that more than half of the test instances were contributed
