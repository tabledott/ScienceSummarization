two different parts of the recognition problem.
    In a second series of experiments we used a &amp;quot;cascaded&amp;quot; classifier.
    This classifier has two stages (cascades).
    The first cascade is similar to the classifier described in the first experiment.
    For the second cascade we added the classifications of the first cascade as extra features.
    The extra features consisted of the left and the right context of the classification tags.
    The focus chunk tag (the classification of the current word) accounts for the correct classification in about 95% of the cases.
    The MBL algorithm assigns a large weight to this input feature and this makes it harder for the other features to contribute to a good result.
    To avoid this we have refrained from using this tag.
    Our goal was to find out the optimal number of extra classification tags in the input.
    We performed 5-fold cross-validation experiments with all combinations of left and right classification tag contexts in the range 0
