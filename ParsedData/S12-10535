    The datasets are released in the XML format shown in Figure 1.
    The dataset was created following the crowdsourcing methodology proposed in (Negri et al., 2011), which consists of the following steps: only the pairs where the difference between the number of words in T1 and T2 (length diff) was below a fixed threshold (10 words) were retained.1 The final result is a monolingual English dataset annotated with multi-directional entailment judgments, which are well distributed over length diff values ranging from 0 to 9; To ensure the good quality of the datasets, all the collected pairs were manually checked and corrected when necessary.
    Only pairs with agreement between two expert annotators were retained.
    The final result is a multilingual parallel entailment corpus, where T1s are in 5 different languages (i.e.
    English, Spanish, German, Italian, and French), and T2s are in English.
    It&#8217;s worth mentioning that the monolingua
