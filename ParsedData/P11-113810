titles Ti that mi may refer to.
    Considering only a small subset of Wikipedia titles as potential disambiguations is crucial for tractability (we detail which titles are selected below).
    In the third step, the ranker outputs the most appropriate non-null disambiguation ti for each mention mi.
    In the final step, the linker decides whether the top-ranked disambiguation is correct.
    The disambiguation (mi, ti) may be incorrect for several reasons: (1) mention mi does not have a corresponding Wikipedia page, (2) mi does have a corresponding Wikipedia page, but it was not included in Ti, or (3) the ranker erroneously chose an incorrect disambiguation over the correct one.
    In the below sections, we describe each step of the GLOW algorithm, and the local and global features utilized, in detail.
    Because we desire a system that can process documents at scale, each step requires trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
