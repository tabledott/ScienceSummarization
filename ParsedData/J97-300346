he proposed technique can be seen in the cascading application of the different sets of guessing rules and in far superior training data.
    We use for training a pre-existing general-purpose (as opposed to corpus-tuned) lexicon.
    This has three advantages: &#8226; the size of the training lexicon is large and does not depend on the size or even the existence of the annotated corpus.
    This allows for the induction of more rules than from a lexicon derived from an annotated corpus.
    For instance, the ending guesser of Xerox includes 536 rules whereas our Ending* guesser includes 2,196 guessing rules; &#8226; the information listed in a general-purpose lexicon can be considered to be of better quality than that derived from an annotated corpus, since it lists all possible readings for a word rather than only those that happen to occur in the corpus.
    We also believe that general-purpose lexicons contain less erroneous information than those derived from annotated corpora; &#8226; the amount of work
