e Czech, En glish and German development set in relation to the rearrangement threshold.
			The curves for all languages are a bit volatile.
			The English curve is rather flat.
			It increases a bit until about 0.3and remains relative stable before it slightly decreases.
			The labeled attachment score for Ger man and Czech increases until 0.3 as well and thenboth scores start to decrease.
			For English a thresh old between 0.3 and about 2.0 would work well.
			For German and Czech, a threshold of about 0.3is the best choice.
			We selected for all three lan guages a threshold of 0.3.

			We have developed a very fast parser with ex cellent attachment scores.
			For the languages of the 2009 CoNLL Shared Task, the parser could reach higher accuracy scores on average than the top performing systems.
