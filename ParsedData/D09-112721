ans on stack is contiguous, and (b) cR(st, wi), i.e. whether the stack top is contiguous with the current word wi.
    According to discussions in Section 3, when (a) is contiguous and (b) is not, it is a clear signal for reduce (to combine the top two elements on the stack) rather than shift, and is strongly supported by the data (first line: 1209 reduces vs. 172 shifts); and while when (b) is contiguous and (a) is not, it should suggest shift (combining st and wi before st&#8722;1 and st are combined) rather than reduce, and is mildly supported by the data (second line: 1432 shifts vs. 805 reduces).
    When (a) and (b) are both contiguous or both discontiguous, it should be considered a neutral signal, and is also consistent with the data (next two lines).
    So to conclude, this bilingual hypothesis is empirically justified.
    On the other hand, we would like to note that these correlations are done with automatic word alignments (in our case, from the Berkeley aligner) which can be quite noisy.
