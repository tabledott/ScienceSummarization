framework, as a separate notion from the current CB.
    This means that in the 15 out of 20 cases where the shift to global focus is identifiably marked with a cue-word such as now, the segment rules will allow BFP to get the global focus examples. forward centers list, as Sidner does in her algorithm for local focusing [Sid79].
    This lets BFP get the two examples of event anaphora.
    Hobbs discusses the fact that his algorithm cannot be modified to get event anaphora in [Hob76b].
    Another interesting fact is that in every case in which Hobbs' algorithm gets the correct co-specifier and BFP didn't, the relevant factor is Hobbs' preference for intrasentential co-specifiers.
    One view on these cases may be that these are not discourse anaphora, but there seems to be no principled way to make this distinction.
    However, Carter has proposed some extensions to Sidner's algorithm for local focusing that seem to be relevant here(chap.
    6, [Car87]).
    He argues that intra-sentential candidates (IS
