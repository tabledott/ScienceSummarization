 level of cohesion between English and French, English and Chinese are syntactically more distant languages.
    We also chose French to compare our study with that of Fox (2002).
    The additional language pair provides a good means of evaluating how our transformation rule extraction method scales to more problematic language pairs for which child-reordering models are shown not to explain the data well.
    We performed experiments with two corpora, the FBIS English-Chinese Parallel Text and the Hansard FrenchEnglish corpus.We parsed the English sentences with a state-of-the-art statistical parser (Collins, 1999).
    For the FBIS corpus (representing eight million English words), we automatically generated word-alignments using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), which we trained on a much larger data set (150 million words).
    Cases other than one-to-one sentence mappings were eliminated.
    For the Hansard corpus, we took the human annotation of word alignment described in (Och and Ney, 2000).
