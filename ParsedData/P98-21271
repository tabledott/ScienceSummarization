    For example, given a corpus that includes the sentences in (1), our goal is to be able to infer that tezgiiino is similar to &amp;quot;beer&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;wine&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;vodka&amp;quot;, etc.

    The most obvious one is thesaurus construction.
    An automatically created thesaurus offers many advantages over manually constructed thesauri.
    Firstly, the terms can be corpus- or genre-specific.
    Manually constructed general-purpose dictionaries and thesauri include many usages that are very infrequent in a particular corpus or genre of documents.
    For example, one of the 8 senses of &a
