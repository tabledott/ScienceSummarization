ority Class of the polarity of the data,5 while COMPOPR uses a Compose function that selects the polarity of the argument that has higher semantic PRiority.
    For brevity, we refer to COMPOPR and COMPOMC collectively as COMPO.
    The polarity lexicon is initialized with the lexicon of Wilson et al. (2005) and then expanded using the General Inquirer dictionary.6 In particular, a word contained in at least two of the following categories is considered as positive: POSITIV, PSTV, POSAFF, PLEASUR, VIRTUE, INCREAS, and a word contained in at least one of the following categories is considered as negative: NEGATIV, NGTV, NEGAFF, PAIN, VICE, HOSTILE, FAIL, ENLLOSS, WLBLOSS, TRANLOSS.
    For the (function- and content-word) negator lexicon, we collect a handful of seed words as well as General Inquirer words that appear in either NOTLW or DECREAS category.
    Then we expand the list of content-negators using the synonym information of WordNet (Miller, 1995) to take a simple vote among senses. based on parse tre
