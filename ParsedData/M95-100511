ded to achieve 100% recall.
  The response only provides thre e correct ones, so we would expect recall to come out at 50% .
  Precision should be 50% a s well, as half of the links indicated in the response are not in the key .
  Working through the math, we note that p(S), the partition of the key with respect to the response yield s four subsets, shown in the followinfigure with thin lines .
  A Evaluating for recall : R _ ISI ?
  1 = 3/6, or 50% For precision, we must consider the three equivalence classes defined in the response.
  Partitioning these three classes with respect to the key yields two subsets in each of the classes, for a total of six subsets.
  These are shown in thick lines in the following figure .
  To evaluate for precision, we must use the corpus-wide formula: 50 I(ISiI ?
  Ip  (S  i) I ) PT = E(ISil -1 ) (3?2)+(3?2)+(3?2 ) (3?1)+(3?1)+(3?1) = 3/6, or 50% Before closing, let us consider an even more complex example with multiple sets in bot h the key and the response .
