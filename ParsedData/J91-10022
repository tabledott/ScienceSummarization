ic word relations.
    Cohesion is not a guarantee of unity in text but rather a device for creating it.
    As aptly stated by Halliday and Hasan (1976), it is a way of getting text to &amp;quot;hang together as a whole.&amp;quot; Their work on cohesion has underscored its importance as an indicator of text unity.
    Lexical cohesion is the cohesion that arises from semantic relationships between words.
    All that is required is that there be some recognizable relation between the words.
    Halliday and Hasan have provided a classification of lexical cohesion based on the type of dependency relationship that exists between words.
    There are five basic classes: Examples 1, 2, and 3 fall into the class of reiteration.
    Note that reiteration includes not only identity of reference or repetition of the same word, but also the use of superordinates, subordinates, and synonyms.
    Examples 4 and 5 fall into the class of collocation, that is, semantic relationships between words that often co-occur.
