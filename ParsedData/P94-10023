    The next section describes the discourse model that motivates the approach.
    This is followed by a description of two algorithms for subtopic structuring that make use only of lexical cohesion relations, the evaluation of these algorithms, and a summary and discussion of future work.
  
  
    Many discourse models assume a hierarchical segmentation model, e.g., attentional/intentional structure (Grosz &amp; Sidner 1986) and Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann &amp; Thompson 1987).
    Although many aspects of discourse analysis require such a model, I choose to cast expository text into a linear sequence of segments, both for computational simplicity and because such a structure is sufficient for the coarse-grained tasks of interest here.'
    Skorochod'ko (1972) suggests discovering a text's structure by dividing it up into sentences and seeing how much word overlap appears among the sentences.
    The overlap forms a kind of intra-structure; fully connected grap
