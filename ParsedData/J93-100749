    If no label is retrieved for the bigram, it means that the parser could not identify a relation between the two words.
    In this case we introduce a new label: U (for undefined) to label the bigram.
    At this point, we associate with the sentence the label for the bigram (w, w1).
    With each of the input sentences, we associate a label for the bigram (w, w1).
    For example, the label associated with sentence (10) for the bigram faced-test would be VO.
    A list of labeled sentences for the bigram w = &amp;quot;rose&amp;quot; and w = &amp;quot;prices&amp;quot; is shown in Figure 10.
    Producing the &amp;quot;prices f] rose,&amp;quot; SV predicative relation at stage 3.
    Input: A set of sentences containing w and w, each associated with a label as shown in Figure 10.
    Output: Labeled collocations as shown in Figure 11.
    Discussion on Step 3.4: At this step, we count the frequencies of each possible label identified for the bigram (w, w,) and perform a statistical analysis of order two f
