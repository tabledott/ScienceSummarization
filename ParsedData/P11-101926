 ones in the training set.
    Feature weights and/or scores can be fitted to a marking scheme by stepwise or linear regression.
    Unlike our approach, e-Rater models discourse structure, semantic coherence and relevance to the prompt.
    However, the system contains manually developed task-specific components and requires retraining or tuning for each new prompt and assessment task.
    Intelligent Essay Assessor (IEA) (Landauer et al., 2003) uses Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Foltz, 1998) to compute the semantic similarity between texts, at a specific grade point, and a test text.
    In LSA, text is represented by a matrix, where rows correspond to words and columns to context (texts).
    Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to obtain a reduced dimension matrix clustering words and contexts.
    The system is trained on topic and/or prompt specific texts while test texts are assigned a score based on the ones in the training set that are most similar.
    The overall score, which i
