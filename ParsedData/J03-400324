egorization frames: Thus the subcategorization requirements are added to the conditioning context.
    As complements are generated they are removed from the appropriate subcategorization multiset.
    Most importantly, the probability of generating the STOP symbol will be zero when the subcategorization frame is non-empty, and the probability of generating a particular complement will be zero when that complement is not in the subcategorization frame; thus all and only the required complements will be generated.
    The probability of the phrase S(bought) &#8594; NP(week) NP-C(IBM) VP(bought) is now Here the head initially decides to take a single NP-C (subject) to its left and no complements to its right.
    NP-C(IBM) is immediately generated as the required subject, and NP-C is removed from LC, leaving it empty when the next modifier, NP(week), is generated.
    The incorrect structures in Figure 6 should now have low probability, because Plc({NP-C,NP-C}  |S,VP,was) and Prc({NP-C,VP-C}  |VP,VB,was) should
