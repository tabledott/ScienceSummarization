    At the lowest level of search error, the relative speed-up from cube growing and cube pruning compared with full-integration is by a factor of 9.8 and 4.1, respectively.
    Figure 8(b) is a similar comparison in terms of BLEU scores and shows an even bigger advantage of cube growing and cube pruning over the baseline.
    4If a hyperedge is not represented at all in the 100-best &#8722;LM derivations at the root node, we use the 1-best &#8722;LM derivation of this hyperedge instead.
    Here, rules that share the same source side but have different target sides are treated as separate hyperedges, not collected into hyperedge bundles, since grouping becomes difficult after binarization.
  
  
    We have presented a novel extension of cube pruning called cube growing, and shown how both can be seen as general forest rescoring techniques applicable to both phrase-based and syntax-based decoding.
    We evaluated these methods on large-scale translation tasks and observed considerable speed improvements, o
