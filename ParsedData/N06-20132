conjunctions are considered part of the word morphology.
    In this paper, we report on an extensive study of the effect on SMT quality of six preprocessing schemes2, applied to text disambiguated in three different techniques and across a learning curve.
    Our results are as follows: (a) for large amounts of training data, splitting off only proclitics performs best; (b) for small amount of training data, following an English-like tokenization and using part-of-speech tags performs best; (c) suitable choice of preprocessing yields a significant increase in BLEU score if there is little training data and/or there is a change in genre between training and test data; (d) sophisticated morphological analysis and disambiguation help significantly in the absence of large amounts of data.
    Section 2 presents previous relevant research.
    Section 3 presents some relevant background on Arabic linguistics to motivate the schemes discussed in Section 4.
    Section 5 presents the tools and data sets used, along
