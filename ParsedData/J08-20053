tomatic syntactic parsers of which the state of the art (Collins 1999; Charniak 2001) is still far from perfect.
  Alternatively, shallow syntactic parsers (i.e., chunkers and clausers), although they do not provide as much information as a full syntactic parser, have been shown to be more robust in their specific tasks (Li and Roth 2001).
  This raises the very natural and interesting question of quantifying the importance of full parsing information to semantic parsing and whether it is possible to use only shallow syntactic information to build an outstanding SRL system.
  Although PropBank is built by adding semantic annotations to the constituents in the Penn Treebank syntactic parse trees, it is not clear how important syntactic parsing is for an SRL system.
  To the best of our knowledge, this problem was first addressed by Gildea and Palmer (2002).
  In their attempt to use limited syntactic information, the parser they used was very shallow?clauses were not available and only chunks were used.
