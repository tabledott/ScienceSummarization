			Table 1 summarizes the experimental results.
			The English?German systems were trained on the full 751,088 sentence Europarl corpus and evaluated on the WMT 2006 test set (Koehn and Monz, 2006).
			Adding part-of-speech and morphological factors on the output side and exploiting them with 7-gram sequence models results in minor improvements in BLEU.
			The model that incorporates both POS and morphology (18.22% BLEU vs. baseline 18.04% BLEU) ensures better local grammatical coherence.
			The baseline system produces often phrases such as zur(to) zwischenstaatlichen(inter-governmental) met
