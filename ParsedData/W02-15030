    Large-scale grammar development platforms are expensive and time consuming to produce.
    As such, a desideratum for the platforms is a broad utilization scope.
    A grammar development platform should be able to be used to write grammars for a wide variety of languages and a broad range of purposes.
    In this paper, we report on the Parallel Grammar (ParGram) project (Butt et al., 1999) which uses the XLE parser and grammar development platform (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1993) for six languages: English, French, German, Japanese, Norwegian, and Urdu.
    All of the grammars use the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) formalism which produces c(onstituent)structures (trees) and f(unctional)-structures (AVMs) as the syntactic analysis.
    LFG assumes a version of Chomsky&#8217;s Universal Grammar hypothesis, namely that all langu
