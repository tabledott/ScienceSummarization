e.
    Judges where excluded from assessing the quality of MT systems that were submitted by their institution.
    Sentences and systems were randomly selected and randomly shuffled for presentation.
    We collected around 300&#8211;400 judgements per judgement type (adequacy or fluency), per system, per language pair.
    This is less than the 694 judgements 2004 DARPA/NIST evaluation, or the 532 judgements in the 2005 DARPA/NIST evaluation.
    This decreases the statistical significance of our results compared to those studies.
    The number of judgements is additionally fragmented by our breakup of sentences into in-domain and out-of-domain.
    The human judges were presented with the following definition of adequacy and fluency, but no additional instructions:
  
  
    Judges varied in the average score they handed out.
    The average fluency judgement per judge ranged from 2.33 to 3.67, the average adequacy judgement ranged from 2.56 to 4.13.
    Since different judges judged different systems (re
