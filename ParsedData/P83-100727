fer only to Cb(S).
    To clarify the notion of center, we will consider a number of discourses illustrating the various factors that are combined in its definition (abstractly) and in its identification in a discourse.
    In Section 5 we define center more precisely, show how it relates to Sidner's [19811 immediate focus and potential foci, and discuss how the linkages established by the centers of a sentence help to determine the degree of intelligibility of a discourse.
    We begin by showing that the center cannot be defined in syntactic terms alone.
    The interaction of semantics and centering is more complex and is discussed in Section 4.
    The following examples, drawn from Reinhart [19821, illustrate the point that the notion of center is not syntactically definable,4 i.e., the syntax of a sentence S does not determine which of its NPs realizes Cb(S).
    (The reasons for the use of this terminology are discussed in Section 4.)
    Although (lb) and (2b) are identical, Cb(lb) is Max and Cb(2b) i
