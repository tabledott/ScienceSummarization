 Gloss Vector measure described above is independent of the dictionary used and is independent of the corpus used.
    However, dictionary glosses tend to be rather short, and it is possible that even closely related concepts will be defined using different sets of words.
    Our belief is that two synonyms that are used in different glosses will tend to have similar Word Vectors (because their co&#8211;occurrence behavior should be similar).
    However, the brevity of dictionary glosses may still make it difficult to create Gloss Vectors that are truly representative of the concept.
    = Word Vector = Gloss Vector (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) encounter a similar issue when measuring semantic relatedness by counting the number of matching words between the glosses of two different concepts.
    They expand the glosses of concepts in WordNet with the glosses of concepts that are directly linked by a WordNet relation.
    We adopt the same technique here, and use the relations in WordNet to augment glosses f
