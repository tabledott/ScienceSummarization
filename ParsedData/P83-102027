g passive.
    Resolving this entire set of issues in a consistent fashion awaits the pending implementation of a parser to serve as a tool in the investigation of these control issues.)
    How is (6.3) parsed?
    Here we assume that the parser will drop a passive trace after the verb &amp;quot;made&amp;quot;.
    Because we assume that the parser cannot access the binding of the trace, and therefore cannot access the lexical material &amp;quot;a mess&amp;quot;, it must be the case that reanalysis will not take place in this case.
    While this asymmetry may seem unpleasant, we note that there is no evidence that syntactic reanalysis has taken place here.
    Instead,. we assume that semantic processing will simply add an additional domination predicate after it notices the binding of the passive trace.
    Thus, the reanalysis here is semantic, not syntactic.
    (Note that there are other cases, e.g. right dislocation, where it is clear that additional domination predicates are added by post-syntactic pr
