on studies measuring the extent to which subjectivity is preserved across languages in each of the two resources.
    These studies show that only a relatively small fraction of the entries in the lexicon preserve their subjectivity in the translation, mainly due to the ambiguity in both the source and the target languages.
    This is consistent with observations made in previous work that subjectivity is a property associated not with words, but with word meanings (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006).
    In contrast, the sentence-level subjectivity was found to be more reliably preserved across languages, with cross-lingual inter-annotator agreements comparable to the monolingual ones.
    Second, we validated the two automatically generated subjectivity resources by using them to build a tool for subjectivity analysis in the target language.
    Specifically, we developed two classifiers: a rulebased classifier that relies on the subjectivity lexicon described in Section 3.1, and a machine learning classifier train
