    In order not to optimize speed by compromising accuracy, we used the hybrid dependency model, together with both kinds of normal-form constraints, and the maximum-recall decoder.
    Times are given for both automatically assigned POS tags and gold-standard POS tags (POS).
    The sents and words columns give the number of sentences, and the number of words, parsed per second.
    For all of the figures reported on Section 23, unless stated otherwise, we chose settings for the various parameters which resulted in a coverage of 99.6%.
    It is possible to obtain an analysis for the remaining 0.4%, but at a significant loss in speed.
    The parse times and speeds include the failed sentences, and include the time taken by the supertagger, but not the POS tagger; however, the POS tagger is extremely efficient, taking less than 4 seconds to supertag Section 23, most of which consists of load time for the Maximum Entropy model.
    The first row corresponds to the strategy of earlier wo
