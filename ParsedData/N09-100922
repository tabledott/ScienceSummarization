l. (2008) in our experiments also described in &#167;3.1.
    For each treebank, we divide the tags into twelve disjoint tag families.4 The covariance matrices for all dependency distributions were initialized with 1 on the diagonal, 0.5 between tags which belong to the same family, and 0 otherwise.
    This initializer has been shown to be more successful than an identity covariance matrix.
    We begin our experiments with a monolingual setting, where we learn grammars for English and Chinese (separately) using the settings described above.
    The attachment accuracy for this set of experiments is described in Table 1.
    The baselines include right attachment (where each word is attached to the word to its right), MLE via EM (Klein and Manning, 2004), and empirical Bayes with Dirichlet and LN priors (Cohen et al., 2008).
    We also include a &#8220;ceiling&#8221; (DMV trained using supervised MLE from the training sentences&#8217; trees).
    For English, we see that tying nouns, verbs or adjectives imp
