one elementary structure.
    We will call these elementary structures supertags, in order to distinguish them from the standard partof-speech tags.
    Note that even when a word has a unique standard part of speech, say a verb (V), there will usually be more than one supertag associated with this word.
    Since there is only one supertag for each word (assuming there is no global ambiguity) when the parse is complete, an LTAG parser (Schabes, Abeille, and Joshi 1988) needs to search a large space of supertags to select the right one for each word before combining them for the parse of a sentence.
    It is this problem of supertag disambiguation that we address in this paper.
    Since LTAGs are lexicalized, we are presented with a novel opportunity to eliminate or substantially reduce the supertag assignment ambiguity by using local information, such as local lexical dependencies, prior to parsing.
    As in standard part-of-speech disambiguation, we can use local statistical information in the form of n-
