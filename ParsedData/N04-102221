hms that are appropriate for specific parsing metrics.
    There has also been recent work that combines 1-best hypotheses from multiple translation systems (Bangalore et al., 2002); this approach uses string-edit distance to align the hypotheses and rescores the resulting lattice with a language model.
    In future work we plan to extend the search space of MBR decoders to translation lattices produced by the baseline system.
    Translation lattices (Ueffing et al., 2002; Kumar and Byrne, 2003) are a compact representation of a large set of most likely translations generated by an MT system.
    While an -best list contains only a limited reordering of hypotheses, a translation lattice will contain hypotheses with a vastly greater number of re-orderings.
    We are developing efficient lattice search procedures for MBR decoders.
    By extending the search space of the decoder to a much larger space than the -best list, we expect further performance improvements.
    MBR is a promising modeling framework f
