 piece of information which is explicit in one sentence, and implicit in the other.
    In these cases, Turkers judged the sentence containing the explicit mention as more specific, and thus the pair was annotated as unidirectional entailment.
    In Example 6, the expression &#8220;the trigger&#8221; in ENG1 implicitly means &#8220;the click of the trigger&#8221;, making the two sentences equivalent, and the entailment bidirectional (instead of ENG&#8594;ENG1). d) 7 pairs where the information removed from or added to the sentence is not relevant to the entailment relation.
    In these cases, the modified sentence was judged less/more specific than the original one (and thus considered as unidirectional entailment), even though the correct judgement is &#8220;bidirectional&#8221;, as in: e) 4 pairs where the added/removed information concerns universally quantified general statements, about which the interpretation of &#8220;more/less specific&#8221; given by Turkers resulted in the wrong annotation.
