reading activation in a semantic network created from an English dictionary.
    The cohesion score is plotted against words and smoothed, and boundaries are considered to fall at the lowest-scoring words.
    This complex computation, as opposed to simple term repetition, may be necessary when working with narrative texts, but no comparison of methods is done.
    The algorithm's results are shown on one text, but are not evaluated formally.
    Reynar (1994) describes an algorithm similar to that of Hearst (1993) and Hearst and Plaunt (1993) with a difference in the way in which the size of the blocks of adjacent regions are chosen.
    A greedy algorithm is used: the algorithm begins with no boundaries, then a boundary b (between two sentences) is chosen which maximizes the lexical score resulting from comparing the block on the left whose extent ranges from b to the closest existing boundary on the left, and similarly for the right.
    This process is repeated until a prespecified number of boundaries ha
