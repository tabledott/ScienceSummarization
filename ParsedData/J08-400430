re difference function d with a different distance function.
    Krippendorff (1980, 2004a) offers distance metrics suitable for nominal, interval, ordinal, and ratio scales.
    Of particular interest is the function for nominal categories, that is, a function which considers all distinct labels equally distant from one another.
    It turns out that with this distance function, the observed disagreement D&#945;o is exactly the complement of the observed agreement of Fleiss&#8217;s multi-&#960;, 1 &#8722; A&#960;o , and the expected disagreement D&#945;e differs from 1 &#8722; A&#960;e by a factor of (ic &#8722; 1)/ic; the difference is due to the fact that &#960; uses a biased estimator of the expected agreement in the population whereas &#945; uses an unbiased estimator.
    The following equation shows that given the correspondence between observed and expected agreement and disagreement, the coefficients themselves are nearly equivalent.
    For nominal data, the coefficients &#960; and &#945; approach e
