 set Ct of terminal configurations to be the set of all configurations of the form c = ([0], [ ], A) (for any arc set A).
    The set T of transitions will be discussed in detail in Sections 3.1&#8211;3.2.
    We will refer to the list E as the stack and the list B as the buffer, and we will use the variables Q and 0 for arbitrary sublists of E and B, respectively.
    For reasons of perspicuity, we will write E with its head (top) to the right and B with its head to the left.
    Thus, c = ([QIi], [j10], A) is a configuration with the node i on top of the stack E and the node j as the first node in the buffer B.
    Given a transition system 5 = (C, T, cs, Ct), a transition sequence for a sentence x is a sequence C0,m = (c0, c1, ... , cm) of configurations, such that The parse assigned to S by C0,m is the dependency graph Gcm = (Vx, Acm), where Acm is the set of arcs in cm.
    A transition system S is sound for a class G of dependency graphs iff, for every sentence x and transition sequence C0,m for x in S,
