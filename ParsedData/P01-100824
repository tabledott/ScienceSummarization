ical relations in WordNet can form paraphrases.
    Thus, we can not evaluate recall.
    We hand-evaluated the coverage, by asking a human judges to extract paraphrases from 50 sentences, and then counted how many of these paraphrases where predicted by our algorithm.
    From 70 paraphrases extracted by human judge, 48(69%) were identified as paraphrases by our algorithm.
    In addition to evaluating our system output through precision and recall, we also compared our results with two other methods.
    The first of these was a machine translation technique for deriving bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 2001) including detection of non-compositional compounds 4.
    We did this evaluation on 60% of the full dataset; this is the portion of the data which is publicly available.
    Our system produced 6,826 word pairs from this data and Melamed provided the top 6,826 word pairs resulting from his system on this data.
    We randomly extracted 500 pairs each from both sets of output.
    Of the 500 pairs produced
