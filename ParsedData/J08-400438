) suggests testing the individual coders&#8217; distributions using the modified &#967;2 test of Stuart (1955), and discarding the annotation as unreliable if significant systematic discrepancies are observed.
    In contrast, Hsu and Field (2003, page 214) recommend reporting the value of &#954; even when the coders produce different distributions, because it is &#8220;the only [index] ... that could legitimately be applied in the presence of marginal heterogeneity&#8221;; likewise, Di Eugenio and Glass (2004, page 96) recommend using &#954; in &#8220;the vast majority ... of discourse- and dialogue-tagging efforts&#8221; where the individual coders&#8217; distributions tend to vary.
    All of these proposals are based on a misconception: that Artstein and Poesio Inter-Coder Agreement for CL single-distribution coefficients require similar distributions by the individual annotators in order to work properly.
    This is not the case.
    The difference between the coefficients is only in the interpretation
