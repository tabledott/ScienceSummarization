data to give the following estimation for the conditional probability: Unfortunately sparse data problems make this estimate useless.
    A quadruple may appear in test data which has never been seen in training data. ie. f(v, nl,p, n2) = 0.
    The above estimate is undefined in this situation, which happens extremely frequently in a large vocabulary domain such as WSJ.
    (In this experiment about 95% of those quadruples appearing in test data had not been seen in training data).
    Even if f (v, nl,p, n2) &gt; 0, it may still be very low, and this may make the above MLE estimate inaccurate.
    Unsmoothed MLE estimates based on low counts are notoriously bad in similar problems such as n-gram language modeling [GC90].
    However later in this paper it is shown that estimates based on low counts are surprisingly useful in the PP-attachment problem.
    Hindle and Rooth [HR93] describe one of the first statistical approaches to the prepositional phrase attachment problem.
