 For both languages our approach gives the best reported figures on these datasets.
    Our results yield relative error reductions of roughly 27% (English) and 20% (Czech) over McDonald and Pereira (2006)&#8217;s second-order supervised dependency parsers, and roughly 9% (English) and 7% (Czech) over the previous best results provided by Koo et. al.
    (2008)&#8217;s secondorder semi-supervised dependency parsers.
    Note that there are some similarities between our two-stage semi-supervised learning approach and the semi-supervised learning method introduced by (Blitzer et al., 2006), which is an extension of the method described by (Ando and Zhang, 2005).
    In particular, both methods use a two-stage approach; They first train generative models or auxiliary problems from unlabeled data, and then, they incorporate these trained models into a supervised learning algorithm as real valued features.
    Moreover, both methods make direct use of existing feature-vector definitions f(x, y) in inducing represe
