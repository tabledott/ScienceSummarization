ly that recognition of fragments of the first type, in which there is abrupt cessation of speech during a vowel, can be aided by looking for heavy glottalization at the end of the fragment.
    We coded fragments as glottalized if they showed irregular pitch pulses in their associated waveform, spectrogram, and pitch tracks.
    We found glottalization in 24 of the 25 vowel-final fragments in our data.
    An example of a glottalized fragment is shown in Figure 1.
    Although it is true that glottalization occurs in fluent speech as well, it normally appears on unstressed, low FO portions of a signal.
    The 24 glottalized fragments we examined however, were not at the bottom of the speaker's range, and most had considerable energy.
    Thus when combined with the feature of a following silence of at. least 60 msec, glottalization on syllables with sufficient. energy and not at the bottom of the speaker's range, may prove a useful feature in recognizing fragments.
  
  
    In summary, disfluencies occur at
