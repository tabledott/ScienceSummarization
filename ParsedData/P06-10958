    In the case of humans, in fact, when a TLINK is posited by both annotators between the same pairs of events or times, the inter-annotator agreement on the labels is a .77 average of P&amp;R.
    To ensure replicability of results, we assume perfect (i.e., OTC-supplied) events, times, and links.
    Thus, we can consider TLINK inference as the following classification problem: given an ordered pair of elements X and Y, where X and Y are events or times which the human has related temporally via a TLINK, the classifier has to assign a label in RelTypes.
    Using RelTypes instead of RelTypes &#8746; {NONE} also avoids the problem of heavily skewing the data towards the NONE class.
    To construct feature vectors for machine learning, we took each TLINK in the corpus and used the given TimeML features, with the TLINK class being the vector&#8217;s class feature.
    For replicability by other users of these corpora, and to be able to isolate the effect of components, we used &#8216;perfect&#8217; features
