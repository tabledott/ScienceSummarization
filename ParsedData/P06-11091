 from shortage of hand-annotated data, unsupervised parsers operate with unlabeled raw data of which unlimited quantities are available.
    During the last few years there has been steady progress in the field.
    Where van Zaanen (2000) achieved 39.2% unlabeled f-score on ATIS word strings, Clark (2001) reports 42.0% on the same data, and Klein and Manning (2002) obtain 51.2% f-score on ATIS part-of-speech strings using a constituent-context model called CCM.
    On Penn Wall Street Journal po-s-strings &#8804; 10 (WSJ10), Klein and Manning (2002) report 71.1% unlabeled f-score with CCM.
    And the hybrid approach of Klein and Manning (2004), which combines constituency and dependency models, yields 77.6% f-score.
    Bod (2006) shows that a further improvement on the WSJ10 can be achieved by an unsupervised generalization of the all-subtrees approach known as Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP).
    This unsupervised DOP model, coined U-DOP, first assigns all possible unlabeled binary trees to a set of sentences
