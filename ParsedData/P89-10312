 evaluate two different approaches to anaphoric processing in discourse by comparing the accuracy and coverage of two published algorithms for finding the cospecifiers of pronouns in naturally occurring texts and dialogues[Hob76b, BFP87].
    Thus there are two parts to this paper: we present the quantitative results of hand-simulating these algorithms (henceforth Hobbs algorithm and BFP algorithm), but this analysis naturally gives rise to both a qualitative evaluation and recommendations for performing such evaluations in general.
    We illustrate the general difficulties encountered with quantitative evaluation.
    These are problems with: (a) allowing for underlying assumptions, (b) determining how to handle underspecifications, and (c) evaluating the contribution of false positives and error chaining.
    Although both algorithms are part of theories of discourse that posit the interaction of the algorithm with an inference or intentional component, we will not use reasoning in tandem with the algorith
