			We set ?r to a single value ? for all productions r. We found that for ? &gt; 10?2 the sam ples produced by the Hastings algorithm were the same trivial analyses as those produced by the IOalgorithm, but as ? was reduced below this t be gan to exhibit nontrivial structure.
			We evaluatedthe quality of the segmentations in the morphological analyses t in terms of unlabeled precision, re call, f-score and exact match (the fraction of words correctly segmented into morphemes; we ignored morpheme labels because the manual morphological analyses contain many morpheme labels that we did not include in G).
			Figure 3 contains a plot of how these quantities vary with ?; obtaining an f-score of 0.75 and an exact word match accuracy of 0.54 at ? = 10?5 (the corresponding values for the MLE ??
			are both 0).
			Note that we obtained good results as ? was varied over several orders of magnitude, so theactual value of ? is not critical.
			Thus in this appli cation the ability to prefer sparse grammars e
