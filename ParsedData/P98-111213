veness of these most frequent WordNet synset to discriminate between article types.
    Evaluation using Kendall's Tau.
    We sought independent confirmation to assess the correlation between two variables' rank for WN-Verber results.
    To evaluate the effects of one synset's frequency on another, we used Kendall's tau (7) rank order statistic (Kendall 1970).
    For example, was it the case that verbs under the synset act tend not to occur with verbs under the synset think?
    If so, do articles with this property fit a particular profile?
    In our results, we have information about synset frequency, where each of the 1236 articles in the corpus constitutes a sample.
    Table 3 shows the results of calculating Kendall's T with considerations for ranking ties, for all (TN ) = 45 pairing combinations of the top 10 most frequently occurring synsets.
    Correlations can range from -1.0 reflecting inverse correlation, to +1.0 showing direct correlation, i.e. the presence of one class increases as the pres
