a single token in the Penn Treebank, thus making it impossible to capture the information as to what is associated with what.
    We have developed new guidelines to assign structure to prenominal entities such as breast cancer, as well as changed the tokenization guidelines to break up tokens such as cancer-associated.
    Coordination We have also modified the treebank annotation to account for the well-known problem of entities that are discontinuous within a coordination structure - e.g., K- and H-ras, where the entities are K-ras and Hras.
    Our annotation tool allows for discontinuous entities, so that both K-ras and H-ras are annotated as genes.
    Under standard Penn Treebank guidelines for tokenization and syntactic structure, this would receive the flat structure
  
  
    K- and H-ras in which there is no way to directly associate the entity K-ras with a constituent node.
    We have modified the treebank guidelines so that K-ras and H-ras are both constituents, with the ras part ofK-ras represe
