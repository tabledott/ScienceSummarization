D-PATR come from the work of Ronald Kaplan, Martin Kay, and Fernando Pereira.
  The matrix display package for feature sets in D-PATR was written by Per-Kristian Halvorsen.
  I would also like to thank Annie Zaenen and Hans Uszkoreit for their help in designing the system.
  This research, made possible in part by a gift from the System Development Foundation, was also supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under Contract N00039-84-C-0524 with the Naval Electronics Systems Command.
