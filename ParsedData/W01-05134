    For decades, researchers have explored various techniques for identifying interesting collocations.
    There have essentially been three separate kinds of approaches for accomplishing this task.
    These approaches could be broadly classified into (1) segmentation-based, (2) word-based and knowledgedriven, or (3) word-based and probabilistic.
    We will illustrate strategies that have been attempted in each of the approaches.
    Since we assume knowledge of whitespace, and since many of the first and all of the second categories rely upon human input, we will be most interested in the third category.
    Some researchers view MWU-finding as a natural by-product of segmentation.
    One can regard text as a stream of symbols and segmentation as a means of placing delimiters in that stream so as to separate logical groupings of symbols from one another.
    A segmentation process may fin
