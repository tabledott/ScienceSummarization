stimation problem by developing a parallelized version of the estimation algorithm which runs on a Beowulf cluster.
    The lexicalized grammar formalism we use is Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman 2000).
    A number of statistical parsing models have recently been developed for CCG and used in parsers applied to newspaper text (Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman 2002; Hockenmaier and Steedman 2002b; Hockenmaier 2003b).
    In this article we extend existing parsing techniques by developing log-linear models for CCG, as well as a new model and efficient parsing algorithm which exploits all CCG&#8217;s derivations, including the nonstandard ones.
    Estimating a log-linear model involves computing expectations of feature values.
    For the conditional log-linear models used in this article, computing expectations requires a sum over all derivations for each sentence in the training data.
    Because there can be a massive number of derivations for some sentences, enumerating all derivations is inf
