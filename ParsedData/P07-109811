many matches with slots filled with the null label, we have set a new step 0: (0) if n1 (or n2) is a pre-terminal node and its child label is null, &#916;(n1, n2) = 0; and subtract one unit to &#916;(n1, n2), in step 3: The above changes generate a new &#916; which, when substituted (in place of the original &#916;) in Eq.
    1, gives the new Shallow Semantic Tree Kernel.
    To show that SSTK is effective in counting the number of relations shared by two PASs, we propose the following: Proposition 1 The new &#916; function applied to the modified PAS counts the number of all possible kary relations derivable from a set of k arguments, i.e.
    Pkk &#65533; relations of arity from 1 to k (the predicate being considered as a special argument).
    Proof We observe that a kernel applied to a tree and itself computes all its substructures, thus if we evaluate SSTK between a PAS and itself we must obtain the number of generated k-ary relations.
    We prove by induction the above claim.
    For the base case (k
