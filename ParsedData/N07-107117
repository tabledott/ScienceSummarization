    In this section, we provide empirical evidence to support the main claim of this paper.
    Given a collection of DIRT inference rules of the form pi =&gt; pj, our experiments, using the methodology of Section 4, evaluate the capability of our ISP models for determining if (x, pj, y) holds given that (x, pi, y) holds.
    For each filtering algorithm in Section 3.3, ISP.JIM, ISP.IIM.&#8743;, and ISP.IIM.v, we trained their probabilistic models using corpus statistics extracted from the 1999 AP newswire collection (part of the TREC-2002 Aquaint collection) consisting of approximately 31 million words.
    We used the Minipar parser (Lin 1993) to match DIRT patterns in the text.
    This permits exact matches since DIRT inference rules are built from Minipar parse trees.
    For each system, we experimented with the different ways of combining relational SP scores: minimum, maximum, and average (see Section 3.2).
    Also, we experimented with various values for the i parameter described in
