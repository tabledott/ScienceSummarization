  The metric is summarized in Equa- tion (1).
  R is the number of tokens in the target string.
  This metric is similar to the string dis- tance metric used for measuring speech recog- nition accuracy.

  Unlike sl)eech recognition, the task of gener- ation involves reordering of tokens.
  The simple accuracy metric, however, penalizes a mist)lacc.d token twice, as a deletion from its c.xpo, ct(.d posi- tion and insertion at at different l)osition.
