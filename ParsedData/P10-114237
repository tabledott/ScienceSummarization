er against multiple scorers, which can indirectly help to counteract the bias inherent in a particular scorer.

    While we have focused our discussion on supervised approaches, coreference researchers have also attempted to reduce a resolver&#8217;s reliance on annotated data by combining a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data using general-purpose semi-supervised learning algorithms such as co-training (M&#168;uller et al., 2002), self-training (Kehler et al., 2004a), and EM (Cherry and Bergsma, 2005; Ng, 2008).
    Interestingly, recent results indicate that unsupervised approaches to coreference resolution (e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007; 2010), Poon and Domingos (2008)) rival their supervised counterparts, casting doubts on whether supervised resolvers are making effective use of the available labeled data.
    Another issue that we have not focused on but which is becoming increasingly important is mult
