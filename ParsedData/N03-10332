sons for suspecting that it would be advantageous to make information from both directions explicitly available for conditioning at each local point in the model: (i) because of smoothing and interactions with other modeled features, terms like P(t0|t+1, ...) might give a sharp estimate of t0 even when terms like P(t+1|t0, ...) do not, and (ii) jointly considering the left and right context together might be especially revealing.
    In this paper we exploit this idea, using dependency networks, with a series of local conditional loglinear (aka maximum entropy or multiclass logistic regression) models as one way of providing efficient bidirectional inference.
    Secondly, while all taggers use lexical information, and, indeed, it is well-known that lexical probabilities are much more revealing than tag sequence probabilities (Charniak et al., 1993), most taggers make quite limited use of lexical probabilities (compared with, for example, the bilexical probabilities commonly used in current statistical parser
