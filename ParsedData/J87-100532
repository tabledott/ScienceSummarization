    Certain natural language phenomena, such as the so-called donkey sentences, exhibit structures that are ill-formed with respect to the assumptions made by this algorithm.
    For instance, the sentence Every man who owns a donkey beats it. has an ill-formed input structure because the pronoun has to reach inside the scope of an existential quantifier for its antecedent.
    Its predicate-argument structure might be something like An alternative is to leave the pronoun unanalyzed, in which case the closest reading produced by the algorithm is In fact, this is not bad if we take it(x) to mean that x is nonhuman and that x is mentioned in the prior discourse in a position determined by whatever coreference resolution process is used.
    There is a problem if we take the quantifier the to mean that there is a unique such x and take the sentence to mean that a man who owns many donkeys will beat every donkey he owns.
    But we can get around this if, following the approach taken by Hobbs (1983
