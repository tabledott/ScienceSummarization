    One of the great difficulties with current MT pipelines is that these diverse components are often designed by separate groups and have different file format and interaction requirements.
    This leads to a large investment in scripts to convert formats and connect the different components, and often leads to untenable and non-portable projects as well as hindering repeatability of experiments.
    To combat these issues, the Joshua toolkit integrates most critical components of the machine translation pipeline.
    Moreover, each component can be treated as a stand-alone tool and does not rely on the rest of the toolkit we provide.
    Scalability: Our third design goal was to ensure that the decoder is scalable to large models and data sets.
    The parsing and pruning algorithms are carefully implemented with dynamic programming strategies, and efficient data structures are used to minimize overhead.
    Other techniques contributing to scalability includes suffix-array grammar extraction, paral
