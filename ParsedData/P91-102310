 as the order of the sentences does not differ too radically between the two languages.
    Details of the alignment techniques differ considerably from one application to another, but all use a distance measure to compare two individual elements within the sequences, and a dynamic programming algorithm to minimize the total distances between aligned elements within two sequences.
    We have found that the sentence alignment problem fits fairly well into this framework.
  
  
    It is convenient for the distance measure to be based on a probabilistic model so that information can be combined in a consistent way.
    Our distance measure is an estimate of &#8211;log Prob(match 18), where 8 depends on li and /2, the lengths of the two portions of text under consideration.
    The log is introduced here so that adding distances will produce desirable results.
    This distance measure is based on the assumption that each character in one language, L1, gives rise to a random number of characters in the other la
