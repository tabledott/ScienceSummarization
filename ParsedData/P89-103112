it will go sequentially further and further up the tree to the left of the pronoun, and that failing will look in the previous sentence.
    Hobbs does not assume a segmentation of discourse structure in this algorithm; the algorithm will go back arbitrarily far in the text to find an antecedent.
    In more recent work, Hobbs uses the notion of COHERENCE RELATIONS to structure the discourse [HM87].
    The order by which Hobbs' algorithm traverses the parse tree is the closest thing in his framework to predictions about which discourse entities are salient.
    In the main it prefers co-specifiers for pronouns that are within the same sentence, and also ones that are closer to the pronoun in the sentence.
    This amounts to a claim that different discourse entities are salient, depending on the position of a pronoun in a sentence.
    When seeking an intersentential cospecification, Hobbs algorithm searches the parse tree of the previous utterance breadth-first, from left to right.
    This predicts that en
