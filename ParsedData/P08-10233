tially many parses,1 which compactly encodes many more alternatives than k-best parses.
    This scheme can be seen as a compromise between the string-based and treebased methods, while combining the advantages of both: decoding is still fast, yet does not commit to a single parse.
    Large-scale experiments (Section 4) show an improvement of 1.7 BLEU points over the 1-best baseline, which is also 0.8 points higher than decoding with 30-best trees, and takes even less time thanks to the sharing of common subtrees.
  
  
    Current tree-based systems perform translation in two separate steps: parsing and decoding.
    A parser first parses the source language input into a 1-best tree T, and the decoder then searches for the best derivation (a sequence of translation steps) d* that converts source tree T into a target-language string among all possible derivations D: We will now proceed with a running example translating from Chinese to English: &#8220;Bush held a talk2 with Sharon1&#8221; Figure 2 shows how
