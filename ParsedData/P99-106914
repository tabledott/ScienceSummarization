0i gives the same conditional distribution Po (w ) y(w)); 0i is irrelevant to the problem of choosing good parses.
    Despite the assurance of consistency, pseudolikelihood estimation is prone to over fitting when a large number of features is matched against a modest-sized training corpus.
    One particularly troublesome manifestation of over fitting results from the existence of features which, relative to the training set, we might term &amp;quot;pseudo-maximal&amp;quot;: Let us say that a feature f is pseudo-maximal for a yield y if Vwf E 1/(y) f(w) &gt; f (co') where w is any correct parse of y, i.e., the feature's value on every correct parse (.4) of y is greater than or equal to its value on any other parse of y. Pseudominimal features are defined similarly.
    It is easy to see that if h is pseudo-maximal on each sentence of the training corpus then the parameter assignment 03 = oo maximizes the corpus pseudo-likelihood.
    (Similarly, the assignment 03 = &#8212;oo maximizes pseudo-likelihood if f
