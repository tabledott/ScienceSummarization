ally with self-trained Medline data.
    So, for example, McClosky et al. (2006a) found that the data from the handannotated WSJ data should be considered at least five times more important than NANC data on an event by event level.
    We did no tuning to find out if there is some better weighting for our domain than one-to-one.
    The resulting parser was tested on a test corpus of hand-parsed sentences from the Genia Treebank (Tateisi et al., 2005).
    These are exactly the same sentences as used in the comparisons of the last section.
    Genia is a corpus of abstracts from the Medline database selected from a search with the keywords Human, Blood Cells, and Transcription Factors.
    Thus the Genia treebank data are all from a small domain within Biology.
    As already noted, the Medline abstracts used for self-training were chosen randomly and thus span a large number of biomedical sub-domains.
    The results, the central results of this paper, are shown in Figure 1.
