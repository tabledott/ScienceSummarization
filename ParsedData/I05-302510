  Table 1 shows our of- ficial SIGHAN bakeoff results.
  The columns R, P, and F show the recall, precision, and F mea- sure, respectively.
  The columns ROOV and RIV show the recall on out-of-vocabulary words and in-vocabulary words, respectively.
  Our Chinese word segmenter which participated in the bakeoff was trained with the basic features (Section 1.1), and made use of the external dictionary (Sec- tion 1.2) and additional training corpora (Sec- tion 1.3).
  Our word segmenter achieved the high- est F measure for AS, CITYU, and PKU, and the second highest for MSR.
