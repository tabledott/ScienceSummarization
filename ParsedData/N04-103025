			In comparing systems, results are reported for all the three types of tasks mentioned earlier.
			13.1 Description of the Systems.
			The Gildea and Palmer (G&amp;P) System.
			The Gildea and Palmer (2002) system uses the same features and the same classification mechanism used by G&amp;J. These results are reported on the December 2001 release of PropBank.
			The Surdeanu et al System.
			Surdeanu et al (2003) report results on two systems using a decision tree classifier.
			One that uses exactly the same features as the G&amp;J system.
			We call this ?SurdeanuSystem I.?
			They then show improved performance of an other system ? ?Surdeanu System II,?
			which uses some additional features.
			These results are are reported on the July 2002 release of PropBank.
			The Gildea and Hockenmaier (G&amp;H) SystemThe Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003) system uses fea tures extracted from Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) corresponding to the features that were used by G&amp;J and G&amp;P systems.
			CCG is a fo
