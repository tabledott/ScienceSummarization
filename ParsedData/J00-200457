    In actual translations, however, when the object of the verb is commission, task force, panel, etc., English appoint is usually translated into French as instituer.
    To account for this kind of context-dependent translational equivalence, link types must be evaluated with respect to the bitext whence they were induced.
    I performed a post hoc evaluation of the link types produced by an earlier version of Method B (Melamed 1996b).
    The bitext used for this evaluation was the same aligned Hansards bitext used by Gale and Church (1991), except that I used only 300,000 aligned segment pairs to save time.
    The bitext was automatically pretokenized to delimit punctuation, English possessive pronouns, and French elisions.
    Morphological variants in both halves of the bitext were stemmed to a canonical form.
