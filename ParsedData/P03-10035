e parameters of this model are learned, given a question Q and the set of sentences &#931; returned by an IR engine, one can find the sentence Si &#8712; &#931; and an answer in it Ai,j by searching for the Si,A.. that maximizes the 'j conditional probability P(Q  |Si,Ai,j).
    In Section 2, we first present the noisy-channel model that we propose for this task.
    In Section 3, we describe how we generate training examples.
    In Section 4, we describe how we use the learned models to answer factoid questions, we evaluate the performance of our system using a variety of experimental conditions, and we compare it with a rule-based system that we have previously used in several TREC evaluations.
    In Section 5, we demonstrate that the framework we propose is flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of resources and techniques that have been employed in state-of-the-art QA systems.
  
  
    Assume that we want to explain why &#8220;1977&#8221; in sentence S in Figure 1 is a good answer for the question
