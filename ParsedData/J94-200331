hen constraint 3 applies, stipulating that the Cb must be the highest-ranked 12 It has also been claimed that symmetric verbs uch as meet by chance mark EMPATHY on the subject (Kuno 1976a).

  Japanese Discourse element of Cf(c) realized in 4d, Ziroo must be the highest-ranked ntity realized, and therefore must be the Cb.
  At this point it is clear that some kind of SHIFT is forced by the application of constraint 3.
  The two candidates are a SMOOTH-SHIFT and a ROUGH- SHIFT.
  The SMOOTH-SHIFT interpretation corresponds to the reading Ziroo invited Taroo to a movie whereas the ROUGH-SHIFT interpretation corresponds tothe Taroo invited Ziroo reading.
  The SMOOTH-SHIFT interpretation is more highly ranked, thus considered more coherent and so is the preferred interpretation (Z = 10.93, p &lt; .001).
