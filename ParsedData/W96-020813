 a representative connectionist method.
    The implementation learns a separate perceptron for recognizing each sense and assigns a test case to the sense indicated by the perceptron whose output most exceeds its threshold.
    In the current experiments, there was never a problem with convergence during training.
    As a representative of decision-tree methods, we chose C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993), a system that is easily available and included in most recent experimental comparisons in machine learning.
    All parameters were left at their default values.
    We also tested C4.5-RULES, a variant of C4.5 in which decision trees are translated into rules and pruned; however, its performance was slightly inferior to the base C4.5 system on the &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; corpus; therefore, its results are not included.
    Finally, we tested three simple logic-based induction algorithms that employ different representations of concepts: DNF, CNF, and decision lists.
    Most rule-based methods, e.g.
