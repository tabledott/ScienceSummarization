tstrap&amp;quot; each other by filling the labels of the instances on which the other side has abstained so far.
    The CoBoost algorithm just described is for the case where there are two labels: for the named entity task there are three labels, and in general it will be useful to generalize the CoBoost algorithm to the multiclass case.
    Several extensions of AdaBoost for multiclass problems have been suggested (Freund and Schapire 97; Schapire and Singer 98).
    In this work we extended the AdaBoost.MH (Schapire and Singer 98) algorithm to the cotraining case.
    AdaBoost.MH maintains a distribution over instances and labels; in addition, each weak-hypothesis outputs a confidence vector with one confidence value for each possible label.
    We again adopt an approach where we alternate between two classifiers: one classifier is modified while the other remains fixed.
    Pseudo-labels are formed by taking seed labels on the labeled examples, and the output of the fixed classifier on the unlabeled exam
