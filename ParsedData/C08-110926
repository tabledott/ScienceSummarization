			It is important to note that while these are notthe exact same essays used in the previous evalua tion of 8,269 preposition contexts, they come from the same pool of student essays and were on the same topics.
			Given these strong similarities, we feel that one can compare scores between the two approaches.
			The precision and recall scores forboth approaches are shown in Table 4 and are ex tremely similar, thus suggesting that the samplingapproach can be used as an alternative to exhaus tive annotation.
			Precision Recall Standard Approach 80% 12% Sampling Approach 79% 14% Table 4: Sampling Results It is important with the sampling approach to use appropriate sample sizes when drawing from the sub-corpora, because the accuracy of the estimatesof hits and misses will depend upon the propor tion of errors in each sub-corpus as well as on the sample sizes.
			The OK sub-corpus is expected to have even fewer errors than the overall base rate, so it is especially important to have a relativelylar
