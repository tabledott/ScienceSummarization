m WER (0.48) that tends to penalize small word movement is the worst performer.
    One interesting observation is that longer lower correlation with adequacy. generally agree with Pearhave more equivalents.
    Pearson's values in the Stem of the Fluency Table, indicates that has the highest correlation (0.93) with fluency.
    However, it is statistically indistinguishable with 95% confidence from all other metrics shown in the Case set of the Fluency Table except for WER and GTM10.
    GTM10 has good correlation with human judgments in adequacy but not fluency; while GTM20 and GTM30, i.e.
    GTM with exponent larger than 1.0, has good correlation with human judgment in fluency but not adequacy.
    ROUGE-L and ROUGE-S*, 4, and 9 are good automatic evaluation metric candidates since they as well as fluency correlation and outperform and 12 significantly in adequacy.
    Among them, ROUGE-L is the best metric in both adequacy and fluency correlation with human judgment according to Spearman&#8217;s correlat
