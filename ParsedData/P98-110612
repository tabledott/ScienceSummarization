y derive the &amp;quot;lifted&amp;quot; version of the tree, where a node is dependent of its linear governor.
    Thus, the derived structure resembles more a unistratal dependency representation like those used by (Hudson, 1990) than the multistratal representations of, for example, (Mel'euk, 1988).
    However, from a formal point of view, the distinction is not significant.
    In order to capture pseudo-projectivity, we will interpret rules of the form (2) (for subcategorization of arguments by a head) and (4) (for selection of a head by an adjunct) as introducing syntactic dependents which may lift to a higher linear governor.
    An LP rule of the form (5) orders all linear dependents of the linear governor, no matter whose syntactic dependents they are.
    In addition, we need a third type of rule, namely a lifting rule, or 1-rule (see 2.3).
    The 1-rule (1) can be rewrited on the following form: This rule resembles normal dependency rules but instead of introducing syntactic dependents of a catego
