stributed (IID) sentences from this distribution.
    We can define the following probabilities: where the probability is taken with respect to the distribution .
    The sign test has the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis .
    Given a sample of test points ,the sign test depends on calculation of the following counts: , , and ,where is the cardinality of the set .
    We now come to the definition of &#8212; how should we judge whether a translation from one system is better or worse than the translation from another system?
    A critical problem with Bleu scores is that they are a function of an entire test corpus and do not give translation scores for single sentences.
    Ideally we would have some measure of the quality of the translation of sentence under the reordered system, and a corresponding function that measures the quality of the baseline translation.
    We could then define as follows: If If If Unfortunately Bleu scores do not give persentence measures and , and thus do not allo
