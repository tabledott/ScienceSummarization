    However, none of this work appears to directly address the more general problem of how to robustly provide feedback to ESL writers&#8212;and for that matter non-native writers in any second language&#8212;in a way that is easily tailored to different L1 backgrounds and secondlanguage (L2) skill levels.
    In this paper, we show that a noisy channel model instantiated within the paradigm of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) (Brown et al., 1993) can successfully provide editorial assistance for non-native writers.
    In particular, the SMT approach provides a natural mechanism for suggesting a correction, rather than simply stranding the user with a flag indicating that the text contains an error.
    Section 2 further motivates the approach and briefly descri
