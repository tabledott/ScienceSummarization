rse all words into stem plus suffix if such a parse is possible using a suffix from this candidate set.
    A considerable number of words will have more than one such parse under those conditions, and we utilize the figure of merit described in the preceding section to choose among those potential parses.
    Regardless of which of the two approaches we have taken, our task now is to decide which splits are worth keeping, which ones need to be dropped, and which ones need to be modified.23 In addition, if we follow the take-all-splits approach, we have many 22 Experimenting with other functions suggests empirically that the details of our choices for a figure of merit, and the distribution reported in the text, are relatively unimportant.
    As long as the measurement is capable of ensuring that the cuts are not strongly pushed towards the periphery, the results we get are robust.
    23 Various versions of Harris's method of morpheme identification can be used as well.
    Harris's approach has the interes
