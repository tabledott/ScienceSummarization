    In the early nineties, Abney (1991) proposed to approach parsing by starting with finding related chunks of words.
    By then, Church (1988) had already reported on recognition of base noun phrases with statistical methods.
    Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) approached chunking by using a machine learning method.
    Their work has inspired many others to study the application of learning methods to noun phrase chunking5.
    Other chunk types have not received the same attention as NP chunks.
    The most complete work is Buchholz et al. (1999), which presents results for NP, VP, PP, ADJP and ADVP chunks.
    Veenstra (1999) works with NP, VP and PP chunks.
    Both he and Buchholz et al. use data generated by the script that produced the CoNLL-2000 shared task data sets.
    Ratnaparkhi (1998) has recognized arbitrary chunks as part of a parsing task but did not report on the chunking performance.
    Part of the Sparkle project has concentrated on finding various sorts o
