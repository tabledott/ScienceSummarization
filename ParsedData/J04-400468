 effect on overall parsing performance, and given that the choice of head is not terribly critical either, one might wonder what power, if any, head-lexicalization is providing.
    The answer is that even when one removes bilexical dependencies from the model, there are still plenty of lexico-structural dependencies, that is, structures being generated conditioning on headwords and headwords being generated conditioning on structures.
    To test the effect of such lexicostructural dependencies in our lexicalized PCFGstyle formalism, we experimented with the removal of the head tag th and/or the head word wh from the conditioning contexts of the PMw and PM parameters.
    The recertainly points to the utility of caching probabilities (the 219 million are tokens, not types).

    PM is the parameter class for generating partially lexicalized modifying nonterminals (a nonterminal label and part of speech).
