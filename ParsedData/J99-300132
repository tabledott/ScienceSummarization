    We then describe the extended version of the functional Cf ranking constraints.
    The two versions differ with respect to the incorporation of (a subset of) inferables in the second version and, hence, with respect to the requirements 10 In Strube and Hahn (1996), we assumed that the information status of a discourse entity has the main impact on its salience.
    In particular, evoked discourse entities were ranked higher in the Cf list than brand-new discourse entities (using Prince's terminology).
