    In the dataset, only 302 entries have been labeled with 12 fields, including size, rent, neighborhood, features, and so on.
    The data was preprocessed using regular expressions for phone numbers, email addresses and URLs.
    The list of the constraints for this domain is given in Table 1.
    We implement some global constraints and include unary constraints which were largely imported from the list of seed words used in (Haghighi and Klein, 2006).
    We slightly modified the seedwords due to difference in preprocessing.
  
  
    given an input sequence x = (x1,... , xN), the task is to find the best assignment to the output variables y = (y1, ... , yM).
    We denote X to be the space of the possible input sequences and Y to be the set of possible output sequences.
    We define a structured output classifier as a function h : X &#57738; Y that uses a global scoring function f : X &#215; Y &#57738; R to assign scores to each possible input/output pair.
    Given an input x, a de
