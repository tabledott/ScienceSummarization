ta were P(fe  |path), P(fe  |path, t), and P(fe  |h, t), where fe indicates an event where the parse constituent in question is a frame element, path the path through the parse tree from the target word to the parse constituent, t the identity of the target word, and h the head word of the parse constituent.
    Some sample values from these distributions are shown in Table 8.
    For example, the path VBTVPtNP, which corresponds to the direct object of a verbal target word, had a high probability of being a frame element.
    The table also illustrates cases of sparse data for various feature combinations.
    By varying the probability threshold at which a decision is made, one can plot a precision/recall curve as shown in Figure 10.
    P(fe  |path, t) performs relatively poorly because of fragmentation of the training data (recall that only about 30 sentences are available for each target word).
    Although the lexical statistic P(fe  |h, t) alone is not useful as a classifier, using it in linear interpo
