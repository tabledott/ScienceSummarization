h a complex, nested structure. gorithm is its integration with state-of-the-art statistical machine translation techniques.
    More specifically, a statistical word alignment model (Brown et al., 1993) is used to acquire a bilingual lexicon consisting of NL substrings coupled with their translations in the target MRL.
    Complete MRs are then formed by combining these NL substrings and their translations under a parsing framework called the synchronous CFG (Aho and Ullman, 1972), which forms the basis of most existing statistical syntax-based translation models (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005).
    Our algorithm is called WASP, short for Word Alignment-based Semantic Parsing.
    In initial evaluation on several real-world data sets, we show that WASP performs favorably in terms of both accuracy and coverage compared to existing learning methods requiring the same amount of supervision, and shows better robustness to variations in task complexity and word order.
