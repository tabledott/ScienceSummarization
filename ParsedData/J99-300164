rical evaluation, we claim, first, that our proposal based on functional criteria leads to substantially improved and&#8212;with respect to the inference load placed on the text understander, whether human or machine&#8212;more plausible results for languages with free word order than the structural constraints given by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) and those underlying the naive approach.
    We base these observations on an evaluation study that considers transition pairs in terms of the inference load specific pairs imply.
    Second, we have gathered preliminary evidence, still far from conclusive, that the functional constraints on centering seem to explain linguistic data more satisfactorily than the common grammar-oriented constraints.
    Hence, we hypothesize that these functional constraints might constitute a general framework for treating free- and fixed-word-order languages by the same methodology.
    This claim, without doubt, has to be further substantiated by additional cross-linguistic
