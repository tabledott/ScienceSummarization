achine translation, (Brown et al. 1993), for which an accurate word-to-word alignment between the source and the target languages is critical for high quality translations.
    The trigram language model probabilities of morpheme sequences, p(mi|mi-1, mi-2), are estimated from the morpheme-segmented corpus.
    At token boundaries, the morphemes from previous tokens constitute the histories of the current morpheme in the trigram language model.
    The trigram model is smoothed using deleted interpolation with the bigram and unigram models, (Jelinek 1997), as in (1): w# kAn AyrfAyn Al*y Hl fy Al# mrkz Al# Awl fy jA}z +p Al# nmsA Al# EAm Al# mADy Ely syAr +p fyrAry $Er b# AlAm fy bTn +h ADTr +t +h Aly Al# AnsHAb mn Al# tjArb w# hw s# y# Ewd Aly lndn l# AjrA' Al# fHwS +At Al# Drwry +p Hsb mA A$Ar fryq 2 A manually segmented Arabic corpus containing about 140K word tokens has been provided by LDC (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu).
