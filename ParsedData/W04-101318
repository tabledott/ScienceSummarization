s based on human assigned scores.
    Acquiring human judgments are usually very expensive; fortunately, we have DUC 2001, 2002, and 2003 evaluation data that include human judgments for the following: Besides these human judgments, we also have 3 sets of manual summaries for DUC 2001, 2 sets for DUC 2002, and 4 sets for DUC 2003.
    Human judges assigned content coverage scores to a candidate summary by examining the percentage of content overlap between a manual summary unit, i.e. elementary discourse unit or sentence, and the candidate summary using Summary Evaluation Environment3 (SEE) developed by the University of Southern California&#8217;s Information Sciences Institute (ISI).
    The overall candidate summary score is the average of the content coverage scores of all the units in the manual summary.
    Note that human judges used only one manual summary in all the evaluations although multiple alternative summaries were available.
    With the DUC data, we computed Pearson&#8217;s product moment co
