to rel marker John likes trace produces rel _pronoun &lt; John likes &gt; After this rule application, it is not possible to apply any rule with a segment matching inside a bracketed portion and another segment matching outside it.
    The use of the above rule has divided the string into two isolated portions, each of which must be independently expanded.
    Given an XG with initial symbol s, a sentence t is in the language defined by the XG if there is a sequence of rule applications that transforms s into a string from which t can be obtained by deleting all brackets.
    I shall refer to the restrictions on XG rule application which I have just described as the bracketing constraint.
    The effect of the bracketing constraint is independent of the order of application of rules, because if two rules are used in a derivation, the brackets introduced by each of them must be compatible in the way described above.
    As brackets are added and never deleted, it is clear that the order of application is irrel
