 corpus, that are unambiguous in the training corpus.
    The list comprises the following negation signals: absence, absent, fail, failure, impossible, lack, loss, miss, negative, neither, never, no, none, nor, not, unable, without.
    Instances with this negation signals are directly assigned their class.
    The classifier predicts the class of the rest of tokens.
    In this phase three classifiers predict whether a token is the first token in the scope sequence, the last, or neither.
    A fourth classifier is a metalearner that uses the predictions of the three classifiers to predict the scope classes.
    The three object classifiers that provide input to the metalearner were trained using the following machine learning methods: in CRF++-0.51 (Lafferty et al., 2001).
    CRFs define a conditional probability distribution over label sequences given a particular observation sequence rather than a joint distribution over label and observation sequences, and are reported to avoid the label bias problem of
