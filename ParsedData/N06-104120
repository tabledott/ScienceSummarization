bed in Grenager et al. (2005) under conditions similar to POS tagging.
    An important characteristic of this domain (see figure 1(a)) is that the hidden labels tend to be &#8220;sticky,&#8221; in that fields tend to consist of runs of the same label, as in figure 1(c), in contrast with part-of-speech tagging, where we rarely see adjacent tokens given the same label.
    Grenager et al. (2005) report that in order to learn this &#8220;sticky&#8221; structure, they had to alter the structure of their HMM so that a fixed mass is placed on each diagonal transition.
    In this work, we learned this structure automatically though prototype similarity features without manually constraining the model (see
  
  
    figure 8), though we did change the similarity function (see below).
    On the test set of (Grenager et al., 2005), BASE scored an accuracy of 46.4%, comparable to Grenager et al. (2005)&#8217;s unsupervised HMM baseline.
    Adding the prototype list (see figure 2) without distributional features yiel
