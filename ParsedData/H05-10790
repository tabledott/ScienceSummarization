	Recognising Textual Entailment With Logical Inference
		We use logical inference techniques for recognising textual entailment.
		As the performance of theorem proving turnsout to be highly dependent on not read ily available background knowledge, we incorporate model building, a technique borrowed from automated reasoning, and show that it is a useful robust method to approximate entailment.
		Finally, we use machine learning to combine these deep semantic analysis techniques with simpleshallow word overlap; the resulting hy brid model achieves high accuracy on the RTE testset, given the state of the art.
		Ourresults also show that the different techniques that we employ perform very dif ferently on some of the subsets of the RTE corpus and as a result, it is useful to use the nature of the dataset as a feature.
	
	
			Recognising textual entailment (RTE) is the task to find out whether some text T entails a hypothesis H. This task has recently been the focus of a challenge organised by the PASCAL network
