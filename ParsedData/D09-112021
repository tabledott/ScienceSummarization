mber of pairwise errors made on MUC6-TEST dataset by mention type; note these errors are not equally weighted in the final evaluations because of the transitive closure taken at the end.
    The most errors are made on nominal mentions with pronouns coming in a distant second.
    In particular, we most frequently say a nominal is NULL when it has an antecedent; this is typically due to not having the necessary semantic knowledge to link a nominal to a prior expression.
    In order to get a more thorough view of the cause of pairwise errors, we examined 20 random errors made in aligning each mention type to an antecedent.
    We categorized the errors as follows: we incorrectly aligned a pronoun to a mention with which it is not semantically compatible (e.g. he aligned to board). mentions with the same head are always compatible.
    Includes modifier and specificity errors such as allowing Lebanon and Southern Lebanon to corefer.
    This also includes errors of definiteness in nominals (e.g. the people in
