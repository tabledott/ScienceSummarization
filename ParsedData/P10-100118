mpute these quantities.
    Our parsers are easily extended to labeled dependencies.
    Direct integration of labels into Models 1 and 2 would result in third-order parts composed of three labeled dependencies, at the cost of increasing the time and space complexities by factors of O(L3) and O(L2), respectively, where L bounds the number of labels per dependency.
    If each word in x has a set of possible &#8220;senses,&#8221; our parsers can be modified to recover the best joint assignment of syntax and senses for x, by adapting methods in Eisner (2000).
    Complexity would increase by factors of O(54) time and O(53) space, where 5 bounds the number of senses per word.
    If more vertical context is desired, the dynamicprogramming structures can be extended with additional ancestor indices, resulting in a &#8220;spine&#8221; of ancestors above each span.
    Each additional ancestor lengthens the vertical scope of the factorization (e.g., from grand-siblings to &#8220;great-grandsiblings&#8221;), while i
