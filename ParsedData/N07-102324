    We performed both automatic and human evaluation against the output produced by Knight and Marcu&#8217;s original implementation of their noisy channel model (Table 3).
    In the former case, we also provide Simple String Accuracies (SSA).8 For human evaluation, we hired six native-speaker judges who scored grammaticality and content (importance) with scores from 1 to 5, using instructions as described in K&amp;M.
    Both types of evaluations favored our Markovized model against the noisy channel model.
    Table 4 shows several outputs of our system (Markov) that significantly differed from the output of the noisy channel model (NoisyC), which confirms our finding that Markovized models can produce quite grammatical output.
    Our compression for the first sentence underlines one of the advantages of constituent-based classifiers, which have the ability of deleting a very long phrase (here, a PP) at once.
    The three next sentences display some advantages of our approach ov
