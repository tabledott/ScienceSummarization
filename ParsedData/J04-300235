    The selection procedure is as follows.
    First, all 1-grams, 2-grams, 3-grams, and 4-grams are extracted from the data.
    In this work, each constituent of an n-gram is a word-stem, part-of-speech pair.
    For example, (in-prep the-det can-noun) is a 3-gram that matches trigrams consisting of preposition in, followed by determiner the, and ending with noun can.
    A subset of the n-grams are then selected based on precision.
    The precision of an n-gram is the number of subjective instances of that n-gram in the data divided by the total number of instances of that n-gram in the data.
    An instance of an n-gram is subjective if each word occurs in a subjective element in the data. n-grams are selected based on two criteria.
    First, the precision of the n-gram must be greater than the baseline precision (i.e., the proportion of all word instances that Wiebe, Wilson, Bruce, Bell, and Martin Learning Subjective Language are in subjective elements).
    Second, the precision of the n-gram must
