oarse inventory acquired automatically.
    To this end, we merged the semantic interconnections belonging to the same cluster.
    We also disabled the first sense baseline heuristic, that most of the systems use as a back-off when they have no information about the word at hand.
    We call this new setting SSI* (as opposed to SSI used in Table 4).
    In Table 5 we report the results.
    The algorithm obtains an improvement of 9.8% recall and 3.1% precision (both statistically significant, p &lt; 0.05).
    The increase in recall is mostly due to the fact that different senses belonging to the same cluster now contribute together to the choice of that cluster (rather than individually to the choice of a fine-grained sense).
  
  
    WordNet for the identification of sense regularities: to this end, they provide a set of semantic and probabilistic rules.
    An evaluation of the heuristics provided leads to a polysemy reduction of 39% and an error rate of 5.6%.
