zation, they used a syntactic pattern matching tool that deploys a large set of hand-crafted finite state rules.
			For event detection, they used a small set of heuristics as well as a lexicon to determine whether or not a token is an event, based on the lemma, part of speech and WordNet senses.
			For temporal relation discovery, LCC-TE used a large set of syntactic and semantic features as input to a machine learning components.NAIST-japan defined the temporal relation iden tification task as a sequence labeling model, in which the target pairs ? a TIMEX3 and an EVENT?
			are linearly ordered in the document.
			For analyz ing the relative positions, they used features fromdependency trees which are obtained from a dependency parser.
			The relative position between the tar get EVENT and a word in the target TIMEX3 is used as a feature for a machine learning based relation identifier.
			The relative positions between a word inthe target entities and another word are also intro duced.
