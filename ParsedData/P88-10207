man was developed at ISI (see [Mann &amp; Matthiessen 831, [Mann 83], [Matthiessen 841).
    The input to Penman is produced by PEA (Programming Enhancement Advisor; see [Moore 87]), a program that inspects a user's LISP program and suggests enhancements.
    PEA is being developed to interact with the user in order to answer his or her questions about the suggested enhancements.
    Its theoretical focus is the production of explanations over extended interactions in ways that are superior to the simple goal-tree traversal of systems such as TYRESIAS ([Davis 76]) and MYCIN ([Shortliffe 761).
    In answer to the question how does the system enhance a program?, the following text (not generated by Penman) is not satisfactory: ...because you have to work too hard to make sense of it.
    In contrast, using the same propositions (now rearranged and linked with appropriate connectives), paragraph (b) (generated by Penman) is far easier to understand: (b).
    The system asks the user to tell it the characteristi
