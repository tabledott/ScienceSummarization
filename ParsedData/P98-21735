    Diagrams may be easier to understand than logical formalisms, but they still lack the flexibility and familiarity of natural Ianguage text, as empirical studies on editing diagrammatic representations have shown (Kim, 1990; Petre, 1995); for discussion see Power et al. (1998).
    This observation has led us to explor
