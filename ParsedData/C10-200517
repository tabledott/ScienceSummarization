ar data.
			This example illustrates our strat egy to weight the prior polarities: for each wordw with prior polarity defined by the list, we cal culate the prior polarity of w, pol(w), based on the distribution of w in the positive and negative sets.
			Thus, polpos(w) = count(w, pos)/count(w) and polneg(w) = 1?
			polpos(w).
			We assume thepolarity of a word is associated with the polar ity of the sentence, which seems to be reasonable since we are dealing with very short messages.
			Although simple, this strategy is able to improve the polarity detection, as we show in Section 4.
	
	
			We have performed an extensive performance evaluation of our solution for twitter sentimentdetection.
			Besides analyzing its overall perfor mance, our goals included: examining different strategies to combine the labels provided by the sources; comparing our approach to previous onesin this area; and evaluating how robust our solu tion is to the noisy and biased data described in Section 3.
