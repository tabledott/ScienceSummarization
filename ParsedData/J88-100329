m that would be applied throughout a sequence of ambiguous words, would produce a more accurate and effective method of word disambiguation (Marshall (1983), p. 141).
    The main innovation of CLAWS is the use of a matrix of collocational probabilities, indicating the relative likelihood of co-occurrence of all ordered pairs of tags.
    This matrix can be mechanically derived from any pre-tagged corpus.
    CLAWS used &amp;quot;[a] large proportion of the Brown Corpus&amp;quot;, 200,000 words (Marshall (1983), pp.
    141, 150).
    The ambiguities contained within a span of ambiguous words define a precise number of complete sets of mappings from words to individual tags.
    Each such assignment of tags is called a path.
    Each path is composed of a number of tag collocations, and each such collocation has a probability which may be obtained from the collocation matrix.
    One may thus approximate each path's probability by the product of the probabilities of all its collocations.
    Each path corresp
