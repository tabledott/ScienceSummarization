Similarly to the familiar F measure, if ? is greater than 1 completeness is weighted more strongly in the calculation, if ? is less than 1, homogeneity is weighted more strongly.
			Notice that the computations of homogeneity,completeness and V-measure are completely inde pendent of the number of classes, the number ofclusters, the size of the data set and the clustering al gorithm used.
			Thus these measures can be applied toand compared across any clustering solution, regard less of the number of data points (n-invariance), thenumber of classes or the number of clusters.
