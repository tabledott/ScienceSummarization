    In summary, we have shown in this paper that there are many different types of collocations needed for language generation.
    Collocations are flexible and they can involve two, three or more words in various ways.
    We have described a fully implemented program, Xtract, that automatically acquires such collocations from large textual corpora and we have shown how they can be represented in a flexible lexicon using FUF.
    In FUF, cooccurrence constraints are expressed uniformly with syntactic and semantic constraints.
    The grammar's function is to satisfy these multiple constraints.
    We are currently working on extending Cook as well as developing a full sized from Xtract's output.
  
  
    We would like to thank Karen Kukich and the Computer Systems Research Division at Bell Communication Research for their help on the acquisition part of this work.
