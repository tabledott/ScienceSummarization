.
    By using a simple co-reference resolution tool adapted from (Soon et al., 2001), we add all the mentions referring to the target into the extended target set.
    2.
    Identifying the top K nouns and noun phrases which have the strongest association with the target.
    Here, we use Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to measure the association.
    Where p(w,t), p(w), and p(t) are probabilities of w and t co-occurring, w appearing, and t appearing in a tweet respectively.
    In the experiments, we estimate them on a tweet corpus containing 20 million tweets.
    We set K = 20 in the experiments based on empirical observations.
    3.
    Extracting head nouns of all extended targets, whose PMI values with the target are above some predefined threshold, as new extended targets.
    For instance, suppose we have found &#8220;Microsoft Technologies&#8221; as the extended target, we will further add &#8220;technologies&#8221; into the extended target set if the PMI value for &#8220;technologies&#8221; an
