    This collection process yielded 1112041 verb-object pairs.
    We selected then the subset involving the 1000 most frequent nouns in the corpus for clustering, and randomly divided it into a training set of 756721 pairs and a test set of 81240 pairs.
  
  
    Figure 3 plots the unweighted average relative entropy, in bits, of several test sets to asymmetD(4,112571), ric clustered models of different sizes, given by W&amp;quot;,'T L_anEArs where Aft is the set of direct objects in the test set and tn is the relative frequency distribution of verbs taking n as direct object in the test set.
    3 For each critical value of we show the relative entropy with respect to the asymmetric model based on Cp of the training set (set train), of randomly selected held-out test set (set iesi), and of held-out data for a further 1000 nouns that were not clustered (set new).
    Unsurprisingly, the training set relative entropy decr
