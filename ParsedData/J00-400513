 more recent value&amp;quot; (p. 3).
    (If both coreferred with the stock price, it would have followed that $4.02 and $3.85 are equal.)
    This solution, however, is still problematic.
    What, for instance, if the price continues to fall?
    Does the annotator have to go back to (4a), deciding that $3.82 is an even more recent value and the stock price does not stand in the IDENT relation with $3.85 after all?
    Remedy.
    At least three different strategies are conceivable.
    Perhaps most obviously, one might decide that coreference between a functional description like those in (3) or (4) and an NP denoting a value requires this value to be the present (rather than the most recent) value of the function.
    But, the text does not always say what the present value is.
    Moreover, functional descriptions do not always pertain to the present.
    In Last year, the president resigned, for example, the subject refers to last year's president, and consequently, it does not corefer with NPs referrin
