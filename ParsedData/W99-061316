 1X21 N and N is a &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot; sized number so that it is feasible to collect 0(N) unlabeled examples.
    Assume that the two classifiers are &amp;quot;rote learners&amp;quot;: that is, 1.1 and 12 are defined through look-up tables that list a label for each member of X1 or X2.
    The problem is a binary classification problem.
    The problem can be represented as a graph with 2N vertices corresponding to the members of X1 and X2.
    Each unlabeled pair (x1,i, x2,i) is represented as an edge between nodes corresponding to x1,i and X2,i in the graph.
    An edge indicates that the two features must have the same label.
    Given a sufficient number of randomly drawn unlabeled examples (i.e., edges), we will induce two completely connected components that together span the entire graph.
    Each vertex within a connected component must have the same label &#8212; in the binary classification case, we need a single labeled example to identify which component should get which label.
