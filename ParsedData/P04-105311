.
    Document frequency is the number of documents which include the word.
    If the norm of the context vector is extremely small due to a lack of content words, the cosine similarity between the vector and others might be unreliable.
    So, we also define a norm threshold in advance to eliminate short context vectors.
    The cosine similarity between context vectors and is calculated by the following formula.
    Cosine similarity varies from to .
    A cosine similarity of would mean these NE pairs have exactly the same context words with the NEs appearing predominantly in the same order, and a cosine similarity of would mean these NE pairs have exactly the same context words with the NEs appearing predominantly in reverse order.
    After we calculate the similarity among context vectors of NE pairs, we make clusters of NE pairs based on the similarity.
    We do not know how many clusters we should make in advance, so we adopt hierarchical clustering.
    Many clustering methods were proposed for hie
