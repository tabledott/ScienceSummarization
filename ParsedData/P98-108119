guage model: T is generally a better combiner than M and R,12 even though it has the lowest accuracy when operating alone.
    A possible criticism of the proposed combi11By a margin at the edge of significance: p=0.0608.
    12Although not significantly better, e.g. the differences within the group ME/ER/ET are not significant. nation scheme is the fact that for the most successful combination schemes, one has to reserve a non-trivial portion (in the experiment 10% of the total material) of the annotated data to set the parameters for the combination.
    To see whether this is in fact a good way to spend the extra data, we also trained the two best individual systems (E and M, with exactly the same settings as in the first experiments) on a concatenation of Train and Tune, so that they had access to every piece of data that the combination had seen.
    It turns out that the increase in the individual taggers is quite limited when compared to combination.
    The more extensively trained E scored 97.51% cor
