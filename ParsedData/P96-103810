    In the instructions, subjects were essentially asked to analyze the linguistic and intentional structures by segmenting the discourse, identifying the DSPs, and specifying the hierarchical relationships among segments.
  
  
    Labels on which all labelers in the group agreed are termed the CONSENSUS LABELS.3 The consensus labels for segment-initial (SBEG), segment-final (SF), and segment-medial (SCONT, defined as neither SBEG nor SF) phrase labels are given in Table 1.4 Note that group T and group S segmentations differ significantly, in contrast to earlier findings of Hirschberg and Grosz (1992) on a corpus of readaloud news stories and in support of informal findings of Swerts (1995).
    Table 1 shows that group S produced significantly more consensus boundaries for both read (p&lt;.001, x=58.8, df=1) and spontaneous (p&lt;.001, x=55.4, df=1) speech than did 3Use of consensus labels is a conservativ
