production for X and the expansion of the partial LHS A, which are together given by 7'.
    Note that the computation makes use of the inner probabilities computed in the forward pass.
    The particular way in which 7 and ,3 were defined turns out to be convenient here, as no reference to the production probabilities themselves needs to be made in the computation.
    As in the forward pass, simple reverse completion would not terminate in the presence of cyclic unit productions.
    A version that collapses all such chains of productions is given below. for all pairs of states 1Y -4 v. and kX A.Zp, in the chart, such that the unit production relation R(Z 4 Y) is nonzero.
    Then The first summation is carried out once for each state j : kX A.Z,u, whereas the second summation is applied for each choice of Z, but only if X AZp, is not itself a unit production, i.e., Aft c. Rationale.
    This increments 13&amp;quot; the equivalent of R(Z 4.
