to Taroo, and not to Hanako.
  Remember that the interpretation of zeros is indicated with parentheses.
  Example 3 a. Taroo wa b. Hanako o eiga ni sasoimasita.
  Taroo TOP/SUBJ Hanako OBJ movie to invited Taroo invited Hanako to the movie.
  Cb: TAROO Cf: [TAROO, HANAKO] 0 itiniti-zyuu nani mo te ni tukimasendesita.
  SUBJ all-day anything even hand to attached-not (Taroo) could not do anything all day.
  Cb: TAROO Cf: [TAROO] In example 3, the Cf from 3a contains the discourse ntity for Taroo as the first element and for Hanako as the second element.
  When the unexpressed argument is interpreted in 3b, the information from this Cf is used.
  Because the zero subject may REALIZE either Taroo or Hanako, both Constraint 3 and Rule 1 would be obeyed with either interpretation.
  11 However by interpreting the zero as Taroo, Taroo is the Cb, and it is possible to get a preferred CONTINUE interpretation Taroo could not do anything all day.
  In this interpretation, Taroo is both the Cb(3b) and the Cp(3b).
