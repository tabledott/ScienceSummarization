variants.
    For all language pairs, we see significant improvements in both BLEU and TER when segmentation lattices are used.5 Additionally, we also confirmed previous findings that showed that when a large amount of training data is available, moving to a one-best segmentation does not yield substantial improvements (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).
    Perhaps most surprisingly, the improvements observed when using lattices with the Hungarian and Turkish systems were larger than the corresponding improvement in the German system, but German was the only language for which we had segmentation training data.
    The smaller effect in German is probably due to there being more in-domain training data in the German system than in the (otherwise comparably sized) Hungarian system.
    Targeted analysis of the translation output shows that while both the 1BEST and LATTICE systems generally produce adequate translations of compound words that are out of vocabulary in the BASELINE system, the LATTICE system performs be
