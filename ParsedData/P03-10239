actic, semantic and positional relationships of an anaphor and any one of its candidates.
    Besides, the feature set may also contain intercandidate features characterizing the relationships between the pair of candidates, e.g. the distance between the candidates in the number distances or paragraphs.
    Based on the feature vectors generated for each anaphor encountered in the training data set, a classifier can be trained using a certain machine learning algorithm, such as C4.5, RIPPER, etc.
    Given the feature vector of a test instance inst(ci, cj , ana ) (i &gt; j), the classifier returns the positive class indicating that Ci is preferred to Cj as the antecedent of ana; or negative indicating that Cj is preferred.
    Let CR( inst(ci , cj , ana)) denote the classification result for an instance inst(ci, cj , ana ) .
    The antecedent of an anaphor is identified using the algorithm shown in Figure 1.
