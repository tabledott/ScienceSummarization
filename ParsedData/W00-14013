n the other hand correlate with empirically verified human judgments in qualitative categories such as readability.
    The structure of the paper is as follows.
    In Section 2. we briefly describe the architecture of FERGUS, and some of the modules.
    In Section 3 we present four metrics and some results obtained with these metrics.
    In Section 4 we discuss the for experimental validation of the metrics using human judgments. and present a new metric based on the results of these experiments.
    In Section 5 we discuss some, of the -many problematic issues related to the use of metrics and our metrics in particular, and discuss on-going work.
  
  
    FERGUS is composed of three modules:. the Tree Chooser, the Unraveler, and the Linear Precedence (LP) Chooser (Figure 1).
    The input to the system is a dependency tree as shown in Figure 2.1 Note that the nodes are unordered and are labeled only with lexemes, not with any sort of syntactic annotations.2 The Tree Chooser uses a stochastic tree model
