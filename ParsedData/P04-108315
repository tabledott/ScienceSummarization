 in one language from a parser in another (L&#168;u et al., 2002).
    The application that is most relevant to this paper is bootstrapping an -dimensional grammar.
    In theory, it is possible to induce a PMTG from multitext in an unsupervised manner.
    A more reliable way is to start from a corpus of multitrees &#8212; a multitreebank.3 We are not aware of any multitreebanks at this time.
    The most straightforward way to create one is to parse some multitext using a synchronous parser, such as Parser C. However, if the goal is to bootstrap an-PMTG, then there is no-PMTG that can evaluate the terms in the parser&#8217;s logic.
    Our solution is to orchestrate lower-dimensional knowledge sources to evaluate the terms.
    Then, we can use the same parsing logic to synchronize multitext into a multitreebank.
    To illustrate, we describe a relatively simple synchronizer, using the Viterbi-derivation semiring.4 Under this semiring, a synchronizer computes the single most probable multitree for a given
