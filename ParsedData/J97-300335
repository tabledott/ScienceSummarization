ouns (NN) if they were not capitalized inside a sentence and proper nouns (NNP) otherwise.
    When we used the cascading guesser with the Brill tagger we interfaced them on the level of the lexicon: we guessed the unknown words before the tagging and added them to the lexicon listing the most likely tags first as required.'
    Here we want to clarify that we evaluated the overall results of the Brill tagger rather than just its unknown-word tagging component.
    Another point to mention is that, since we included the guessed words in the lexicon, the Brill tagger could use for the transformations all relevant POStags for unknown words.
    This is quite different from the output of the original Brill's guesser, which provides only one POS-tag for an unknown word.
    In our tagging experiments, we measured the error rate of tagging on unknown words using different guessers.
    Since, arguably, the guessing of proper nouns is easier than is the guessing of other categories, we also measured the error rate
