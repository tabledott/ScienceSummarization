ction in itself.
    Examining our categories at random, we found a nice example that shows how difficult it is to evaluate the task and how useful automatic category discovery can be, as opposed to manual definition.
    Consider the following category, discovered in the Dmoz corpus: {nightcrawlers, chicken, shrimp, liver, leeches}.
    We did not know why these words were grouped together; if asked in an evaluation, we would give the category a very low score.
    However, after some web search, we found that this is a &#8216;fish bait&#8217; category, especially suitable for catfish.
  
  
    We have presented a novel method for patternbased discovery of lexical semantic categories.
    It is the first pattern-based lexical acquisition method that is fully unsupervised, requiring no corpus annotation or manually provided patterns or words.
    Pattern candidates are discovered using meta-patterns of high frequency and content words, and symmetric patterns are discovered using simple graph-theoretic measur
