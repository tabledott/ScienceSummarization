 Section 4 presents the MGIZA++ implementation, followed by the profile and evaluation results of both systems in section 5.
    Finally, conclusion and future work are presented in section 6.
  
  
    GIZA++ aligns words based on statistical models.
    Given a source string fJ1 = f1, &#183; &#183; &#183; , fj, &#183; &#183; &#183; , fJ and a target string eI1 = e1, &#183; &#183; &#183; , ei, &#183; &#183; &#183; , eI, an alignment A of the two strings is defined as(Och and Ney, 2003): A C {(j,i) : j = 1,&#183;&#183;&#183;,J;i = 0,&#183;&#183;&#183;,I} (1) in case that i = 0 in some (j, i) E A, it represents that the source word j aligns to an &#8220;empty&#8221; target word e0.
    In statistical world alignment, the probability of a source sentence given target sentence is written as: in which aJ1 denotes the alignment on the sentence pair.
    In order to express the probability in statistical way, several different parametric forms of P(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1) = p&#952;(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1) have been proposed, and t
