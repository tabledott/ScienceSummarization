rabar and Zweigenbaum (1999) use the SNOMED corpus of semantically-arranged medical terms to find semantically-motivated morphological relationships.
    Also, Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) obtained outstanding results at inducing English past tense after beginning with a list of the open class roots in the language, a table of a language&#8217;s inflectional parts of speech, and the canonical suffixes for each part of speech.
    A second, knowledge-free category of research has focused on obtaining affix inventories.
    Brent, et al. (1995) used minimum description length (MDL) to find the most data-compressing suffixes.
    Kazakov (1997) does something akin to this using MDL as a fitness metric for evolutionary computing.
    D&#233;Jean (1998) uses a strategy similar to that of Harris (1951).
    He declares that a stem has ended when the number of characters following it exceed some given threshold and identifies any residual following semantic relations, we identified those word pairs the stems as s
