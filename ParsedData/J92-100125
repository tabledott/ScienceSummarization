s.
    They also provide some of the information required to verify and interpret collocations.
    Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, below, describe sources of information that enable a system to recognize role-based preferences, collocations, and the semantic context.
    The concept hierarchy serves several purposes.
    First, it associates word senses that are siblings or otherwise closely related in the hierarchy, thus providing a thesaurus for information retrieval and other tasks (cf.
    Fox et al. 1988).
    In a sense tagging system, these associations can help determine the semantic context.
    Second, it supplies the basic ontology to which domain knowledge can be associated, so that each new domain requires only incremental knowledge engineering.
    Third, it allows role-based preferences, wherever possible, to apply to groups of word senses rather than just individual lexical entries.
    To see how the hierarchy's concept definitions establish the basic ontology, consider Figure 3, the definition
