			Adding the noisy data hurts all methods, butthe Jeopardy model maintains its lead and consis tently suffers less damage than Cui et al (2005).

			5.5 Summing vs. Maximizing.
			Unlike most previous work, our model does not try to find a single correspondence between words in the question and words in the answer, during training or during testing.
			An alternative method might choose the best (most probable) alignment, rather than the sum of all alignment scores.
			This involves a slight change to Equation 3, replacing the summation with a maximization.
			The change could be made during training, during testing, or both.
			Table 3 shows that summing is preferable, especially during training.
	
	
			The key experimental result of this work is that loose syntactic transformations are an effective way to carry out statistical question answering.One unique advantage of our model is
