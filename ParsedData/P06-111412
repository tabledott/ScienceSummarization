for two of the aligned elements from Figure 3 are presented in Table 3.
    Finally, the Classification Module employs a decision tree classifier in order to determine whether an entailment relationship exists for each pair of texts.
    This classifier is learned using features extracted from the previous modules, including features derived from (1) the (lexical) alignment of the texts, (2) syntactic and semantic dependencies discovered in each text passage, (3) paraphrases derived from web documents, and (4) semantic and pragmatic annotations.
    (A complete list of features can be found in Figure 4.)
    Based on these features, the classifier outputs both an entailment judgment (either yes or no) and a confidence value, which is used to rank answers or paragraphs in the architecture illustrated in Figure 1.
    Several approaches to the RTE task have argued that the recognition of textual entailment can be enhanced when systems are able to identify &#8211; or align &#8211; corresponding entities, predica
