lity is more sensitive to perturbations in the source and target spaces.
    Note that even when corpora are derived from parallel sources, no explicit use is ever made of document or sentence-level alignments.
    In particular, our method is robust to permutations of the sentences in the corpora.
    Each experiment requires a lexicon for evaluation.
    Following Koehn and Knight (2002), we consider lexicons over only noun word types, although this is not a fundamental limitation of our model.
    We consider a word type to be a noun if its most common tag is a noun in our monolingual corpus.11 For all languages pairs except English-Arabic, we extract evaluation lexicons from the Wiktionary online dictionary.
    As we discuss in section 7, our extracted lexicons have low coverage, particularly for proper nouns, and thus all performance measures are (sometimes substantially) pessimistic.
    For EnglishArabic, we extract a lexicon from 100k parallel sentences of UN parallel corpora by running the HMM inter
