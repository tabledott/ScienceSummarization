while for the others, there is an earlier peak.
    Also shown is an upper bound (the target trees are not all binary and so any all-binary system will overpropose constituents).
    Klein and Manning (2002) gives comparative numbers showing that the basic CCM outperforms other recent systems on the ATIS corpus (which many other constituency induction systems have reported on).
    While absolute numbers are hard to compare across corpora, all the systems compared to in Klein and Manning (2002) parsed below a right-branching baseline, while the CCM is substantially above it.
  
  
    The two models described above have some common ground.
    Both can be seen as models over lexicalized trees composed of the configurations in figure 4.
    For the DMV, it is already a model over these structures.
    At the &#8220;attachment&#8221; rewrite for the CCM in (a/b), we assign the quantity: which is the odds ratio of generating the subsequence and context for span hi, ki as a constituent as opposed to a non-constit
