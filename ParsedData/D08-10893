			The phrase of the region should swap with the rest of the noun phrase, yet these previous approaches are unable to model this movement, and assume the orientation of this phrase is discontinuous (D).
			Observe that, in a shortened version of the same sentence (withoutand progress), the phrase orientation would be different (S), even though the shortened version has es sentially the same sentence structure.
			Coming from the other direction, such observations about phrase reordering between different languages are precisely the kinds of facts that parsing approaches to machinetranslation are designed to handle and do success fully handle (Wu, 1997; Melamed, 2003; Chiang, 2005).
			In this paper, we introduce a novel orientationmodel for phrase-based systems that aims to bet ter capture long distance dependencies, and that presents a solution to the problem illustrated in Fig.

			In this example, our reordering modeleffectively treats the adjacent phrases the develop ment and and p
