 of any word in the corpus containing a sense marked with that code.
    Disambiguation is carried out by examining the same 100 word context window for an ambiguous word and comparing it against the models for each of its possible categories.
    Further details may be found in Yarowsky (1992).
    Yarowsky reports 92% correct disambiguation over 12 test words, with an average of three possible Roget large categories.
    However, LDOCE has a higher level of average ambiguity and does not contain as complete a thesaural hierarchy as Roget, so we would not expect such good results when the algorithm is adapted to LDOCE.
    Consequently, we implemented the approach as a partial tagger.
    The algorithm identifies the most likely pragmatic code and returns the set of senses which are marked with that code.
    In LDOCE, several senses of a word may be marked with the same pragmatic code, so this partial tagger may return more than one sense for an ambiguous word.
    The final disambiguation module is the onl
