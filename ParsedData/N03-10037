tel (2001) extract inference rules, which are related to paraphrases (for example, X wrote Y implies X is the author of Y), to improve question answering.
    They assume that paths in dependency trees that take similar arguments (leaves) are close in meaning.
    However, only two-argument templates are considered.
    Shinyama et al. (2002) also use dependency-tree information to extract templates of a limited form (in their case, determined by the underlying information extraction application).
    Like us (and unlike Lin and Pantel, who employ a single large corpus), they use articles written about the same event in different newspapers as data.
    Our approach shares two characteristics with the two methods just described: pattern comparison by analysis of the patterns&#8217; respective arguments, and use of nonparallel corpora as a data source.
    However, extraction methods are not easily extended to generation methods.
    One problem is that their templates often only match small fragments of a sen
