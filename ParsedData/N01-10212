le 3 Sentence processing is eager.
    &#8220;Eager&#8221; in this sense means the experimental situations to be modeled are ones like self-paced reading in which sentence comprehenders are unrushed and no information is ignored at a point at which it could be used.
    The proposal is that a person&#8217;s difficulty perceiving syntactic structure be modeled by word-toword surprisal (Attneave, 1959, page 6) which can be directly computed from a probabilistic phrasestructure grammar.
    The approach taken here uses a parsing algorithm developed by Stolcke.
    In the course of explaining the algorithm at a very high level I will indicate how the algorithm, interpreted as a psycholinguistic model, observes each principle.
    After that will come some simulation results, and then a conclusion.
  
  
    Stolcke&#8217;s parsing algorithm was initially applied as a component of an automatic speech recognition system.
    In speech recognition, one is often interested in the probability that some word will follo
