ents reported here is the same as the one used for other experiments reported in this paper.
    The results in Table 3 illustrate how the language model performs reasonably well for local reorderings (e.g., for s = 3 and w = 4), but its perfromance deteriorates as we relax the reordering restrictions by increasing the reordering window size (w).
    Table 4 shows some examples of original English, English in Arabic order, and the decoder output for two different sets of reordering parameters.
    The phrases in the phrase dictionary we use in the experiments reported here are a combination of phrases automatically extracted from maximumposterior alignments and maximum entropy alignments.
    Only phrases that conform to the so-called consistent alignment restrictions (Och et al., 1999) are extracted.
    Table 5 shows BLEU scores for our SMT decoder with different parameter settings for skip s, window width w, with and without our distortion model.
    The BLEU scores reported in this table are based on 4 re
