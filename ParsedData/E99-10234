n be recovered by combining this format with one of the bracketing formats.
    Our three partial representations are: All baseNP-initial words receive an [ tag, other words receive a . tag.
    All baseNP-final words receive a ] tag, other words receive a . tag.
    I0 Words inside a baseNP receive an I tag, others receive an 0 tag.
    These partial representations can be combined in three pairs which encode the complete baseNP structure of the data: A word sequence is regarded as a baseNP if the first word has received an [ tag, the final word has received a ] tag and these are the only brackets that have been assigned to words in the sequence.
    [ + JO In the 10 format, tags of words that have received an I tag and an [ tag are changed into B tags.
    The result is interpreted as the 10B2 format.
    10 + ] In the JO format, tags of words that have received an I tag and a ] tag are changed into E tags.
    The result is interpreted as the 10E2 format.
