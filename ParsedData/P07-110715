ement its activity score by 1, and every time we move to generate the next mention, all activity scores decay by a constant factor of 0.5.
    This gives rise to an ordered list of entity activations, L, where the rank of an entity decays exponentially as new mentions are generated.
    We call this list a salience list.
    Given a salience list, L, each possible entity z has some rank on this list.
    We discretize these ranks into five buckets S: TOP (1), HIGH (23), MID (4-6), LOW (7+), and NONE.
    Given the entity choices Z, both the list L and buckets S are deterministic (see figure 4).
    We assume that the mention type M is conditioned on S as shown in figure 4.
    We note that correctly sampling an entity now requires that we incorporate terms for how a change will affect all future salience values.
    This changes our sampling equation for existing entities: where the product ranges over future mentions in the document and Si,j, is the value of future salience feature given the setting of all e
