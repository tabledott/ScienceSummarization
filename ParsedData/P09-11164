ithm with a similar objective function as the Brown algorithm.
    It substantially increases the number of elements that can be clustered.
    However, since it still needs to load the current clustering of all elements into each of the workers in the distributed system, the memory requirement becomes a bottleneck.
    We present a distributed version of a much simpler K-Means clustering that allows us to cluster tens of millions of elements.
    We demonstrate the advantages of phrase-based clusters over word-based ones with experimental results from two distinct application domains: named entity recognition and query classification.
    Our named entity recognition system achieves an F1-score of 90.90 on the CoNLL 2003 English data set, which is about 1 point higher than the previous best result.
    Our query classifier reaches the same level of performance as the KDDCUP 2005 winning systems, which were built with a great deal of knowledge engineering.
  
  
    K-Means clustering (MacQueen 1967) is one o
