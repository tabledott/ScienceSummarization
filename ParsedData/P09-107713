containing &#8220;but&#8221; as one of their elements in fact signal the presence of a relation that is not Contrast.
    Consider the example shown below: The government says it has reached most isolated townships by now, but because roads are blocked, getting anything but basic food supplies to people remains difficult.
    Following Marcu and Echihabi (2001), the pair [The government says it has reached most isolated townships by now, but] and [roads are blocked, getting anything but basic food supplies to people remains difficult.] is created as an example of the Cause relation.
    Because of examples like this, &#8220;but-but&#8221; is a very useful word pair feature indicating Cause, as the but would have been removed for the artifical Contrast examples.
    In fact, the top 17 features for classifying Contrast versus Other all contain the word &#8220;but&#8221;, and are indications that the relation is Other.
    These findings indicate an unexpected anomalous effect in the use of synthetic data.
