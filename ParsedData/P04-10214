paradigm of noisy channel model (NCM).
    For a given English name E as the observed channel output, one seeks a posteriori the most likely Chinese transliteration C that maximizes P(C|E).
    Applying Bayes rule, it means to find C to maximize with equivalent effect.
    To do so, we are left with modeling two probability distributions: P(E|C), the probability of transliterating C to E through a noisy channel, which is also called transformation rules, and P(C), the probability distribution of source, which reflects what is considered good Chinese transliteration in general.
    Likewise, in C2E backtransliteration, we would find E that maximizes for a given Chinese name.
    In eqn (1) and (2), P(C) and P(E) are usually estimated using n-gram language models (Jelinek, 1991).
    Inspired by research results of grapheme-tophoneme research in speech synthesis literature, many have suggested phoneme-based approaches to resolving P(E|C) and P(C|E), which approximates the probability distribution by introducing
