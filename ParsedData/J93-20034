rk in bilingual lexicography and machine translation.
    Section 2 is a synopsis of our statistical approach to machine translation.
    Following this synopsis, we develop some terminology and notation for describing the word-byword alignment of pairs of sentences.
    In Section 4 we describe our series of models of the translation process and give an informal discussion of the algorithms by which we estimate their parameters from data.
    We have written Section 4 with two aims in mind: first, to provide the interested reader with sufficient detail to reproduce our results, and second, to hold the mathematics at the level of college calculus.
    A few more difficult parts of the discussion have been postponed to the Appendix.
    In Section 5, we present results obtained by estimating the parameters for these models from a large collection of aligned pairs of sentences from the Canadian Hansard data (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991).
    For a number of English words, we show translation probabilities that
