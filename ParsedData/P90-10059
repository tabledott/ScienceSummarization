nd therefore the domain of the corresponding node is a singleton set f &lt;ROOT,nil&gt;1.
    In the figure, values are abbreviated by concatenating the initial letter of the label and the modifiee, such as Rnil for &lt;P.00T , nil&gt;, 01 for &lt;OBJ 1&gt;, and so on.
    An arc in a constraint network represents a binary constraint imposed on two roles.
    Each arc is associated with a two-dimensional matrix called a constraint matrix, whose xy-elements are either 1 or 0.
    The rows and the columns correspond to the possible values of each of the two roles.
    The value 0 indicates that this particular combination of role values violates the binary constraints.
    A constraint matrix is calculated by generating every possible pair of values and by checking its validity according to the binary constraints.
    For example, the case in which governor(PP3) = &lt;1,0C,1&gt; and governor(PP 4) = &lt;P0STM0D,2&gt; violates the binary constraint (G2a-6), so the 1,1-P2 element of the constraint matrix between
