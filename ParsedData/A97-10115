 To solve the problems, we developed a more powerful rule formalism which utilises an explicit dependency representation.
    The basic Constraint Gram'The convention in the Constraint Grammar is that the tags for syntactic functions begin with the 0-sign. mar idea of introducing the information in a piecemeal fashion is retained, but the integration of different pieces of information is more efficient in the new system.
    3 Dependency grammars in a nutshell Our notation follows the classical model of dependency theory (Heringer, 1993) introduced by Lucien Tesniere (1959) and later advocated by Igor Mel'auk (1987).
    In Tesniere's and Mel'auk's dependency notation every element of the dependency tree has a unique head.
    The verb serves as the head of a clause and the top element of the sentence is thus the main verb of the main clause.
    In some other theories, e.g.
    Hudson (1991), several heads are allowed.
    Projectivity (or adjacency4) was not an issue for Tesniere (1959, ch.
    10), because
