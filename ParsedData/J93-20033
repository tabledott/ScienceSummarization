er of words that the sentences contain, while Gale and Church base a similar algorithm on the number of characters that the sentences contain.
    The lesson to be learned from these two efforts is that simple, statistical methods can be surprisingly successful in achieving linguistically interesting goals.
    Here, we address a natural extension of that work: matching up the words within pairs of aligned sentences.
    In recent papers, Brown et al. (1988, 1990) propose a statistical approach to machine translation from French to English.
    In the latter of these papers, they sketch an algorithm for estimating the probability that an English word will be translated into any particular French word and show that such probabilities, once estimated, can be used together with a statistical model of the translation process to align the words in an English sentence with the words in its French translation (see their Figure 3).
    Pairs of sentences with words aligned in this way offer a valuable resource for wo
