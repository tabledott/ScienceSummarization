    Our paraphrase model was trained using the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005).
    We used ten parallel corpora between English and (each of) Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish, with approximately 30 million words per language for a total of 315 million English words.

    The English side of each parallel corpus was parsed using the Bikel parser (Bikel, 2002).
    A total of 1.6 million unique sentences were parsed.
    A trigram language model was trained on these English sentences using the SRI language modeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
    The paraphrase model and language model for the Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) baseline were trained on the same data to ensure a fair comparison.
    The test set was the English portion of test sets used in the shared translation task of the ACL2007 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (Callison-Burch e
