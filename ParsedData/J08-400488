 some started with the word so, some started with we, some with ship, and some with one.
    We tested a number of ways to measure partial agreement on this task, and obtained widely different results.
    First of all, we tested three set-based distance metrics inspired by the Passonneau proposals that we just discussed: We considered discourse segments to be sets of words, and computed the distance between them using Passonneau&#8217;s metric, Jaccard, and Dice.
    Using these three metrics, we obtained &#945; values of 0.55 (with Passonneau&#8217;s metric), 0.45 (with Jaccard), and 0.55 (with Dice).
    We should note that because antecedents of different expressions rarely overlapped, the expected disagreement was close to 1 (maximal), so the value of &#945; turned out to be very close to the complement of the observed disagreement as calculated by the different distance metrics.
    Next, we considered methods based on the position of words in the text.
    The first method computed differences between
