    Our determination of path coreference can be considered a bootstrapping procedure.
    Furthermore, the coreferent paths themselves can serve as the seed for bootstrapping additional coreference information.
    In this section, we sketch previous approaches to bootstrapping in coreference resolution and explain our new ideas.
    Coreference bootstrapping works by assuming resolutions in unlabelled text, acquiring information from the putative resolutions, and then making inferences from the aggregate statistical data.
    For example, we assumed two pronouns from the same pronoun group were coreferent, and deduced path coreference from the accumulated counts.
    The potential of the bootstrapping approach can best be appreciated by imagining millions of documents with coreference annotations.
    With such a set, we could extract fine-grained features, perhaps tied to individual words or paths.
    For example, we could estimate the likelihood each noun belongs to a partic
