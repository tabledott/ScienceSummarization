that bill is being used in the legislative sense.
    However, a computer program attempting to perform the same task faces a difficult problem since it does not have the benefit of innate common&#8212;sense or linguistic knowledge.
    Rather than attempting to provide computer programs with real&#8212;world knowledge comparable to that of humans, natural language processing has turned to corpus&#8212;based methods.
    These approaches use techniques from statistics and machine learning to induce models of language usage from large samples of text.
    These models are trained to perform particular tasks, usually via supervised learning.
    This paper describes an approach where a decision tree is learned from some number of sentences where each instance of an ambiguous word has been manually annotated with a sense&#8212;tag that denotes the most appropriate sense for that context.
    Prior to learning, the sense&#8212;tagged corpus must be converted into a more regular form suitable for automatic process
