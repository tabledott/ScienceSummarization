 that the extra-linguistic strategies employed to combine the available linguistic knowledge sources play an important role in computational approaches to coreference resolution.
    In particular, our results suggest that additional performance gains might be obtained by further investigating the interaction between training instance selection, feature selection, and the coreference clustering algorithm.
  
  
    This section describes the second major extension to the Soon approach investigated here: we explore the effect of including 41 additional, potentially useful knowledge sources for the coreference resolution classifier (Table 3).
    The features were not derived empirically from the corpus, but were based on common-sense knowledge and linguistic intuitions regarding coreference.
    Specifically, we increase the number of lexical features to nine to allow more complex NP string matching operations.
    In addition, we include four new semantic features to allow finer-grained semantic compatibility
