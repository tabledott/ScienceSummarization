osite of what we expect; for instance, loosening thresholds may lead to faster parsing, because we don't need to parse the sentence, fail, and then retry with looser thresholds.
    The full algorithm contains additional checks that our thresholding change had the effect we expected (either increased time for decreased entropy or vice versa).
    If we get either a change in the wrong direction, or a change that makes everything worse, then we retry with the inverse change, hoping that that will have the intended effect.
    If we get a change that makes both time and entropy better, then we make that change regardless of the ratio.
    Also, we need to do checks that the denominator when computing Ratio isn't too small.
    If it is very small, then our estimate may be unreliable, and we don't consider changing this parameter.
    Finally, the actual algorithm we used also contained a simple &amp;quot;annealing schedule&amp;quot;, in which we slowly decreased the factor by which we changed thresholds.
