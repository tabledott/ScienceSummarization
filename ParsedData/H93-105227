of-speech, distance, and sample frequency.
  We discussed the implications of these results for data set creation and algorithm design, identifying potential weaknesses in the common "bag of words" approach to disambiguation.
  Finally, we showed that models of local collocation can be combined in a disambiguation algorithm that achieves overall precision of 92%.
