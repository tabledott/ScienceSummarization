 of derivation step, and then compute new rule probability estimates as appropriate ratios of those expected frequency estimates.
    Since these are most conveniently expressed as relative frequencies, they are a bit loosely referred to as inside and outside probabilities.
    More precisely, for each w E W, the inside probability 1; (i, i) estimates the likelihood that Ap derives 1w2, while the outside probability Cr; (i, j) estimates the likelihood of deriving sentential form owi Ap jw from the start symbol Al.
    In adapting the inside-outside algorithm to partially bracketed training text, we must take into account the constraints that the bracketing imposes on possible derivations, and thus on possible phrases.
    Clearly, nonzero values for 1'(i, j) or ON, j) should only be allowed if iwi is compatible with the bracketing of w, or, equivalently, if (i, j) is valid for the bracketing of w. Therefore, we will in the following assume a corpus C of bracketed strings c = (w, B), and will modify the standa
