ge test sets (Blatz et al., 2003).
    Kulesza and Shieber (2004) use a machine learning approach to improve the correlation at the sentence level.
    Their method, based on the assumption that higher classification accuracy in discriminating human- from machine-generated translations will yield closer correlation with human judgments, uses support vector machine (SVM) based learning to weight multiple metrics such as BLEU, NIST, and WER (minimal word error rate).
    The SVM is trained for differentiating the MT hypothesis and the professional human translations, and then the distance from the hypothesis&#8217;s metric vector to the hyper-plane of the trained SVM is taken as the final score for the hypothesis.
    While the machine learning approach improves correlation with human judgments, all the metrics discussed are based on the same type of information: n-gram subsequences of the hypothesis translations.
    This type of feature cannot capture the grammaticality of the sentence, in part because they d
