 techniques from the Prolog literature might be useful here.
  Nothing has been said al~out he importartt problem of guaranteeing that the syntactic and semantic goal properties will actually be real- ized in the sentence generated.
  The success criterion for generation described here would require that the logical form for the sentence generated be identical to the goal logical form.
  However, there is no guarantee that the other properties of the sentence include those of the goal; only compatibility is guaranteed.
  Researchers at the Univer- sity of Stuttgart have proposed solutions to this problem based on the type of existential constraint found in lexieal-functional grammar.
  We expect hat their methods might be applicable within th~ presented architecture.
  Finally, on a more pessimistic note, we turn to a widespread problem in all systems for automatic generation of natural language, which Ap- pelt [1987] has discussed under the rubric "the problem of logical-form equivalence".
