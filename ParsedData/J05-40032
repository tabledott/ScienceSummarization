 lexical acquisition (Gale and Church 1991; Melamed 1997), crosslanguage information retrieval (Davis and Dunning 1995; Oard 1997), and annotation projection (Diab and Resnik 2002; Yarowsky and Ngai 2001; Yarowsky, Ngai, and Wicentowski 2001).
    Unfortunately, parallel texts are also scarce resources: limited in size, language coverage, and language register.
    There are relatively few language pairs for which parallel corpora of reasonable sizes are available; and even for those pairs, the corpora come mostly from one domain, that of political discourse (proceedings of the Canadian or European Parliament, or of the United Nations).
    This is especially problematic for the field of statistical machine translation (SMT), because translation systems trained on data from a particular domain (e.g., parliamentary proceedings) will perform poorly when translating texts from a different domain (e.g., news articles).
    One way to alleviate this lack of parallel data is to exploit a much more available and div
