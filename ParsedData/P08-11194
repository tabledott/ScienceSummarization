re then ranked based on properties of the HPLG.
    We conducted experiments with four semantic classes, achieving high accuracies and outperforming the results reported by others who have worked on the same classes.
  
  
    A substantial amount of research has been done in the area of semantic class learning, under a variety of different names and with a variety of different goals.
    Given the great deal of similar work in information extraction and ontology learning, we focus here only on techniques for weakly supervised or unsupervised semantic class (i.e., supertype-based) learning, since that is most related to the work in this paper.
    Fully unsupervised semantic clustering (e.g., (Lin, 1998; Lin and Pantel, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006)) has the disadvantage that it may or may not produce the types and granularities of semantic classes desired by a user.
    Another related line of work is automated ontology construction, which aims to create lexical hierarchies based on semantic classes (e.
