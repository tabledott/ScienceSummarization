ed. in figure 1, is based on a comprehensive corpus analysis of more than 450 discourse markers and 7900 text fragments (see (Marcu, 1997b) for details) When given a text, the rhetorical parser determines first the discourse markers and the elementary units that make up that text The parser uses then the information derived from the corpus analysis in order to hypothesize rhetoncal relations among the elementary units In the end, the parser applies a constraint-satisfaction procedure to detemune the text structures that are valid If more than one valid structure is found, the parser chooses one that is the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; according to a given metric The details of the algorithms that INPUT a text T I Determine the set D of all discourse markers in T and the set UT of elementary textual units in T 2 Hypothesize a set of relations R between the elements of UT 3 Determine the set ValTrees of all valid RS-trees of T that can be built using relations from R 4 Determine the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; RS-tree
