ifferently from detailed analyses of specific discourse phenomena in depth, such as anaphoric relations (Garside et al., 1997) or style types (Leech et al., 1997); analysis of a single text from multiple perspectives (Mann and Thompson, 1992); or illustrations of a theoretical model on a single representative text (Britton and Black, 1985; Van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983).
    Our annotation work is grounded in the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) framework (Mann and Thompson, 1988).
    We decided to use RST for three reasons: can play a crucial role in building natural language generation systems (Novy, 1993; Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore, 1995) and text summarization systems (Marcu, 2000); can be used to increase the naturalness of machine translation outputs (Marcu et al. 2000); and can be used to build essayscoring systems that provide students with discourse-based feedback (Burstein et al., 2001).
    We suspect that RST trees can be exploited successfully in the context of other applications as well.
