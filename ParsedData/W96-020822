nstance-based methods that weight features based on their predictive ability have also been developed (Aha et al., 1991).
    Therefore, our results indicate that lexical disambiguation is perhaps best performed using methods that combine weighted evidence from all of the features rather tures actually present in the examples.
    Without this optimization, testing would have been several orders of magnitude slower. than making a decision by testing only a small subset of highly predictive features.
    Among the other methods tested, decision lists seem to perform the best.
    The ordering of rules employed in a decision list in order to simplify the representation and perform conflict resolution apparently gives it an advantage over other symbolic methods on this task.
    In addition to the results reported by Yarowsky (1994) and Mooney and Calif (1995), it provides evidence for the utility of this representation for natural-language problems.
    With respect to training time, the symbolic methods are si
