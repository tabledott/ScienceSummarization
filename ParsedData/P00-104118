    This paper has presented an alternative to extractive summarization: an approach that makes it possible to generate coherent summaries that are shorter than a single sentence and that attempt to conform to a particular style.
    Our approach applies statistical models of the term selection and term ordering processes to produce short summaries, shorter than those reported previously.
    Furthermore, with a slight generalization of the system described here, the summaries need not contain any of the words in the original document, unlike previous statistical summarization systems.
    Given good training corpora, this approach can also be used to generate headlines from a variety of formats: in one case, we experimented with corpora that contained Japanese documents and English headlines.
    This resulted in a working system that could simultaneously translate and summarize Japanese documents.8 The performance of the system could be improved by improving either content selection or linearization
