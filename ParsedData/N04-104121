    Current state of the art concept discovery algorithms generate lists of instances of semantic classes but stop short of labeling the classes with concept names.
    Class labels would serve useful in applications such as question answering to map a question concept into a semantic class and then search for answers within that class.
    We propose here an algorithm for automatically labeling concepts that searches for syntactic patterns within a grammatical template for a class.
    Of the 1432 noun concepts discovered by CBC, our system labelled 98.5% of them with an NRR score of 77.1% in a human evaluation.
    Hyponym relationships were then easily extracted, one for each instance/concept label pair.
    We extracted 159,000 hyponyms and achieved a precision of 68%.
    On a subset of 65,000 proper names, our performance was 81.5%.
    This work forms an important attempt to building large-scale semantic knowledge bases.
