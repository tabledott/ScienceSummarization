and for the yes/no judgments it was substantial.7 For the intraannotator agreement K indicated that people had moderate consistency with their previous judgments on the sentence ranking task, substantial consistency with their previous constituent ranking judgments, and nearly perfect consistency with their previous yes/no judgments.
    These K values indicate that people are able to more reliably make simple yes/no judgments about the translations of short phrases than they are to rank phrases or whole sentences.
    While this is an interesting observation, we do not recommend doing away with the sentence ranking judgments.
    The higher agreement on the constituent-based evaluation may be influenced based on the selection criteria for which phrases were selected for evaluation (see Section 3.2).
    Additionally, the judgments of the short phrases are not a great substitute for sentence-level rankings, at least in the way we collected them.
    The average correlation coefficient between the constituent-
