e taggers based on a pure HMM is that developed at Xerox (Cutting et al., 1992).
    An important aspect of this tagger is that it will give good accuracy with a minimal amount of manually tagged training data.
    96% accuracy correct assignment of tags to word token, compared with a human annotator, is quoted, over a 500000 word corpus.
    The Xerox tagger attempts to avoid the need for a hand-tagged training corpus as far as possible.
    Instead, an approximate model is constructed by hand, which is then improved by BW re-estimation on an untagged training corpus.
    In the above example, 8 iterations were sufficient.
    The initial model set up so that some transitions and some tags in the lexicon are favoured, and hence having a higher initial probability.
    Convergence of the model is improved by keeping the number of parameters in the model down.
    To assist in this, low frequency items in the lexicon are grouped together into equivalence classes, such that all words in a given equivalence clas
