 run an experiment as similar as possible in setup to Koehn and Knight (2002), using English Gigaword and German Europarl.
    In this setting, our MCCA system yielded 61.7% accuracy on the 186 most confident predictions compared to 39% reported in Koehn and Knight (2002).
  
  
    We have presented a novel generative model for bilingual lexicon induction and presented results under a variety of data conditions (section 6.1) and languages (section 6.3) showing that our system can produce accurate lexicons even in highly adverse conditions.
    In this section, we broadly characterize and analyze the behavior of our system.
    We manually examined the top 100 errors in the English-Spanish lexicon produced by our system on EN-ES-W. Of the top 100 errors: 21 were correct translations not contained in the Wiktionary lexicon (e.g. pintura to painting), 4 were purely morphological errors (e.g. airport to aeropuertos), 30 were semantically related (e.g. basketball to b&#180;eisbol), 15 were words with strong ortho
