 a different measure from the backed-off estimate which gives 73(iiv,p, n1).
    The backed-off method based on just the f(v,p) and Anil, p) counts would be: If P(11v,n1,p)&gt;= 0.5 then choose noun attachment, else choose verb attachment, where f (1, v , f(1,n1,p) fi(liv,n1,P)= f(v,p)+ f(nl,p) An experiment was implemented to investigate the difference in performance between these two methods.
    The test set was restricted to those cases where f(1, n1) &gt; 0, f(0, v) &gt; 0, and Hindle and Rooth's method gave a definite decision.
    (ie. the above inequality is strictly less-than or greater-than).
    This gave 1924 test cases.
    Hindle and Rooth's method scored 82.1% accuracy (1580 correct) on this set, whereas the backed-off measure scored 86.5% (1665 correct).
  
  
    A possible criticism of the backed-off estimate is that it uses low count events without any smoothing, which has been shown to be a mistake in similar problems such as n-gram language models.
    In particular, quadruples and triple
