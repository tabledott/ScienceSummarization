e previous three positions.
    These features were some help in reducing the RB/IN/RP confusions.
    The accuracy on the RP category rose to 44.3%.
    Although the overall confusions in this class were reduced, some of the errors were increased, for example, the number of INs classified as RBs rose slightly.
    There seems to be still considerable room to improve these results, though the attainable accuracy is limited by the accuracy with which these distinctions are marked in the Penn Treebank (on a quick informal study, this accuracy seems to be around 85%).
    The next table shows the final performance on the test set.
    For ease of comparison, the accuracies of all models on the test and development sets are shown in Table 7.
    We note that accuracy is lower on the development set.
    This presumably corresponds with Charniak's (2000: 136) observation that Section 23 of the Penn Treebank is easier than some others.
    Table 8 shows the different number of feature templates of each kind that ha
