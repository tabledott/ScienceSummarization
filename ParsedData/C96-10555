hine-readable dictionaries (e.g., the LDOCE) is % hopeless pursuit [since] stan- dard dictionaries are simply not equipped to offer this kind of information with consistency and exhaustive- ness."
  Others have also argued that the task of simplify- in K lexical entries on the basis of broad semantic lass membership is complex and, perhaps, infeasible (see, e.g., Boguraev and llriscoe (1989)).
  tlowever, a number of researchers (l,ilhnore, 1968; Grimshaw, 1990; Gru- ber, 1965; Guthrie et al., 1991; Hearst, 1991; Jackend- otr, 1983; Jackendoff, 1990; l,evin, 1993; Pinker, t989; Yarowsky, 1992) have demonstrated conclusively that there is a clear relationship between syntactic context and word senses; it is our aim to exploit this relationship for the acquisition of semantic lexicons.
  3 Syntax-Semantics Relation: -Verb Classification Based on Syntactic Behavior The central thesis of (Levin, 1993) is that the seman- tics of a verb and its syntactic behavior are predictably related.
  As a demonstration that s
