    Semantic role labeling is the task of identifying semantic roles such as Agent, Patient, Speaker, or Topic, in a sentence.
    A statistical approach for semantic role labeling was introduced by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
    Their system learned semantic relationship among constituents in a sentence from FrameNet, a large corpus of semantically hand-annotated data.
    The FrameNet annotation scheme is based on Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1976).
    Frames are defined as &#8220;schematic representations of situations involving various frame elements such as participants, props, and other conceptual roles.&#8221; For example, given a sentence &#8220;Jack built a new house out of bricks&#8221;, a semantic role labeling system should identify the roles for the verb built such as &#8220;[Agent Jack] built [Created_entity a new house] [Component out of bricks]&#8221;3.
