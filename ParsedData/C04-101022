			5 Conclusion.
			This paper has explored the application of a data driven dependency parser to English text, using data from the Penn Treebank.
			The parser is deterministic and uses a linear-time parsing algorithm, guided bymemory-based classifiers, to construct labeled de pendency structures incrementally in one pass over the input.
			Given the difficulty of extracting labeled dependencies from a phrase structure treebank with limited functional annotation, the accuracy attainedis fairly respectable.
			And although the structural ac curacy falls short of the best available parsers, the labeling accuracy appears to be competitive.The most important weakness is the limited ac curacy in identifying the root node of a sentence, especially for longer sentences.
			We conjecture that an improvement in this area could lead to a boost in overall performance.
			Another important issue to investigate further is the influence of different kinds of arc labels, and in particular labels that a
