  This same task was used for MUC-4 (1992), with a further small increase in template complexity (24 slots).
  MUC-5 (1993), which was conducted as part of the Tipster program, a represented a substantial fllrther jump in task complexity.
  Two tasks were involved, international joint ventures and elec- tronic circuit fabrication, in two hmgnages, En- glish and Japanese.
  The joint venture task re- quired 11 templates with a total of 47 slots for the output double tile number of slots defined for MUC-4  and the task documentation was over 40 pages long.
  One innovation of MUC-5 was the use of a nested template structure.
