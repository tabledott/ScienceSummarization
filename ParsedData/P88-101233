orders of magnitude.
    There is a problem, however.
    In an ontologically promiscuous notation, there is no commitment in a primed proposition to truth or existence in the real world.
    Thus, lubeoil' (e, o) does not say that o is lube oil or even that it exists; rather it says that e is the eventuality of o's being lube oil.
    This eventuality may or may not exist in the real world.
    If it does, then we would express this as Rexists( e). and from that we could derive from axioms the existence of o and the fact that it is lube oil.
    But e's existential status could be something different.
    For example, e could be nonexistent, expressed as not(e) in the notation, and in English as &amp;quot;The eventuality e of o's being lube oil does not exist,&amp;quot; or as &amp;quot;o is not lube oil.&amp;quot; Or e may exist only in someone's beliefs.
    While the axiom (V x)pressure(x) D ,lube-oil(x) is certainly true, the axiom (V ei, x)pressure(ei, x) D e2)lube-oir(e2, x) would not be true.
