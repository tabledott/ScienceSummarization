 are MWUs, one 52X* (i.e., the vectors derived from excluding C&#8217;s counts) than for 52X.
    Yet, performance overall is horrible, particularly considering we are rescoring Z-score output whose score was 0.269.
    Rescoring caused five-fold degradation!
    What happens if we instead emphasize compositionality?
    Rows 5-8 illustrate the effect: there is a significant recovery in performance.
    The most reasonable explanation for this is that if MWUs and their components are strongly correlated, the components may rarely occur except in context with the MWU.
    It takes about 20 hours to compute the 52X* for each possible n-gram combination.
    Since the probabilistic algorithms already identify n-grams that share strong distributional properties with their components, it seems imprudent to exhaust resources on this LSAbased strategy for non-compositionality.
    These findings warrant some discussion.
    Why did non-compositionality fail?
    Certainly there is the possibility that better choices
