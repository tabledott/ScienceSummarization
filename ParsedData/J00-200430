fortunately, these parameters cannot be directly inferred from a training bitext, because we don't know which words in one half of the bitext were generated together with which words in the other half.
    The observable features of the bitext are only the co-occurrence counts cooc(u, v) (see Section 4.1).
    Methods for estimating translation parameters from co-occurrence counts typically involve link counts links(u, v), which represent hypotheses about the number of times that u and v were generated together, for each u and v in the bitext.
    A link token is an ordered pair of word tokens, one from each half of the bitext.
    A link type is an ordered pair of word types.
    The link counts links(u, v) range over link types.
    We can always estimate trans (u, v) by normalizing link counts so that E trans (u, v) = 1: For estimation purposes, it is convenient to also employ a separate set of nonprobabilistic parameters score(u, v), which represent the chances that u and v can ever be mutual translations
