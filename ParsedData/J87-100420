eech words without any special mechanism.
    In the sentence, that is a multi-part-of-speech word, because it could also be a determiner or a pronoun.
    The third example is provided to show that the algorithm is also able to handle unknown words by considering an unknown word as a special multi-part-of-speech word whose part of speech can be anything.
    We use an example sentence / * a *, where *s represent unknown words.
    This subsection gives a trace of the algorithm with the grammar in Figure 2.1, the parsing table in Figure 2.2, and the sentence I saw a man in the park with a telescope.
    At the very beginning, the stack contains only one vertex labeled 0, and the parse forest contains nothing.
    By looking at the action table, the next action, &amp;quot;shift 4&amp;quot;, is determined as in standard LR parsing.
