ndencies among SCUS in future work that would involve adding a new annotation layer.4 However, in our approach, SCUs are treated as independent annotation values, which has the advantage of affording a rigorous analysis of interannotator reliability (see following section).
    We do not attempt to represent the subsumption or implicational relations that Halteren and Teufel assign to factoids (Halteren and Teufel, 2003).
    After the annotation procedure is completed, the final SCUs can be partitioned in a pyramid.
    The partition is based on the weight of the SCU; each tier contains all and only the SCUs with the same weight.
    When we use annotations from four summaries, the pyramid will contain four tiers.
    SCUs of weight 4 are placed in the top tier and SCUs of weight 1 on the bottom, reflecting the fact that fewer SCUs are expressed in all summaries, more in three, and so on.
    For the mid-range tiers, neighboring tiers sometimes have the same number of SCUs.
    In descending tiers, SCUs beco
