ble property of the overall VPC, and not the individual parts.
    Gold-standard data was generated by asking human annotators to describe the compositionality of a given VPC according to a 11point scale, based upon which the VPCs were ranked in order of compositionality.
    Similarly to this research, McCarthy et al. in part used the similarity measure of Lin (1998a) to model compositionality, e.g., in taking the top N similar words to each VPC and looking at overlap with the top N similar words to the head verb.
    They also examine the use of statistical tests such as mutual information in modelling compositionality, and find the similarity-based methods to correlate more highly with the human judgements.
    Baldwin et al. (2003) use LSA as a technique for analysing the compositionality (or decomposability) of a given MWE.
    LSA is suggested to be a construction-inspecific test for compositionality, which is illustrated by testing its effectivity over both English noun-noun compounds and VPCs.
