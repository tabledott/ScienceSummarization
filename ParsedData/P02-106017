information to semantic information to NE gazetteers to macro context of the document, to capture internal and external evidences for NER problem.
    It also shows that our NER system can reach &amp;quot;near human performance&amp;quot;.
    To our knowledge, our NER system outperforms any published machine-learning system and any published rule-based system.
    While the experimental results have been impressive, there is still much that can be done potentially to improve the performance.
    In the near feature, we would like to incorporate the following into our system:
