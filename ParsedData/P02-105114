    However, the normalized phrase counts for the possible full names are: (Jon Kyl, 0.8976), (John Kyl, 0.0936), (John Keele, 0.0087), and (Jon Keele, 0.0001), which is more desirable as Jon Kyl is an often-mentioned US Senator.
    Co-reference: When a named entity is first mentioned in a news article, typically the full form of the phrase (e.g., the full name of a person) is used.
    Later references to the name often use a shortened version of the name (e.g, the last name of the person).
    Shortened versions are more ambiguous by nature than the full version of a phrase and hence more difficult to translate.
    Also, longer phrases tend to have more accurate Web counts than shorter ones as we have shown above.
    For example, the phrase &#8220; alnw&#175;ab m&#711;gls&#8221; is translated as the House ofRepresentatives.
    The word &#8220; al-m&#711;gls&#8221;2 might be used for later references to this phrase.
    In that case, we are confronted with the task of translating &#8220; al-m&#711;gls&#
