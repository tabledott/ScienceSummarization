 our WordNet-based method uses the graph of the concepts and relations, we can easily compute the similarity between words from different languages.
    For example, consider a English-Spanish pair like car &#8211; coche.
    Given that the Spanish WordNet is included in MCR we can use MCR as the common knowledge-base for the relations.
    We can then compute the personalized PageRank for each of car and coche on the same underlying graph, and then compare the similarity between both probability distributions.
    As an alternative, we also tried to use publicly available mappings for wordnets (Daude et al., 2000)4 in order to create a 3.0 version of the Spanish WordNet.
    The mapping was used to link Spanish variants to 3.0 synsets.
    We used the English WordNet 3.0, including glosses, to construct the graph.
    The two Spanish WordNet versions are referred to as MCR16 and WN30g.
  
  
    In this section, we describe the distributional methods used for calculating similarities between words, and profi
