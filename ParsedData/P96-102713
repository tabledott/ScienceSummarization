e as many of them as there are words but, for there to be any possibility of interaction between a pair of edges, they must come together at just one index.
    These are the natural points of articulation in the domain of strings.
    They cannot fill this role in generation because they are not natural properties of the semantic expressions that are the input to the process.
    The corresponding natural points of articulation in 202 flat semantic structures are the entities that we have already referring to as In the modified version of the procedure, whenever a new inactive edge is created with label B(b ...). then for all rules of the form in (9), an active edge is also created with label A(...)/C(c ...).
    A(...) ---&gt; ...) C(c ...) This represents a phrase of category A that requires a phrase of category Con the right for its completion.
    In these labels, (variables representing) the first, or distinassociated with B and C. By analogy with parsing charts, an inactive edge labeled B(b ...) can be
