ppear in which kind of phrase.
    Intersective modifiers specify lexically that they are [ MOD ( [ LOCAL isect-mod ] )] and scopal modifiers specify lexically that they are [ MOD ( [ LOCAL scopal-mod ] )].3 These constraints exemplify the kind of information that will be developed in the lexical hierarchy of the matrix.
    It is characteristic of broad-coverage grammars that every particular analysis interacts with many other analyses.
    Modularization is an on-going concern, both for maintainability of individual grammars, and for providing the right level of abstraction in the matrix.
    For the same reasons, we have only been able to touch on the highlights of the semantic analysis of modification here, but hope that this quick tour will suffice to illustrate the extent of the jump-start the matrix can give in the development of new grammars.
  
  
    The initial version of the matrix, while sufficient to support some useful grammar work, will require substantial further development on several fronts
