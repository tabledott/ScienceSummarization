alance k have been eliminated.
    If q is a k-imbalance state, it will be entered only by U: E transitions from k- 1 states and left only by E:v transitions also to k - 1 states.
    For all transitions u : E from a state p to q and all transitions &#8364;: v from q to r, we construct a new transition u:v from p to r. Then we remove state q from the machine along with all transitions entering or leaving it.
    These manipulations do not change the accepted relation but do reduce by one the number of k-imbalance states.
    We repeat this procedure for all k states and then move on to the k - 1 states, continuing until no states remain with a positive imbalance.
    A symmetric procedure is then used to eliminate all the states whose imbalance is negative.
    In the end, T will have been transformed to an &amp;free transducer that still accepts R. 0 The same-length regular relations are obviously closed under union, concatenation, composition, inverse, and reverse, in addition to intersection, since all of
