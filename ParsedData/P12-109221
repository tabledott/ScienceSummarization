n various relations to thefirst word?s chosen synset, including hypernyms, hy ponyms, holonyms, meronyms and attributes.
			We randomly select a word from this set of words as the second word in the pair.
			We try to repeat the abovetwice to generate two pairs for each word.
			In addi tion, for words with more than five synsets, we allow the second word to be the same as the first, but with different synsets.
			We end up with pairs of words as well as the one chosen synset for each word in the pairs.
			In step 3, we aim to extract a sentence from Wikipedia for each word, which contains the word and corresponds to a usage of the chosen synset.We first find all sentences in which the word oc curs.
			We then POS tag2 these sentences and filter out those that do not match the chosen POS.
			To find the 2We used the MaxEnt Treebank POS tagger in the python nltk library.
