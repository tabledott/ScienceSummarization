speech translation by showing that lattice decoding can also yield improvements for text by preserving alternative analyses of the input.
    In addition, we generalize lattice decoding algorithmically, extending it for the first time to hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007).
    Formally, the approach we take can be thought of as a &#8220;noisier channel&#8221;, where an observed signal o gives rise to a set of source-language strings f' E F(o) and we seek An exception is the translation of speech recognition output, where the acoustic signal generally underdetermines the choice of source word sequence f. There, Bertoldi and others have recently found that, rather than translating a single-best transcription f, it is advantageous to allow the MT decoder to = arg max max Pr(e)Pr(f'|e)Pr(o|f')&#65533;(4) e f&#65533;EF(o) Following Och and Ney (2002), we use the maximum entropy framework (Berger et al., 1996) to directly model the posterior Pr(e, f'|o) with parameters tuned to minim
