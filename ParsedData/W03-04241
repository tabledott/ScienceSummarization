eported state of the art results on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data using a HMM-based tagger.
    Zhou and Su (2002) used a wide variety of features, which suggests that the relatively poor performance of the taggers used in CoNLL-2002 was largely due to the feature sets used rather than the machine learning method.
    We demonstrate this to be the case by improving on the best Dutch results from CoNLL-2002 using a maximum entropy (ME) tagger.
    We report reasonable precision and recall (84.9 F-score) for the CoNLL-2003 English test data, and an F-score of 68.4 for the CoNLL-2003 German test data.
    Incorporating a diverse set of overlapping features in a HMM-based tagger is difficult and complicates the smoothing typically used for such taggers.
    In contrast, a ME tagger can easily deal with diverse, overlapping features.
    We also use a Gaussian prior on the parameters for effective smoothing over the large feature space.
  
  
    The ME tagger is based on Ratnaparkhi (1996)&#8217;s POS tagger and is de
