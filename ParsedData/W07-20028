sake of completeness we also include thestandard entropy and purity measures in the unsupervised evaluation.
			The entropy measure consid ers how the various classes of objects are distributedwithin each cluster.
			In general, the smaller the entropy value, the better the clustering algorithm per forms.
			The purity measure considers the extent to which each cluster contained objects from primarilyone class.
			The larger the values of purity, the bet ter the clustering algorithm performs.
			For a formal definition refer to (Zhao and Karypis, 2005).
			2.2 Supervised evaluation.
			We have followed the supervised evaluation frame work for evaluating WSID systems as described in (Agirre et al, 2006).
			First, we split the corpus intoa train/test part.
			Using the hand-annotated sense in formation in the train part, we compute a mappingmatrix M that relates clusters and senses in the fol lowing way.
			Suppose there are m clusters and n senses for the target word.
			Then, M = {mij} 1 ? i ? m, 1 ? j ? n,
