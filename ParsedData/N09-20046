s the reason that today&#8217;s most accurate shallow semantic parsers rely not primarily on compositional parsing techniques, but rather on ensembles of predictors that independently rate/rank a wide variety of factors supporting the role assignments given a broad sentence-wide range of context features.
    But while this improves semantic parsing accuracy, it poses a major obstacle for efficient tight integration into the sub-hypothesis construction and maintenance loops within SMT decoders.
    To circumvent this computational obstacle, the hybrid two-pass model defers application of the non-compositional semantic parsing information until a second error-correcting pass.
    This imposes a division of labor between the two passes.
    The first pass is performed using a conventional phrase-based SMT model.
    The phrase-based SMT model is assigned to the tasks of (a) providing an initial baseline hypothesis translation, and (b) fixing the lexical choice decisions.
    Note that the lexical choice decisio
