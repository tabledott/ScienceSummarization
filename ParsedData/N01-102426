atistical information on the words they do transitive relation from X to Z by way of some process which means that any observed failures intermediate path &#338;i={Y1,Y2,.. Yt}.
    That is, assume cannot be attributed to weak statistics. there is a path X&lt;Y1, Y1&lt;Y2,...,Yt&lt;Z.
    Suppose Morphological relationships can be represented as also that the probabilities of these relationships are directed graphs.
    Figure 6, for instance, illustrates respectively p0, p1, p2,...,pt.
    If &#65533; is a decay factor in the directed graph, according to CELEX, of words the unit interval accounting for the number of link associated with &#8220;conduct.&#8221; We will call the words separations, then we will say that the Pr(X&lt;Z) of such a directed graph the conflation set for any of along path &#338;i has probability Pr &amp;quot;t = P' IT-6 p.. We the words in the graph.
    Due to the difficulty in combine the probabilities of all independent paths developing a scoring algorithm to compare directed betwe
