ction incorporates many-to-many alignments into the conventional phoneme prediction models.
    Finally, the HMM technique yields global phoneme predictions based on language models.
    Impressive word accuracy improvements are achieved when the many-to-many alignments are applied over the baseline system.
    On several languages and data sets, using the many-to-many alignments, word accuracy improvements ranged from 2.7% to 7.6%, as compared to one-to-one alignments.
    The HMM cooperating with the local predictions shows slight improvements when it is applied to the manyto-many alignments.
    We illustrated that the HMM technique improves the word accuracy more consistently than the constraint-based approach.
    Moreover, the HMM can be easily incorporated into the many-to-many alignment approach.
    We are investigating the possibility of integrating syllabification information into our system.
    It has been reported that syllabification can potentially improve pronunciation performance in English
