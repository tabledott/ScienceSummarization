problem can be overcome by obtaining counts through Web searches, instead of relying on a corpus.
    Grefenstette (1998) therefore effectively uses the Web as a way of obtaining counts for compounds that are sparse in a given corpus.
    Although this is an important initial result, it raises the question of the generality of the proposed approach to overcoming data sparseness.
    It remains to be shown that Web counts are generally useful for approximating data that are sparse or unseen in a given corpus.
    It seems possible, for instance, that Grefenstette&#8217;s (1998) results are limited to his particular task (filtering potential translations) or to his particular linguistic phenomenon (noun-noun compounds).
    Another potential problem is the fact that Web counts are far more noisy than counts obtained from a well-edited, carefully balanced corpus.
    The effect of this noise on the usefulness of the Web counts is largely unexplored.
    Zhu and Rosenfeld (2001) use Web-based n-gram counts for la
