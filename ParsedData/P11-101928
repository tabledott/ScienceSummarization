m, and of the task.
    The Bayesian Essay Test Scoring sYstem (BETSY) (Rudner and Liang, 2002) uses multinomial or Bernoulli Naive Bayes models to classify texts into different classes (e.g. pass/fail, grades A&#8211; F) based on content and style features such as word unigrams and bigrams, sentence length, number of verbs, noun&#8211;verb pairs etc.
    Classification is based on the conditional probability of a class given a set of features, which is calculated using the assumption that each feature is independent of the other.
    This system shows that treating AA as a text classification problem is viable, but the feature types are all fairly shallow, and the approach doesn&#8217;t make efficient use of the training data as a separate classifier is trained for each grade point.
    Recently, Chen et al. (2010) has proposed an unsupervised approach to AA of texts addressing the same topic, based on a voting algorithm.
    Texts are clustered according to their grade and given an initial Z-score.
