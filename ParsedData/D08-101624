    In the case of TREE, dynamic matrix inverse allows us to update any row or column (i.e., messages from all parents or children of a given word) and find the new inverse in O(n2) time (Sherman and Morrison, 1950).
    20Symmetrically, we compute b(Lke = true) for each k. To find this in O(1) time, we precompute for each E an array of partial sums Q`[s, t] def = Ps&lt;k&lt;t &#65533;qLke.
    Since Q`[s, t] = Q`[s, t&#8722;1]+&#65533;qLte, we can compute each entry in O(1) time.
    The total precomputation time over all E, s, t is then O(n3), with the array Q` shared across all factors NOCROSSjq.
    The crossing sum is respectively Q`[0, i&#8722;1]+Q`[j+1, n], Q`[i+ 1, j &#8722; 1], or 0 according to whether E &#8712; (i, j), E &#8712;&#65533; [i, j], or E = i.21 The non-crossing sum is Q`[0, n] minus the crossing sum.
    CHILDSEQi , like TRIGRAM, is propagated by a forward-backward algorithm.
    In this case, the algorithm is easiest to describe by replacing CHILDSEQi in the factor graph by a collect
