etence model doesn't fit the part-of-speech application very well because of the model's failure to capture certain lexical preferences.
    The model also runs into trouble in a number of other NLP applications.
    Consider, for example, the problem of deciding between the words form and farm in the OCR application (mentioned in Section 1.4) when they appear in the context: ( farm ) of pure form Most people would have little difficulty deciding that form was the intended word.
    Neither does an OCR system that employs a trigram language model, because preferences, such as collocations, fall naturally within the scope of the n-gram approximation.
    Traditional NLP techniques, on the other hand, fail here because the competence approximation does not capture the crucial collocational constraints.
    Lexicographers use the terms collocation, co-occurrence, and lexis to describe various constraints on pairs of words.
    The words strong and powerful are perhaps the canonical example.
