plementation is evaluated against the task provided by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for disambiguating intransitive verbs, as well as a similar new experiment for transitive verbs.
    Our model improves on the best method evaluated in Mitchell and Lapata (2008) and offers promising results for the transitive case, demonstrating its scalability in comparison to that of other models.
    But we still feel there is need for a different class of experiments to showcase merits of compositionality in a statistically significant manner.
    Our work shows that the categorical compositional distributional model of meaning permits a practical implementation and that this opens the way to the production of large scale compositional models.
  
  
    Formal Semantics To compute the meaning of a sentence consisting of n words, meanings of these words must interact with one another.
    In formal semantics, this further interaction is represented as a function derived from the grammatical structure of the sentence, but mea
