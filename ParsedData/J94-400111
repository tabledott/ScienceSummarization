 types, it is relatively easy to detect the presence of a CS by looking for a distinctive key bunsetsu (we call this a KB) that accompanies a word indicating a CS listed in Table 1 or has the renyoh forms (the underlined bunsetsus are KBs in Sadao Kurohashi and Makoto Nagao Syntactic Analysis Method Table 1).
    A KB lies last in the pre-conjunct and is a pre-head.
    However, it is difficult to determine which bunsetsu sequences on both sides of the KB constitute pre- and post-conjuncts.
    That is, it is not easy to determine which bunsetsu to the left of a KB is the leftmost bunsetsu of the pre-conjunct (we call this starting bunsetsu SB) and which bunsetsu to the right of a KB is the rightmost bunsetsu of the post-conjunct (this ending bunsetsu is called EB and is a post-head).
    The bunsetsus between these two extreme bunsetsus constitute the scope of the CS.
    In detecting a CS, it is most important to find the post-head (that is, the EB) among many candidates in a sentence; e.g., in a conjunctiv
