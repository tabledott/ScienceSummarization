Test (Agresti 1990).
    The pairwise differences in precision between LRA and the two VSM variations are also significant, but the difference in precision between the two VSM variations (42.4% vs. 47.7%) is not significant.
    Although VSM-AV has a corpus 10 times larger than LRA&#8217;s, LRA still performs better than VSM-AV.
    Comparing VSM-AV to VSM-WMTS, the smaller corpus has reduced the score of the VSM, but much of the drop is due to the larger number of questions that were skipped (34 for VSM-WMTS versus 5 for VSM-AV).
    With the smaller corpus, many more of the input word pairs simply do not appear together in short phrases in the corpus.
    LRA is able to answer as many questions as VSM-AV, although it uses the same corpus as VSM-WMTS, because Lin&#8217;s thesaurus allows LRA to substitute synonyms for words that are not in the corpus.
    VSM-AV required 17 days to process the 374 analogy questions (Turney and Littman 2005), compared to 9 days for LRA.
