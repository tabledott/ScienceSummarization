 and are both equal to one when each noun has exactly the same features.
    It should also be noted that RA, B) = P(B, A).
    We will now consider some different possibilities for measuring the degree of association between a noun n and a verb v. In the combinatorial model, we simply consider whether a verb has ever been seen to co-occur with the noun.
    In other words, the degree of association (D) between a noun n and a verb v is 1 if they have co-occurred together and 0 otherwise.
    In this case, it should be noted that the definitions of precision and recall can be simplified as follows: In the probabilistic model, more probable (or more frequent) co-occurrences are considered more significant.
    The degree of association between a noun n and verb v is defined in the probabilistic model as: The definitions for feature set membership, TP, precision and recall all remain the same except for the use of the new association function.
    Using the probabilistic model, the precision of A's prediction of
