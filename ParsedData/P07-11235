    Creating corpora and lexical resources for a new language is very time consuming.
    In general, we would like to leverage resources already developed for one language to more rapidly create subjectivity analysis tools for a new one.
    This motivates our exploration and use of cross-lingual lexicon translations and annotation projections.
    Most if not all work on subjectivity analysis has been carried out in a monolingual framework.
    We are not aware of multi-lingual work in subjectivity analysis such as that proposed here, in which subjectivity analysis resources developed for one language are used to support developing resources in another.
  
  
    Many subjectivity and sentiment analysis tools rely on manually or semi-automatically constructed lexicons (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2006).
    Given the success of such techniques, the first approach we take to generating a target-language subjectivity classifier is to create a subjectivity lexicon
