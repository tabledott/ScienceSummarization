een conducted on extracting relations for specific semantic domains such as corporate acquisitions or terrorist events in the framework of the DARPA Message Understanding Conferences.
    Recently, attention has turned to creating corpora annotated for argument structure for a broader range of predicates.
    The Propbank project at the University of Pennsylvania (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) and the FrameNet project at the International Computer Science Institute (Baker et al., 1998) share the goal of documenting the syntactic realization of arguments of the predicates of the general English lexicon by annotating a corpus with semantic roles.
    Even for a single predicate, semantic arguments often have multiple syntactic realizations, as shown by the following paraphrases: Correctly identifying the semantic roles of the sentence constituents is a crucial part of interpreting text, and in addition to forming an important part of the information extraction problem, can serve as an intermediate step in machine
