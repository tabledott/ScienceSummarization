    Information sources that support this decision making process are the source text, dictionaries, and knowledge bases in MT systems.
    In the early direct replacement approaches, very little data was used for verb selection.
    The source verb was directly replaced by a target verb with the help of a bilingual dictionary.
    In transfer-based approaches, more information is involved in the verb selection process.
    In particular, the verb argument structure is used for selecting the target verb.
    This requires that each translation verb pair and the selection restrictions on the verb arguments be exhaustively listed in the bilingual dictionary.
    In this way, a verb sense is defined with a target verb and a set of selection restrictions on its arguments.
    Our questions are: Is the exhaustive listing of translation verb pairs feasible?
    Is this verb representation scheme sufficient for solving the verb selection problem?
    Our study of a particular MT system shows that when English ver
