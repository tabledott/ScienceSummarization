o machine translation, pioneered by (Brown et al., 1993), achieved impressive performance by leveraging large amounts of parallel corpora.
    Such approaches, which are essentially stochastic string-to-string transducers, do not explicitly model natural language syntax or semantics.
    In reality, pure statistical systems sometimes suffer from ungrammatical outputs, which are understandable at the phrasal level but sometimes hard to comprehend as a coherent sentence.
    In recent years, syntax-based statistical machine translation, which aims at applying statistical models to structural data, has begun to emerge.
    With the research advances in natural language parsing, especially the broad-coverage parsers trained from treebanks, for example (Collins, 1999), the utilization of structural analysis of different languages has been made possible.
    Ideally, by combining the natural language syntax and machine learning methods, a broad-coverage and linguistically wellmotivated statistical MT system can be
