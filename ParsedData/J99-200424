be an invaluable resource in improving the performance of the supertag models as is discussed in the following sections.
    Using structural information to filter out supertags that cannot be used in any parse of the input string reduces the supertag ambiguity but obviously does not eliminate it completely.
    One method of disambiguating the supertags assigned to each word is to order the supertags by the lexical preference that the word has for them.
    The frequency with which a certain supertag is associated with a word is a direct measure of its lexical preference for that supertag.
    Associating frequencies with the supertags and using them to associate a particular supertag with a word is clearly the simplest means of disambiguating supertags.
    Therefore a unigram model is given by: where Thus, the most frequent supertag that a word is associated with in a training corpus is selected as the supertag for the word according to the unigram model.
    For the words that do not appear in the trainin
