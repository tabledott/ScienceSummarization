tic lexicon, our system generated 137 conceptual case frames.
    One important question is how to deal with unknown words during extraction.
    This is especially important in the terrorism domain because many of the extracted items are proper names, which cannot be expected to be in the semantic lexicon.
    We allowed unknown words to fill all eligible slots and then used a precedence scheme so that each item was instantiated by only one slot.
    Precedence was based on the order of the roles shown in Figure 4.
    This is not a very satisfying solution and one of the weaknesses of our current approach.
    Handling unknown words more intelligently is an important direction for future research.
    We compared AutoSlog-TS' extraction patterns with the case frames using 100 blind texts6 from the MUC-4 test set.
    The MUC-4 answer keys were used to score the output.
    Each extracted item was scored as either correct, mislabeled, duplicate, or spurious.
    An item was correct if it matched against the
