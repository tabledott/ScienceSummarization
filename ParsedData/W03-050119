dge has been enhanced by incorporating part of speech of information into the decoding process, rejecting headlines that do not contain a word that was used as a verb in the story, and allowing morphological variation only on words that were used as verbs in the story.
    HMM Hedge was trained on 700,000 news articles and headlines from the TIPSTER corpus.
    BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) is a system for automatic evaluation of machine translation.
    BLEU uses a modified n-gram precision measure to compare machine translations to reference human translations.
    We treat summarization as a type of translation from a verbose language to a concise one, and compare automatically generated headlines to human generated headlines.
    For this evaluation we used 100 headlines created for 100 AP stories from the TIPSTER collection for August 6, 1990 as reference summarizations for those stories.
    These 100 stories had never been run through either system or evaluated by the authors prior to this evaluation.
