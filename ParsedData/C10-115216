calendartheNP old calendarthe month Figure 5: Substitution As a result of all the simplification operations, we obtain the following two sentences: s1 = Str(pt1)=?August was the sixth month in the old calendar.?
			and s2 = Str(pt2)=?The old calendar started in 735BC.?
			3.4 The Probabilistic Model.
			Our model can be formalized as a direct translation model from complex to simple P (s|c) multi plied by a language model P (s) as shown in Equ.
			4.
			s = argmax s P (s|c)P (s) (4) We combine the parts described in the previous sections to get the direct translation model: P (s|c) = ? ?:Str(?(c))=s (P (seg|c)P (com|seg) (5) ? node P (dp|node)P (ro|node)P (sub|node) ? w (sub|w)).
			where ? is a sequence of simplification operationsand Str(?(c)) corresponds to the leaves of a simplified tree.
			There can be many sequences of op erations that result in the same simplified sentence and we sum up all of their probabilities.
	
	
			In this section, we describe how we train the prob abilities in the tables.
