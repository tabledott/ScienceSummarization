			As a final point, to see how these rules can interact in practice, see figure 3.
			This example demonstrates the use of the relaxed application and composition rules, as well as the new type-raising rules.
	
	
			This section describes an approach to learning in ourmodel.
			We first define the features used and then de scribe a new online learning algorithm for the task.
			4.1 Features in the Model.
			Section 2.3 described the use of a function f(x, y) which maps a sentence x together with a CCG parse y to a feature vector.
			As described in section 3,we introduce features for the new CCG combinators.
			In addition, we follow ZC05 in defining fea tures which track the number of times each lexical item in ? is used.
			For example, we would h
