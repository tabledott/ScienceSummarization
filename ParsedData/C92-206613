obligatory or null adjoining) which are required for tree-adjoining rammar . 7 Probab i l i ty of a Sentence We now define an bottom-up algorithm for SLTAG which computes the probability of an input string.
			The algorithm is an extension of the CKY-type parser for tree-adjoining grammar (Vijay-Shanker, 1987).
			The ex- tended algorithm parses all spans of the input string and also computes tbelr probability in a bottom-up fashion.
			Since the string on the frontier of an auxiliary is bro- ken up into two substrings by the foot node, for the purpose of computing the probability of the sentence, we will consider the probability that a node derives two substrings of the input string.
			This entity will be called the inside probability.
			Its exact definition is given be- low.
			We will refer to the subsequenee of the input string w = ax "" aN from position i to j , w{'.
			It is defined as follows: w~/'~f { a i+t" .uj , i f i&gt;_ j ' i f /&lt; j Given a string w = at . . .
