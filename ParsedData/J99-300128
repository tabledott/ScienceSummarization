the sense of the functional sentence perspective (FSP) (Firbas 1974).
    Viewed from this perspective, the theme/rheme-hierarchy of utterance 11, is determined by the Cf(Ui_i).
    Elements of Ui that are contained in Cf(Lli_i) are less rhematic than those not contained in Cf(Ui_i).
    He then concludes that the Cb(U) must be the theme of the current utterance.
    Rambow does not exploit the information structure of utterances to determine the Cf ranking but formulates it on the basis of linear textual precedence among the relevant discourse entities.
    In order to analyze Turkish texts, Hoffman (1996, 1998) distinguishes between the information structure of utterances and centering, since both constructs are assigned different functions for text understanding.
    A hearer exploits the information structure of an utterance to update his discourse model, and he applies the centering constraints in order to connect the current utterance to the previous discourse.
    Hoffman describes the information stru
