    None of these algorithms consider the general Jacquemin (1997) deems pairs of word n-grams as morphologically related if two words in the first ngram have the same first few letters (or stem) as two words in the second n-gram and if there is a suffix for each stem whose length is less than k. He also clusters groups of words having the same kinds of word endings, which gives an added performance boost.
    He applies his algorithm to a French term list and scores based on sampled, by-hand evaluation.
    Goldsmith (1997/2000) tries to automatically sever each word in exactly one place in order to establish a potential set of stems and suffixes.
    He uses the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) and MDL as well as some triage procedures to help eliminate inappropriate parses for every word in a corpus.
    He collects the possible suffixes for each stem and calls these signatures which give clues about word classes.
    With the exceptions of capitalization removal and some word segmentatio
