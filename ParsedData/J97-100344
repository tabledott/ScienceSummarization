he similarity scores are low were used, then it would resemble the blocks algorithm with tf.idf weighting, but without the use of overlapping text windows.
    However, a consequence of the fact that the vector space method is better at distinguishing similarities than differences, is that similarity scores alone are probably less effective at finding the transition points between subtopic discussions than sequences of similarity scores, using moving windows of text, in the manner described above.
    Salton et al. (1996) attempt to address a version of the subtopic segmentation problem by extending the algorithm to finding &amp;quot;text pieces exhibiting internal consistency that can be distinguished from the remainder of the surrounding text&amp;quot; (p. 55).
    As one part of this goal, they seek what is called the text segment, which is defined as &amp;quot;a contiguous piece of text that is linked internally, but largely disconnected from the adjacent text.
    Typically, a segment might consist of in
