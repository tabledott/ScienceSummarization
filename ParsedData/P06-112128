isambiguation).
			A limitation of earlier syntax-based systems is their poor handling of non-constituent phrases.
			Table 4 shows that our model can learn rules for such phrases, e.g., said that (lhs3).
			While the that has no direct translation, our model effectively learns to separate?
			(said) from the relative clause with a comma, which is common in Chinese.
			Another promising prospect of our model seems to lie in its ability to handle non-contiguous phrases, a feature that state of the art systemssuch as (Och and Ney, 2004) do not incorpo rate.
			The when-NP-are-VP construction of lhs4 presents such a case.
			Our model identifies that are needs to be deleted, that when translates into the phrase( ...?, and that the NP needs to be moved after the VP in Chinese (p = .66).
	
	
			The task of our decoder is to find the most likely English tree pi that maximizes all models involved in Equation 2.
			Since xRs rules can be converted to context-free productions by increasing the number of non-terminals,
