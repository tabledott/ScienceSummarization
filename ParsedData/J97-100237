red enough that it was easy to forget to use the subcode.
    To determine stability, the most experienced coder completed the same dialogue twice, two months and many dialogues apart.
    She reached better agreement (90%; N =- 49) on where games began, suggesting that one way to improve the coding would be to formalize more clearly the distinctions that she believes herself to use.
    When she agreed with herself on where a game began, she also agreed well with herself about what game it was (K = .88, N = 44, the only disagreements being confusions between CHECK and QUERY-YN), whether or not games were embedded (K = .95), and where the games ended (89%).
    There were not enough instances of abandoned games marked to test formally, but she did not appear to use the coding consistently.
    In general, the results of the game cross-coding show that the coders usually agree, especially on what game category to use, but when the dialogue participants begin to overlap their utterances or fail to address each
