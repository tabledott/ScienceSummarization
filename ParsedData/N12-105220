tering additional words not in the projection.
    1 and 3) moves the clustering too far from those that obey the word alignment constraints, which causes the procedure to fail to converge.
    However, we found that fixing the clustering of the words that are assigned clusters in the projection stages (lines 2 and 4) and only clustering the remaining words works well in practice.
    Furthermore, we found that iterating the procedure has little effect on performance and set N = 1 for all subsequent experiments.
  
  
    In our first set of experiments on using cross-lingual cluster features, we evaluate direct transfer of our EN parser, trained on Stanford style dependencies (De Marneffe et al., 2006), to the the ten non-EN Indo-European languages listed in Section 3.
    We exclude KO and ZH as initial experiments proved direct transfer a poor technique when transferring parsers between such diverse languages.
    We study the impact of using cross-lingual cluster features by comparing the strong delexical
