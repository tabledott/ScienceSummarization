g a workstation for specifying subcorpora according to text type, using Biber-style analyses, among others.
    In Kilgarriff (2001) we present a first pass at quantifying similarity between corpora, and Cavaglia (2002) continues this line of work.
    As mentioned above, Sekine (1997) and Gildea (2001) directly address the relation between NLP systems and text type; one further such item is Roland et al. (2000).
    Buitelaar and Sacaleanu (2001) explores the relation between domain and sense disambiguation.
    A practical discussion of a central technical concern is Vossen (2001), which tailors a general-language resource for a domain.
    Baayen (2001) presents sophisticated mathematical models for word frequency distributions, and it is likely that his mixture models have potential for modeling sublanguage mixtures.
    His models have been developed with a specific, descriptive goal in mind and using a small number of short texts: It is unclear whether they can be usefully applied in NLP.
