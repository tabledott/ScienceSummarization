 two baseline methods for comparison: Baseline-1: Baseline-1 follows the method proposed in (Quirk et al., 2004), which generates paraphrases using typical SMT tools.
    Similar to Quirk et al.&#8217;s method, we extract a paraphrase table for the SMT model from a monolingual comparable corpus (PT-2 described above).
    The SMT decoder used in Baseline-1 is Moses.
    Baseline-2: Baseline-2 extends Baseline-1 by combining multiple resources.
    It exploits all PTs introduced above in the same way as our proposed method.
    The difference from our method is that Baseline-2 does not take different applications into consideration.
    Thus it contains no paraphrase planning stage or the usability sub-model.
    We tune the parameters for the two baselines using the development data as described in Section 3.6 and evaluate them with the test data.
    Since paraphrase applications are not considered by the baselines, each baseline method outputs a single best paraphrase for each test sentence.
