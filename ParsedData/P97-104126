n, we also showed the rule sequence algorithm to be very effective in improving segmentation in Thai, an alphabetic language.
    While the scores themselves were not as high as the Chinese performance, the error reduction was nevertheless very high, which is encouraging considering the simple rule syntax used.
    The current state of our algorithm, in which only three characters are considered at a time, will understandably perform better with a language like Chinese than with an alphabetic language like Thai, where average word length is much greater.
    The simple syntax described in Section 2.2 can, however, be easily extended to consider larger contexts to the left and the right of boundaries; this extension would necessarily come at a corresponding cost in learning speed since the size of the rule space searched during training would grow accordingly.
    In the future, we plan to further investigate the application of our rule-based algorithm to alphabetic languages.
