em, the issue of polysemy is related to another, bigger issue: the potential and limitations of clustering in inducing semantic information from polysemic SCF data.
    Our results show that it is unrealistic to expect that the &#8216;important&#8217; (high frequency) verbs in language fall into classes corresponding to single senses.
    However, they also suggest that clustering can be used for novel, previously unexplored purposes: to detect from corpus data general patterns of semantic behaviour (monosemy, predominant sense, regular/irregular polysemy).
    In the future, we plan to investigate the use of soft clustering (without hardening the output) and develop methods for evaluating the soft output against polysemous gold standards.
    We also plan to work on improving the accuracy of subcategorization acquisition, investigating the role of noise (irregular / regular) in clustering, examining whether different syntactic/semantic verb types require different approaches in clustering, developing our gol
