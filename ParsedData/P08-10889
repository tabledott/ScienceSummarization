 weighted edges.
    As we run EM, we gradually increase the number of edges to retain.
    In our context, bootstrapping has a similar motivation to the annealing approach of Smith and Eisner (2006), which also tries to alter the space of hidden outputs in the E-step over time to facilitate learning in the M-step, though of course the use of bootstrapping in general is quite widespread (Yarowsky, 1995).
  
  
    In section 5, we present developmental experiments in English-Spanish lexicon induction; experiments 6Empirically, we obtained much better efficiency and even increased accuracy by replacing these marginal likelihood weights with a simple proxy, the distances between the words&#8217; mean latent concepts: where A is a thresholding constant, zz = E(zi,j &#65533;fS(si)) = P1/2Us fS(si), and zj* is defined analogously.
    The increased accuracy may not be an accident: whether two words are translations is perhaps better characterized directly by how close their latent concepts are, whereas log-probabi
