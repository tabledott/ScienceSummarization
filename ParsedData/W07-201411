e other two employed a hy brid approach.
			This section gives a short description of the participating systems.
			CU-TMP trained three support vector machine (SVM) models, one for each task.
			All models used the gold-standard TimeBank features for events and times as well as syntactic features derived from the text.
			Additionally, the relation types obtained by running the task B system on the training data for Task A and Task C, were added as a feature to the two latter systems.
			A subset of features was selectedusing cross-validations on the training data, discarding features whose removal improved the cross validation F-score.
			When applied to the test data, the Task B system was run first in order to supplythe necessary features to the Task A and Task C sys tems.LCC-TE automatically identifies temporal refer ring expressions, events and temporal relations in text using a hybrid approach, leveraging variousNLP tools and linguistic resources at LCC.
