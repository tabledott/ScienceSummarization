    As in many areas of NLP, a learning approach is appealing.
    Surprisingly, though, rather little work has been devoted to learning local syntactic patterns, mostly noun phrases (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Vilain and Day, 1996).
    This paper presents a novel general learning approach for recognizing local sequential patterns, that may be perceived as falling within the memorybased learning paradigm.
    The method utilizes a part-of-speech tagged training corpus in which all instances of the target pattern are marked (bracketed).
    The training data are stored as-is in suffix-tree data structures, which enable linear time searching for subsequences in the corpus.
    The memory-based nature of the presented algorithm stems from its deduction strategy: a new instance of the target pattern is recognized by examining the raw training corpus, searching for positive and negative evidence with respect to the given test sequence.
