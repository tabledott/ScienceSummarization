beled with these frame elements.
    The next section describes the set of frame elements/semantic roles used by our system.
    In the rest of this paper we report on our current system, as well as a number of preliminary experiments on extensions to the system.
  
  
    Historically, two types of semantic roles have been studied: abstract roles such as AGENT and PATiENT, and roles specific to individual verbs such as EATER and EATEN for &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot;.
    The FrameNet project proposes roles at an intermediate level, that of the semantic frame.
    Frames are defined as schematic representations of situations involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles (Fillmore, 1976).
    For example, the frame &amp;quot;conversation&amp;quot;, shown in Figure 1, is invoked by the semantically related verbs &amp;quot;argue&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;banter&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;debate&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;converse&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;gossip&amp;quot; as well as the nouns &amp;quot;argument&am
