 fore rely on an empmcal methodology We have developed an envxronment to compute and graph- lcally visuallze lexxcal chains to evaluate xperimen- tally how they capture the mare topics of the texts Figure 5 shows how lemcal chains are visualized to help human testers evaluate therr importance Figure 5 Visual representa~on f lexlcal chRm~ We have collected data for a set of 30 texts extracted from popular magazmes (from "The Econommt" and ` `Scientific American"), all of them are popular science genre For each text, we manu- ally ranked chains m terms of relevance to the mare toplcs We then computed ifferent formal measures on the chmns, including chmn length, ?hstnbution m the text, text span covered by the chain, density, graph topology (diameter of the graph of the words) and number of repetitious The results on our data set indicate that only the following parameters are good predictors of the strength of a chmn Length:  The number of occurrences ofmembers of the chain Homogene i ty  index: 1 - the number
