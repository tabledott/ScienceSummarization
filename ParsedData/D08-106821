).
    Notice that when the objects form independent subsets (in our cases, mentions in each document), we can process them in parallel and then gather sufficient statistics for learning.
    We developed an efficient parallelized implementation of our unsupervised learning algorithm using the message-passing interface (MPI).
    Learning in MUC-6 took only one hour, and in ACE-2004 two and a half.
    To reduce burn-in time, we initialized MC-SAT with the state returned by MaxWalkSAT (Kautz et al., 1997), rather than a random solution to the hard clauses.
    In the existing implementation in Alchemy (Kok et al., 2007), SampleSAT flips only one atom in each step, which is inefficient for predicates with unique-value constraints (e.g., Head(m, c!)).
    Such predicates can be viewed as multi-valued predicates (e.g., Head(m) with value ranging over all c&#8217;s) and are prevalent in NLP applications.
    We adapted SampleSAT to flip two or more atoms in each step so that the unique-value constraints are autom
