nce between these two goals.
    In (McCarthy et al., 2004), a method was presented to determine the predominant sense of a word in a corpus.
    However, in (Chan and Ng, 2005), we showed that in a supervised setting where one has access to some annotated training data, the EMbased method in section 5 estimates the sense priors more effectively than the method described in (McCarthy et al., 2004).
    Hence, we use the EM-based algorithm to estimate the sense priors in the WSJ evaluation data for each of the 21 nouns.
    The sense with the highest estimated sense prior is taken as the predominant sense of the noun.
    For the set of 12 nouns where the predominant sense remains unchanged between BC and WSJ, the EM-based algorithm is able to predict that the predominant sense remains unchanged for all 12 nouns.
    Hence, we will focus on the 9 nouns which have different predominant senses between BC and WSJ for our remaining adaptation experiments.
    For these 9 nouns, the EM-based algorithm correctly pre
