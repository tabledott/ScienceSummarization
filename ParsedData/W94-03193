urvey of generation systems that: In short, the idea was to survey recent systems that looked at the entire generation problem, and that were motivated by applications and engineering considerations as well as linguistic theory.
    The systems examined were:1 FUF [Elhadad, 1992]: Developed at Columbia University and used in several projects there, including COMET and ADVISOR II; I will use the term `FUF' in this paper to refer to both FUF itself and the various related systems at Columbia.
    Several other universities have also recently begun to use FUF in their research.
    FUF is based on Kay's functional unification formalism [Kay, 1979].
    IDAS [Reiter 0 at., 19921: Developed at Edinburgh University, IDAS was a prototype online documentation system for users of complex machinery.
    From a theoretical perspective, IDAS's main objective was to show that a single representation and reasoning system can be used for both domain and linguistic knowledge [Reiter and Mellish, 1992].
