(1), uses the method in section 4.1 to generate 0, and the method in section 4.2.1 to generate p. Table 4 shows accuracies of the classifiers on the test set of (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994), which is derived from the manually annotated attachments in the Penn Treebank Wall St. Journal data.
    The Penn Treebank is drawn from the 1989 Wall St. Journal data, so there is no possibility of overlap with our training data.
    Furthermore, the extraction heuristic was developed and tuned on a &amp;quot;development set&amp;quot;, i.e., a set of annotated examples that did not overlap with either the test set or the training set.
    Table 5 shows the two probabilities Pr(alv, n) and Pr (pla, v, n), using the same approximations as c/bigram, for the ambiguous example rise num to num.
    (Recall that Pr(v) and Pr(n) are not needed.)
    While the tuple (num, to, num) is more frequent than (rise, to, num), the conditional probabilities prefer a = V, which is the choice that maximizes Pr (v , n, p, a).
