 that G = u when F takes its minority value, and b is the probability that G = u when F takes its majority value.
    The value r = a &#8722; b is the difference.
    Note that r = 0 if F and G are conditionally independent given Y = +.
    In fact, we can show Hence, in particular, we may write dy = a &#8722; b.
    Observe further that p2, the minority probability of G when Y = +, is a weighted average of a and b, namely, p2 = p1a+q1b.
    Combining this with the equation dy = a&#8722;b allows us to express a and b in terms of the remaining variables, to wit: a = p2 + q1dy and b = p2 &#8722; p1dy.
    In order to prove theorem 3, we need to show that the area of disagreement (B U C) upper bounds the area of the minority value of F (AU B).
    This is true just in case C is larger than A, which is to say, if bq1 &gt; ap1.
    Substituting our expressions for a and b into this inequality and solving for dy yields: dy ` p2 2p1q1 In short, disagreement upper bounds the minority probability just in case weak rul
