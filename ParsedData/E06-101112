l not hurt performance.
    Even in freer-word order languages such as Czech, almost all non-projective dependency trees are primarily projective, modulo a few nonprojective edges.
    Thus, if our inference algorithm starts with the highest scoring projective parse, the best non-projective parse only differs by a small number of edge transformations.
    Furthermore, it is easy to show that each iteration of the loop takes O(n2) time, resulting in a O(n3 + Mn2) runtime algorithm.
    In practice, the approximation terminates after a small number of transformations and we do not need to bound the number of iterations in our experiments.
    We should note that this is one of many possible approximations we could have made.
    Another reasonable approach would be to first find the highest scoring first-order non-projective parse, and then re-arrange edges based on second order scores in a similar manner to the algorithm we described.
    We implemented this method and found that the results were slightly wors
