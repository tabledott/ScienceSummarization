 from other computational approaches to metaphor in requiring no manually compiled knowledge base besides WordNet.
    It has successfully found some of the conventional metaphors on the Master Metaphor List.
    CorMet uses gradients in selectional preferences learned from dynamically mined, domain-specific corpora to identify metaphoric mappings between concepts.
    It is reasonably accurate despite the noisiness of many of its components.
    CorMet demonstrates the viability of a computational, corpus-based approach to conventional metaphor but requires more work before it can constitute a viable NLP tool.
