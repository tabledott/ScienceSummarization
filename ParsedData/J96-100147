s the three-word elements of P (S) containing one of 7 The choice of the Dice coefficient is not crucial; for example, using the Jaccard coefficient or any other similarity measure that is monotonically related to the Dice coefficient would be equivalent.
    What is important is that the selected measure satisfy the conditions of asymmetry insensitivity to marginal word probabilities, and convenience in testing for correlation.
    There are many other possible measures of association, and the general points made in this section may apply to them insofar as they also exhibit the properties we discussed.
    For example, the normalized chi-square measure (02) used in Gale and Church (1991a) shares some of the important properties of average mutual information (for example, it is completely symmetric with respect to 1-1 and 0-0 matches).
