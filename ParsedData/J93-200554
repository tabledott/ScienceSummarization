m different styles and sources, such as novels, newspaper texts, scientific journal articles, etc.
    The assumption is of course that given a representative mix of samples of language use, we can extract the general properties and usage of words.
    But if we gain access to sophisticated automatic corpus analysis tools such as those discussed above, and indeed if we have specialized algorithms for sublanguage extraction, then homogeneous corpora might provide better data.
    The few examples of lexical preference mentioned in this section might not tell us anything conclusive for the definitive usage of a word such as said, if there even exists such a notion.
    Nevertheless the statistics provide an important tool for text analysis within the corpus from which they are derived.
    Because we can systematically capture the violation of selectional restrictions (as semantically predicted), there is no need for a text analysis system to perform extensive commonsense inferencing.
    Thus, such presupposit
