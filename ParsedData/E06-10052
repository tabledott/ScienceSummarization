attices or N-best lists from several different MT systems (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994).
    To be successful, such approaches require compatible lattices and comparable scores of the (word) hypotheses in the lattices.
    However, the scores of most statistical machine translation (SMT) systems are not normalized and therefore not directly comparable.
    For some other MT systems (e.g. knowledge-based systems), the lattices and/or scores of hypotheses may not be even available.
    (Bangalore et al., 2001) used the edit distance alignment extended to multiple sequences to construct a confusion network from several translation hypotheses.
    This algorithm produces monotone alignments only (i. e. allows insertion, deletion, and substitution of words); it is not able to align translation hypotheses with significantly different word order.
    (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005) try to overcome this problem.
    They introduce a method that allows non-monotone alignments of words in different translation hypothese
