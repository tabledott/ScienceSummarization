the core NPs were identified correctly.
    Subsequent analysis suggested that half the errors could be removed with only a little additional work, suggesting that over 90% performance is achievable.
    In a related test, we explored the bracketings produced by Church's PARTS program (Church 1988).
    We extracted 200 sentences of WSJ text by taking every tenth sentence from a collection of manually corrected parse trees (data from the TREEBANK Project at the University of Pennsylvania).
    We evaluated the NP bracketings in these 200 sentences by hand and tried to classify the errors.
    Of 1226 phrases in the 200 sentences, 131 were errors, for a 10.7% error rate.
    The errors were classified by hand as follows: The 90% success rate in both tests suggests that identification of core NPs can be achieved using only local information and with minimal knowledge of the words.
    Next we consider the issue of what semantics should be assigned and how reliably that can be accomplished.
