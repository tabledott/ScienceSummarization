of the [orm ( , l%elPron Y ,) followed by soIne (Z), where Y and Z are arbitrary sequences of words, then the sentence may be simplified into two sentences, namely the sequence (X) followed by (Z), and (X) followed by (Y).
  The resulting sen];ences are then recursively simplified, to the extent possible.
  The system has been tested on news text, and performs well on certain classes of sentences.
  See (Chandrasekar and R, amani, 1996) ibr details of quantitative valuation of the system, including an evaluation of the acceptability of the resulting 1042 sentences.
  A set of news stories, consist, ing of 224 sentences, was simplitied by the prototype system, resulting in 369 simplified sentences.
  Ilowever, there are certain weMenesses in this system, caused mostly by the relatively simple mechanisms used to detect phrases and attach- meats.
  Sentences which include long distance or crossed del)enden(ies, and sentences which have malt|ply stacked appositives are not handled llrOl)erly; nor are sentences wi
