    This algorithm steps through the data incrementally and performs two steps for each training example.
    First, new lexical items are induced for the training instance by splitting and merging nodes in the best correct parse, given the current parameters.
    Next, the parameters of the PCCG are updated by making a stochastic gradient update on the marginal likelihood, given the updated lexicon.
    Inputs and Initialization The algorithm takes as input the training set of n (sentence, logical form) pairs {(xi, zi) : i = 1...n} along with an NP list, ANP, of proper noun lexical items such as Texas ` NP:tex.
    The lexicon, A, is initialized with a single lexical item xi `S :zi for each of the training pairs along with the contents of the NP list.
    It is possible to run the algorithm without the initial NP list; we include it to allow direct comparisons with previous approaches, which also included NP lists.
    Features and initial feature weights are described in Section 7.
