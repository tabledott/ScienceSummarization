alternatives, and that a good choice of WordNet versions and relations is fundamental for good performance.
    The paper is structured as follows.
    We first describe the PageRank and Personalized PageRank algorithms.
    Section 3 introduces the graph based methods used for WSD.
    Section 4 shows the experimental setting and the main results, and Section 5 compares our methods with related experiments on graph-based WSD systems.
    Section 6 shows the results of the method when applied to a Spanish dataset.
    Section 7 analyzes the performance of the algorithm.
    Finally, we draw some conclusions in Section 8.
  
  
    The celebrated PageRank algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998) is a method for ranking the vertices in a graph according to their relative structural importance.
    The main idea of PageRank is that whenever a link from vi to vj exists in a graph, a vote from node i to node j is produced, and hence the rank of node j increases.
    Besides, the strength of the vote from i to j also depend
