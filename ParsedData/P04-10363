    We believe that an automatic means of finding a predominant sense would be useful for systems that use it as a means of backing-off (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998; Hoste et al., 2001) and for systems that use it in lexical acquisition (McCarthy, 1997; Merlo and Leybold, 2001; Korhonen, 2002) because of the limited size of hand-tagged resources.
    More importantly, when working within a specific domain one would wish to tune the first sense heuristic to the domain at hand.
    The first sense of star in SemCor is celestial body, however, if one were disambiguating popular news celebrity would be preferred.
    Assuming that one had an accurate WSD system then one could obtain frequency counts for senses and rank them with these counts.
    However, the most accurate WSD systems are those which require manually sense tagged data in the first place, and their accuracy depends on the quantity of training examples (Yarowsky and
