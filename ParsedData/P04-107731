f the Fluency Table except for WER and GTM10.
    GTM10 has good correlation with human judgments in adequacy but not fluency; while GTM20 and GTM30, i.e.
    GTM with exponent larger than 1.0, has good correlation with human judgment in fluency but not adequacy.
    ROUGE-L and ROUGE-S*, 4, and 9 are good automatic evaluation metric candidates since they perform as well as BLEU in fluency correlation analysis and outperform BLEU4 and 12 significantly in adequacy.
    Among them, ROUGE-L is the best metric in both adequacy and fluency correlation with human judgment according to Spearman&#8217;s correlation coefficient and is statistically indistinguishable from the best metrics in both adequacy and fluency correlation with human judgment according to Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient.
  
  
    In this paper we presented two new objective automatic evaluation methods for machine translation, ROUGE-L based on longest common subsequence (LCS) statistics between a candidate translation and a set of refere
