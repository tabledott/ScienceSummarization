 incorporate simple agreement constraints between coreferent mentions.
    Since we currently allow proper and nominal mentions to corefer only with matching head mentions, agreement is only a concern for pronouns.
    Traditional linguistic theory stipulates that coreferent mentions must agree in number, person, gender, and entity type (e.g. animacy).
    Here, we implement person, number and entity type agreement.6 A number feature is assigned to each mention deterministically based on the head and its POS tag.
    For entity type, we use NER labels.
    Ideally, we would like to have information about the entity type of each referential NP, however this information is not easily obtainable.
    Instead, we opt to utilize the Stanford NER tagger (Finkel et al., 2005) over the sentences in a document and annotate each NP with the NER label assigned to that mention head.
    For each mention, when its NP is assigned an NER label we allow it to only be compatible with that NER label.7 For pronouns, we determin
