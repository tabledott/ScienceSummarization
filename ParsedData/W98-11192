es a detailed study on factors in anaphora resolution.)
    We first discuss the training features we use and then derive the probability equations from them.
    The first piece of useful information we consider is the distance between the pronoun and the candidate antecedent.
    Obviously the greater the distance the lower the probability.
    Secondly, we look at the syntactic situation in which the pronoun finds itself.
    The most well studied constraints are those involving reflexive pronouns.
    One classical approach to resolving pronouns in text that takes some syntactic factors into consideration is that of Hobbs (1976).
    This algorithm searches the parse tree in a leftto-right, breadth-first fashion that obeys the major reflexive pronoun constraints while giving a preference to antecedents that are closer to the pronoun.
    In resolving inter-sentential pronouns, the algorithm searches the previous sentence, again in left-to-right, breadth-first order.
    This implements the observed prefer
