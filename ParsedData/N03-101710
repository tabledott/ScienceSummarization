    If we collect all phrase pairs that are consistent with word alignments, this includes many non-intuitive phrases.
    For instance, translations for phrases such as &#8220;house the&#8221; may be learned.
    Intuitively we would be inclined to believe that such phrases do not help: Restricting possible phrases to syntactically motivated phrases could filter out such non-intuitive pairs.
    Another motivation to evaluate the performance of a phrase translation model that contains only syntactic phrases comes from recent efforts to built syntactic translation models [Yamada and Knight, 2001; Wu, 1997].
    In these models, reordering of words is restricted to reordering of constituents in well-formed syntactic parse trees.
    When augmenting such models with phrase translations, typically only translation of phrases that span entire syntactic subtrees is possible.
    It is important to know if this is a helpful or harmful restr
