ategory of the B part and of all potential A parts should help in finding the most meaningful dialog act tag among all potential A parts; for example, the question-accept pair is admittedly more likely to correspond to an AP than e.g. backchannel-accept.
    We used the DA annotation that we also had available, and used the DA tag sequence of part A and B as a feature.7 When we add the DA feature set, the accuracy reaches 91.34%, which is only slightly better than our 90.20% accuracy, which indicates that lexical, durational, and structural features capture most of the informativeness provided by DAs.
    This improved accuracy with DA information should of course not be considered as the actual accuracy of our system, since DA information is difficult to acquire automatically (Stolcke et al., 2000).
