 word ordering.
    For example, when judging the translation of assistance program into programme X aide the judges knew that the missing word (X) was d' even without looking at the corpus.
    In Section 9, we describe a later version of Champollion in which we added the capability to identify these types of closed-class words during the last stage.
    The results of the evaluation experiments are given in Table 9.
    The first column describes the experiment, the second column gives the percentage of XTRACT errors, and the next two columns give the percentages of incorrect and correct translations of source collocations in comparison to the total number of collocations.
    Since our previous work shows that XTRACT has a rate of accuracy of 80% (Smadja 1991b), it is reasonable to expect a certain number of errors in the input to Champollion, but these should not contribute to the evaluation of Champollion.
    Consequently, we have included in the last column of the table the percentage of correct transl
