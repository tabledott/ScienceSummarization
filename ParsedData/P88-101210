he constraints.
    This is the process of metonymy resolution.
    Let us suppose, for example, that in sentence (2), the predicate after requires its arguments to be events: To allow for coercions, the logical form of the sentence is altered by replacing the explicit arguments by &amp;quot;coercion variables&amp;quot; which satisfy the constraints and which are related somehow to the explicit arguments.
    Thus the altered logical form for (2) would include As in the most general approach to compound nominal interpretation, this treatment is second-order, and suggests that any relation at all can hold between the implicit and explicit arguments.
    Nunberg (1978), among others, has in fact argued just this point.
    However, in our implementation, we are using a first-order simulation.
    The symbol rel is treated as a predicate constant, and there are a number of axioms that specify what the possible coercions are.
    Identity is one possible relation, since the explicit arguments could in fact satisf
