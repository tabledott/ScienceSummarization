    If we multiply all trees&#8217; attachment scores by the denominators of the odds ratios cancel, and we are left with each tree being assigned the probability it would have received under the CCM.9 In this way, both models can be seen as generating either constituency or dependency structures.
    Of course, the CCM will generate fairly random dependency structures (constrained only by bracketings).
    Getting constituency structures from the DMV is also problematic, because the choice of which side to first attach arguments on has ramifications on constituency &#8211; it forces x-bar-like structures &#8211; even though it is an arbitrary convention as far as dependency evaluations are concerned.
    For example, if we attach right arguments first, then a verb with a left subject and a right object will attach the object first, giving traditional VPs, while the other attachment order gives subject-verb groups.
    To avoid this bias, we alter the DMV in the following ways.
    When using the depend
