d polarity of other 7.8% of the words by using WordNet.
    So we find prior polarity of about 88.9% of English language words.
  
  
    We design a tree representation of tweets to combine many categories of features in one succinct convenient representation.
    For calculating the similarity between two trees we use a Partial Tree (PT) kernel first proposed by Moschitti (2006).
    A PT kernel calculates the similarity between two trees by comparing all possible sub-trees.
    This tree kernel is an instance of a general class of convolution kernels.
    Convolution Kernels, first introduced by Haussler (1999), can be used to compare abstract objects, like strings, instead of feature vectors.
    This is because these kernels involve a recursive calculation over the &#8220;parts&#8221; of abstract object.
    This calculation is made computationally efficient by using Dynamic Programming techniques.
    By considering all possible combinations of fragments, tree kernels capture any possible correlation be
