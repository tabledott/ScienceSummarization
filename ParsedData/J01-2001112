re found in both Si and S2 (indicated (S1, S2)), followed by those found only in Si (S1, - S2), and then those only found in S2 Si, 52).
    Recall that angle brackets are used to indicate the type count of a set, the number of typographically distinct members of a set.
    In (8), we derive a formula for the change in length of the suffix component of the morphology.
    Observe the final formulation, in which the first two terms involve suffixes present in both Si and S2, while the third term involves suffixes present only in Si and the fourth term involves suffixes present only in S2.
    This format will appear in all of the components of this computation.
    Recall that the function Ltypo specifies the length of a string in bits, which we may take here to be simply log(26) times the number of characters in the string.
    In (9), we derive the corresponding formula for the stem component.
    The general form of the computation of the change to the signature component (10) is more complicated, and this
