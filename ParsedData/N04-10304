			The problem of shallow semantic parsing can be viewed as three different tasks.Argument Identification ? This is the process of identi fying parsed constituents in the sentence that represent semantic arguments of a given predicate.
			Argument Classification ? Given constituents known torepresent arguments of a predicate, assign the appropri ate argument labels to them.Argument Identification and Classification ? A combina tion of the above two tasks.
			Each node in the parse tree can be classified as eitherone that represents a semantic argument (i.e., a NONNULL node) or one that does not represent any seman tic argument (i.e., a NULL node).
			The NON-NULL no
