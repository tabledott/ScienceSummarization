  Nymble: A High-Performance Learning Name-Finder
  
    This paper presents a statistical, learned approach to finding names and other nonrecursive entities in text (as per the MUC-6 definition of the NE task), using a variant of the standard hidden Markov model.
    We present our justification for the problem and our approach, a detailed discussion of the model itself and finally the successful results of this new approach.
  
  
    In the past decade, the speech recognition community has had huge successes in applying hidden Markov models, or HMM's to their problems.
    More recently, the natural language processing community has effectively employed these models for part-ofspeech tagging, as in the seminal (Church, 1988) and other, more recent efforts (Weischedel et al., 1993).
    We would now propose that HMM's have successfully been applied to the problem of name-finding.
    We have built a named-entity (NE) recognition system using a slightly-modified version of an HMM; we call our system &amp;qu
