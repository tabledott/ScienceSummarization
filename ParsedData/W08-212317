 80.80 84.66 Table 7: Syntactic?semantic integration.
  6 Conclusion We have described a system1 for syntactic and se- mantic dependency analysis based on PropBank and NomBank, and detailed the implementation of its subsystems.
  Crucial to our success was the high performance of the syntactic parser, which achieved a high accuracy.
  In addition, we recon- firmed the benefits of global inference in semantic analysis: both constraint-based and learning-based methods resulted in improvements over a baseline.
  Finally, we showed that integration of syntactic and semantic analysis is beneficial for both sub- tasks.
  We hope that this shared task will spur fur- ther research that leads to new feature representa- tions and search procedures to handle the problem of joint syntactic and semantic analysis.
