rs that were found in a training set of text produced by non-native Swedish writers, targeted spelling errors involving prepositions and some particularly problematic Swedish verbs.
    In a test of the system, 11 of 40 preposition errors were correctly detected.
    Izumi et al. (2003) and (2004) used errorannotated transcripts of Japanese speakers in an interview-based test of spoken English to train a maximum entropy classifier (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) to recognize 13 different types of grammatical and lexical errors, including errors involving prepositions.
    The classifier relied on lexical and syntactic features.
    Overall performance for the 13 error types reached 25.1% precision with 7.1% recall on an independent test set of sentences from the same source, but the researchers do not separately report the results for preposition error detection.
    The approach taken by Izumi and colleagues is most similar to the one we have used, which is described in the next section.
