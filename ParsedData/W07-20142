his aim in a first evaluation challenge was judged to be too difficult, both for organizers and participants, and a staged approach was deemedmore effective.
			Thus we here present an initial eval uation exercise based on three limited tasks that webelieve are realistic both from the perspective of as sembling resources for development and testing and from the perspective of developing systems capable of addressing the tasks.
			They are also tasks, whichshould they be performable automatically, have ap plication potential.
	
	
			The tasks as originally proposed were modified slightly during the course of resource development for the evaluation exercise due to constraints on dataand annotator availability.
			In the following we de scribe the tasks as they were ultimately realized in the evaluation.
			There were three tasks ? A, B and C. For allthree tasks the data provided for testing and train ing includes annotations identifying: (1) sentence boundaries; (2) all temporal referring expression as 75 speci
