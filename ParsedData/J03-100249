the last iteration of Model 6 for both translation directions.
    In this experiment, we use the conventional dictionary as well.
    Particularly for the Verbmobil task, with the language pair German-English, we observe that for German as the source language the alignment error rate is much higher than for English as source language.
    A possible reason for this difference in the alignment error rates is that the baseline alignment representation as a vector aJ1 does not allow German word compounds (which occur frequently) to be aligned with more than one English word.
    The effect of merging alignments by forming the intersection, the union, or the refined combination of the Viterbi alignments in both translation directions is shown in Tables 17 and 18.
    Figure 5 shows the corresponding precision/recall graphs.
    By using the refined combination, we can increase precision and recall on the Hansards task.
    The lowest alignment error rate on the Hansards task is obtained by using the intersection
