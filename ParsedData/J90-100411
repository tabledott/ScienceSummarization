t of as applying to the rules at compile time.
    Wedekind (1988) achieves the reordering by first generating nodes that are connected, that is, whose semantics is instantiated.
    Since the NP is not connected in this sense, but the VP is, the latter will be expanded first.
    In essence, the technique is a kind of goal freezing (Colmerauer 1982) or implicit wait declaration (Naish 1986).
    This method is more general, as the reordering is dynamic; the ordering of child nodes can, in principle at least, be different for di fferent uses of the same rule.
    The generality seems necessary; for cases in which the a priori ordering of goals is insufficient, Dymetman and Isabelle also introduce goal freezing to control expansion.
    Although vastly superior to the naive top-down algorithm, even this sort of amended top-down approach to generation based on goal freezing under one guise or another is insufficient with respect to certain linguistically plausible analyses.
    The symptom is an ordering parado
