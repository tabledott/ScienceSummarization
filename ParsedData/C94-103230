lus ion We have developed a stochastic Japanese morphologi- cal analyzer.
  It uses a statistical tagging model and an efficient two-pass earch algorithm to llnd the N best morphological nalysis hypotheses for the input sen- tence.
  Its word segmentation a d tagging accuracy is approxlmatcly 95%, which is comparable to the star.e- of-the-art stochastic tagger for English.
