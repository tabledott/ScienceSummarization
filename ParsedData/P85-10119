constraints.
  It is thus clear that TAGs can generate more than context-free languages.
  It can be shown that TAGs cannot generate all context,-sensitive languages [Jmhi ,lg84J.
  Although TAGs are more powerful than CFGs, this extra power is highly constrained and apparently it is just the right kind for characterizing certain structural descriptions.
  TAGs share almost all the formal properties of CFGs (more precisely, the corresponding classes of language,).
  we shalJ see in Netin* 4 of this paper and [Vijay-Shankar nd Joehi,1985J.
  In addition,the string languages of TAGs can also be parsed in polynomial time, in partkular is O(nS}.
  The parsing algorithm is described is detail in section 3.
