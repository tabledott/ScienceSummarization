poses as done in both C&amp;C and Goodman (1997).
    We applied the binarization technique described above to the grammar.
    We chose to measure the amount of work done by the parser in terms of the average number of edges popped off the agenda before finding a parse.
    This method has the advantage of being platform independent, as well as providing a measure of &amp;quot;perfection&amp;quot;.
    Here, perfection is the minimum number of edges we would need to pop off the agenda in order to create the correct parse.
    For the binarized grammar, where each popped edge is a completed constituent, this number is simply the number of terminals plus nonterminals in the sentence&#8212; on average, 47.5.
    Our algorithm includes some measures to reduce the number of items on the agenda, and thus (presumably) the number of popped edges.
    Each time we add a constituent to the chart, we combine it with the constituents on either side of it, potentially creating several new edges.
    For each of these new
