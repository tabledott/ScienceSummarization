    For the purpose of evaluation, we created two datasets: one for corporate acquisitions, as shown in Table 2, and one for the person-birthplace relation, with the example pairs from Table 3.
    In both tables, the top part shows the training pairs, while the bottom part shows the test pairs.
    Given a pair of arguments (a1, a2), the corresponding bag of sentences is created as follows: &#9632; A query string &#8220;a1 * * * * * * * a2&#8221; containing seven wildcard symbols between the two arguments is submitted to Google.
    The preferences are set to search only for pages written in English, with Safesearch turned on.
    This type of query will match documents where an occurrence of a1 is separated from an occurrence of a2 by at most seven content words.
    This is an approximation of our actual information ber of sentences in the bag), and C(X, w) the numb
