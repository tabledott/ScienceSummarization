  6 Conclusion The automatic method for the disambiguation of nouns presented in this papcr is ready-usable in any general domain and on free-running text, given part of speech tags.
  It does not need any training and uses word sense tags from WordNet, an extensively used Icxieal data base.
  Conceptual Density has been used for other tasks apart from the disambiguation of free-running test.
  Its application for automatic spelling correction is outlined in tAgirre ct al.
  It was also used on Computational Lexicography, enriching dictionary senses with semantic tags extracted from WordNet [Rigau 9411, or linking bilingual dictionaries to WordNet [Rigau and Agirre 96].
  In the experiments, the algorithm disambiguated [our texts (about 10,000 words long) of SemCor, a subset of the Brown corpus.
  The results were obtained automatically comparing the tags in SemCor with those computed by the algorithm, which would allow the comparison with oth
