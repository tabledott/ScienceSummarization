l-based methods provide an elegant solution to explore implicitly structured features by directly computing the similarity between two trees.
			Although earlier researches (Zelenko et al2003; Culotta and Sorensen 2004; Bunescu and Mooney 2005a) only achieve success on simple tasks and fail on complex tasks, such as the ACE RDC task, tree kernel-based methods achieve much progress recently.
			As the state-of-the-art, Zhang et al(2006) applied the convo lution tree kernel (Collins and Duffy 2001) and achieved comparable performance with a state-of-the art linear kernel (Zhou et al2005) on the 5 relation types in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.
			However, there are two problems in Collins and Duffy?s convolution tree kernel for relation extraction.
			The first is that the sub-trees enumerated in the tree kernel computation are context-free.
			That is, each sub-tree enumerated in the tree kernel computation 728 does not consider the context information outside the sub-tree.
			The second is to decide a proper tree
