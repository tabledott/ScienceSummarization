dimensional PMTG and a word-to-word translation model is similar in spirit to the way that regular grammars can help to estimate CFGs (Lari &amp; Young, 1990), and the way that simple translation models can help to bootstrap more sophisticated ones (Brown et al., 1993).
    We need only redefine the terms in a way that does not rely on an-PMTG.
    Without loss of generality, we shall assume a -PMTG that ranges over the first components, where .
    We shall then refer to the structured components and the unstructured components.
    We begin with .
    For the structured components , we retain the grammarbased definition: by applying the chain rule9 and continues by making independence assumptions.
    The first assumption is that the structured components of the production&#8217;s RHS are conditionally independent of the unstructured components of its LHS: The above probability can be looked up in the -PMTG.
    Second, since we have no useful nonterminals in the unstructured components, we let if and other
