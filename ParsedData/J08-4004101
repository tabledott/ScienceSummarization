e above using Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum&#8217;s LABEL category, then we would still find a distance d = 1/3.
    An alternative way of using &#945; for word sense annotation was developed and tested by Passonneau, Habash, and Rambow (2006).
    Their approach is to allow coders to assign multiple labels (WordNet synsets) for wordsenses, as done by V&#180;eronis (1998) and more recently by Rosenberg and Binkowski (2004) for text classification labels and by Poesio and Artstein (2005) for anaphora.
    These multi-label sets can then be compared using the MASI distance metric for &#945; (Passonneau 2006).
  
  
    The purpose of this article has been to expose the reader to the mathematics of chancecorrected coefficients of agreement as well as the current state of the art of using these coefficients in CL.
    Our hope is that readers come to view agreement studies not as an additional chore or hurdle for publication, but as a tool for analysis which offers new insights into the annotation process.
