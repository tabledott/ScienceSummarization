  A Unification Method For Disjunctive Feature Descriptions
  
    Although disjunction has been used in several unificationbased grammar formalisms, existing methods of unification have been unsatisfactory for descriptions containing large quantities of disjunction, because they require exponential time.
    This paper describes a method of unification by successive approximation, resulting in better average performance.
  
  
    Disjunction has been used in several unification-based grammar formalisms to represent alternative structures in descriptions of constituents.
    Disjunction is an essential component of grammatical descriptions in Kay's Functional Unification Grammar [6], and it has been proposed by Karttunen as a linguistically motivated extension to PATR-II [2].
    In previous work two methods have been used to handle disjunctive descriptions in parsing and other computational applications.
    The first method requires expanding descriptions to disjunctive normal form (DNF) so that the entir
