MUC (6&#8211;7) data sets and yields state-of-the-art performance (70.4 F-measure on MUC-6 and 63.4 on MUC-7).
    Example of a feature-vector document representation using all transitions of length two given syntactic categories S, O, X, and &#8211;.
    Barzilay and Lapata Modeling Local Coherence Although machine learning approaches to coreference resolution have been reasonably successful&#8212;state-of-the-art coreference tools today reach an F-measure2 of 70% when trained on newspaper texts&#8212;it is unrealistic to assume that such tools will be readily available for different domains and languages.
    We therefore consider an additional approach to entity extraction where entity classes are constructed simply by clustering nouns on the basis of their identity.
    In other words, each noun in a text corresponds to a different entity in a grid, and two nouns are considered coreferent only if they are identical.
    Under this view Microsoft Corp. from Table 2 (Sentence 1) corresponds to two entities,
