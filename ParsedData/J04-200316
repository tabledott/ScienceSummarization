xt information locally available, and it allows information to be explicitly accessed at different levels of abstraction.
    Inflected word forms in the input language often contain information that is not relevant for translation.
    This is especially true for the task of translating from a more inflecting language like German into English, for instance: In parallel German/English corpora, the German part contains many more distinct word forms than the English part (see, for example, Table 5).
    It is useful for the process of statistical machine translation to define equivalence classes of word forms which tend to be translated by the same target language word: The resulting statistical translation lexicon becomes smoother, and the coverage is considerably improved.
    Such equivalence classes are constructed by omitting those items of information from morpho-syntactic analysis which are not relevant for translation.
    The lemma-tag representation of the corpus helps to identify the unimportant info
