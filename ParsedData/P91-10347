notres gagnent, which means it is necessary that we win, il should be translated as it.
    Here, we can determine which sense to assign to il by asking about the identity of the first verb to its right.
    Even though we cannot hope to determine the translation of il from this informant unambiguously, we can hope to obtain a significant amount of information about the translation.
