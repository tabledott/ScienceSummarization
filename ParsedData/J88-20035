) and (2) do not arise from any sense-ambiguity of when, or from any &amp;quot;fuzziness&amp;quot; in the relation that it expresses between the times referred to in the clauses it conjoins, but from the fact that the meaning of when is not primarily temporal at all.
    Nor is it simply causal, as Example 3 shows.
    We will argue instead that when has a single sense-meaning, reflecting its role of establishing a temporal focus, which we follow Isard and Longuet-Higgins (1973) in relating to Reichenbach's reference time (cf. introduction to this collection).
    The apparent diversity of meanings arises from the nature of this referent and the organisation of events and states of affairs in episodic memory under a relation we shall call contingency, a term related, but not identical to a notion like causality, rather than mere temporal sequentiality.
    This contingent, nontemporal relation on the representation of events in episodic memory also determines the ontology of propositions associated with lingu
