much as possible.
    This is, of course, the same approach taken in our own work, which could be seen as pushing Carter's approach to the extreme.
    The difference is that when it becomes necessary, SPAR does use Iwo commonsense knowledge sources: a semantic network based on Alshawi's theory of memory for text interpretation (Alshawi 1987) and a causal reasoner based on Wilks' work (Wilks 1975).
    In both cases, the necessary information was encoded by hand.
    Carter's system was tested over short stories specifically designed for the testing of the system: about 40 written by Carter himself, and 23 written by others.
    These latter contain about 80 definite descriptions.
    SPAR correctly resolved all anaphors in the stories written by Carter, and 66 out of 80 of the descriptions in the 23 other stories.
    (Carter himself points out that these results are &amp;quot;of limited significance because of the simplicity of the texts processed compared to 'real' texts&amp;quot; [p.
    238].)
