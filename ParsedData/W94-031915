g and self-repair (summarized in [Levelt, 1989, pages 458299]) suggests that there is some feedback in the human language generation system, so the human language processor is probably more complex than a simple one-way pipeline; but it may not be much more complex.
    To the best of my knowledge, most of the observed self-repair phenomena could be explained by an architecture that added a few feedback loops from later stages of the pipeline back to the initial planner; this would only slightly add to the number of intermodule interfaces (perhaps N+1 instead of N-1, say), and hence would have a much lower engineering cost than implementing the fully connected 'every module communicates with every other module' architecture.
    Whether the human language engine is organized as a 'pipeline plus a few feedback loops' or an 'every module talks to every other module' architecture is unknown at this point; hopefully new psycholinguistic experiments will shed more light on this issue.
    I think it would be very
