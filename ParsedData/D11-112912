    The diagram of a transitive sentence is shown in Figure 3.
    Cats like milk.
    n nr s nl n Syntax-guided Semantic Composition According to Coecke et al. (2010) and based on a general completeness theorem between compact categories, wire diagrams, and vector spaces, the meaning of sentences can be canonically reduced to linear algebraic formulae.
    The following is the meaning vector of our transitive sentence: ++++++++- cats like = (f ) (cats &#174;1 like &#174; &#65533;) (I) Here f is the linear map that encodes the grammatical structure.
    The categorical morphism corresponding to it is denoted by the tensor product of 3 components: eV &#174;1S &#174;eW, where V and W are subject and object spaces, S is the sentence space, the E&#8217;s are the cups, and 1S is the straight line in the diagram.
    The cups stand for taking inner products, which when done with the basis vectors imitate substitution.
    The straight line stands for the identity map that does nothing.
