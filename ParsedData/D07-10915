rphology part-of-speech word word morphologyFigure 2: Example factored model: morphologi cal analysis and generation, decomposed into three mapping steps (translation of lemmas, translation ofpart-of-speech and morphological information, gen eration of surface forms).
	
	
			One example to illustrate the short-comings of thetraditional surface word approach in statistical machine translation is the poor handling of morphology.
			Each word form is treated as a token in it self.
			This means that the translation model treats, say, the word house completely independent of the word houses.
			Any instance of house in the training data does not add any knowledge to the translation of houses.
			In the extreme case, while the translation of house may be known to the model, the word housesmay be unknown and the system will not be able to translate it.
			While this problem does not show up as stronglyin English ? due to the very limited morphological inflection in English ? it does constitute a sig nificant proble
