 discourse segments, as well as local structural features, using text alone as well as text and professionally recorded speech.
    Agreement ranged from 74%-95%, depending upon discourse feature.
    Hearst (1993) asked subjects to place boundaries between paragraphs of three expository texts (length 77 to 160 sentences), to indicate topic changes.
    She found agreement greater than 80%.
    We present results of an empirical study of a large corpus of spontaneous oral narratives, with a large number of potential boundaries per narrative.
    Subjects were asked to segment transcripts using an informal notion of speaker intention.
    As we will see, we found agreement ranging from 82%-92%, with very high levels of statistical significance (from p = .114 x 10-6 to p &lt; .6 x 10-9).
    One of the goals of such empirical work is to use the results to correlate linguistic cues with discourse structure.
    By asking subjects to segment discourse using a non-linguistic criterion, the correlation of linguisti
