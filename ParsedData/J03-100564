    The translation task for the translation direction English to German is more difficult than for the translation direction German to English; the trigram language model perplexity increases from 38.3 to 68.2 on the TEST-331 test set, as can be seen in Table 5.
    No parameter optimization is carried out for this translation direction; the parameter settings are carried over from the results obtained in Table 11.
    The word error rates for the translation direction English to German are significantly higher than those for the translation direction German to English.
    There are several reasons for this: German vocabulary and perplexity are significantly larger than those for English, and only a single reference translation per test sentence is available for English-to-German translation.
    There is only a very small difference in terms of word error rates for the reordering constraints EG and S3; in particular, WER is 70.1% for both.
