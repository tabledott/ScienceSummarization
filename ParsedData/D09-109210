terestingly, all languages except Greek and Finnish use closely related words for &#8220;youth&#8221; or &#8220;young&#8221; in a separate topic.)
    The third topic demonstrates differences in inflectional variation.
    English and the Romance languages use only singular and plural versions of &#8220;objective.&#8221; The other Germanic languages include compound words, while Greek and Finnish are dominated by inflected variants of the same lexical item.
    The final topic demonstrates that PLTM effectively clusters &#8220;syntactic&#8221; words, as well as more semantically specific nouns, adjectives and verbs.
    Although the topics in figure 2 seem highly focused, it is interesting to ask whether the model is genuinely learning mixtures of topics or simply assigning entire document tuples to single topics.
    To answer this question, we compute the posterior probability of each topic in each tuple under the trained model.
    If the model assigns all tokens in a tuple to a single topic, the maximum p
