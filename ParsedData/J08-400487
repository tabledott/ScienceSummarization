 the annotation of the antecedents of references to abstract objects, such as the example of the pronoun that in utterance 7.6 (TRAINS 1991, dialogue d91-2.2).
    Previous studies of discourse deixis annotation showed that these are extremely difficult judgments to make (Eckert and Strube 2000; Navarretta 2000; Byron 2002), except perhaps for identifying the type of object (Poesio and Modjeska 2005), so we simplified the task by only requiring our participants to identify the boundaries of the area of text in which the antecedent was introduced.
    Even so, we found a great variety in how these boundaries were marked: Exactly as in the case of discourse segmentation discussed earlier, our participants broadly agreed on the area of text, but disagreed on A comparison of the values of &#945; and K for anaphoric annotation (Poesio and Artstein 2005). its exact boundary.
    For instance, in this example, nine out of ten annotators marked the antecedent of that as a text segment ending with the word Elmira, but
