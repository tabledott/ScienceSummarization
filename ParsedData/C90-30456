m the other.
			3The definition allows for the operations performed on the first Synchronous TAG derivation then proceods by choos~ ing a pair of initial trees (cq, o~2) that is an element of the grammar, and repeatedly applying derivation steps as above.
			As an example, suppose we start with the tree pair c~ in Figure 1.
			4 We choose the link from the subject NP to T and the tree pair fl to apply to its nodes.
			The resultant, by synchronous substitution, is the tree pair: i Ny T T,\ I I I \George V " / ~P, hates' georgeJ / Note that the links from a are preserved in the resul- tant pair cq except for the chosen link, which has no counterpart in the result.
			Using tree pair 7 on the remaining link from NP to T in oq yields o~ 2 \] NP VP~.
			.~ ~ R T .~.
			T \ George y ~P hare'george')broccoli' \ hates broccoli This pairing manifests the correspondence b tween the sentence "George hates broccoli" and its logical form hates' (george' , broccoli') (as written in a more tradi- tional notation).
