panese, have no explicit marking of proper nouns.
    Interestingly, the capitalization feature contributed very little to the reduction in error rates, whereas using the word features contributed a great deal.
    However, it does undeniably reduce confusion with respect to the proper noun category.
    Some well-known previous efforts (Church 1988; de Marcken 1990) have dealt with unknown words using various heuristics.
    For instance, Church's program PARTS has a prepass prior to applying the tri-tag probability model that predicts proper nouns based on capitalization.
    The new aspects of our work are (1) incorporating the treatment of unknown words uniformly within the probability model, (2) approximating the component probabilities for unknowns directly from the training data, and (3) measuring the contribution of the tri-tag model, of the ending, and of capitalization.
    In sum, adding a probability model of typical endings of words to the trkag model has yielded an accuracy of 82% for unknown wo
