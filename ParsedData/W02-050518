y affects the transliterations obtained using our models.
    We also present some transliteration errors made by our algorithm in Section 8.2.3.
    Table 7 shows the transliteration accuracy of the spelling-based model, the phonetic-based model, and the linear combination on the development and blind test set.
    The spelling-based model was by far more accurate than the phonetic-based model in all three categories and on both data sets.
    Because it combines the transliterations of the two models, we expected the linear combination to be the most accurate.
    However, this was not the case.
    The linear combination was slightly worse than the spellingbased model when considering only the top candidate, and slightly better when considering the top20 candidates.
    We believe that the reason is that equal weights were given to the phonetic-based and spelling-based models in the combination.
    Weighting the spelling-based model higher will most likely give more accurate transliterations.
