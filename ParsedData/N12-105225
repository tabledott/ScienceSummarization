ese are often annotated in similar ways across treebanks, typically modifying the main verb of the sentence.
    The bottom half of Table 5 gives the scores when restricted to such dependencies in the gold data.
    We measure the percentage of modifiers in subject and object dependencies that modify the correct word.
    Indeed, here we see the difference in performance become clearer, with the cross-lingual cluster model reducing errors by 14% relative to the non-cross-lingual model and upwards of 22% relative for IT.
    We now turn to the results of the transfer experiments for NER, listed in Table 6.
    While the performance of the transfer systems is very poor when no word clusters are used, adding cross-lingual word clusters give substantial improvements across all languages.
    The simple PROJECTED CLUSTERS work well, but the X-LINGUAL CLUSTERS provide even larger improvements.
    On average the latter reduce errors on the test set by 22% in terms of FI and up to 26% for ES.
    We also measure how
