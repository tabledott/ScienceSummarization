ice for many natural language processing tasks.
    Although they take much longer to train than generative models, they typically produce higher performing systems, in large part due to the ability to incorporate arbitrary, potentially overlapping features.
    However, constituency parsing remains an area dominated by generative methods, due to the computational complexity of the problem.
    Previous work on discriminative parsing falls under one of three approaches.
    One approach does discriminative reranking of the n-best list of a generative parser, still usually depending highly on the generative parser score as a feature (Collins, 2000; Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
    A second group of papers does parsing by a sequence of independent, discriminative decisions, either greedily or with use of a small beam (Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Henderson, 2004).
    This paper extends the third thread of work, where joint inference via dynamic programming algorithms is used to train models and to attempt to find the gl
