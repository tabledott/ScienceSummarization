in WordNet: VC = {vc E WordNet}.
    Let AC be the set of adjective classes (which subsume WordNet synsets; we elaborate further on this subsequently).
    Thus, the TCMs define a probability distribution over NS that is conditioned on a verb class (vc) or adjective class (ac) and a particular grammatical relation (gr): Acquisition of a TCM for a given vc and gr proceeds as follows.
    The data for acquiring the preference are obtained from a subset of the tuples involving verbs in the synset or troponym (subordinate) synsets.
    Not all verbs that are troponyms or direct members of the synset are used in training.
    We take the noun argument heads occurring with verbs that have no more than 10 senses in WordNet and a frequency of 20 or more occurrences in the BNC data in the specified grammatical relationship.
    The threshold of 10 senses removes some highly polysemous verbs having many sense distinctions that are rather subtle.
    Verbs that have more than 10 senses include very frequent verbs such a
