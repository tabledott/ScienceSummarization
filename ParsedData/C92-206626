 a context-free subset of SLTAG confirms that SLTAG enables faster conver- gence than stochastic ontext-free grammars (SCFG).
			This is the case since SCFG are unable to represent lexieal influences on distribution except by a statisti- cally and eomputationally impractical proliferation of nonterminal symbols, whereas SLTAG allows for a lexi- eally sensitive distributional mmlysis while maintaining a hierarchical structure.
			Furthermore, the techniques explained in this paper apply to other grammatical formalisms uch as combi- natory categorial grammars and modified head gram- mars since they have been proven to be equivalent to tree-adjoining grammars and linear indexed grmnmars (Joshi, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir, 1991).
			Due to the lack of space, only few experiments with SLTAG were reported.
			A full version of tile paper will be available by tile time of the meeting and more exper- imental details will be reported uring the presentation of the paper.
