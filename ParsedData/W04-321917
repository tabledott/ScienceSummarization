ynonym list, again with a trigram language model.
    We used standard bigram clustering techniques (Goodman 2002) to produce 4,096 clusters of our 65,225 vocabulary items.
  
  
    We have experimented with several methods for extracting a parallel sentence-aligned corpus from news clusters using word alignment error rate, or AER, (Och &amp; Ney 2003) as an evaluation metric.
    A brief summary of these experiments is provided in Table 1.
    To evaluate the quality of generation, we followed the lead of Barzilay &amp; Lee (2003).
    We started with the 59 sentences and corresponding paraphrases from MSA and WordNet (designated as WN below).
    Since the size of this data set made it difficult to obtain statistically significant results, we also included 141 randomly selected sentences from held-out clusters.
    We then produced paraphrases with each of the following systems and compared them with MSA and WN: For the sake of consistency, we did not use the judgments provided by Barzilay and Lee; instead
