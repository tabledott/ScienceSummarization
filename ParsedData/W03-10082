 predicate-argument structure, including longrange dependencies arising through control, raising, extraction and coordination.
  
  
    The Proposition Bank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) provides a human-annotated corpus of semantic verb-argument relations.
    For each verb appearing in the corpus, a set of semantic roles is defined.
    Roles for each verb are simply numbered Arg0, Arg1, Arg2, etc.
    As an example, the entryspecific roles for the verb offer are given below: These roles are then annotated for every instance of the verb appearing in the corpus, including the following examples: A variety of additional roles are assumed to apply across all verbs.
    These secondary roles can be thought of as being adjuncts, rather than arguments, although no claims are made as to optionality or other traditional argument/adjunct tests.
    The secondary roles include: Location in Tokyo, outside Time last week, on Tuesday, never Manner easily, dramatically Direction south, into the wind Cause due to pressure
