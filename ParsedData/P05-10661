) has lead to the development of phrasebased systems (Och et al., 1999; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003).
    These methods go beyond the original IBM machine translation models (Brown et al., 1993), by allowing multi-word units (&#8220;phrases&#8221;) in one language to be translated directly into phrases in another language.
    A number of empirical evaluations have suggested that phrase-based systems currently represent the state&#8211;of&#8211;the&#8211;art in statistical machine translation.
    In spite of their success, a key limitation of phrase-based systems is that they make little or no direct use of syntactic information.
    It appears likely that syntactic information will be crucial in accurately modeling many phenomena during translation, for example systematic differences between the word order of different languages.
    For this reason there is currently a great deal of interest in methods which incorporate syntactic information within statistical machine translation systems (e.g.
