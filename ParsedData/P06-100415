 segments, and a typical segment corresponds to two pages of a transcript.
    Artificial Intelligence Lectures Our second lecture corpus differs in subject matter, lecturing style, and segmentation granularity.
    The graduate Artificial Intelligence class has, on average, twelve segments per lecture, and a typical segment is about half of a page.
    One segment roughly corresponds to the content of a slide.
    This time the segmentation was obtained from the lecturer herself.
    The lecturer went through the transcripts of lecture recordings and segmented the lectures with the objective of making the segments correspond to presentation slides for the lectures.
    Due to the low recording quality, we were unable to obtain the ASR transcripts for this class.
    Therefore, we only use manual transcriptions of these lectures.
    Synthetic Corpus Also as part of our analysis, we used the synthetic corpus created by Choi (2000) which is commonly used in the evaluation of segmentation algorithms.
