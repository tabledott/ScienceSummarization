-decomposable MWEs, and that the variability can be partially predicted from the decompositional analysis.
    We thus aim to capture the decomposability of MWEs in the grammar and use this to constrain the syntax of MWEs in parsing and generation.
    Note that it is arguable whether simple decomposable MWEs belong in the grammar proper, or should be described instead as lexical affinities between particular word combinations.
    As the first step down the path toward an empirical model of decomposability, we focus on demarcating simple decomposable MWEs from idiosyncratically decomposable and non-decomposable MWEs.
    This is largely equivalent to classifying MWEs as being endocentric (i.e., a hyponym of their head) or ezocentric (i.e., not a hyponym of their head: Haspelmath (2002)).
    We attempt to achieve this by looking at the semantic similarity between an MWE and its constituent words, and hypothesising that where the similarity between the constituents of an MWE and the whole is sufficiently high
