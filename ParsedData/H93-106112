  A tokenizer searches the input text for collocations that WordNet knows about and when one is found it is made into a unit by connecting its parts with underscores.
  For exam- ple, if a text contains the collocation "took place," the tok- enizer will convert it to "took_place."
  ConText can then display the synset for "take place" rather than successive synsets for "take" and "place."
  Syntactic tags indicate the part of speech of each word in the input text.
  We have used an automatic syntactic tagger developed by Eric Brill [6] which he generously adapted to our needs.
  For example, "store" can be a noun or a verb; when the syntactic tagger encounters an instance of "store" it tries to decide from the context whether it is being used as a noun or a verb.
  ConText then uses this syntactic tag to determine which part of speech to display to the user.
  Con- Text also uses syntactic tags in order to skip over closed- class words.
  Since the automatic syntactic tagger sometimes makes mistakes, Co
