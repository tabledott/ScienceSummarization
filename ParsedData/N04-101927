    Given the figures shown in Table 5, we don&#8217;t have reason to believe that unigram scores are correlated with pyramid scores.
  
  
    The work closest to ours is (Halteren and Teufel, 2003), and we profited from the lessons they derived from an annotation of 50 summaries of a single 600-word document into content units that they refer to as factoids.
    They found a total of 256 factoids and note that the increase in factoids with the number of summaries seems to follow a Zipfian distribution.
    We identify four important differences between factoids and SCUs.
    First, an SCU is a set of contributors that are largely similar in meaning, thus SCUs differ from each other in both meaning and weight (number of contributors).
    In contrast, factoids are semi-formal expressions in a FOPL-style semantics, which are compositionally interpreted.
    We intentionally avoid creating a representation language for SCU labels; the function of an SCU label is to focus the annotator&#8217;s attent
