quot;).
    That this is so is demonstrated by the fact that (25c) is true in 1994, whereas (26c) is not.
    Centering accommodates these differences by allowing the noun phrase &amp;quot;the Vice-President of the United States&amp;quot; potentially to contribute both its value-free interpretation and its value-loading at the world type to Cf(25a).
    Cb(25b) is then the value-free interpretation, and Cb(26b) is the value-loaded one (at the time of the writing of Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986), George Bush, but now [1995] Al Gore).
    In each sequence, the (a) utterance underdetermines what element to add to Cf.
    This underdetermination may continue in a subsequent utterance with the pronoun.
    For example, that would be the case if the introductory adverbials were left off the (b) utterances.
    We conjecture that the correct approach to take in these cases is to add the valuefree interpretation to Cf and then load it for the interpretation of subsequent utterances if this is necessary.
