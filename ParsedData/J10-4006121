eneral model for distributional semantics.
    The vectors of this space are labeled with links l (rows of matrix Bmode-2 in Table 3) and their dimensions are labeled with word pair tuples (w1, w2) (columns of the same matrix).
    Links are represented in terms of the word pairs they connect.
    The LxW1W2 space supports tasks where we are directly interested in the links as an object of study&#8212;for example, characterizing prepositions (Baldwin, Kordoni, and Villavicencio 2009) or measuring the relative similarity of different kinds of verb&#8211;noun relations.
    We focus here instead on a potentially more common use of LxW1W2 vectors as a &#8220;feature selection and labeling&#8221; space for W1W2xL tasks.
    Specifically, we go back to the qualia extraction task of Section 6.2.3.
    There, we started with manually identified links.
    Here, we start with examples of noun&#8211;quale pairs (n, qr) that instantiate a role r. We project all LxW1W2 vectors in a subspace where only dimensions corresp
