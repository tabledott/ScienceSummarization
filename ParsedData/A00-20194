pass the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.
    All occurrences of the word in a collection of edited text could be automatically assigned to a single training set representing appropriate usage.
    Inappropriate usage would be signaled by contextual cues that do not occur in training.
    Unfortunately, this approach was not effective for error detection.
    An example of a word usage error is often very similar to the model of appropriate usage.
    An incorrect usage can contain two or three salient contextual elements as well as a single anomalous element.
    The problem of error detection does not entail finding similarities to appropriate usage, rather it requires identifying one element among the contextual cues that simply does not fit.
  
  
    What kinds of anomalous elements does ALEK identify?
    Writers sometimes produce errors that violate basic principles of English syntax (e.g., a desks), while other mistakes show a lack of information about a specific vocabulary item (e.g., a knowledge).
