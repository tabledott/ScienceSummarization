s for years and it has been said that &amp;quot;the quest for an efficient method for the analysis and generation of word-forms is no longer an academic research topic&amp;quot; (Karlsson and Karttunen, 1997).
    However, development of these analyzers typically begins with human intervention requiring time spans from days to weeks.
    If it were possible to build such analyzers automatically without human knowledge, significant development time could be saved.
    On a larger scale, consider the task of inducing machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) using no human-provided information (&amp;quot;knowledge-free&amp;quot;).
    In building an MRD, &amp;quot;simply expanding the dictionary to encompass every word one is ever likely to encounter.. .fails to take advantage of regularities&amp;quot; (Sproat, 1992, p. xiii).
    Hence, automatic morphological analysis is also critical for selecting appropriate and non-redundant MRD headwords.
    For the reasons expressed above, we are interested in knowledge-free
