Ward, 2003).
    We adopt a tagging perspective for the three tasks.
    Thereby, we address them using the same SVM experimental setup which comprises a standard SVM as a multiclass classifier (Allwein et al., 2000).
    The difference for the three tasks lies in the input, context and features.
    None of the features utilized in our approach is explicitly language dependent.
    The following subsections illustrate the different tasks and their corresponding features and tag sets.
    We approach word tokenization (segmenting off clitics) as a one-of-six classification task, in which each letter in a word is tagged with a label indicating its morphological identity.4 Therefore, a word may have proclitics and enclitic from the lists described in Section 2.
    A word may have no clitics at all, hence the .
    Input: A sequence of transliterated Arabic characters processed from left-to-right with &#8221;break&#8221; markers for word boundaries.
    Context: A fixed-size window of -5/+5 characters centered
