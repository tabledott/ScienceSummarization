of q is not a subset of the support of r).
    2Strictly speaking, some of these functions are dissimilarity measures, but each such function f can be recast as a similarity function via the simple transformation C &#8212; f, where C is an appropriate constant.
    Whether we mean f or C &#8212; f should be clear from context.
    1, The confusion probability has been used by several authors to smooth word cooccurrence probabilities (Sugawara et al., 1985; Essen and Steinbiss, 1992; Grishman and Sterling, 1993); it measures the degree to which word m can be substituted into the contexts in which n appears.
    If the base language model probabilities obey certain Bayesian consistency conditions (Dagan et al., 1999), as is the case for relative frequencies, then we may write the confusion probability as follows: Note that it incorporates unigram probabilities as well as the two distributions q and r. Finally, Kendall's T which appears in work on clustering similar adjectives (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993
