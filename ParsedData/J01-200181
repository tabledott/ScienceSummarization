in the case of speakers of Japanese, Chinese, and Korean when forced to place word boundaries in e-mail romanizations of their language.

    Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language for which no analysis was provided by the algorithm, and Spurious Analysis are the cases of words that are not morphologically complex but were analyzed as containing a suffix.
    For both English and French, correct performance is found in 83% of the words; details are presented in Tables 10 and 11.
    For English, these figures correspond to precision of 829/(829 + 52 + 83) = 85.9%, and recall of 829/(829 + 52 + 36) = 90.4%.
