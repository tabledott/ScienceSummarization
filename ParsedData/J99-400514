e complex channel.
    We first create a source word e, for each subset in C, and let g, be the size of that subset.
    We create a table b(e,jej) with values set uniformly to the reciprocal of the source vocabulary size (i.e., the number of subsets in C).
    Assuming S has m elements, we next create target words ,fin corresponding to each of those elements, and set up channel model tables as follows: 1/g, if the element in S corresponding to j5 is also in the subset s(fi le,) = corresponding to e, Finally, we set k to zero.
    This completes the reduction.
    To solve an instance of Minimum Set Cover in polynomial time, we transform it as above, then call MlDECIDE with inputs b, E, s, k, and the words &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; n in any order.
    Selecting a concise set of source words is like solving the Minimum Set Cover Problem.
    A channel model with overlapping, one-to-many dictionary entries will typically license many decodings.
    The source model may prefer short decodings over long ones.
