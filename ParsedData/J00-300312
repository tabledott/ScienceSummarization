 function of the utterance was related to Task-Management and Communication-Management.
    Approximately 220 of the many possible unique combinations of these codes were used by the coders (Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca 1997).
    To obtain a system with somewhat higher interlabeler agreement, as well as enough data per class for statistical modeling purposes, a less fine-grained tag set was devised.
    This tag set distinguishes 42 mutually exclusive utterance types and was used for the experiments reported here.
    Table 2 shows the 42 categories with examples and relative frequencies.'
    While some of the original infrequent classes were collapsed, the resulting DA type distribution is still highly skewed.
    This occurs largely because there was no basis for subdividing the dominant DA categories according to task-independent and reliable criteria.
    The tag set incorporates both traditional sociolinguistic and discourse-theoretic notions, such as rhetorical relations and adjacency pairs, as well
