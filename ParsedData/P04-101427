e parser of Clark et al. (2002) and produces results at least as good as the current state-of-the-art for CCG parsing.
    The use of adaptive supertagging and the normal-form constraints result in a very efficient wide-coverage parser.
    Our system demonstrates that accurate and efficient wide-coverage CCG parsing is feasible.
    Future work will investigate extending the feature sets used by the log-linear models with the aim of further increasing parsing accuracy.
    Finally, the oracle results suggest that further experimentation with the supertagger will significantly improve parsing accuracy, efficiency and robustness.
