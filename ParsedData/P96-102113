    With regard to expressiveness, we believe that almost all variation in the order of arguments in a syntactic frame can be accommodated.3 Syntactic frames generally contain four or fewer subconstituents.
    Figure 2 shows that for the case of four subconstituents, BTGs permit 22 out of the 24 possible alignments.
    The only prohibited arrangements are &amp;quot;inside-out&amp;quot; transformations (Wu, 1995b), which we have been unable to find any examples of in our corpus.
    Moreover, extremely distorted alignments can be handled by BTGs (Wu, 1995c), without resorting to the unrestricted-alignment model.
    The translation expressiveness of BTGs is by no means perfect.
    They are nonetheless proving very useful in applications and are substantially more feasible than previous models.
    In our previous corpus analysis applications, any expressiveness limitations were easily tolerable since degradation was graceful.
    In the present translation application, any expressiveness limitation simpl
