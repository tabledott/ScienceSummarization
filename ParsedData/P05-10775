e a spherically symmetric random vector r of unit length from this k dimensional space.
    We define a hash function, hr, as: Proof of the above theorem is given by Goemans and Williamson (1995).
    We rewrite the proof here for clarity.
    The above theorem states that the probability that a random hyperplane separates two vectors is directly proportional to the angle between the two vectors (i,e., 0(u, v)).
    By symmetry, we have Pr[hr(u) =&#65533; hr(v)] = 2Pr[u.r &gt; 0, v.r &lt; 0].
    This corresponds to the intersection of two half spaces, the dihedral angle between which is 0.
    Thus, we have Pr[u.r &gt; 0, v.r &lt; 0] = 0(u, v)/27r.
    Proceeding we have Pr[hr(u) =&#65533; hr(v)] = 0(u, v)/7r and Pr[hr(u) = hr(v)] = 1 &#8722; 0(u, v)/7r.
    This completes the proof.
    Hence from equation 3 we have, This equation gives us an alternate method for finding cosine similarity.
    Note that the above equation is probabilistic in nature.
    Hence, we generate a large (d) number of random vector
