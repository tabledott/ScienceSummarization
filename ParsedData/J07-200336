d Hiero, is in Python, a bytecode-interpreted language, and optimized using Psyco, a just-in-time compiler (Rigo 2004), and Pyrex, a Python-like compiled language, with C++ code from the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke 2002).
    In this section we report on experiments with Mandarin-toEnglish translation.
    Our evaluation metric is case-insensitive BLEU-4 (Papineni et al. 2002), as defined by NIST, that is, using the shortest (as opposed to closest) reference sentence length for the brevity penalty.
    We ran the grammar extractor of Section 3.2 on the parallel corpora listed in Table 2 with the exception of the United Nations data, for a total of 28 million words (English side).8 We then filtered this grammar for our development set, which was the 2002 NIST MT evaluation dry-run data, and our test sets, which were the data from the 2003&#8211;2005 NIST MT evaluations.
    Some example rules are shown in Table 3, and the sizes of the filtered grammars are shown in Table 4.
    We also used the SRI
