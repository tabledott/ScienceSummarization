ike&#8221;).
    Consequently the method directly looks for low-dimensional structures with the highest predictive power.
    By contrast, the principle components of input data in the data space (which PCA seeks) may not necessarily have the highest predictive power.
    The above argument also applies to the feature generation from unlabeled data using LSI (e.g.
    Ando (2004)).
    Similarly, Miller et al. (2004) used word-cluster memberships induced from an unannotated corpus as features for named entity chunking.
    Our work is related but more general, because we can explore additional information from unlabeled data using many different auxiliary problems.
    Since Miller et al. (2004)&#8217;s experiments used a proprietary corpus, direct performance comparison is not possible.
    However, our preliminary implementation of the word clustering approach did not provide any improvement on our tasks.
    As we will see, our starting performance is already high.
    Therefore the additional information
