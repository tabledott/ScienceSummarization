ning NER and co-reference resolution systems on newsire text.
    In this case, all mentions of all the detected named entities are linked.
    We also constructed two additional data sets.
    The first is a subset of the ACE co-reference data set, which has the advantage that mentions and their types are given, and the co-reference is resolved.
    We asked annotators on Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk to link the first nominal mention of each co-reference chain to Wikipedia, if possible.
    Finding the accuracy of a majority vote of these annotations to be approximately 85%, we manually corrected the annotations to obtain ground truth for our experiments.
    The second data set we constructed, Wiki, is a sample of paragraphs from Wikipedia pages.
    Mentions in this data set correspond to existing hyperlinks in the Wikipedia text.
    Because Wikipedia editors explicitly link mentions to Wikipedia pages, their anchor text tends to match the title of the linked-topage&#8212;as a result, in the overwhelmin
