 syntactic node.
    This is guaranteed by the semantic rule formalism and by the fact that every lexical item has a semantics associated with it.
    Table 2 contains average edge counts and parse timing statisticsi for the 5875-utterance training set.
    'Gemini is implemented primarily in Quintus Prolog version 3.1.1.
    All timing numbers given in this paper were run on a lightly loaded Sun SPARCstation 2 with at least 48 MB of memory.
    Under normal conditions, Gemini runs in under 12 MB of memory.
    The constituent parser uses the constituent grammar to build all possible categories bottomup, independent of location within the string.
    Thus, the constituent parser does not force any constituent to occur either at the beginning of the utterance, or at the end.
    Those constraints are stated in what we call the utterance grammar.
    They are applied after constituent parsing is complete by the utterance parser.
    The utterance grammar specifies ways of combining the categories found by the c
