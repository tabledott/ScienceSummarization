ture uses the actual predicate lemma in addition to &#8220;voice:active&#8221;.
    Additionally, we define variations of these feature templates that concatenate the label sequence with features of individual nodes.
    We experimented with variations, and found that including the phrase type and the head of a directly dominating PP &#8211; if one exists &#8211; was most helpful.
    We also add a feature that detects repetitions of the same label in a candidate argument sequence, together with the phrase types of the nodes labeled with that label.
    For example, (NP-ARG0,WHNP-ARG0) is a common pattern of this form.
    Frame Features: Another very effective class of features we defined are features that look at the label of a single argument node and internal features of other argument nodes.
    The idea of these features is to capture knowledge about the label of a constituent given the syntactic realization of all arguments of the verb.
    This is helpful to capture syntactic alternations, such as the
