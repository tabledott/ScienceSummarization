still very large alignment space.
    In the meantime, synchronous parsing methods efficiently process the same bitext phrases while building their bilingual constituents, but continue to be employed primarily for word-to-word analysis (Wu, 1997).
    In this paper we unify the probability models for phrasal translation with the algorithms for synchronous parsing, harnessing the benefits of both to create a statistically and algorithmically wellfounded method for phrasal analysis of bitext.
    Section 2 begins by outlining the phrase extraction system we intend to replace and the two methods we combine to do so: the joint phrasal translation model (JPTM) and inversion transduction grammar (ITG).
    Section 3 describes our proposed solution, a phrasal ITG.
    Section 4 describes how to apply our phrasal ITG, both as a translation model and as a phrasal word-aligner.
    Section 5 tests our system in both these capacities, while Section 6 concludes.
  
  
    Phrasal decoders require a phrase table (Koehn et
