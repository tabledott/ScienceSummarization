e left two labels are called the left interface, and the right two labels are called the right interface.
    Left and right interfaces have only one label in case of spans of length one.
    A pair s = (Ilea, Ijght) with a left and a right interface is called a state.
    We partition the hypotheses associated with span p into sets compatible with the same state.
    In practice, for span p, we use a matrix Mp indexed by states, so that Mp(s), s = (Ilett, I,jght), is the set of all hypotheses associated with p that are compatible with Ilett and I ght.
    For a span p and a state s, we denote the associated top hypothesis as where V is the score of a hypothesis (defined in (1) below).
    Similarly, we denote the top state for p as Algorithm 1 Inference Algorithm Require: token sequence w1 &#183; &#183; &#183; wn; Require: beam width B; Require: weight vector w; where U is the score of an action.
    In other words, the score of an hypothesis is the sum of the score of the most recent action h.A and the scor
