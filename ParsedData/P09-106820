rameNet frames that have the largest overlap with each schema&#8217;s six verbs.
    We were able to map 13 of our 20 narratives to FrameNet (for the remaining 7, no frame contained more than one of the six verbs).
    The remaining 13 schemas contained 6 verbs each for a total of 78 verbs.
    26 of these verbs, however, did not occur in FrameNet, either at all, or with the correct sense.
    Of the remaining 52 verb mappings, 35 (67%) occurred in the closest FrameNet frame or in a frame one link away.
    17 verbs (33%) deliberate deadlocked found convict acquit occurred in a different frame than the one chosen.
    We examined the 33% of verbs that occurred in a different frame.
    Most occurred in related frames, but did not have FrameNet links between them.
    For instance, one schema includes the causal verb trade with unaccusative verbs of change like rise and fall.
