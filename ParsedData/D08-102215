onal counts for three conditional probabilities regarding a rule, which will be used in the experiments:
  
  
    The concept of packed forest has been previously used in translation rule extraction, for example in rule composition (Galley et al., 2006) and tree binarization (Wang et al., 2007).
    However, both of these efforts only use 1-best parses, with the second one packing different binarizations of the same tree in a forest.
    Nevertheless we suspect that their extraction algorithm is in principle similar to ours, although they do not provide details of forest-based fragmentation (Algorithm 1) which we think is non-trivial.
    The forest concept is also used in machine translation decoding, for example to characterize the search space of decoding with integrated language models (Huang and Chiang, 2007).
    The first direct application of parse forest in translation is our previous work (Mi et al., 2008) which translates a packed forest from a parser; it is also the base system in our experiments
