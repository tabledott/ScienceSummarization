  Semi-Supervised Training For Statistical Word Alignment
  
    We introduce a semi-supervised approach to training for statistical machine translation that alternates the traditional Expectation Maximization step that is applied on a large training corpus with a discriminative step aimed at increasing word-alignment quality on a small, manually word-aligned sub-corpus.
    We show that our algorithm leads not only to improved alignments but also to machine translation outputs of higher quality.
  
  
    The most widely applied training procedure for statistical machine translation &#8212; IBM model 4 (Brown et al., 1993) unsupervised training followed by post-processing with symmetrization heuristics (Och and Ney, 2003) &#8212; yields low quality word alignments.
    When compared with gold standard parallel data which was manually aligned using a high-recall/precision methodology (Melamed, 1998), the word-level alignments produced automatically have an F-measure accuracy of 64.6 and 76.4% (see Section 2
