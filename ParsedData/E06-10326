o, that was to, that would take, the American plane, the plane that, to Miami,, to Miami in, to carry him, to the American, to the plane, was being led, was led to, was to carry, which will take, while being escorted, will take him, would take him, , Florida . then the modified precisions would be p1 = .83, p2 = .59, p3 = .31, and p4 = .2.
    Each pn is combined and can be weighted by specifying a weight wn.
    In practice each pn is generally assigned an equal weight.
    Because Bleu is precision based, and because recall is difficult to formulate over multiple reference translations, a brevity penalty is introduced to compensate for the possibility of proposing highprecision hypothesis translations which are too short.
    The brevity penalty is calculated as: where c is the length of the corpus of hypothesis translations, and r is the effective reference corpus length.1 Thus, the Bleu score is calculated as A Bleu score can range from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate closer matches to the reference
