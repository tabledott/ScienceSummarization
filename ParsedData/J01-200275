ime needed to process the text can be expected to be at least a factor N+1 more than when using a single system.
    Whether this is worth the improvement that is achieved, which is as yet expressed in percents rather than in factors, will depend very much on the amount of text that has to be processed and the use that is made of the results.
    There are a few clear-cut cases, such as a corpus annotation project where the CPU time for tagging is negligible in relation to the time needed for manual correction afterwards (i.e., do use combination), or information retrieval on very large text collections where the accuracy improvement does not have enough impact to justify the enormous amount of extra CPU time (i.e., do not use combination).
    However, most of the time, the choice between combining or not combining will have to be based on evidence from carefully designed pilot experiments, for which this paper can only hope to provide suggestions and encouragement.
