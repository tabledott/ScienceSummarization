 ending-guessing rules are akin to those of Xerox and the morphological rules resemble some rules of Brill's, but ours use more constraints and provide a set of all possible tags for a word rather than a single best tag.
    The two additional types of features used by Brill's guesser are implicitly represented in our approach as well: One of the Brill schemata checks the context of an unknown word.
    In our approach we guess the words using their features only and provide several possibilities for a word; then at the disambiguation phase the context is used to choose the right tag.
    As for Brill's schemata that checks the presence of a particular character in an unknown word, we capture a similar feature by collecting the endingguessing rules for proper nouns and hyphenated words separately.
    We believe that the technique for the induction of the ending-guessing rules is quite similar to that of Xeroxl&#176; or Schmid (1994) but differs in the scoring and pruning methods.
