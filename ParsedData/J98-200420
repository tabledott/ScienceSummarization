 rewrite the figure of merit as follows: As usual, we use a trigram model for the tags, giving p(thk I to,prk,n) p(thk tj_2, Now, we assume that p(Mhk I kJ, tk,n) r-z&#8226;, p(Mhk I tj_i), that is, that the probability of a nonterminal is dependent on the tag immediately before it in the sentence (see Figure 9).
    Then we have: We can calculate /3(Nk) and the tritag probabilities as usual.
    The p(Ivihk I probabilities are estimated from our training data by parsing the training data and counting the occurrences of the nonterminal and the tag weighted by their probability in the parse.
    (Further details are provided in Appendix B.)
    We will refer to this figure as the left boundary trigram estimate.
    We can derive a similar estimate using context on both sides of the constituent as follows: Once again applying the usual independence assumption that given a nonterminal, the tag sequence it generates depends only on that nonterminal and also assuming that the probability of t depends only on the p
