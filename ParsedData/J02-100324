 age as each other, selection of FORMING A FOOTBALL TEAM removes all sets that do not make up a football team, and so on.
    As a result, the algorithm generates descriptions of sets of collective entities (i.e., sets of sets).
    In this way, descriptions such as those teams all of whose members are of the same age can be generated.
    In this collective version of D&amp;RPlural, the target S is a set of sets; P is a list of properties of sets, so if Pi E P, then [[Pill is also a set of sets.
    As in the case of distributive properties, describing one entity (in this case, one set) is a special case of describing a set of entities.
    Once again, these adaptations leave the algorithm structurally unchanged: sets replace objects throughout.
    Yet, they cause the complexity of the algorithm to become exponential, since testing whether C = S involves inspecting all elements of C, of which there can be up to 2nd (where nd is the cardinality of the domain D).
    This algorithm can also be applied to dist
