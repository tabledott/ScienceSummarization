grammars all we have is the lexicon, which projects the elementary structures of each lexical item; there is no independent grammar.
    The Extended Domain of Locality (EDL) property has two parts: Part (1) of EDL allows the anchor to impose syntactic and semantic constraints on its arguments directly since they appear in the same elementary structure that it anchors.
    Hence, all elements that appear within one elementary structure are considered to be local.
    This property also defines how large an elementary structure in a grammar can be.
    Figure 9 shows trees for the following example sentences: Figure 9(a) shows the elementary tree anchored by seem that is used to derive a raising analysis for sentence 1.
    Notice that the elements appearing in the tree are only those that serve as arguments to the anchor and nothing else.
    In particular, the subject NP (John in sentence 1) does not appear in the elementary tree for seem since it does not serve as an argument for seem.
