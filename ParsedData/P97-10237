es where a positive or negative label was assigned by both us and the independent evaluators, the average agreement on the label was 97.38%.
    The average inter-reviewer agreement on labeled adjectives was 96.97%.
    These results are extremely significant statistically and compare favorably with validation studies performed for other tasks (e.g., sense disambiguation) in the past.
    They show that positive and negative orientation are objective properties that can be reliably determined by humans.
    To extract conjunctions between adjectives, we used a two-level finite-state grammar, which covers complex modification patterns and noun-adjective apposition.
    Running this parser on the 21 million word corpus, we collected 13,426 conjunctions of adjectives, expanding to a total of 15,431 conjoined adjective pairs.
    After morphological transformations, the remaining 15,048 conjunction tokens involve 9,296 distinct pairs of conjoined adjectives (types).
    Each conjunction token is classified by the
