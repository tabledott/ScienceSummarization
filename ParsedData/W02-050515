    For example, 5% of the names in our development test set were misspelled.
    Human translators seem to be able to recover from name misspellings when transliterating a name they are familiar with.
    Our human subject was able to transliterate the name &amp;quot;,..).4 bwrys&amp;quot; (Boris) correctly, even though it was misspelled as &amp;quot;Lty, brwys.&amp;quot; Therefore, we believe that we need to model misspellings explicitly rather than hope that they will not cause wrong transliterations.
    We model misspellings by using an additional finite-state machine at the end of the cascade of finite state machines.
    We would like to estimate the parameters in this model empirically.
    But since we do not have enough misspellings/correct spelling pairs to train this model, the weights were set manually.
    The use of this spelling correction model slightly improves our transliterations, as shown in Table 3.
    As we have described in Section 5, the P(w) model is a combination of a word unigra
