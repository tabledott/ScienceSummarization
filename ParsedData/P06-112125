).
			In the case of Cm, we can see that many small rules must be applied to explain the transformation, and at eachstep, the decision regarding the re-ordering of con stituents is made with little syntactic context.
			For example, from the perspective of a decoder, theword by is immediately transformed into a prepo sition (IN), but it is in general useful to know which particular function word is present in thesentence to motivate good re-orderings in the up 966 lhs1: NP-C(x0:NPB PP(IN(of) x1:NP-C)) (NP-of-NP) lhs2: PP(IN(of) NP-C(x0:NPB PP(IN(of) NP-C(x1:NPB x2:VP)))) (of-NP-of-NP-VP) lhs3: VP(VBD(said) SBAR-C(IN(that) x0:S-C)) (said-that-S) lhs4: SBAR(WHADVP(WRB(when)) S-C(x0:NP-C VP(VBP(are) x1:VP-C))) (when-NP-are-VP) rhs1i p(rhs1i|lhs1) rhs2i p(rhs2i|lhs2) rhs3i p(rhs3i|lhs3) rhs4i p(rhs4i|lhs4) x1 x0 .54 x2 ? x1 ? x0 .6754 ? , x0 .6062 ( x1 x0 ? .6618 x0 x1 .2351 ( x2 ? x1 ? x0 .035 ? x0 .1073 S x1 x0 ? .0724 x1 ? x0 .0334 x2 ? x1 ? x0 , .0263 h: , x0 .0591 ( x1 x0 ? , .0579 x1 x0 ? .026 x2 ? x1 ? x0
