ring where neighbor blocks can be swapped (&#8217;SWAP&#8217;).
    The &#8217;SWAP&#8217; re-ordering uses the same features as the monotone models plus additional orientation-based and distortionBLEU on the training data ( sentences) and the MT03 test data (670 sentences). based features.
    Different feature sets include word-based features, phrase-based features, and the combination of both.
    For the results with word-based features, the decoder still generates phrase-to-phrase translations, but all the scoring is done on the word level.
    Line shows a BLEU score of for the best performing system which uses all word-based and phrase-based features 7.
    Line and line of Table 3 show the training data averaged BLEU score obtained by searching for the highest BLEU scoring block sequence for each training sentence pair as described in Section 2.
    Allowing local block swapping in this search procedure yields a much improved BLEU score of .
    The experimental results show that word-based models sig
