ortcomings of this method are that it is dependent upon parse quality, and is limited by the rareness of the data.
    Pang et al. (2003) use parse trees over sentences in monolingual parallel corpus to identify paraphrases by grouping similar syntactic constituents.
    They use heuristics such as keyword checking to limit the over-application of this method.
    Our alignment method might be an improvement of their heuristics for choosing which constituents ought to be grouped.
  
  
    In this paper we have introduced a novel method for extracting paraphrases, which we believe greatly increases the usefulness of paraphrasing in NLP applications.
    The advantages of our method are that it: &#8226; Produces a ranked list of high quality paraphrases with associated probabilities, from which the best paraphrase can be chosen according to the target context.
    We have shown how a language model can be used to select the best paraphrase for a particular context from this list.
