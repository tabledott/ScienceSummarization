  If the right sibling Y is the ancestor of the foot node such that it belongs to All,m,n,pJ and its left sibling X belongs to A i.j.j.lJ, then we know that the parent Z of X and Y belongs to A i ,m,n.p, see Fig 3.1b Case 3.
  If neither X nor its right sibling Y are the ancestors of the foot node ( or there is no foot node) then if X E A[i,J,j,ll and Y E A[I.m.m,nJ then their parent Z belongs to A[ioj,j,n[.
  node Z has only one child X, and if X E A[i,j,k,l], then obviously Z E A{i,j,k,ll.
  If 3 node X E AIi.j,k,ll, and the root Y of a derived tree "7 having the same label as that of X, belongs to A[m,i,l.u I, then adjoining "t at X makes the resulting node to be in AIm,Lk,nl, see Fig 3.1c.
