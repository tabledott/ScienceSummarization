e consider only the expressions marked as named entities by the NER tagger, the noun-phrase chunks extracted by the shallow parser, and all sub-expressions of up to 5 tokens of the noun-phrase chunks.
    To retrieve the disambiguation candidates Ti for a given mention mi in Step 2 of the algorithm, we query the anchor-title index.
    Ti is taken to be the set of titles most frequently linked to with anchor text mi in Wikipedia.
    For computational efficiency, we utilize only the top 20 most frequent target pages for the anchor text; the accuracy impact of this optimization is analyzed in Section 6.
    From the anchor-title index, we compute two local features Oi(m, t).
    The first, P(tIm), is the fraction of times the title t is the target page for an anchor text m. This single feature is a very reliable indicator of the correct disambiguation (Fader et al., 2009), and we use it as a baseline in our experiments.
    The second, P(t), gives the fraction of all Wikipedia articles that link to t. local fe
