ing credit for the difference in the value of I between the two models.
    More precisely, we need a function ir(s) over the words s E S such that The predictive value function ir(s) represents the contribution of s to the objective function of the whole translation model.
    I will write simply i(s) when T is clear from the context.
    Comparison of predictive value functions across translation models can only be done under Let i and i' be the predictive value functions for source words in the base translation model and in the trial translation model, respectively.
    Under Assumption 1, the net change in the objective function effected by each candidate NCC xy is If Azy &gt; 0, then xy is a valid NCC for the given application.
    Assumption 1 would likely be false if either x or y was a part of any candidate NCC other than sy.
    Therefore, NCCs that are tested at the same time must satisfy the mutual exclusion condition: No word s E S may participate in more than one candidate NCC at the same time.
