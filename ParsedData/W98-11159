is has the effect of multiplying the inside probability /3(N.4) by rik-J.
    In Section 4 we show how the behavior of our algorithm changes for is between 1.0 and 2.4.
  
  
    Informally, our algorithm differs from the one presented in C&amp;C primarily in that we rank all edges, incomplete as well as complete, with respect to the FOM.
    A straight-forward way to extend C&amp;C in this fashion is to transform the grammar so that all productions are either unary or binary.
    Once this has been done there is no need for incomplete edges at all in bottomup parsing, and parsing can be performed using the CKY algorithm, suitably extended to handle unary productions.
    One way to convert a PCFG into this form is left-factoring (Hoperoft and Ullman, 1979).
    Left-factoring replaces each production A -4 : p, where p is the production probability and 101 = n&gt; 2, with the following set of binary productions: In these productions A is the ith element of /3 and `13i,j' is the subsequence A of 0, but treated
