 small window from the word being tagged.
    Therefore it could be possible that they all end up learning the same information, just in different forms.
    In the field of machine learning, there have been many recent results demonstrating the efficacy of combining classifiers.'
    In this paper we explore whether classifier combination can result in an overall improvement in lexical disambiguation accuracy.
  
  
    The experiments described in this paper are based on four popular tagging algorithms, all of which have readily available implementations.
    These taggers are described below.
    This is by far the simplest of tagging algorithms.
    Every word is simply assigned its most likely part of speech, regardless of the context in which it appears.
    Surprisingly, this simple tagging method achieves fairly high accuracy.
    Accuracies of 90-94% are typical.
    In the unigram tagger used in our experiments, for words that do not appear in the lexicon we use a I See Dietterich(1997) for a good s
