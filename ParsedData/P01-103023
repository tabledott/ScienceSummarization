dy search that can find better solutions.
    (We came up with the greedy operations discussed in Section 5 by carefully analyzing error logs of the kind shown in Table 1).
    The results in Table 1 also enable us to prioritize the items on our research agenda.
    Since the majority of the translation errors can be attributed to the language and translation models we use (see column PME in Table 1), it is clear that significant improvement in translation quality will come from better trigram language model.
    Greedyand greedyare greedy decoders optimized for speed. models.
    The results in Table 2, obtained with decoders that use a trigram language model, show that our greedy decoding algorithm is a viable alternative to the traditional stack decoding algorithm.
    Even when the greedy decoder uses an optimized-forspeed set of operations in which at most one word is translated, moved, or inserted at a time and at most 3-word-long segments are swapped&#8212;which is labeled &#8220;greedy&#8221; in Table
