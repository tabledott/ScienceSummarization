e is that we can find near analogies for the original pairs, such that the near analogies co-occur more frequently in the corpus.
    The danger is that the alternates may have different relations from the originals.
    The filtering steps above aim to reduce this risk.
    In our experiments, the input set contains from 600 to 2,244 word pairs.
    The output similarity measure is based on cosines, so the degree of similarity can range from &#8722;1 (dissimilar; 0 = 180&#176;) to +1 (similar; 0 = 0&#176;).
    Before applying SVD, the vectors are completely non-negative, which implies that the cosine can only range from 0 to +1, but SVD introduces negative values, so it is possible for the cosine to be negative, although we have never observed this in our experiments.
    In the following experiments, we use a local copy of the WMTS (Clarke, Cormack, and Palmer 1998; Terra and Clarke 2003).4 The corpus consists of about 5 x 1010 English words, gathered by a Web crawler, mainly from US academic Web sites.
