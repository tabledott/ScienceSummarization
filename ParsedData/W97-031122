utcome of BiBLE evaluation, which is quite harsh.
    Many translations are not word for word in real bitexts and BiBLE does not even give credit for synonyms.
    The best possible performance on this kind of BiBLE evaluation has been estimated at 62% precision and 60% recall (Melamed, 1995).
    The purpose of BiBLE is internally valid comparison, rather than externally valid benchmarking.
    On a sufficiently large test bitext, BiBLE can expose the slightest differences in translation quality.
    The number of NCCs validated on each iteration was never more than 2.5% of the vocabulary size.
    Thus, the curves in Figures 4 and 5 have a very small range, but the trends are clear.
    A qualitative assessment of the NCC discovery method can be made by looking at Table 4.
    It contains a random sample of 50 of the English NCCs accumulated in the first five iterations of the algorithm in Section 5, using the simpler objective function V. All of the NCCs in the table are noncompositional with respect to th
