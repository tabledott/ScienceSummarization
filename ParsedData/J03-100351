in which a nonplanar graph G can be turned into a planar one G' (see Liebers [2001] for a recent overview of planarization algorithms): Either the graph G can be pruned (using vertex or edge deletion) or it can be extended (for instance, using vertex splitting or by inserting vertices at crossings).
    A disadvantage of the extension approach is that we lose the intuitive one-to-one correspondence between potential target objects and vertices in the scene graph, since the additional vertices only serve the purpose of planarizing the graph and do not represent objects in a scene.
    A disadvantage of the pruning approach is that we lose information.
    The presence of a cost function, however, is potentially very useful, since it allows us to avoid eliminating comparatively cheap (and thus more frequently selected) edges.
    Here, for the sake of illustration, we briefly describe a weighted greedy pruning algorithm that turns an arbitrary scene graph G = (VG, EG) with n vertices and m edges into a planar g
