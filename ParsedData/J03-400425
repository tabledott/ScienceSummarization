m their random baseline for precision, and the difference is more marked when monosemous instances are dropped.
    Table 3 shows the precision results for polysemous words given the slot and the disambiguation source.
    Overall, once at least one word token has been disambiguated by the preferences, the OSPD heuristic seems to perform better than the selectional preferences.
    We can see, however, that although this is certainly true for the nouns, the difference for the adjectives (1.3%) is less marked, and the preferences outperform OSPD for the verbs.
    It seems that verbs obey the OSPD principle much less than nouns.
    Also, verbs are best disambiguated by their direct objects, whereas nouns appear to be better disambiguated as subjects and when modified by adjectives.
  
  
    The precision of our system compares well with that of other unsupervised systems on the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task, despite the fact that these other systems use a number of different sources of information for di
