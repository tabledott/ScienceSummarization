se the chain output for the entity has 2 correct elements in it and the &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; chain for the entity only contains those 2 elements.
    Figure 9 shows the final precision and recall numbers computed by the B-CUBED algorithm for the examples shown in Figures 7 and 8.
    The figure also shows the precision and recall numbers for each entity (ordered by entity-numbers).
    The B-CUBED algorithm does overcome the the two main shortcomings of the MUC scoring algorithm discussed earlier.
    It implicitly overcomes the first number of correct elements in the output chain containing entityi number of elements in the output chain containing entity, number of correct elements in the output chain containing entity, number of elements in the truth chain containing entity, Figure 10: Definitions for Precision and Recall for an Entity i shortcoming of the MUC-6 algorithm by calculating the precision and recall numbers for each entity in the document (irrespective of whether an entity is part of a core
