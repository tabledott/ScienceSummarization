R) of our algorithm over the baseline.
    We use the minimum of the two judges&#8217; scores.
    Here we define fine-grained precision as c1/total.
    We see that our joint algorithm strongly outperforms the baseline, and has high precision for predicting novel hyponyms up to 10,000 links.
    Also in Table 2 we compare the sense disambiguation precision of our algorithm and the baseline.
    Here we measure the precision of sense-disambiguation among all examples where each algorithm found a correct hyponym word; our calculation for disambiguation precision is c1/ (c1 + c2).
    Again our joint algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithm at all levels of recall.
    Interestingly the baseline disambiguation precision improves with higher recall; this may be attributed to the observation that the highestconfidence hypernyms predicted by individual classifiers are likely to be polysemous, whereas hypernyms of lower confidence are more frequently monosemous (and thus trivially easy to disambiguate).
    We
