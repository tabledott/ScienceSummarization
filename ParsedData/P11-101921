 experts to trick the scoring capabilities of an earlier version of e-Rater (Burstein et al., 1998). e-Rater (see Section 6 for more details) assigns a score to a text based on linguistic feature types extracted using relatively domain-specific techniques.
    Participants were given a description of these techniques as well as of the cue words that the system uses.
    The results showed that it was easier to fool the system into assigning higher than lower scores.
    Our goal here is to determine the extent to which knowledge of the feature types deployed poses a threat to the validity of our system, where certain text generation strategies may give rise to large positive discrepancies.
    As mentioned in Section 2, the marking criteria for FCE scripts are primarily based on the accurate use of a range of different grammatical constructions relevant to specific communicative goals, but our system assesses this indirectly.
    We extracted 6 high-scoring FCE scripts from the CLC that do not overlap with ou
