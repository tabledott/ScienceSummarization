d nouns, which almost always fall in the CN-e and CN-p classes.
    In addition, many of the features were first created for the MUC6 data set, so the feature extractors are likely more accurate than for other data sets.
    Overall, results indicate that coreference performance is substantially influenced by the mix of resolution classes found in the data set.
    Our CPP measure can be used to produce a good estimate of the level of performance on a new corpus.
    8Observed scores for MUC6 and 7 differ slightly from Table 3 because this part of the work did not use the OPTIONAL field of the key, employed by the official MUC scorer.
  
  
    The bulk of the relevant related work is described in earlier sections, as appropriate.
    This paper studies complexity issues for NP coreference resolution using a &#8220;good&#8221;, i.e. near state-of-the-art, system.
