  A Maximum Entropy Approach To Identifying Sentence Boundaries
  
    We present a trainable model for identifying sentence boundaries in raw text.
    Given a corpus annotated with sentence boundaries, our model learns to classify each occurrence of., ?, and !as either a valid or invalid sentence boundary.
    The training procedure requires no hand-crafted rules, lexica, part-of-speech tags, or domain-specific information.
    The model can therefore be trained easily on any genre of English, and should be trainable on any other Romanalphabet language.
    Performance is comparable to or better than the performance of similar systems, but we emphasize the simplicity of retraining for new domains.
  
  
    The task of identifying sentence boundaries in text has not received as much attention as it deserves.
    Many freely available natural language processing tools require their input to be divided into sentences, but make no mention of how to accomplish this (e.g.
    (Brill, 1994; Collins, 1996)).
