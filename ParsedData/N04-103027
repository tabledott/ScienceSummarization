 to ours, report results us ing the same set of features on the same data, we candirectly assess the influence of the classifiers.
			G&amp;P system estimates the posterior probabilities using several dif ferent feature sets and interpolate the estimates, whileSurdeanu et al (2003) use a decision tree classifier.
			Ta ble 11 shows a comparison between the three systems for the task of argument classification.
			13.3 Argument Identification (NULL vs NON-NULL).
			Table 12 compares the results of the task of identifying the parse constituents that represent semantic arguments.
			As expected, the performance degrades consider ably when we extract features from an automatic parse as opposed to a hand-corrected parse.
			This indicates that thesyntactic parser performance directly influences the argu ment boundary identification performance.
			This could be attributed to the fact that the two features, viz., Path and Head Word that have been seen to be good discriminators of the semantically salient nodes in t
