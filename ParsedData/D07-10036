			To model the syntactic transformation process, re searchers in these fields?especially in machine translation?have developed powerful grammatical formalisms and statistical models for representing and learning these tree-to-tree relations (Wu and Wong, 1998; Eisner, 2003; Gildea, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al, 2005;Galley et al, 2006; Smith and Eisner, 2006, in ter alia).
			We can also observe a trend in recent work in textual entailment that more emphasis is put onexplicit learning of the syntactic graph mapping between the entailed and entailed-by sentences (Mac Cartney et al, 2006).
			However, relatively fewer attempts have been made in the QA community.
			As pointed out by Katz and Lin (2003), most early experiments in QA that tried to bring in syntactic or semantic features showed little or no improvement, and itwas often the case that performance actually de graded (Litkowski, 1999; Attardi et al, 2001).
			Morerecent attempts have tried to augment the bag-of
