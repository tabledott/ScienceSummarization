les, thereibre, it; has become possible to adapt the extraction system quite ral)idly.
  However, the burden is still on the user to find the appropriate set of examples, which may require a painstaldng and expensive search of a large corpus.
  Reducing this cost is essential for enhanced system portability; this is the problem addressed by the current research.
  Ilow can we automatically discover a suitable set; of candidate patterns or examples (patterns which at least have a high likelihood of being relevant to the scenario)?
  The basic idea is to look for linguistic patterns which apt)ear with relatively high frequency in relevant documents.
  While there has been prior research oll idea|i- lying the primary lexical t)atterns of a sublan- guage or cortms (Orishman et al, 1986; Riloff, 1996), the task here is more complex, since we are tyt)ically not provided in advance with a sub-corpus of relevmlt passages; these passages must themselves be tbund as part of t;t1(; discov- ery i)rocedure.
