een used for syntactic and semantic disambiguation (Hindle 1990; Dagan, Pereira, and Lee 1994) and to develop lexical resources from corpora (Lin 1998; Riloff and Jones 1999).
    We are not aware of other work identifying and using density parameters as described in this article.
    Since our experiments, other related work in NLP has been performed.
    Some of this work addresses related but different classification tasks.
    Three studies classify reviews as positive or negative (Turney 2002; Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan 2002; Dave, Lawrence, Pennock 2003).
    The input is assumed to be a review, so this task does not include finding subjective documents in the first place.
    The first study listed above (Turney 2002) uses a variation of the semantic similarity procedure presented in Wiebe (2000) (Section 3.4).
    The third (Dave, Lawrence, and Pennock 2003) uses ngram features identified with a variation of the procedure presented in Wiebe, Wilson, and Bell (2001) (Section 3.3).
