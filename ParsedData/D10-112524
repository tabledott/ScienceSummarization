are for the sibling model, lower results are G+S.
    Columns give scores for UAS accuracy, percentage of solutions which are integral, and solution speed in seconds per sentence.
    These results are for Section 22 of the PTB.
    The last column is the percentage of integral solutions on a random problem of length 10 words.
    The (I)LP experiments were carried out using Gurobi, a high-performance commercial-grade solver. for i = 0 ... n. However, if for some i, u(k)(i, j) = u(k&#8722;1)(i, j) for all j, then z(k) |&#65533;= z(k&#8722;1) |&#65533; .
    In lazy decoding we immediately set z(k) |&#65533; if u(k)(i, j) = u(k&#8722;1)(i, j) for all j; this check takes O(n) time, and saves us from decoding with the i&#8217;th automaton.
    In practice, the updates to u are very sparse, and this condition occurs very often in practice.
    Figure 3 demonstrates the utility of this method for both sibling automata and G+S automata.
    We also ran experiments varying the value of K&#8212; the maximum number of
