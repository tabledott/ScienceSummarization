  Measures Of Distributional Similarity
  
    distributional similarity measures for the purpose of improving probability estimation for unseen cooccurrences.
    Our contributions are three-fold: an empirical comparison of a broad range of measures; a classification
  
  
    An inherent problem for statistical methods in natural language processing is that of sparse data &#8212; the inaccurate representation in any training corpus of the probability of low frequency events.
    In particular, reasonable events that happen to not occur in the training set may mistakenly be assigned a probability of zero.
    These unseen events generally make up a substantial portion of novel data; for example, Essen and Steinbiss (1992) report that 12% of the test-set bigrams in a 75%-25% split of one million words did not occur in the training partition.
    We consider here the question of how to estimate the conditional cooccurrence probability P(v In) of an unseen word pair (n, v) drawn from some finite set N x V. Two
