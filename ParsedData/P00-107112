 compute the same score for both short and long answers, as we analyze in the same way the answer windows.
  
  
    Several criteria and metrics may be used to measure the performance of a QA system.
    In TREC-8, the performance focus was on accuracy.
    Table 4 summarizes the scores provided by NIST for our system.
    The metric used by NIST for accuracy is described in (Voorhees and Tice 1999).
    Another important performance parameter is the processing time to answer a question.
    On the average, the processing time per question is 61 sec., and the time ranges from 1 sec. to 540 sec.
    There are four main components of the overall time: (1) question processing time, (2) paragraph search time, (3) paragraph ordering time, and (4) answer extraction time.
    Table 5 summarizes the relative time spent on each processing component.
    The answer extraction dominates the processing time while the question processing part is negligible.
