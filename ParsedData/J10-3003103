    Use of SMT Machinery.
    In theory, statistical machine translation is very closely related to paraphrase generation since the former also relies on finding semantic equivalence, albeit in a second language.
    Hence, there have been numerous paraphrasing approaches that have relied on different components of an SMT pipeline (word alignment, phrase extraction, decoding/search) as we saw in the preceding pages of this survey.
    Despite the obvious convenience of using SMT components for the purpose of monolingual translation, we must consider that doing so usually requires additional work to deal with the added noise due to the nature of such components.
    We believe that SMT research will continue to influence research in paraphrasing; both by providing readyto-use building blocks and by necessitating development of methods to effectively use such components for the unintended task of paraphrase generation.
