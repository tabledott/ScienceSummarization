			Table-3 Translation examples 4.6 Oracle Experiment Finally, we run an oracle experiments to see how much improvement could be achieved if we only selected better data for the specific language models.
			We converted the four available reference translations into structured query models and retrieved the top 4000 relevant sentences from AFE corpus for each source sentence.
			Using these language models, interpolated with the background language model gave a NIST score of 8.67, and a Bleu score of 0.2228.
			This result indicates that there is room for further improvements using this language model adaptation technique.
			The oracle experiment suggests that better initial translations lead to better language models and thereby better 2nd iteration translati
