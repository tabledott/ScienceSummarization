Carroll, and Watson (2006) split the 700 sentences in DepBank into a test and development set, but the latter only consists of 140 sentences which we found was not enough to reliably create the transformation.
    There are some development files in the RASP release which provide examples of the GRs, which we used when possible, but these only cover a subset of the CCG lexical categories.
    Our solution to this problem was to convert the gold-standard dependencies from CCGbank into GRs and use these to develop the transformation.
    So we did inspect the annotation in DepBank, and compared it to the transformed CCG dependencies, but only the gold-standard CCG dependencies.
    Thus the parser output was never used during this process.
    We also ensured that the dependency mapping and the post-processing are general to the GRs scheme and not specific to the test set.
    Table 14 gives some examples of the dependency mapping.
    Because the number of sentences annotated with GRs is so small, the only oth
