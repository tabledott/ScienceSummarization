roduce a new formula for graph-based ranking that takes into account edge weights when computing the score associated with a vertex in the graph.
    Notice that a similar formula can be defined to integrate vertex weights.
    Figure 1 plots the convergence curves for the same sample graph from section 2.1, with random weights in the interval 0&#8211;10 added to the edges.
    While the final vertex scores (and therefore rankings) differ significantly as compared to their unweighted alternatives, the number of iterations to convergence and the shape of the convergence curves is almost identical for weighted and unweighted graphs.
    To enable the application of graph-based ranking algorithms to natural language texts, we have to build a graph that represents the text, and interconnects words or other text entities with meaningful relations.
    Depending on the application at hand, text units of various sizes and characteristics can be added as vertices in the graph, e.g. words, collocations, entire sentenc
