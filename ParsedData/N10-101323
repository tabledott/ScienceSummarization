 the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (Rasmussen, 2000).
    Such a model would allow naturally more polysemous words to adopt more flexible representations.
    Cluster similarity metrics: Besides AvgSim and MaxSim, there are many similarity metrics over mixture models, e.g.
    KL-divergence, which may correlate better with human similarity judgements.
    Comparing to traditional senses: Compared to WordNet, our best-performing clusterings are significantly more fine-grained.
    Furthermore, they often do not correspond to agreed upon semantic distinctions (e.g., the &#8220;hurricane&#8221; sense of position in Fig.
    1).
    We posit that the finer-grained senses actually capture useful aspects of word meaning, leading to better correlation with WordSim-353.
    However, it would be good to compare prototypes learned from supervised sense inventories to prototypes produced by automatic clustering.
    Joint model: The current method independently clusters the contexts of each word, so the senses discove
