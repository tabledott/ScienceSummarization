ers (Grice, 1975).
    It is also similar to Schuler&#8217;s (2003) use of model-theoretic interpretations to guide syntactic parsing.
    Errors that do not involve type mismatch are handled by adding new features to the maximumentropy model (Section 3.2).
    We only consider features that are based on the MR translations, and therefore, these features can be seen as an implicit language model of the target MRL (Papineni et al., 1997).
    Of the many features that we have tried, one feature set stands out as being the most effective, the two-level rules in Collins and Koo (2005), which give the number of times a given rule is used to expand a non-terminal in a given parent rule.
    We use only the MRL part of the rules.
    For example, a negative weight for the combination of QUERY &#8594; answer(x1,FORM(x1)) and FORM &#8594; Ax1.equal(x1, ) would discourage any parse that yields Figure 7(c).
    The two-level rules features, along with the features described in Section 3.2, are used in the final version
