 model of mentions in a document corpus.
    Our model captures both withinand cross-document coreference.
    At the top, a hierarchical Dirichlet process (Teh et al., 2006) captures cross-document entity (and parameter) sharing, while, at the bottom, a sequential model of salience captures within-document sequential structure.
    As a joint model of several kinds of discourse variables, it can be used to make predictions about either kind of coreference, though we focus experimentally on within-document measures.
    To the best of our ability to compare, our model achieves the best unsupervised coreference performance.
  
  
    We adopt the terminology of the Automatic Context Extraction (ACE) task (NIST, 2004).
    For this paper, we assume that each document in a corpus consists of a set of mentions, typically noun phrases.
    Each mention is a reference to some entity in the domain of discourse.
    The coreference resolution task is to partition the mentions according to referent.
    Mentions can b
