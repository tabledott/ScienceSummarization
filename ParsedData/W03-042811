he primary argument of this paper is that character substrings are a valuable, and, we believe, underexploited source of model features.
    In an HMM with an admittedly very local sequence model, switching from a word model to a character model gave an error reduction of about 30%.
    In the final, much richer chained maxent setting, the reduction from the best model minus -gram features to the reported best model was about 25% &#8211; smaller, but still substantial.
    This paper also again demonstrates how the ease of incorporating features into a discriminative maxent model allows for productive feature engineering.
