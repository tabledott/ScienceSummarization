en uses the learned extractor to label each word between the two arguments as part of the relation phrase or not.
    The extractor is applied to the successive sentences in the corpus, and the resulting extractions are collected.
    This method faces several challenges.
    First, the training phase requires a large number of labeled training examples (e.g., 200, 000 heuristicallylabeled sentences for TEXTRUNNER and 300, 000 for WOE).
    Heuristic labeling of examples obviates hand labeling but results in noisy labels and distorts the distribution of examples.
    Second, the extraction step is posed as a sequence-labeling problem, where each word is assigned its own label.
    Because each assignment is uncertain, the likelihood that the extracted relation phrase is flawed increases with the length of the sequence.
    Finally, the extractor chooses an extraction&#8217;s arguments heuristically, and cannot backtrack over this choice.
    This is problematic when a word that belongs in the relation phrase
