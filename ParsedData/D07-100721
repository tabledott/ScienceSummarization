sists of 40000 sentence pairs, and each test set contains around 500 sentences.
			We used only the pure text data, and notthe speech transcriptions, so that speech-specific issues would not interfere with our primary goal of understanding the effect of integrating WSD in a full scale phrase-based model.A larger scale evaluation is conducted on the stan dard NIST Chinese-English test set (MT-04), whichcontains 1788 sentences drawn from newswire cor pora, and therefore of a much wider domain than the IWSLT data set.
			The training set consists of about 1 million sentence pairs in the news domain.
			Basic preprocessing was applied to the corpus.The English side was simply tokenized and case normalized.
			The Chinese side was word segmented using the LDC segmenter.

			Since our focus is not on a specific SMT architec ture, we use the off-the-shelf phrase-based decoderPharaoh (Koehn, 2004) trained on the IWSLT train ing set.
