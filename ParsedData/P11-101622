idations on the selected data.
    Following (Go et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2002), we use accuracy as a metric in our experiments.
    The results are listed below.
    As shown in Table 1, the classifier using only the content features achieves an accuracy of 61.1%.
    Adding sentiment lexicon features improves the accuracy to 63.8%.
    Finally, the best performance (68.2%) is achieved by combining targetdependent features and other features (t-test: p &lt; 0.005).
    This clearly shows that target-dependent features do help remove many sentiments not truly about the target.
    We also re-implemented the method proposed in (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) for comparison.
    From Table 1, we can see that all our systems perform better than (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) on our data set.
    One possible reason is that (Barbosa and Feng, 2010) use only abstract features while our systems use more lexical features.
    To further evaluate the contribution of target extension, we compare the system using the exact target
