 that the methods employed have become quite accurate in classifying constituents.5 Results for the restricted were also quite good in comparison with the Gildea and Jurafsky study, which achieved 65% precision and 61% recall at the &#8220;more difficult task of simultaneously segmenting constituents and identifying their semantic role.&#8221; In this task, four teams achieved results between 80 and 90 percent for precision and between 65 and 78 percent for recall.
    The participants in this task used a wide variety of methods and data in their systems.
    In addition, they used the FrameNet dataset from a wide diversity of perspectives.
    In some cases, they developed mechanisms for grouping the FrameNet data by part of speech or making use of the nascent inheritance hierarchy in FrameNet.
    In some cases, they used all frames as a basis for training and in others, they 5The diversity of frame elements in the test data has not yet been investigated, so the assertion that this task is more difficult is
