r weights to frequent words, since such words may introduce more noise.'
    The word class method thus overcomes the circularity problem by mapping word senses to classes of words.
    However, because of this mapping, the method cannot distinguish between senses that belong to the same class, and it also introduces some level of noise.
    7.2.4 A Bilingual Corpus.
    Brown et al. (1991) were concerned with sense disambiguation for machine translation.
    Having a large aligned bilingual corpus available, they noticed that the target word which corresponds to an occurrence of an ambiguous source word can serve as a tag of the appropriate sense.
    This kind of tagging provides sense distinctions when different senses of a source word translate to different target words.
    For the purpose of translation, these are exactly the cases for which sense distinction is required.
    Conceptually, the use of a bilingual corpus does not eliminate (or reduce) manual tagging of the training corpus.
    Such a corp
