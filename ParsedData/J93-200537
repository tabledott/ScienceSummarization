 used as tools to help the knowledge engineer extract useful information from on-line textual sources, and in some applications (e.g., a &amp;quot;related terms&amp;quot; thesaurus for full text information retrieval) may provide a useful way to heuristically organize sublanguage terminology when human resources are unavailable.
  
  
    The purpose of the research described in this section is to experiment with the automatic acquisition of semantic tags for words in a sublanguage, tags well beyond that available from the seeding of MRDs.
    The identification of semantic tags is the result of type coercion on known syntactic forms, to induce a semantic feature, such as [+event] or [+object].
    A pervasive example of type coercion is seen in the complements of aspectual verbs such as begin and finish, and verbs such as enjoy.
    That is, in sentences such as &amp;quot;John began the book,&amp;quot; the normal complement expected is an action or event of some sort, most often expressed by a gerundive or i
