ferent from other objects in the hearers focus of attention; such information has been the subject of this paper.
  Navigational information is not needed if the in- tended referent is already in the focus of attention.
  If it is needed, it frequently (although not always) takes the form of loeational information.
  The IDAS system, for example, can generate referring expres- sions such as tl~e black power supply in the equipment rack.
  In this case, in the equipment rack is navigation information that is intended to bring the equipment rack and its components into the hearers focus of attention, while black power supply is discrimination information that is intended Ix) distinguish the in- tended referent from other members of the context ~t  (e.g., the white power supply that is also present in the equipment rack).
  The navigation model currently implemented in If)AS is simplistic and not theoretically well-justified.
  We hope to do further research on building a better- ju~stified model of navigation.
