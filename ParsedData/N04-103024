			The lower part of the table shows the per formance of some feature combinations by themselves.Table 10 shows the feature salience on the task of ar gument identification.
			One important observation we canmake here is that the path feature is the most salient fea ture in the task of argument identification, whereas it is the least salient in the task of argument classification.
			Wecould not provide the numbers for argument identifica tion performance upon removal of the path feature since that made the SVM training prohibitively slow, indicating that the SVM had a very hard time separating the NULL class from the NON-NULL class.
