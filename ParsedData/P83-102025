), the preposition &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; triggers exactly such a reanalysis.
    Given D-theory, this can be effected simply by adding the additional predication (10) to (7.1-2) above: Given this new predication, the standard referent of the description now has npl directly dominated by vl, i.e. it is now part of the verb.
    And now when &amp;quot;a house&amp;quot; is noticed by the parser, it will be attached as the first NP after the verb vi, i.e. as its object.
    Once again, the predications (7.1-2) are not falsified by the additional predication; they remain indelibly true - npl remains dominated by vp 1, although no longer directly dominated by it.
    But, to repeat the point, the parser is (blissfully) unaware of this notion; the standard referent is a notion meaningful only to semantics.
    The analysis of (6.2) proceeds as follows: After parsing &amp;quot;made&amp;quot; as a verb and &amp;quot;a mess&amp;quot; as its object and noticing the trigger &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; sitting in the buffer,
