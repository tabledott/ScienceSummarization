ional preferences of both the antecedent r1 and the consequent r2.4 Pantel et al. (2007) made use of these intuitions by producing a set of classbased selectional preferences for each relation, then filtering out any inferences where the arguments were incompatible with the intersection of these preferences.
    In contrast, we take a probabilistic approach, evaluating the quality of a specific inference by measuring the probability that the arguments in both the antecedent and the consequent were drawn from the same hidden topic in our model.
    Note that this probability captures both the requirement that the antecedent and consequent have similar selectional preferences, and that the arguments from a particular instance of the rule&#8217;s application match their overlap.
    We use zrz,j to denote the topic that generates the jth argument of relation ri.
    The probability that the two arguments a1, a2 were drawn from the same hidden topic factorizes as follows due to the conditional independences in ou
