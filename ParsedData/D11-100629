curacies comparable to PR.6 Another projection based system is that of Smith and Eisner (2009), who report results for German (68.5%) and Spanish (64.8%) on sentences of length 15 and less inclusive of punctuation.
    Smith and Eisner use custom splits of the data and modify a subset of the dependencies.
    The multi-source projected parser obtains 71.9% for German and 67.8% for Spanish on this setup.7 If we cherry-pick the source language the results can improve, e.g., for Spanish we can obtain 71.7% and 70.8% by directly transferring parsers form Italian or Portuguese respectively.
  
  
    One fundamental point the above experiments illustrate is that even for languages for which no resources exist, simple methods for transferring parsers work remarkably well.
    In particular, if one can transfer part-of-speech tags, then a large part of transferring unlabeled dependencies has been solved.
    This observation should lead to a new baseline in unsupervised and projected grammar induction &#8211; the UA
