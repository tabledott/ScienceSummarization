hand-tagged corpora, and ontology lists (Srihari and Li, 00; Harabagiu et al., 01; Hovy et al., 01; Prager et al., 01).
    However, at the recent TREC-10 QA evaluation (Voorhees, 01), the winning system used just one resource: a fairly extensive list of surface patterns (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 01).
    The apparent power of such patterns surprised many.
    We therefore decided to investigate their potential by acquiring patterns automatically and to measure their accuracy.
    It has been noted in several QA systems that certain types of answer are expressed using characteristic phrases (Lee et al., 01; Wang et al., 01).
    For example, for BIRTHDATEs (with questions like &#8220;When was X born?&#8221;), typical answers are &#8220;Mozart was born in 1756.&#8221; &#8220;Gandhi (1869&#8211;1948)...&#8221; These examples suggest that phrases like &#8220;&lt;NAME&gt; was born in &lt;BIRTHDATE&gt;&#8221; &#8220;&lt;NAME&gt; (&lt;BIRTHDATE&gt;&#8211;&#8221; when formulated as regular expressions, can be used t
