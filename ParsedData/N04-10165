nouns in order to make it possible to recognize simple NPs.
    This insertion was limited to a/an, the, and the empty determiner (for bare plurals).
    All queries (other than the ones using the NEAR operator) were performed as exact matches (using quotation marks in Altavista).
    All search terms were submitted to the search engine in lower case.
    If a query consists of a single, highly frequent word (such as the), Altavista will return an error message.
    In these cases, we set the web count to a large constant (108).
    This problem is limited to unigrams, which were used in some of the models detailed below.
    Sometimes the search engine fails to return a hit for a given n-gram (for any of its morphological variants).
    We smooth zero counts by setting them to .5.
    For all tasks, the web-based models are compared against identical models whose parameters were estimated from the BNC (Burnard, 1995).
    The BNC is a static 100M word corpus of British English, which is about 1000 times smal
