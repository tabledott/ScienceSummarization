    We view the source and target sentences S and T as word sequences s1..sm and t1..tn.
    A word alignment A of S and T can be expressed as a function from each of the source and target tokens to a unique cept (Brown et al. 1993); isomorphically, a cept represents an aligned subset of the source and target tokens.
    Then, for a given sentence pair and word alignment, we define a phrase pair as a subset of the cepts in which both the source and target tokens are contiguous.
    6 We gathered all phrase =
  
  
    pairs (limited to those containing no more than five cepts, for reasons of computational efficiency) occurring in at least one aligned sentence somewhere in our training corpus into a single replacement database.
    This database of lexicalized phrase pairs, termed phrasal replacements, serves as the backbone of our channel model.
    As in (Vogel et al. 2003), we assigned probabilities to these phrasal replacements via IBM Model 1.
    In more detail, we first gathered
