wever, their analysis was based on a set of sentences known to contain either a company acquisition or birthplace relationship, while our results are on a random sample of Web sentences.
    We applied Banko and Etzioni&#8217;s verbal patterns to our random sample of 300 Web sentences, and found that they cover approximately 69% of the relation phrases in the corpus.
    The gap in recall between this and the 85% shown in Table 3 is largely due to LVC relation phrases (made a deal with) and phrases containing multiple verbs (refuses to return to), which their patterns do not cover.
    In sum, our model is by no means complete.
    However, we have empirically shown that the majority of binary verbal relation phrases in a sample of Web sentences are captured by our model.
    By focusing on this subset of language, our model can be used to perform Open IE at significantly higher precision than before.
