ted phrase-table with the standard sourcetarget one.
    This is desired in order to compensate for the noise incurred by the triangulation process.
    We used two combination methods, namely linear interpolation (see (2)) and a weighted geometric mean (see (3)).
    Table 1 reports the results for two translation tasks when triangulating with a single language (es) using three different feature sets, each with different translation features.
    The interpolation model uses uniform linear interpolation to merge the standard and triangulated phrase-tables.
    Non-uniform mixtures did not provide consistent gains, although, as expected, biasing towards the standard phrasetable was more effective than against.
    The indicator model uses the same interpolated distribution along with a series of 0-1 indicator features to identify the source of each event, i.e., if each (s, t) pair is present in phrase-table j.
    We also tried per-context features with similar results.
    The separate model has a separate f
