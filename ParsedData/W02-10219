t for constructing word graphs for statistical machine translation by extending the single best search algorithm.
    Experiments have shown that the graph error rate significantly decreases for rising word graph densities.
    The quality of the hypotheses contained in a word graph is better than of those in an N-best list.
    This indicates that word graph rescoring can yield a significant gain in translation quality.
    For the future, we plan the application of refined translation and language models for rescoring on word graphs.
