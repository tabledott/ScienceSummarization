sed category is heterogeneous.
    The SMT system has an inherent bias against deletion, with the result that unwanted determiners tended not to be deleted, especially in the smaller training sets.
    Other errors related to coverage in the development data set.
    Several occurrences of greengrocer&#8217;s apostrophes (tea&#8217;s, equipment&#8217;s) caused correction failures: these were not anticipated when engineering the training data.
    Likewise, the test data presented several malformed quantifiers and quantifier-like phrases (plenty tea 4 plenty of tea, a lot information 4 a lot of information, few information 4 too little information) that had been unattested in the development set.
    Examples such as these highlight the difficulty in obtaining complete coverage when using handcrafted techniques, whether to engineer errors, as in our case, or to handcraft targeted correction solutions.
    The system performed poorly on words that commonly present both mass and count noun senses in ways that ar
