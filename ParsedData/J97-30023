onal transduction grammars.
    In tandem with the concept of bilingual language-modeling, we propose the concept of bilingual parsing, where the input is a sentence-pair rather than a sentence.
    Though inversion transduction grammars remain inadequate as full-fledged translation models, bilingual parsing with simple inversion transduction grammars turns out to be very useful for parallel corpus analysis when the true grammar is not fully known.
    Parallel bilingual corpora have been shown to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (Brown et al. 1990; Gale and Church 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al.
    1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and Church 1994; Wu and Xia 1994; Fung and McKeown 1994).
    The primary purpose of bilingual parsing with inversion transduction grammars is not to flag ungrammatical inputs; rather, the aim is to extract structure from the input data, which is assumed to be grammatical, in keeping with the spirit of robust pa
