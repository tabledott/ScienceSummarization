    Tables 5 and 6 show the top 20 characteristic verbs for LAB and FINANCE, respectively.
    CorMet finds the selectional preferences of all of the characteristic predicates&#8217; case slots.
    A sample of the selectional preferences of the top 20 verbs in LAB and FINANCE are shown in Tables 7 and 8, respectively.
    The leftmost columns of these two tables have the (stemmed form of the) characteristic verb and the thematic role characterized.
    The right-hand sides have clusters of characteristic nodes.
    The numbers associated with the nodes are the bits of uncertainty about the identity of a word x resolved by the fact that x fills the given case slot, or P(x +&#8212; N) &#8722; P(x +&#8212; N|case slot(x)) (where x +&#8212; N is read as x is N or a hyponym of N).
    All of the 400 possible mappings between the top 20 concepts (clusters) from the two domains are examined.
    Each possible mapping is evaluated in terms of polarity, the number of frames instantiating the mapping, and the syst
