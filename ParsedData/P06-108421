  Searching for best state sequence The searching algorithm gets an observation sequence O and a probabilistic model &#181;, and looks for the best state sequence that generates the observation.
    We define S(t, l) as the probability of the best state sequence that leads to emission olt, and&#65533;(t, l) as the index of the emission at time t&#8722;1 that precedes olt in the best state sequence that leads to it.

    We ran a series of experiments on a Hebrew corpus to compare various approaches to the full morphological disambiguation and PoS tagging tasks.
    The training corpus is obtained from various newspaper sources and is characterized by the following statistics: 6M word occurrences, 178,580 distinct words, 64,541 distinct lemmas.
    Overall, the ambiguity level is 2.4 (average number of analyses per word).
