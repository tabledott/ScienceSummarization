 between these extremes, sets that stand in a subset relation are closer (less distant) than ones that merely intersect.
    This leads to the following distance metric between two sets A and B.
    Alternative distance metrics take the size of the anaphoric chain into account, based on measures used to compare sets in Information Retrieval, such as the coefficient of community of Jaccard (1912) and the coincidence index of Dice (1945) (Manning and Sch&#168;utze 1999).
    In later work, Passonneau (2006) offers a refined distance metric which she called MASI (Measuring Agreement on Set-valued Items), obtained by multiplying Passonneau&#8217;s original metric dP by the metric derived from Jaccard dJ.
    4.4.2 Experience with &#945; for Anaphoric Annotation.
    In the experiment mentioned previously (Poesio and Artstein 2005) we used 18 coders to test &#945; and K under a variety of conditions.
    We found that even though our coders by and large agreed on the interpretation of anaphoric expressions, virtua
