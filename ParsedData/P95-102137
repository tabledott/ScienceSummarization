 at the substitution node of seems.
    We insert the subject component of to adore above the anchor component of seems.
    We then subsert this derived structure into the claims tree by substituting the root of the subject component of to adore at the S node of claims and by inserting the S node of the seems d-tree as well as the object component of the to adore d-tree in the SYS d-edge of the claims d-tree.
    This last operation is shown in Figure 6.
    The resulting phrase structure tree would be the same as in the previously discussed derivation, but the derivation structure is linguistically meaningless, since to adore would have been subserted into both seems and claims.
    However, this derivation is ruled out by the restriction that only substitutable components can be substituted: the subject component of the adore d-tree is not substitutable after subsertion into the seems d-tree, and therefore it cannot be substituted into the claims d-tree.
    In the above discussion, substitutability played
