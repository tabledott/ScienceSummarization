;John should have left,&amp;quot; Magerman's rules make should and have the heads of their respective VPs, so that there is no dependency between left and its subject John (see Figure 2a).
    Since nearly a quarter of nonempty subjects appear in such a configuration, this is not a small problem.
    (We could make VP the head of VP instead, but this would generate auxiliaries independently of each other, so that, for example, P(John leave) &gt; 0.)
    TAG can produce the desired dependencies (b) easily, using the grammar of Figure 1.
    A more complex lexicalization scheme for CFG could as well (one which kept track of two heads at a time, for example), but the TAG account is simpler and cleaner.
    Bilexical dependencies are not the only nonlocal dependencies that can be used to improve parsing accuracy.
    For example, the attachment of an S depends on the presence or absence of the embedded subject (Collins, 1999); Treebank-style two-level NPs are mismodeled by PCFG (Collins, 1999; Johnson, 1998); the
