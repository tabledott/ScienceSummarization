augmented trees, starting with a) human-generated semantic annotations and b) machinegenerated syntactic parse trees.
    For each sentence, combining these two sources involved five steps.
    These steps are given below:
  
  
    syntactic modifier of the other, the inserted node serves to indicate the relation as well as the argument.
    For example, in the phrase &amp;quot;Lt. Cmdr.
    David Edwin Lewis,&amp;quot; a node is inserted to indicate that &amp;quot;Lt. Cmdr.&amp;quot; is a descriptor for &amp;quot;David Edwin Lewis.&amp;quot; 5.
    Whenever a relation involves an entity that is not a direct descendant of that relation in the parse tree, semantic pointer labels are attached to all of the intermediate nodes.
    These labels serve to form a continuous chain between the relation and its argument.
  
  
    In our statistical model, trees are generated according to a process similar to that described in (Collins 1996, 1997).
    The detailed probability structure differs, however, in that it wa
