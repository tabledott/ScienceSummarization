but would not involve putting those decisions into action.
    The monotonicity in monotonic interpretation thus refers to the way in which alternative derivations of sentence meanings may be chosen, but not to the semantic effects of those sentence meanings.
  
  
    A description of the language processing mechanisms to which we have applied the monotonic semantics model is beyond the scope of this paper.
    However, we believe that the QLF representation presented here brings significant advantages to implementing mechanisms for reference resolution, scoping, preference and generation.
    Reference and Scoping: The order independence of resolution operations allows for a variety of control structures in implementing a resolution mechanism.
    We find it convenient to make a bottom up pass through QLFs making reference resolutions, followed by a stage of scoping resolution, and to iterate over this should any of the resolutions introduce further unresolved expressions.
    The salience relation S can be
