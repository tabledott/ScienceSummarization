countmerging in our domain adaptation study.
    Countmerging assigns different weights to different examples to better reflect their relative importance.
    Roark and Bacchiani (2003) showed that weighted count-merging is a special case of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, and successfully used it for probabilistic context-free grammar domain adaptation (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003) and language model adaptation (Bacchiani and Roark, 2003).
    Count-merging can be regarded as scaling of counts obtained from different data sets.
    We let c denote the counts from out-of-domain training data, c&#65533; denote the counts from in-domain adaptation data, and p&#65533; denote the probability estimate by count-merging.
    We can scale the out-of-domain and in-domain counts with different factors, or just use a single weight parameter &#946;: Obtaining an optimum value for &#946; is not the focus of this work.
    Instead, we are interested to see if assigning a higher weight to the in-domain WSJ adaptation e
