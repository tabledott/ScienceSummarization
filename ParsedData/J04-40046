    The third motivation is that a deep understanding of an existing model&#8212;its intricacies, the interplay of its many features&#8212;provides the necessary platform for advancement to newer, &#8220;better&#8221; models.
    This is especially true in an area like statistical parsing that has seen rapid maturation followed by a soft &#8220;plateau&#8221; in performance.
    Rather than simply throwing features into a new model and measuring their effect in a crude way using standard evaluation metrics, this work aims to provide a more thorough understanding of the nature of a model&#8217;s features.
    This understanding not only is useful in its own right but should help point the way toward newer features to model or better modeling techniques, for we are in the best position for advancement when we understand existing strengths and limitations.
    2 In the course of replicating Collins&#8217; results, it was brought to our attention that several other researchers had als
