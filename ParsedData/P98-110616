s d2 and d3, and the lifting rule /1 which introduces an objective NP argument.
    The lifting condition of /I is passed to the V dependent but the dot remains at the left of Vbridge:+ because of the Kleene star.
    When we rewrite the embedded V, we choose to rewrite again with Klause, and the lifting condition is passed on to the next verb.
    This verb is a V+.
    &#8222;rans which requires a Nobj.
    The lifting condition is passed to Nobj and the dot is moved to the right of the regular expression, therefore Nobj is rewritten as the empty string.
  
  
    In this section, we show that pseudo-projective dependency grammars as defined in Section 2.3 are polynomially parsable.
    We can extend the bottom-up parser for GDG to a parser for PP-GDG in the following manner.
    In PP-GDG, syntactic and linear governors do not necessarily coincide, and we must keep track separately of linear precedence and of lifting (i.e., &amp;quot;long distance&amp;quot; syntactic dependence).
