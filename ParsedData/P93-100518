t structure depends not only on the input string, but also the entire history up to that point in the sentence.
    In HBGs, history is interpreted as any element of the output structure, or the parse tree, which has already been determined, including previous words, non-terminal categories, constituent structure, and any other linguistic information which is generated as part of the parse structure.
  
  
    Unlike P-CFG which assigns a probability to a mnemonic production, the HBG model assigns a probability to a rule template.
    Because of this the HBG formulation allows one to handle any grammar formalism that has a derivation process.
    For the HBG model, we have defined about 50 syntactic categories, referred to as Syn, and about 50 semantic categories, referred to as Sem.
    Each NT (and therefore mnemonic) of the grammar has been assigned a syntactic (Syn) and a semantic (Sem) category.
    We also associate with a non-terminal a primary lexical head, denoted by Hi, and a secondary lexical head,
