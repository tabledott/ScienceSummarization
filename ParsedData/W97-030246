ure 14 shows precision and recall curves for single pass versus multiple pass experiments.
    As in the entropy curves, we can determine the performance ratio by looking across horizontally.
    For instance, the multi-pass recognizer achieves a 74% recall level using 2500 seconds, while the best single pass algorithm requires about 4500 seconds to reach that level.
    Due to the noise resulting from precision and recall measurements, it is hard to exactly quantify the advantage from multiple pass parsing, but it is generally about 50%.
  
  
    In this paper, we only considered applying multiplepass and global thresholding techniques to parsing probabilistic context-free grammars.
    However, just about any probabilistic grammar formalism for which inside and outside probabilities can be computed can benefit from these techniques.
    For instance, Probabilistic Link Grammars (Lafferty, Sleator, and Temperley, 1992) could benefit from our algorithms.
    We have however had trouble using global threshold
