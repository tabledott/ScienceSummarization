    Commas are quite common within parenthetical phrases.
    Accordingly, if a comma in an input Overall parsing results using only details found in Collins (1997, 1999).
    The first two lines show the results of Collins&#8217; parser and those of our parser in its &#8220;complete&#8221; emulation mode (i.e., including unpublished details).
    All reported scores are for sentences of length &lt; 40 words.
    LR (labeled recall) and LP (labeled precision) are the primary scoring metrics.
    CBs is the number of crossing brackets.
    0 CBs and &lt; 2 CBs are the percentages of sentences with 0 and &lt; 2 crossing brackets, respectively.
    F (the F-measure) is the evenly weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, or 1 LP&#183;LR sentence occurs after an opening parenthesis and before a closing parenthesis or the end of the sentence, it is not considered a comma for the purposes of the comma constraint.
    Another subtlety is that the comma c
