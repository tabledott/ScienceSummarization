which means that word&#8211;paraphrase pairs will have lower co-occurrence rates than wordtranslation pairs in MT.
    For example, consider occurrences of the word &#8220;boy&#8221; in two translations of &#8220;Madame Bovary&#8221; &#8212; E. Marx-Aveling&#8217;s translation and Etext&#8217;s translation.
    The first text contains 55 occurrences of &#8220;boy&#8221;, which correspond to 38 occurrences of &#8220;boy&#8221; and 17 occurrences of its paraphrases (&#8220;son&#8221;, &#8220;young fellow&#8221; and &#8220;youngster&#8221;).
    This rules out using word translation methods based only on word co-occurrence counts.
    On the other hand, the big advantage of our corpus comes from the fact that parallel translations share many words, which helps the matching process.
    We describe below a method of paraphrase extraction, exploiting these features of our corpus.
  
  
    During the preprocessing stage, we perform sentence alignment.
    Sentences which are translations of the same source sentenc
