he systems by exploiting other information in the absence of the full parse tree information (Punyakanok et al.
  2004), and, hence, can be helpful in conjunction with the features extracted from a full parse tree.
  They also aim to encode the properties of the predicate, the constituent to be classified, and their relationship in the sentence.
  
  
  Note that a 263 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 verb may inhabit many classes and we collect all of these classes as features, regardless of the context-specific sense which we do not attempt to resolve.
  
  
  ?exclusively overlaps,?

  a chunk with its type.
  For instance, in Figure 1, if the constituents are [NP His duties], [PP by John Smith], and [VBN elected], then their chunk features are ?is-NP,?
  ?embed-PP &amp; embed-NP,?
  and ?embedded-in-VP,?
  
  For example, in Figure 1 the chunk sequence from [NP His duties] to the predicate elect is VP-PP-NP-NP-VP.
  
  
  In addition, we label the clause with the type of
