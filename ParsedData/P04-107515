ithm described in Section 2.3.1.
  
  
    In this section, we will study how to combine and strike a proper balance between these criteria, viz. informativeness, representativeness and diversity, to reach the maximum effectiveness on NER active learning.
    We build two strategies to combine the measures proposed above.
    These strategies are based on the varying priorities of the criteria and the varying degrees to satisfy the criteria. most informativeness score from NESet to an intermediate set called INTERSet.
    By this preselecting, we make the selection process faster in the later steps since the size of INTERSet is much smaller than that of NESet.
    Then we cluster the examples in INTERSet and choose the centroid of each cluster into a batch called BatchSet.
    The centroid of a cluster is the most representative example in that cluster since it has the largest density.
    Furthermore, the examples in different clusters may be considered diverse to each other.
    By this means, we consider r
