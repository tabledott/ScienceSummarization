the 2008 NIST Open MT Evaluation (MT08).
  
  
    The current state-of-the-art is confusion-networkbased MT system combination as described by Rosti and colleagues (Rosti et al., 2007a, Rosti et al., 2007b).
    The major steps are illustrated in Figure 1.
    In Fig.
    1 (a), hypotheses from different MT systems are first collected.
    Then in Fig.
    1 (b), one of the hypotheses is selected as the backbone for hypothesis alignment.
    This is usually done by a sentence-level minimum Bayes risk (MBR) method which selects a hypothesis that has the minimum average distance compared to all hypotheses.
    The backbone determines the word order of the combined output.
    Then as illustrated in Fig.
    1 (c), all other hypotheses are aligned to the backbone.
    Note that in Fig.
    1 (c) the symbol &#949; denotes a null word, which is inserted by the alignment normalization algorithm described in section 3.4.
    Fig.
    1 (c) also illustrates the handling of synonym alignment (e.g., aligning &#8220;ca
