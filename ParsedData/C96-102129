thin and outside of quoted text requires, in effect, a method of evaluating quoted speech separately from its surrotmdingcnntext.
			Al hough acomplex problem, we feel that this is possible, given that our input data stream embodies a richer notkm of position and con- text, as a resu\[t of an independent text segmentation procedure adapted from (\[ learst, 1994) (and discussed above in section 2.2.2).
			What is worth noting is the small number of errors which can be directly attributed to the absence of con- figurational inh~rmation.
			Of the 75 misinterpreted pro- nouns, only 2 inw~lved a failure to establish configu- ratkmally determined disjoint reference (both of these inw~lved Condition 3), and only an additional several errors could be tmambiguously traced to a failure to correctly identify the syntactic ontext in which a dis~ course referent appeared (as determined by a misfireof the salience factors ensitive to syntactic context, I lEAD- S and ARC:S).
			Overall, these considerations lead to two con
