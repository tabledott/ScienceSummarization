sed alone, are the most relevant in a combination of features (compare lines 5 and 6 to line 1).
    We conclude that experimentation with combinations of features is required to determine the relevance of individual features to the classification task.
    The general behaviour in classification based on individual features and on size 4 and size 5 subsets of features is confirmed for all subsets.
    Appendix B reports the results for all subsets of feature combinations, in order of decreasing performance.
    Table 10 summarizes this information.
    In the first data column, the table illustrates the average accuracy across all subsets of each size.
    The second through sixth data columns report the average accuracy of all the size n subsets in which each feature occurs.
    For example, the second data cell in the second row (54.9) indicates the average accuracy of all subsets of size 2 that contain the feature VBN.
    The last row of the table indicates the average accuracy for each feature of all su
