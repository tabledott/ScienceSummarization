by finding the combination of senses from a set of contiguous nouns that maximises the Conceptual Density among senses.
  The perlbrmance ofthe procedure was tested on four SemCor texts chosen at random.
  For comparison purposes two other approaches, [Sussna 93] and [Yarowsky 92], were also tried.
  The results show that our algorithm performs better on the test set.
  Following this short introduction the Conceptual Dcnsity formula is presented.
  The main procedure to resolve lexical ambiguity of nouns using Conceptual Density is sketched on section 3.
  Section 4 describes extensively the experiments and its results.
  Finally, sections 5 and 6 deal with further work and conclusions.
  1Semcor comprises approximately 250,000 words.
  Tile tagging was done manually, and the error rate measured by the authors is around 10% for polysemous words.
  2The senses of a word are represented by synonym sets (or synscts), one for each word sense.
  The nominal part of WordNct can be viewed as a tangled hierarchy of
