ibe that task and the preprocessing steps applied.
    In Sections 4.2.3 through 4.2.5, the efficiency of the beam search pruning techniques is shown for German-to-English translation, as the most detailed experiments are conducted for that direction.
    Section 4.2.6 gives translation results for the translation direction English to German.
    In Section 4.3, translation results for the Canadian Hansards task are reported.
    To measure the performance of the translation methods, we use three types of automatic and easy-to-use measures of the translation errors.
    Additionally, a subjective evaluation involving human judges is carried out (Niessen et al. 2000).
    The following evaluation criteria are employed: performed to convert the generated string into the reference target string.
    This performance criterion is widely used in speech recognition.
    The minimum is computed using a DP algorithm and is typically referred to as edit or Levenshtein distance.
