the result would be a model with so little probability concentrated on well-formed English strings as to confound any scheme to discover one.
    The two factors in Equation (2) cooperate.
    The translation model probability is large for English strings, whether well- or ill-formed, that have the necessary words in them in roughly the right places to explain the French.
    The language model probability is large for well-formed English strings regardless of their connection to the French.
    Together, they produce a large probability for well-formed English strings that account well for the French.
    We cannot achieve this simply by reversing our translation models.
  
  
    We say that a pair of strings that are translations of one another form a translation, and we show this by enclosing the strings in parentheses and separating them by a vertical bar.
    Thus, we write the translation (Qu'aurions-nous Pu faire?
    I What could we have done?) to show that What could we have done? is a translation o
