s using the Penn2Malt tool.2 Following Huang and Sagae (2010), we assign POS-tags to the training data using ten-way jackknifing.
    We used our implementation of the Collins (2002) tagger (with 97.3% accuracy on a standard Penn Treebank test) to perform POS-tagging.
    For all experiments, we set the beam size to 64 for the parser, and report unlabeled and labeled attachment scores (UAS, LAS) and unlabeled exact match (UEM) for evaluation.
    Table 3 shows the effect of new features on the development test data for English.
    We start with the baseline features in Table 1, and incrementally add the distance, valency, unigram, third-order and label set feature templates in Table 2.
    Each group of new feature templates improved the accuracies over the previous system, and the final accuracy with all new features was 93.14% in unlabeled attachment score.
    Table 4 shows the final test results of our parser for English.
    We include in the table results from the pure transition-based parser of Zhang
