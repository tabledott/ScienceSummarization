formation values and frequencies of cooccurrence pairs.
    The search is based on the property that when computing sim(wi w2), words that have high mutual information values 'The nominator in our metric resembles the similarity metric in (Hindle, 1990).
    We found, however, that the difference between the two metrics is important, because the denominator serves as a normalization factor. with both w1 and w2 make the largest contributions to the value of the similarity measure.
    Also, high and reliable mutual information values are typically associated with relatively high frequencies of the involved cooccurrence pairs.
    We therefore search first for all the &amp;quot;strong neighbors&amp;quot; of w, which are defined as words whose cooccurrence with w has high mutual information and high frequency, and then search for all their &amp;quot;strong neighbors&amp;quot;.
    The words found this way (&amp;quot;the strong neighbors of the strong neighbors of w&amp;quot;) are considered as candidates for bei
