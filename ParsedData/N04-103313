    About 3 million parallel sentences of this bilingual data have been made available by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).
    Here, we use a subset of the data containing only sentences with a maximum length of 30 words.
    This task covers a large variety of topics, so this is an open-domain corpus.
    This is also reflected by the large vocabulary size.
    Table 3 shows the training and test corpus statistics.
  
  
    In this section, we will investigate the effect of the monotonicity constraint.
    Therefore, we compute how many of the training corpus sentence pairs can be produced with the monotone phrase-based search.
    We compare this to the number of sentence pairs that can be produced with a nonmonotone phrase-based search.
    To make these numbers more realistic, we use leaving-one-out.
    Thus phrases that are extracted from a specific sentence pair are not used to check its monotonicity.
    With leaving-one-out it is possible that even t
