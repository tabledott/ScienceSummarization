			Our approach was as follows: 1.
			We trained the forward MaxEnt and backward.
			SVM models using the out-of-domain labeled training data; 2.
			We then used each of the models to parse the.
			first two of the three sets of domain-specific unlabeled data that were provided (we did not use the larger third set) 3.
			We compared the output for the two models,.
			and selected only identical analyses that were produced by each of the two separate models; 4.
			We added those analyses (about 200k words in.
			the test domain) to the original (out-of domain) labeled training set; the new larger training set; and finally 6.
			We used this model to parse the test data..
			Following this procedure we obtained a labeled attachment score of 81.06, and unlabeled attach ment score of 83.42, both the highest scores for this track.
			This was done without the use of any additional resources (closed track), but these re sults are also higher than the top score for the open track, where the use of certain additiona
