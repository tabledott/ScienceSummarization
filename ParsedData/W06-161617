    The training set was divided into a 10% development set (dev) while the remaining 90% is used as a training and cross-validation set (cross).
    Feature sets, constraints and training parameters were selected through training on cross and optimising against dev.
    Our final accuracy scores and runtime evaluations were acquired using a nine-fold crossvalidation on cross All our experiments were conducted on a Intel Xeon with 3.8 Ghz and 4Gb of RAM.
    We used the open source Mixed Integer Programming library lp solve4 to solve the Integer Linear Programs.
    Our code ran in Java and called the JNIwrapper around t
