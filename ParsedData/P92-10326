 (e.g., sentence) in each sense (e.g., judicial sentence vs. syntactic sentence), by extracting instances from the corpus that were translated one way or the other (e.g, peine or phrase).
    These data sets were then analyzed using well-understood Bayesian discrimination methods, which have been used very successfully in many other applications, especially author identification (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964, section 3.1) and information retrieval (1R) (van Rijsbergen, 1979, chapter 6; Salton, 1989, section 10.3), though their application to word-sense disambiguation is novel.
    In author identification and information retrieval, it is customary to split the discrimination process up into a testing phase and a training phase.
    During the training phase, we are given two (or more) sets of documents and are asked to construct a discriminator which can distinguish between the two (or more) classes of documents.
    These discriminators are then applied to new documents during the testing phase.
