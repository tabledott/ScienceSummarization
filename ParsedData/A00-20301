to information extraction.
    The technique was benchmarked in the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) in 1998.
    Several technical challenges confronted us and were solved: TREEBANK on Wall Street Journal adequately train the algorithm for New York Times newswire, which includes dozens of newspapers?
    Manually creating sourcespecific training data for syntax was not required.
    Instead, our parsing algorithm, trained on the UPenn TREEBANK, was run on the New York Times source to create unsupervised syntactic training which was constrained to be consistent with semantic annotation.
  
  
    We evaluated the new approach to information extraction on two of the tasks of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) and reported in (Marsh, 1998).
    The Template Element (TE) task identifies organizations, persons, locations, and some artifacts (rocket and airplane-related artifacts).
    For each organization in an article, one must identify all of its names as used in the article,
