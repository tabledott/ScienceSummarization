top element is p and whose remaining part is schematically written as '..'.
			\[$\] represents a stack whose only element is the bottom of the stack.
			While it is possible to define SLIGs in general, we define them for the particular case where the rules are binary branching and where tile left hand sides are always incomparable.
			A stochastic linear indexed grammar, G, is denoted by (VN, VT, VI, S, Prod), where VN is a finite set of non- terminal symbols; VT is a finite set of terminal symbols; VI is a finite set of stack symbols; S E VN is the start symbol; Prod is a finite set of productions of the form: Xo\[$po\] --* a Xo\[..po\] --.
