nates (Simard, Foster, and Isabelle 1992) and from statistical alignment models based on word groups rather than single words (Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999).
    The use of models that explicitly deal with the hierarchical structures of natural language is very promising (Wu 1996; Yamada and Knight 2001).
    We plan to develop structured models for the lexicon, alignment, and fertility probabilities using maximum-entropy models.
    This is expected to allow an easy integration of more dependencies, such as in a second-order alignment model, without running into the problem of the number of alignment parameters getting unmanageably large.
    Furthermore, it will be important to verify the applicability of the statistical alignment models examined in this article to less similar language pairs such as ChineseEnglish and Japanese-English.
  
  
    In this Appendix, we describe some methods for efficient training of fertility-based alignment models.
    The core idea is to enumerate only a small subset of good
