at prevents an inference of the type: &#8220;C lives in A; C does not live in B&#8221;).
    We note that a large number of problems can be modeled this way.
    Examples include problems such as chunking sentences (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001), coreference resolution and sequencing problems in computational biology.
    In fact, each of the components of our problem here, the separate task of recognizing named entities in sentences and the task of recognizing semantic relations between phrases, can be modeled this way.
    However, our goal is specifically to consider interacting problems at different levels, resulting in more complex constraints among them, and exhibit the power of our method.
    The most direct way to formalize our inference problem is via the formalism of Markov Random Field (MRF) theory (Li, 2001).
    Rather than doing that, for computational reasons, we first use a fairly standard transformation of MRF to a discrete optimization problem (see (Kleinberg and Tardos, 1999) for details).
