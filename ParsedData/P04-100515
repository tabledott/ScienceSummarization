 cases where the reparandum of one repair is the repair of another).
    (Naturally, in testing we have no such freedom.)
    We analyze each repair as consisting of n aligned word pairs (we describe the interregnum model later).
    Mi is the ith reparandum word and Ri is the corresponding repair word, so both of these range over E &#57740; {&#57738;}.
    We define M0 and R0 to be source sentence word that preceded the repair (which is &#8216;$&#8217; if the repair begins at the beginning of a sentence).
    We define M&#57739; i and R&#57739; i to be the last non-&#57738; reparandum and repair words respectively, i.e., M&#57739; i = Mi if Mi =&#57741; &#57738; and M&#57739; i = M&#57739;i&#8722;1 otherwise.
    Finally, Ti, i = 1... n + 1, which indicates the type of repair that occurs at position i, ranges over {copy, subst, ins, del, nonrep}, where Tn+1 = nonrep (indicating that the repair has ended), and for i = 1... n, Ti = copy if Mi = Ri, Ti = ins if Ri = &#57738;, Ti = del if Mi = &#57738; and Ti =
