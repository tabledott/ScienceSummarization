f how the standard annotation was obtained are given in Vieira (1998).2' The system's performance as a classifier was automatically evaluated against the standard annotation of the corpus as follows.
    Each NP in a text is given an index: When a text is annotated or processed, the coder or system associates each index of a definite description with a type of use; both the standard annotation and the system's output are represented as Prolog assertions.
    To assess the system's performance on the identification of a coreferential antecedent, it is necessary to compare the links that indicate the antecedent of each description classified as anaphora.
    These links are also represented as Prolog assertions, as follows: The system uses these assertions to build an equivalence class of discourse entities, called a coreference chain.
    When comparing an antecedent indicated by the system for a given definite description with that in the annotated corpus, the corresponding coreference chain is checked&#8212;
