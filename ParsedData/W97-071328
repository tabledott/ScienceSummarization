 induce a partial order on the Importance of the textual units For text (1), the most important unit is 4 The textual units that are salient in the nodes found one level below represent the next level of importance (in this case, unit 12&#8212; unit 4 was already accounted for) The next level contains units 5,6, 16, and 18, and so on To evaluate our program, we associated with each textual unit in the RS-trees built by the rhetorical parser a score in the same way we did for the RS-trees built by the analysts For example, the RS-tree in figure 2 has a depth of 6 Because unit 4 is salient for the root, it gets a score of 6 Units 5,6 are salient for an internal node found two levels below the root therefore, their score is 4 Unit 9 is salient for a leaf found five levels below the root therefore, its score is 1 Table 1 presents the scores associated by our summarization program to each unit in text (1) We used the importance scores assigned by our program to compute statistics similar to those discussed in the
