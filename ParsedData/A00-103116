 in turn is expressed by the quotient of probabilities.
    So, the distance of the probabilities of a best tag tbest and an alternative tag tau is expressed by p(tbest)/P(talt)7 which is some value greater or equal to 1 since the best tag assignment has the highest probability.
    Figure 4 shows the accuracy when separating assignments with quotients larger and smaller than the threshold (hence reliable and unreliable assignments).
    As expected, we find that accuracies for percentage known unknown &#8226; overall unknowns acc. acc. acc. a Table 5: Part-of-speech tagging accuracy for the Penn Treebank.
    The table shows the percentage of unknown tokens, separate accuracies and standard deviations for known and unknown tokens, as well as the overall accuracy. percentage known unknown overall unknowns acc. acc. acc. reliable assignments are much higher than for unreliable assignments.
    This distinction is, e.g., useful for annotation projects during the cleaning process, or during pre-processing, so th
