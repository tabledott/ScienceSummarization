 the disambiguation of nouns.
    If a noun to be disambiguated is the head of a noun group, as indicated by its last position in a noun group bracketing, and if the word immediately preceding the opening noun group bracketing is a verb, LEXAS takes such a verb-noun pair to be in a verb-object syntactic relation.
    Again, using similar conditional probability criteria for the selection of keywords, verbs that are predictive of a certain sense of the noun to be disambiguated are selected to form the possible values for this verb-object feature V. Since our training and test sentences come with noun group bracketing, determining verb-object relation using the above heuristic can be readily done.
    In future work, we plan to incorporate more syntactic relations including subject-verb, and adjectiveheadnoun relations.
    We also plan to use verbobject and subject-verb relations to disambiguate verb senses.
    The heart of exemplar-based learning is a measure of the similarity, or distance, between two examp
