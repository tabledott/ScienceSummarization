ls&#8212;z&#8727; may be a good approximation to y&#8727;.
    Later we will see that dual decomposition can effectively use MST inference to rule out ill-formed structures.
    We now give the main assumption underlying sibling models: Assumption 1(Sibling Decompositions) A model f(y) satisfies the sibling-decomposition assumption if: 1) f(y) = Eni=0 fi(y|i) for some set offunctions f0 ... fn.
    2) For any i E {0 ... n}, for any value of the variables u(i, j) E R for j = 1... n, it is possible to compute The second condition includes additional terms involving u(i, j) variables that modify the scores of individual dependencies.
    These terms are benign for most definitions of fi, in that they do not alter decoding complexity.
    They will be of direct use in the dual decomposition parsing algorithm.
    Example 1: Bigram Sibling Models.
    Recall that y|i is a binary vector specifying which words are modifiers to the head-word i.
    Define l1 ... lp to be the sequence of left modifiers to word i under
