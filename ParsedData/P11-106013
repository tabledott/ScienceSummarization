.
    For example, In a DCS tree, the quantifier appears as the child of a Q relation, and the restrictor is the parent (see Figure 4(b) for an example).
    This information is retrieved from the store when the quantifier in column i is executed.
    In particu- using the exact same machinery as superlatives.
    Figlar, the restrictor is A = E (d.bi) and the nu- ure 4(g) shows that we can naturally account for clear scope is B = E (d[i, &#8722;(i, 0)]).
    We then superlative ambiguity based on where the scopeapply d.ci to these two sets (technically, denota- determining execute relation is placed. tions) and project away the first column: Xi(d) = 3 Semantic Parsing ((d.ci ./1,1 A) ./2,1 B) [&#8722;1].
    We now turn to the task of mapping natural language For the example in Figure 4(b), the de- utterances to DCS trees.
    Our first question is: given notation of the DCS tree before execution is an utterance x, what trees z &#8712; Z are permissible?
