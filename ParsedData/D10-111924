extent to which these representations are compatible with the logic-based learning approach we developed is an important area for future work.
    Finally, there is work on using categorial grammars to solve other, related learning problems.
    For example, Buszkowski &amp; Penn (1990) describe a unification-based approach for grammar discovery from bracketed natural language sentences and Villavicencio (2002) developed an approach for modeling child language acquisition.
    Additionally, Bos et al. (2004) consider the challenging problem of constructing broad-coverage semantic representations with CCG, but do not learn the lexicon.
  
  
    Features We use two types of features in our model.
    First, we include a set of lexical features: For each lexical item L E A, we include a feature OL that fires when L is used.
    Second, we include semantic features that are functions of the output logical expression z.
    Each time a predicate p in z takes an argument a with type T (a) in position i it triggers
