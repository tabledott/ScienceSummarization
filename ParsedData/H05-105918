re likely to be ambiguous.
			We applied our bidirectional inference methods to the test data.
			The results are shown in Table 3.
			The table also summarizes the accuracies achieved by several other research efforts.
			The best accuracyis 97.24% achieved by bidirectional dependency net works (Toutanova et al, 2003) with a richer set of features that are carefully designed for the corpus.
			A perceptron algorithm gives 97.11% (Collins, 2002).
			Gimenez and Marquez achieve 97.05% with support vector machines (SVMs).
			This result indicates thatbidirectional inference with maximum entropy mod eling can achieve comparable performance to other state-of-the-art POS tagging methods.
			4.2 Chunking Experiments.
			The task of chunking is to find non-recursive phrases in a sentence.
			For example, a chunker segments the sentence ?He reckons the current account deficit willnarrow to only 1.8 billion in September?
			into the fol lowing, [NP He] [VP reckons] [NP the current accountdeficit] [VP will narrow] [PP
