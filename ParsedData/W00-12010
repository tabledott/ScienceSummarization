  Two Statistical Parsing Models Applied To The Chinese Treebank
  
    This paper presents the first-ever results of applying statistical parsing models to the newly-available Chinese Treebank.
    We have employed two models, one extracted and adapted from BBN's SIFT System (Miller et al., 1998) and a TAGbased parsing model, adapted from (Chiang, 2000).
    On sentences with &lt;40 words, the former model performs at 69% precision, 75% recall, and the latter at 77% precision and 78% recall.
  
  
    Ever since the success of HMMs' application to part-of-speech tagging in (Church, 1988), machine learning approaches to natural language processing have steadily become more widespread.
    This increase has of course been due to their proven efficacy in many tasks, but also to their engineering efficacy.
    Many machine learning approaches let the data speak for itself (data ipsa loguuntur), as it were, allowing the modeler to focus on what features of the data are important, rather than on the complicated i
