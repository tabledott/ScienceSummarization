			A previous paper (Collins and Duffy 2001) showed improvements over a PCFG in parsing the ATIS task.
			In this paper we show that the method scales to far more complex domains.
			In parsing Wall Street Journal text, the method gives a 5.1% relative reduction in error rate over the model of (Collins1999).
			In the second domain, detecting namedentity boundaries in web data, we show a 15.6% rel ative error reduction (an improvement in F-measure from 85.3% to 87.6%) over a state-of-the-art model, a maximum-entropy tagger.
			This result is derived using a new kernel, for tagged sequences, described in this paper.
			Both results rely on a new approach that incorporates the log-probability from a baseline model, in addition to the ?all-fragments?
			features.
	
	
			Trees and Tagged SequencesThis paper focuses on the task of choosing the cor rect parse or tag sequence for a sentence from agroup of ?candidates?
			for that sentence.
