our approach we decided to implement [Yarowsky 92] and [Sussna 93], and test them on our texts.
  For [Yarowsky 92] we had to adapt it to work with WordNet.
  His method relies on cooccurrence data gathered on Rogets Thesaurus semantic ategories.
  Instead, on our experiment we use saliency values 4 based on the lexicographic file tags in SemCor.
  The results for a window size of 50 nouns are those shown in table 35.
  Tile precision attained by our algorithm is higher.
  To compare figures better consider the results in table 4, were the coverage of our algorithm was easily extended using the version presented below, increasing recall to 70.1%.

  Sussna disambiguates everal documents from a public corpus using WordNet.
  The test set was tagged by hand, allowing more than one correct senses for a single w
