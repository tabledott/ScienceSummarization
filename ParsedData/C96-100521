  WordNet provides sinonymy, hypernymy and meronyny relations for nouns, but other relations are missing.
  For instance, WordNet lacks eross-categorial semantic relations, which could he very useful to extend the notion of Conceptual Density of nouns to Conceptual Density of words.
  Apart from extending lhe disambiguation to verbs, adjectives and adverbs, cross-catcgorial relations would allow to capture better lhe relations alnong senses and provide firmer grounds for disambiguating.
  These other relations could be extracted from other knowledge sources, both corpus-based or MRD-based.
  If those relations could be given on WordNet senses, Conceptual Density could profit from them.
  It is ot, r belief, following the ideas of [McRoy 92] that full- fledged lexical ambiguity resolution should combine several information sources.
