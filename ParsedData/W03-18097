ere is no simplex verb to gun.
    This is a very useful way of testing whether the simplex verb contributes to the meaning of the construction.
    We can approach the relationship between VPCs and particles in this same way.
    For (1), while it is not true that Peter was up, it is true that The picture was up.
    We can therefore say that the VPC entails the particle here.
    For (2), it is not true that either Susan or the paper were up, and the VPC therefore does not entail the particle.
    In the case of (3), while it is not true that Philip was down it is true that The intruder was down, and the VPC therefore entails the particle.
    Finally, for (4), it is not true that Barbara and Simon were out, and the VPC therefore does not entail the particle.
    We make the assumption that these relationships between the component words of the VPC and the whole are intuitive to non-experts, and aim to use their &#8220;entailment&#8221; judgements accordingly.
    This use of entailment in exploring the sem
