    Here Time is given as the total amount of time in hours elapsed from submitting the group of HITs to AMT until the last assignment is submitted by the last worker.
  
  
    The reliability of individual workers varies.
    Some are very accurate, while others are more careless and make mistakes; and a small few give very noisy responses.
    Furthermore, for most AMT data collection experiments, a relatively small number of workers do a large portion of the task, since workers may do as much or as little as they please.
    Figure 6 shows accuracy rates for individual workers on one task.
    Both the overall variability, as well as the prospect of identifying high-volume but low-quality workers, suggest that controlling for individual worker quality could yield higher quality overall judgments.
    In general, there are at least thre
