			in the transition matrix M . MarkovLink This variant includes the explicit WordNetrelations such as hypernymy and the edges representing overlap between the TokenPOS nodes con tained in Synsets.
			A particle walking through this graph reaches only Synset nodes and can step from one Synset to another whenever WordNet specifies a relationship between the Synsets or when the Synsets share a common word.
			There is a single connected component in this model variant.
			This model isloosely analogous to a smoothed version of the path based WordNet measures surveyed in (Budanitskyand Hirst, 2006) but differs in that it integrates multiple link types and aggregates relatedness informa tion across all paths in the graph.
			MarkovGloss This variant includes only the weighteduni-directional edges linking Synsets to the Token POS nodes contained in their gloss definitions, andthe edges from a TokenPOS node to the Synsets con taining it.
			The intuition behind this model variant is that the par
