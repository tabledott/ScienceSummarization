22;1i 5. &#955;k(&#8712; A = {&#955;1, ... , &#955;K} &#8712; RK) is a learned weight or parameter associated with feature function fk.
    Note that our formulation of CRFs is different from the widely-used formulations (e.g., (Sha and Pereira, 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003; Peng et al., 2004; Pinto et al., 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004)).
    The previous applications of CRFs assign a conditional probability for a label sequence y = y1, ... , yT given an input sequence x = x1, ... , xT as: In our formulation, CRFs deal with word boundary ambiguity.
    Thus, the the size of output sequence T is not fixed through all candidates y &#8712; Y(x).
    The index i is not tied with the input x as in the original CRFs, but unique to the output y &#8712; Y(x).
    Here, we introduce the global feature vecthe global feature vector, P(y|x) can also be represented as P(y|x) = Zx1 exp(A &#183; F(y, x)).
    The most probable path y&#710; for the input sentence x is then given by To maximize L&#923;, we have to maximize th
