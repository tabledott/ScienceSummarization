he existing GIS weight update (7) can still be derived analytically.
    An advantage of GIS is that it is a very simple algorithm, made even simpler by the removal of the correction feature.
    This simplicity means that, although GIS requires more iterations than 11s to reach convergence, in practice it is significantly faster (Malouf, 2002).
  
  
    Several methods have been proposed for smoothing ME models (see Chen and Rosenfeld (1999)).
    For taggers, a standard technique is to eliminate low frequency features, based on the assumption that they are unreliable or uninformative (Ratnaparkhi, 1998).
    Studies of infrequent features in other domains suggest this assumption may be incorrect (Daelemans et al., 1999).
    We test this for ME taggers by replacing the cutoff with the use of a Gaussian prior, a technique which works well for language models (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999).
    When using a Gaussian prior, the objective function is no longer the likelihood, L(A), but has the form: 2oMaximising t
