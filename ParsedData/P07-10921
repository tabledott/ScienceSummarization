MT systems are capable of producing high quality translations when provided with large quantities of training data.
    With only a small training sample, the translation output is often inferior to the output from using larger corpora because the translation algorithm must rely on more sparse estimates of phrase frequencies and must also &#8216;back-off&#8217; to smaller sized phrases.
    This often leads to poor choices of target phrases and reduces the coherence of the output.
    Unfortunately, parallel corpora are not readily available in large quantities, except for a small subset of the world&#8217;s languages (see Resnik and Smith (2003) for discussion), therefore limiting the potential use of current SMT systems.
    In this paper we provide a means for obtaining more reliable translation frequency estimates from small datasets.
    We make use of multi-parallel corpora (sentence aligned parallel texts over three or more languages).
    Such corpora are often created by international organisations,
