induced from Wikipedia are competitive with the ones from WordNet.
    The performance gap on all three datasets is quite small, which indicates the usefulness of using an encyclopedic knowledge base as a replacement for a lexical taxonomy.
    As a consequence of having different knowledge sources accounting for the resolution of different RE types, the best results are obtained by (1) combining features generated from different sources; (2) performing feature selection.
    When combining different feature sources, we register an accuracy improvement on pronouns and common nouns, as well as an increase in F-measure due to a higher recall.
    Feature selection always improves results.
    This is due to the fact that our full feature set is extremely redundant: in order to explore the usefulness of the knowledge sources we included overlapping features (i.e. using best and average similarity/relatedness measures at the same time), as well as features capturing the same phenomenon from different point of vie
