atistical significance hard to establish.
    This conjecture is supported by considering the smoothed model omitting the re-estimation null-word weight, which has substantially the same AER as the full smoothed model, but with a precision/recall balance much closer to the standard model.
    The 2-tailed paired t test comparing this model to the standard model showed significance at a level of better than 10&#8722;10.
    We also compared the combined model with and without the initial null-word weight, and found that the improvement without the weight was significant at the 0.008 level.
  
  
    We have demonstrated that it is possible to improve the performance of Model 1 in terms of alignment error by about 30%, simply by changing the way its parameters are estimated.
    Almost half this improvement is obtained with a simple heuristic model that does not require EM re-estimation.
    It is interesting to contrast our heuristic model with the heuristic models used by Och and Ney (2003) as baselines in th
