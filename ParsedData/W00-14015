nraveler therefore uses the XTAG grammar of English (XTAG-Group, 1999) to produce a lattice of all possible linearizations that are compatible with the supertagged tree.
    Specifically, the daughter nodes are ordered with respect to the head at each level of the derivation tree.
    In cases where the XTAG grammar allows a daughter node to be attached at more than one place in the mother supertag (as is the case in our example for was and for; generally, such underspecification occurs with adjuncts and with arguments if their syntactic role is not specified), a disjunction of all these positions is assigned to the daughter node.
    A bottom-up algorithm then constructs a lattice that encodes the strings represented by each level of the derivation tree.
    The lattice at the root of the derivation tree is the result of the Unraveler.
    Finally. the LP Chooser chooses the most likely traversal of this lattice. given a linear language 'The sentence generated by this tree is a predicative noun construction.
