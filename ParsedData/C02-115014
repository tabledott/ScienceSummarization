			3.2 Feature Space.
			Each question is analyzed and represented as a listof features to be treated as a training or test exam ple for learning.
			We use several types of features and investigate below their contribution to the QC accuracy.
			The primitive feature types extracted for eachquestion include words, pos tags, chunks (non overlapping phrases) (Abney, 1991), named entities,head chunks (e.g., the first noun chunk in a sen tence) and semantically related words (words that often occur with a specific question class).
			Over these primitive features (which we call ?sensors?)
			we use a set
