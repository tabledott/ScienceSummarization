form that obtained from a set of ordered rules.
    However it is an advantage of parallel machines that they can be used with very little loss of efficiency without combining them in this way.
    While it is not the purpose of this paper to explore the formal properties of finite-state transducers, a brief excursion may be in order at this point to forestall a possible objection to the claim that a parallel configuration of transducers can be combined into a single one.
    On the face of it, this cannot generally be so because there is generally no finite-state transducer that will accept the intersection of the sets of tape pairs accepted by an arbitrary set of transducers.
    It is, for example, easy to design a transducer that will map a string of x's onto the same number of y's followed by an arbitrary number of z's.
    It is equally easy to design one that maps a string of x's onto the same number of z's preceded by an arbitrary number of x's.
    The intersection of these two sets contains just tho
