res to refer to underspecified segments.
    A good example of this is the vowel-harmony rule referred to earlier, namely Vi -4 B, / BjC* In feature notation, this could be written -consonantal meaning that a segment that is specified as a vowel comes also to be specified as back when the most recent preceding vowel is back; all other features remain unchanged.
    The grammar will presumably contain another rule that will apply in circumstances when this one does not, namely -consonantal except, of course, that the context can be omitted from whichever of the two is placed second in an ordered list of rules.
    But this is precisely the question: What is the proper order of this pair of rules?
    Consider an actual case, namely, vowel harmony in Turkish.
    Let A represent an abstract vowel with e and a as its front and back realizations, and I another abstract vowel with i and dotless z as its front and back counterparts.
    The first of these occurs, for example, in the abstract plural suffix lAr, and
