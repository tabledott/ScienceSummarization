markers analogous to a preposition.
    We began this paper by alluding to several approaches to PP attachment, specifically work assuming the construction of discourse models, approaches based on structural attachment preferences, and work indicating a dominant role for lexical preference.
    Our results tend to confirm the importance of lexical preference.
    However, we can draw no firm conclusions about the other approaches.
    Since our method yielded incorrect results on roughly 20% of the cases, its coverage is far from complete.
    This leaves a lot of work to be done, within both psycholinguistic and computational approaches.
    Furthermore, as we noted above, contemporary psycholinguistic work is concerned with modeling the time course of parsing.
    Our experiment gives no information about how lexical preference information is exploited at this level of detail, or the importance of such information compared with other factors such as structural preferences at a given temporal stage of the hu
