 connections between a single vocabulary item in one language and two or more in the other, or even between several items in one language and several in the other.
    The other would involve connections&#8212;one&#8211;one, one&#8211;many, or many&#8211;many&#8212;between phrases or recurring sequences.
    We have investigated the first of these enough to satisfy ourselves that there is latent information on one-to-many associations in the text, and that it can be revealed by suitable extensions of our methods.
    However, it is clear that the combinatorial problems associated with this approach are severe, and pursuing it would require much fine tuning of the program and designing much more effective ways of indexing the most important data structures.
    The key to reducing the combinatorial explosion probably lies in using tables of similarities such as those the present algorithm uses to suggest combinations of items that would be worth considering.
    If such an approach could be made efficient enou
