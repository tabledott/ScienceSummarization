nces of accidental personal biases.
    However, Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945; is indispensable when the category labels are not equally distinct from one another.
    We think there are at least two types of coding schemes in which this is the case: (i) hierarchical tagsets and (ii) set-valued interpretations such as those proposed for anaphora.
    At least in the second case, weighted coefficients are almost unavoidable.
    We therefore recommend using &#945;, noting however that the specific choice of weights will affect the overall numerical result.
    We view the lack of consensus on how to interpret the values of agreement coefficients as a serious problem with current practice in reliability testing, and as one of the main reasons for the reluctance of many in CL to embark on reliability studies.
    Unlike significance values which report a probability (that an observed effect is due to chance), agreement coefficients report a magnitude, and it is less clear how to interpret such magnitudes.
