    Considering the size of the corpora that must be handled by Champollion, special care has been taken to minimize the number of disk accesses made during processing.
    We have experimented on up to two full years of the Hansards corpus, amounting to some 640,000 sentences in each language or about 220 megabytes of uncompressed text.
    With corpora of this magnitude, Champollion takes between one and two minutes to translate a collocation, thus enabling its practical use as a bilingual lexicography tool.
    To achieve efficient processing of the corpus database, Champollion is implemented in two phases: the preparation phase and the actual translation phase.
    The preparation phase reads in the database corpus and indexes it for fast future access using a commercial B-tree package (Informix 1990).
    Each word in the original corpus is associated with a set of pointers to all the sentences containing it and to the positions of the word in ea
