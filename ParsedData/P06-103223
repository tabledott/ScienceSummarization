    Since the architecture is not dependent on hard-to-maintain rules or regular expressions, little or no linguistic expertise will be required in developing and maintain applications.
    As with SMT, this expertise is pushed into the data component, to be handled by instructors and editors, who do not need programming or scripting skills.
    We expect it to be possible, moreover, once parallel data becomes available, to quickly ramp up new systems to accommodate the needs of learners with different first-language backgrounds and different skill levels and to writing assistance for learners of L2s other than English.
    It is also likely that this architecture may have applications in pedagogical environments and as a tool to assist editors and instructors who deal regularly with ESL texts, much in the manner of either Human Assisted Machine Translation or Machine Assisted Human Translation.
    We also believe that this same architecture could be extended naturally to provide grammar and style tools
