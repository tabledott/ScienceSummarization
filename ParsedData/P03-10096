l: it employs a robust statistical parser (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002) which yields complete though shallow parses, and a comprehensive SCF classifier, which incorporates 163 SCF distinctions, a superset of those found in the ANLT (Boguraev et al., 1987) and COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994) dictionaries.
    The SCFs abstract over specific lexicallygoverned particles and prepositions and specific predicate selectional preferences but include some derived semi-predictable bounded dependency constructions, such as particle and dative movement.
    78 of these &#8216;coarse-grained&#8217; SCFs appeared in our data.
    In addition, a set of 160 fine grained frames were employed.
    These were obtained by parameterizing two high frequency SCFs for prepositions: the simple PP and NP + PP frames.
    The scope was restricted to these two frames to prevent sparse data problems in clustering.
    A SCF lexicon was acquired using this system from the British National Corpus (Leech, 1992, BNC) so that the maximum of 7000
