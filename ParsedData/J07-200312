 in Figure 2a.
    The initial phrases that would be extracted are shown in Figure 2b.
    More formally: Definition 1 Given a word-aligned sentence pair ( f, e, &#8212;), let fji stand for the substring of f from position i to position j inclusive, and similarly for eji.
    Then a rule ( fj, ele ) is an initial phrase pair of ( f, e, &#8212;) iff: Second, in order to obtain rules from the phrases, we look for phrases that contain other phrases and replace the subphrases with nonterminal symbols.
    For example, given the initial phrases shown in Figure 2b, we could form the rule where k is an index not used in &#947; and &#945;, is a rule of (f, e, &#8212;).
    This scheme generates a very large number of rules, which is undesirable not only because it makes training and decoding very slow, but also because it creates spurious ambiguity&#8212;a situation where the decoder produces many derivations that are distinct yet have the same model feature vectors and give the same translation.
    This can result
