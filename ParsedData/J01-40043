we do not place any restriction on the possible candidate markables; that is, all markables, whether they are &amp;quot;organization,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;person,&amp;quot; or other entity types, are considered.
    The ability to link coreferring noun phrases both within and across sentences is critical to discourse analysis and language understanding in general.
    System architecture of natural language processing pipeline.
  
  
    We adopt a corpus-based, machine learning approach to noun phrase coreference resolution.
    This approach requires a relatively small corpus of training documents that have been annotated with coreference chains of noun phrases.
    All possible markables in a training document are determined by a pipeline of language-processing modules, and training examples in the form of feature vectors are generated for appropriate pairs of markables.
    These training examples are then given to a learning algorithm to build a classifier.
