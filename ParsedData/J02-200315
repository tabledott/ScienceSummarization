robabilities and deal with the problem of ambiguous data.
    The relative-frequency estimates are as follows: where f (c, v, r) is the number of (n, v, r) triples in the data in which n is being used to denote c, and V is the set of verbs in the data.
    The problem is that the estimates are defined in terms of frequencies of senses, whereas the data are assumed to be in the form of (n, v, r) triples: a noun, verb, and argument position.
    All the data used in this work have been obtained from the British National Corpus (BNC), using the system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997), which consists of a shallow-parsing component that is able to identify verbal arguments.
    We take a simple approach to the problem of estimating the frequencies of senses, by distributing the count for each noun in the data evenly among all senses of the noun: where f&#710; (c, v, r) is an estimate of the number of times that concept c appears in position r of verb v, and |cn(n) |is the cardinality of cn(n).
    This is the approac
