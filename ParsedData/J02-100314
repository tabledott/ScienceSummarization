 been chosen instead of PHILIPS, leading to a description like the brown desk bought by Sony.
    The algorithm does not just fail: it fails in a situation where Success was perfectly achievable!
    How can this limitation be remedied?
    One might introduce a limited kind of backtracking, which &#8220;remembers&#8221; where the algorithm has encountered overlapping Values and, when it results in Failure, goes back to the last-encountered situation where it has made a choice between overlapping Values; if this does not lead to Success, the algorithm backtracks to the previous choice situation, and so on until no more choice situations are left (Failure) or a distinguishing description has been reached (Success).
    Unfortunately, this algorithm becomes intractable if Values overlap too often: in the worst case, we are back to having to check all combinations of properties.
    A simpler and computationally more efficient algorithm would include all overlapping Values that are true of the target while also
