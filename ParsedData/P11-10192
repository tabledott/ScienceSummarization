cilitating self-assessment and self-tutoring.
    Implicitly or explicitly, previous work has mostly treated automated assessment as a supervised text classification task, where training texts are labelled with a grade and unlabelled test texts are fitted to the same grade point scale via a regression step applied to the classifier output (see Section 6 for more details).
    Different techniques have been used, including cosine similarity of vectors representing text in various ways (Attali and Burstein, 2006), often combined with dimensionality reduction techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 2003), generative machine learning models (Rudner and Liang, 2002), domain-specific feature extraction (Attali and Burstein, 2006), and/or modified syntactic parsers (Lonsdale and Strong-Krause, 2003).
    A recent review identifies twelve different automated free-text scoring systems (Williamson, 2009).
    Examples include e-Rater (Attali and Burstein, 2006), Intelligent Essay Assessor (I
