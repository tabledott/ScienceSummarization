 sequence1 as the basic translation unit and utilizes tree sequence alignments to model the translation process.
    Therefore, it not only describes non-syntactic phrases with syntactic structure information, but also supports multi-level tree structure reordering in larger span.
    These give our model much more expressive power and flexibility than those previous models.
    Experiment results on the NIST MT-2005 ChineseEnglish translation task show that our method significantly outperforms Moses (Koehn et al., 2007), a state-of-the-art phrase-based SMT system, and other linguistically syntax-based methods, such as SCFG-based and STSG-based methods (Zhang et al., 2007).
    In addition, our study further demonstrates that 1) structure reordering rules in our model are very useful for performance improvement while discontinuous phrase rules have less contribution and 2) tree sequence rules are able to model non-syntactic phrases with syntactic structure information, and thus contribute much to the performa
