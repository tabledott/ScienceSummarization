 we can see that PGIZA++ has larger difference in the generated alignment.
    That is partially because of the pruning on count tables.
    To also compare the alignment score in the different systems.
    For each sentence pair i = 1, 2, &#183; &#183; &#183; , N, assume two systems b and c have Viterbi alignment scores Sb, Sz .
    We define the residual R as: The residuals of the three systems are listed in Table 11.
    The residual result shows that the MGIZA++ has a very small (less than 0.2%) difference in alignment scores, while PGIZA++ has a larger residual.
    The results of experiments show the efficiency and also the fidelity of the alignment generated by the two versions of parallel GIZA++.
    However, there are still small differences in the final alignment result, especially for PGIZA++.
    Therefore, one should consider which version to choose when building systems.
    Generally speaking, MGIZA++ provides smoother integration into other packages: easy to set up and also more precise.
