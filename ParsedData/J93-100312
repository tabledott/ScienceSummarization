 were constant, then the estimates using normal distributions could be corrected and would still be useful, but the fact that the errors are not constant means that methods dependent on the normal approximation should not be used to analyze Bernoulli trials where the probability of positive outcome is very small.
    Yet, in many real analyses of text, comparing cases where np --= 0.001 with cases where np &gt; 1 is a common problem.
  
  
    There is another class of tests that do not depend so critically on assumptions of normality.
    Instead they use the asymptotic distribution of the generalized likelihood ratio.
    For text analysis and similar problems, the use of likelihood ratios leads to very much improved statistical results.
    The practical effect of this improvement is that statistical textual analysis can be done effectively with very much smaller volumes of text than is necessary for conventional tests based on assumed normal distributions, and it allows comparisons to be made between the
