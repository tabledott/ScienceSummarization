only coreference links between base noun phrases, the clustering algorithm obtains a recall of 72.4% on the dryrun, and 75.9% on the formal evaluation.
    Another source of error is inaccurate and inadequate NP feature vectors.
    Our procedure for computing semantic class values, for example, is responsible for many errors - it sometimes returns incorrect values and the coarse semantic class distinctions are often inadequate.
    Without a better named entity finder, computing feature vectors for proper nouns is difficult.
    Other errors result from a lack of thematic and grammatical role information.
    The lack of discourse-related topic and focus information also limits system performance.
    In addition, we currently make no special attempt to handle reflexive pronouns and pleonastic &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;.
    Lastly, errors arise from the greedy nature of the clustering algorithm.
    Noun phrase NP., is linked to every preceding noun phrase N13, that is compatible and within the radius r, and th
