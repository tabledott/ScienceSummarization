art&#8221;, &#8220;Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus&#8221;, &#8220;Amadeus Mozart&#8221; or &#8220;Mozart&#8221;.
    To learn from such variations, in step 1 of Algorithm 1 we specify the various ways in which the question term could be specified in the text.
    The presence of any of these names would cause it to be tagged as the original question term &#8220;Mozart&#8221;.
    The same arrangement is also done for the answer term so that presence of any variant of the answer term would cause it to be treated exactly like the original answer term.
    While easy to do for BIRTHDATE, this step can be problematic for question types such as DEFINITION, which may contain various acceptable answers.
    In general the input example terms have to be carefully selected so that the questions they represent do not have a long list of possible answers, as this would affect the confidence of the precision scores for each pattern.
    All the answers need to be enlisted to ensure a high confidence in the precision score of ea
