    The utility of the system reported here would be considerably improved by a more tractable approach to probabilistically unpacking the packed parse forest than exhaustive search.
    Finding the n-best analyses would allow us to recover analyses for longer sentences where a parse forest is constructed and would make the approach generally more efficient.
    Carroll and Briscoe (1992) present a heuristic algorithm for parse forest unpacking that interleaves normalization of competing sub-analyses with best-first extraction of the n most probable analyses.
    Normalization of competing sub-analyses with respect to the longest derivation both allows us to prune the search probabilistically and to treat the probability of analyses as the product of the probability of their sub-analyses, without biasing the system in favor of shorter derivations.
    This modified version of the system presented here is able to return analyses for sentences over 31 words in length, yields slightly better
