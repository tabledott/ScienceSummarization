    This induces a decomposition of the feature vector f(x, y) as: Under this decomposition, each arc receives a score; parsing amounts to choosing the configuration that maximizes the overall score, which, as shown by McDonald et al. (2005), is an instance of the maximal arborescence problem.
    Combinatorial algorithms (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967) can solve this problem in cubic time.4 If the dependency parse trees are restricted to be projective, cubic-time algorithms are available via dynamic programming (Eisner, 1996).
    While in the projective case, the arc-factored assumption
