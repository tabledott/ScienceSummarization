ample of 0-criterion in action when parsing: The subject NP, &amp;quot;it&amp;quot;, has attribute -theta, which is percolated to the IP node.
    The verb &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; has attributes +theta +subj-theta.
    The NP, &amp;quot;Mary&amp;quot;, has attribute +theta.
    When the items representing &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Mary&amp;quot; are combined.
    Their theta attribute are unifiable, thus satisfying the 0-criterion.
    The +subj-theta attribute of &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; percolates with the item representing &amp;quot;love Mary&amp;quot;, which is propagated to IP node.
    When the item from NP and Ibar are combined at IP node, the new item has both -theta and +subj-theta attribute, resulting in a 0-criterion violation.
    The above constraints guarantee that chains with only one element satisfy 0-criterion.
    We now consider chains with more than one element.
    The base-position of a wh-movement is case-marked and assigned a 0-role.
