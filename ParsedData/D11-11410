  Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study
  
    People tweet more than 100 Million times daily, yielding a noisy, informal, but sometimes informative corpus of 140-character messages that mirrors the zeitgeist in an unprecedented manner.
    The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets.
    This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to recognition.
    Our novel doubles compared with the NER system. the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision.
    LabeledLDA outperforms coincreasing 25% over ten common entity types.

    Status Messages posted on Social Media websites such as Facebook and Twitter present a new and challenging style of text for language technology due to their noisy and informal nature.
