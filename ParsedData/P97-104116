    In this experiment we demonstrate that our algorithm can also improve the output of such a system.
    The Chinese segmenter CHSEG developed at the Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University is a complete system for highaccuracy Chinese segmentation (Jin, 1994).
    In addition to an initial segmentation module that finds words in a text based on a list of Chinese words, CHSEG additionally contains specific modules for recognizing idiomatic expressions, derived words, Chinese person names, and foreign proper names.
    The accuracy of CHSEG on an 8.6MB corpus has been independently reported as F=84.0 (Ponte and Croft, 1996).
    (For reference, Ponte and Croft report scores of F=86.1 and 83.6 for their probabilistic Chinese segmentation algorithms trained on over 100MB of data.)
    On our test set, CHSEG produced a segmentation score of F=87.9.
    Our rule-based algorithm learned a sequence of 1755 transformations from the training set; applied to the test set, they improved th
