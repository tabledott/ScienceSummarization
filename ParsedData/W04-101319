rrelation coefficients, Spearman&#8217;s rank order correlation coefficients, and Kendall&#8217;s correlation coefficients between systems&#8217; average ROUGE scores and their human assigned average coverage scores using single reference and multiple references.
    To investigate the effect of stemming and inclusion or exclusion of stopwords, we also ran experiments over original automatic and manual summaries (CASE set), stemmed4 version of the summaries (STEM set), and stopped version of the summaries (STOP set).
    For example, we computed ROUGE scores for the 12 systems participated in the DUC 2001 single document summarization evaluation using the CASE set with single reference and then calculated the three correlation scores for these 12 systems&#8217; ROUGE scores vs. human assigned average coverage scores.
    After that we repeated the process using multiple references and then using STEM and STOP sets.
    Therefore, 2 (multi or single) x 3 (CASE, STEM, or STOP) x 3 (Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall
