tizing (Or, Agreement on Markable Identification).
    It is often assumed in CL annotation practice that the units of analysis are &#8220;natural&#8221; linguistic objects, and therefore there is no need to check agreement on their identification.
    As a result, agreement is usually measured on the labeling of units rather than on the process of identifying them (unitizing, Krippendorff 1995).
    We have just seen, however, two coding tasks for which the reliability of unit identification is a crucial part of the overall reliability, and the problem of markable identification is more pervasive than is generally acknowledged.
    For example, when the units to be labeled are syntactic constituents, it is common practice to use a parser or chunker to identify the markables and then to allow the coders to correct the parser&#8217;s output.
    In such cases one would want to know how reliable the coders&#8217; corrections are.
    We thus need a general method of testing relibility on markable identification
