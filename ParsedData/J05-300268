 a similarity function can be induced in an unsupervised fashion.
    In addition, we can improve the flexibility of the fusion algorithm by using a more powerful language model.
    Recent research (Daume et al. 2002) has show that syntax-based language models are more suitable for language generation tasks; the study of such models is a promising direction to explore.
    An important feature of the sentence fusion algorithm is its ability to generate multiple verbalizations of a given fusion lattice.
    In our implementation, this property is utilized only to produce grammatical texts in the changed syntactic context, but it can also be used to increase coherence of the text at the discourse level by taking context into account.
    In our current system, each sentence is generated in isolation, independently from what is said before and what will be said after.
    Clear evidence of the limitation of this approach is found in the selection of referring expressions.
    For example, all summary sentences
