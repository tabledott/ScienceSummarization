allel only those pairs for which the classifier probability is above a certain threshold.
    In the experiments from Section 4.1, we use the (default) threshold of 0.5, while in Section 4.2 we use 0.7.
  
  
    Our main goal is to extract, from an in-domain comparable corpus, parallel training data that improves the performance of an out-of-domain-trained SMT system.
    Thus, we evaluate our extracted corpora by showing that adding them to the out-of-domain training data of a baseline MT system improves its performance.
    We first evaluate the extracted corpora presented in Section 4.1.
    The extraction system used to obtain each of those corpora made use of a certain initial out-of-domain parallel corpus.
    We train a Baseline MT system on that initial corpus.
    We then train another MT system (which we call PlusExtracted) on the initial corpus plus the extracted corpus.
    In order to compare the quality of our extracted data with that of human-translated data from the same domain, we also train
