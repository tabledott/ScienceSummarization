 coreference problems.
    This paper presents a new corpus-based approach to noun phrase coreference.
    We believe that it is the first such unsupervised technique developed for the general noun phrase coreference task.
    In short, we view the task of noun phrase coreference resolution as a clustering task.
    First, each noun phrase in a document is represented as a vector of attribute-value pairs.
    Given the feature vector for each noun phrase, the clustering algorithm coordinates the application of context-independent and context-dependent coreference constraints and preferences to partition the noun phrases into equivalence classes, one class for each real-world entity mentioned in the text.
    Context-independent coreference constraints and preferences are those that apply to two noun phrases in isolation.
    Context-dependent coreference decisions, on the other hand, consider the relationship of each noun phrase to surrounding noun phrases.
