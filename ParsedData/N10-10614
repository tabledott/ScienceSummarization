    Entities: An entity is a specific individual or object in the world.
    Entities are always latent in text.
    Where a mention has a single word for each property, an entity has a list of signature words.
    Formally, entities are mappings from properties r E R to lists Lr of &#8220;canonical&#8221; words which that entity uses for that property.
    For instance in Figure 1(b), the list of nominal heads for the Barack Obama entity includes &#8220;president.&#8221; Types: Coreference systems often make a mention / entity distinction.
    We extend this hierarchy to include types, which represent classes of entities (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and so on).
    Types allow the sharing of properties across entities and mediate the generation of entities in our model (Section 3.1).
    See Figure 1(c) for a concrete example.
    We represent each type T as a mapping between properties r and pairs of multinomials (Br, fr).
    Together, these distributions control the lists Lr for entities of that type.
