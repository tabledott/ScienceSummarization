 refined than the one left at the end of the preceding pass.
    The input to the whole process consists only of the WSIs of the two texts.
    Before the first pass of the relaxation process, an initial AST is computed simply from the lengths of the two texts: Construct Initial AST.
    If the texts contain m and n sentences respectively, then the table can be thought of as an m x n array of ones and zeros.
    The average number of sentences in the second text corresponding to a given one in the first text is n/rn, and the average position of the sentence in the second text corresponding to the i-th sentence in the first text is therefore i - n/m.
    In other words, the expectation is that the true correspondences will lie close to the diagonal.
    Empirically, sentences typically correspond one for one; correspondences of one sentence to two are much rarer, and correspondences of one to three or more, though they doubtless occur, are very rare and were unattested in our data.
    The maximum deviation ca
