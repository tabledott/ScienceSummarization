ta to train on; (2) the class distribution is further skewed which results in a higher majority class baseline (3) closure produces additional data in such a way as to increase the frequencies and statistical power of existing features in the unclosed data, as opposed to adding new features.
    For example, with unclosed data, given A BEFORE B and B BEFORE C, closure generates A BEFORE C which provides more significance for the features related to A and C appearing as first and second arguments, respectively, in a BEFORE relation.
    In order to help determine the effects of the above factors, we carried out two experiments in which we sampled 6145 vectors from the closed data &#8211; i.e. approximately the number of EventEvent vectors in the unclosed data.
    This effectively removed the contribution of factor (1) above.
    The first experiment (Closed Class Distribution) simply sampled 6145 instances uniformly from the closed instances, while the second experiment (Unclosed Class Distribution) sampled i
