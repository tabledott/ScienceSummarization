d-use application, even when time and resources exist to provide some document labels.
    Several modifications of LDA to incorporate supervision have been proposed in the literature.
    Two such models, Supervised LDA (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) and DiscLDA (Lacoste-Julien et al., 2008) are inappropriate for multiply labeled corpora because they limit a document to being associated with only a single label.
    Supervised LDA posits that a label is generated from each document&#8217;s empirical topic mixture distribution.
    DiscLDA associates a single categorical label variable with each document and associates a topic mixture with each label.
    A third model, MM-LDA (Ramage et al., 2009), is not constrained to one label per document because it models each document as a bag of words with a bag of labels, with topics for each observation drawn from a shared topic distribution.
    But, like the other models, MM-LDA&#8217;s learned topics do not correspond directly with the label set.
    Consequently, th
