at maximizes the linear sum of the confidence scores (e.g., the conditional probabilities estimated by the argument classifier), subject to the constraints that encode the domain knowledge.
    Formally speaking, the argument classifier attempts to assign labels to a set of arguments, S1:M, indexed from 1 to M. Each argument Si can take any label from a set of argument labels, P, and the indexed set of arguments can take a set of labels, c1:M E PM.
    If we assume that the argument classifier returns an estimated conditional probability distribution, Prob(Si = ci), then, given a sentence, the inference procedure seeks an global assignment that maximizes the following objective function, subject to linguistic and structural constraints.
    In other words, this objective function reflects the expected number of correct argument predictions, subject to the constraints.
    The constraints are encoded as the followings.
  
  
    The inference process allows a natural way to combine the outputs from multiple ar
