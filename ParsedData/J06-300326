se, the decision may not be clear, since industrial plants often produce food and living organisms often serve as food.
    It would be very helpful to know the relation between food and plant in this example.
    In the phrase &#8220;food for the plant,&#8221; the relation between food and plant strongly suggests that the plant is a living organism, since industrial plants do not need food.
    In the text &#8220;food at the plant,&#8221; the relation strongly suggests that the plant is an industrial plant, since living organisms are not usually considered as locations.
    Thus, an algorithm for classifying semantic relations (as in Section 7) should be helpful for word sense disambiguation.
    The problem of relation extraction is, given an input document and a specific relation R, to extract all pairs of entities (if any) that have the relation R in the document.
    The problem was introduced as part of the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) in 1998.
