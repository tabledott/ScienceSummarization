    Once the system has selected the most useful examples from the pool, it is forced to choose among the remainder that it previously rejected as less useful.
    At the extreme where all available examples are used, our experimental framework prevents active learning from exhibiting any benefit whatsoever since the system is left no choice in selecting examples.
    Before considering the impact of word clustering on system performance, we first evaluate the discriminative tagger relative to the baseline HMM.
    For this experiment, we used all of the features described in Section 3 except word cluster features.
    The remaining features encode essentially the same information used in the HMM, although in a slightly different form.
    Results are shown in Figure 1.
    For very small and very large training sets, the systems perform about the same.
    Between these extremes, the discriminative tagger exhibits somewhat, though not distressingly, worse performance.
    We conjecture that lack of smoo
