 preceding mention that is classified as coreferent with mk.
    If mk is not classified as coreferent with any preceding mention, it will be considered discourse-new (i.e., no antecedent will be selected for mk).
    Unlike a mention-pair model, an entity-mention model is a classifier that decides whether or not an active mention mk is coreferent with a partial cluster cj that precedes mk.
    Each training instance, i(cj, mk), represents cj and mk.
    The features for an instance can be divided into two types: (1) features that describe mk (i.e, those shown in the second block of Table 1), and (2) cluster-level features, which describe the relationship between cj and mk.
    Motivated by previous work (Luo et al., 2004; Culotta et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2008), we create cluster-level features from mention-pair features using four predicates: NONE, MOST-FALSE, MOST-TRUE, and ALL.
    Specifically, for each feature X shown in the last two blocks in Table 1, we first convert X into an equivalent set of binar
