ts are obtained by performing sentence alignment (Gale and Church 1991) on the corpora to obtain sets of parallel sentences that are then lemmatized, part-of-speech tagged and chunked in order to identify all the verb and noun phrases.
    The bootstrapping algorithm is then employed to incrementally learn better and better contextual features that are then leveraged to generate semantically similar phrasal correspondences.
    Figure 4 shows the basic steps of the algorithm.
    To seed the algorithm, some fake paraphrase examples are extracted by using identical words from either side of the aligned sentence pair.
    For example, given the following sentence pair: S1: Emma burst into tears and he tried to comfort her.
    S2: Emma cried and he tried to console her.
    A bootstrapping algorithm to extract phrasal paraphrase pairs from monolingual parallel corpora.
    (tried, tried), (her, her) may be extracted as positive examples and (tried, Emma), (tried, console) may be extracted as negative examples.
