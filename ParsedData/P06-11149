s process, candidate answers extracted from the AP module were then re-associated with their AGQs and resubmitted to the TE system (as in Method 1).
    Question-answer pairs deemed to be positive instances of entailment were then stored in a database and used as additional training data for the AutoQUAB module.
    When no AGQs were found to be entailed by the original question, however, passages were ranked according to their entailment confidence and sent to AP for further processing and validation.
  
  
    Processing textual entailment, or recognizing whether the information expressed in a text can be inferred from the information expressed in another text, can be performed in four ways.
    We can try to (1) derive linguistic information from the pair of texts, and cast the inference recognition as a classification problem; or (2) evaluate the probability that an entailment can exist between the two texts; (3) represent the knowledge from the pair of texts in some representation language that can be as
