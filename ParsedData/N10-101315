rizontal bars show the performance of single-prototype.
    Squares indicate performance when combining across clusterings.
    Error bars depict 95% confidence intervals using the Spearman test.
    Squares indicate performance when combining across clusterings. than combined multi-prototype for tf-idf features, and does not differ significantly for x2 features.
    Overall this result indicates that multi-prototype performs at least as well as exemplar in the worst case, and significantly outperforms when using the best feature representation / corpus pair.
    We next evaluated the multi-prototype approach on its ability to determine the most closely related words for a given target word (using the Wikipedia corpus with tf-idf features).
    The top k most similar words were computed for each prototype of each target word.
    Using a forced-choice setup, human subjects were asked to evaluate the quality of these near synonyms relative to those produced by a sincarrier, crane, cell, company, issue, interes
