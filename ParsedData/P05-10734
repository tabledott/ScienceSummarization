ed with semantic roles.
    We distinguish between models that learn to label nodes in the parse tree independently, called local models, and models that incorporate dependencies among the labels of multiple nodes, called joint models.
    We build both local and joint models for semantic role labeling, and evaluate the gains achievable by incorporating joint information.
    We start by introducing our local models, and later build on them to define joint models.
  
  
    In the context of role labeling, we call a classifier local if it assigns a probability (or score) to the label of an individual parse tree node ni independently of the labels of other nodes.
    We use the standard separation of the task of semantic role labeling into identification and classifi'For a full listing of PropBank argument labels see (Palmer et al., 2003) cation phases.
    In identification, our task is to classify nodes of t as either ARG, an argument (including modifiers), or NONE, a non-argument.
    In classification, we
