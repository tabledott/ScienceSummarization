ith low est Euclidean distance to v4 with assigned labels Li, i = 1 . . .
			k. We calculate the mean distance d(ti, v) for this set of vectors and drop from the set up to five outliers for which the distance was more then twice the mean distance.
			The label assigned 4We used k = 10 for all experiments.
			to v is the label of the majority of the remaining vectors.
			If a similar number of remaining vectors have different labels, we assigned to the test vector the most frequent of these labels according to their frequency in the dataset.
			If there are no matching vectors found for v, we assigned the default ?no sentiment?
			label since there is significantly more non-sentiment sentences than sentiment sentences in Twitter.
	
	
			In our experiments we used an extensive Twit ter data collection as training and testing sets.
			In our training sets we utilize sentiment hashtags andsmileys as classification labels.
			Below we de scribe this dataset in detail.
