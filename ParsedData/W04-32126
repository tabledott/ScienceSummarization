    There are also constituents that are not semantic arguments (by semantic arguments we mean both numbered arguments and ARCMs) to a given verb and we will label such constituents NULL.
    Semantic role tagging is thus an one of N classification task.
  
  
    Although it is conceivable that one can simply treat this as a multi-category classification problem, there are at least two reasons why such a simple approach will not work effectively.
    One is that for a given verb, the majority of the constituents in a syntactic tree are not its semantic arguments.
    When negative samples (constituents marked NULL) overwhelm positive samples, the current machine-learning algorithms will not be effective.
    The second reason, which is more subtle, is that information that is effective in separating arguments from NULL elements may not be as effective in distinguishing different types of arguments and vice versa, as we will show in our experiments.
