 The weight assigned to a configuration is the product of the weights assigned to selected features of the configuration.
    We use the notation: where ,(3, is the weight for feature i and J(.) is its frequency function, that is, f, (x) is the number of times that feature i occurs in configuration x.
    (For most purposes, a feature can be identified with its frequency function; I will not always make a careful distinction between them.)
    I use the term feature here as it is used in the machine learning and statistical pattern recognition literature, not as in the constraint grammar literature, where feature is synonymous with attribute.
    In my usage, dag edges are labeled with attributes, not features.
    Features are rather like geographic features of dags: a feature is some larger or smaller piece of structure that occurs&#8212;possibly at more than one place&#8212;in a dag.
    The probability of a configuration (that is, a dag) is proportional to its weight, and is obtained by normalizing the we
