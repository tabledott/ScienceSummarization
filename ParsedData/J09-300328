 the following sections, the goal is to classify the contextual polarity of the expressions that contain instances of the subjectivity clues in our lexicon.
    However, determining which clue instances are part of the same expression and identifying expression boundaries are not the focus of this work.
    Thus, instead of trying to identify and label each expression, in the following experiments, each clue instance is labeled individually as to its contextual polarity.
    We define the gold-standard contextual polarity of a clue instance in terms of the manual annotations (Section 3) as follows.
    If a clue instance is not in a subjective expression (and therefore not in a sentiment expression), its gold class is neutral.
    If a clue instance appears in just one subjective expression or in multiple subjective expressions with the same contextual polarity, its gold class is the contextual polarity of the subjective expression(s).
    If a clue instance appears in a mixture of negative and neutral subjec
