served treebank grammars.
    Our method effectively avoids all of these problems by rebuilding and refitting the pruning grammars on the fly from the final grammar.
    Fortunately, there is a well worked-out notion of estimating a grammar from an infinite distribution over trees (Corazza and Satta, 2006).
    In particular, we can estimate parameters for a projected grammar 7r(G) from the tree distribution induced by G (which can itself be estimated in any manner).
    The earliest work that we are aware of on estimating models from models in this way is that of Nederhof (2005), who considers the case of learning language models from other language models.
    Corazza and Satta (2006) extend these methods to the case of PCFGs and tree distributions.
    The generalization of maximum likelihood estimation is to find the estimates for 7r(G) with minimum KL divergence from the tree distribution induced by G. Since 7r(G) is a grammar over coarser symbols, we fit 7r(G) to the distribution G induces over 7r-proje
