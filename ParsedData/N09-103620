et al. (2007b) describe the basic adaptor grammar inference procedure that we use here.
    That paper leaves unspecified a number of implementation details, which we show can make a crucial difference to segmentation accuracy.
    The adaptor grammar algorithm is basically a Gibbs sampler of the kind widely used for nonparametric Bayesian inference (Blei et al., 2004; Goldwater et al., 2006b; Goldwater et al., 2006a), so it seems reasonable to expect that at least some of the details discussed below will be relevant to other applications as well.
    The inference algorithm maintains a vector t = (ti, ... , tr,,) of sample parses, where tz E TS is a parse for the ith sentence wz.
    It repeatedly chooses a sentence wz at random and resamples the parse tree tz for wz from P(tz  |t&#8722;z, wz), i.e., conditioned on wz and the parses t&#8722;z of all sentences except wz.
    Sampling algorithms like ours produce a stream of samples from the posterior distribution over parses of the training data.
