 In total, 42 teams showed interest in the shared task and registered for participation, and 24 teams submitted final results.
    All 24 teams participated in the obligatory Task 1, six in each of Tasks 2 and 3, and two teams completed all the three tasks.
    Table 4 shows a profile of the 22 final teams, excepting two who wished to remain anonymous.
    A brief examination on the team organization (the Org column) shows a computer science background (C) to be most frequent among participants, with less frequent participation from bioinformaticians (BI), biologists (B) and liguists (L).
    This may be attributed in part to the fact that the event extraction task required complex computational modeling.
    The role of computer scientists may be emphasized in part due to the fact that the task was novel to most participants, requiring particular efforts in framework design and implementation and computational resources.
    This also suggests there is room for improvement from more input from biologists.
