 disambiguation candidates for m. This adds 4 more &#8220;reweighted local&#8221; features in Global approaches require a disambiguation context V and a relatedness measure 0 in Eq.
    3.
    In this section, we describe our method for generating a disambiguation context, and the set of global features 0i(t, t&#8242;) forming our relatedness measure.
    In previous work, Cucerzan defined the disambiguation context as the union of disambiguation candidates for all the named entity mentions in the input document (2007).
    The disadvantage of this approach is that irrelevant titles are inevitably added to the disambiguation context, creating noise.
    Milne and Witten, on the other hand, use a set of unambiguous mentions (2008b).
    This approach utilizes only a fraction of the available mentions for context, and relies on the presence of unambiguous mentions with high disambiguation utility.
    In GLOW, we utilize a simple and efficient alternative approach: we first train a local disambiguation system,
