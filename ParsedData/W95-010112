ng stops when no positive scoring transformations can be found.
    To test the effectiveness of the above unsupervised learning algorithm, we ran a number of experiments using two different corpora and part of speech tag sets: the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal Corpus [Marcus et al., 19931 and the original Brown Corpus [Francis and Kucera, 1982].
    First, a dictionary was created listing all possible tags for each word in the corpus.
    This means that the test set contains no unknown words.
    We have set up the experiments in this way to facilitate comparisons with results given in other papers, where the same was done.
    &#176;An example of a context is: the previous tag is a determiner.
    In this experiment, a training set of 120,000 words and a separate test set of 200,000 words were used.
    We measure the accuracy of the tagger by comparing text tagged by the trained tagger to the gold standard manually annotated corpus.
    In the case where the tag of a word is not fully disambiguated by
