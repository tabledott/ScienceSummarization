    (In subsequent tables, confusion sets will be referred to by their most frequent word.)
    The &amp;quot;Baseline&amp;quot; column gives the prediction accuracy of the baseline system on the test corpus.
    Following previous work [Gale et al., 1994], we formulate the method in a Bayesian framework.
    The task is to pick the word wi that is most probable, given the context words ci observed within a &#177;k-word window of the target word.
    The probability for each wi is calculated using Bayes' rule: As it stands, the
