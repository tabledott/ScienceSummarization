 of the nine labeled set sizes.
    The results are presented in table 2.
    Each entry in the table represents the average accuracy across 20 trials for an author, a labeled set size, and an algorithm.
    The best result in each row is highlighted in bold.
    Any results on the same row that cannot be distinguished from the best result using a paired t-test at the 0.05 level are also bold.
    The results indicate that the graph-based semisupervised learning algorithm based on PSP similarity (SSL+PSP) achieved better performance than all other methods in all four author corpora when only 200, 100, 50, 25, or 12 labeled documents were available.
    In 19 out of these 20 learning scenarios, the unlabeled set accuracy by the SSL+PSP algorithm was significantly higher than all other methods.
    While accuracy generally degraded as we trained on less labeled data, the decrease for the SSL approach was less severe through the mid-range labeled set sizes.
    SSL+PSP remains among the best methods with only 6
