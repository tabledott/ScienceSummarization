 this approach is left as a question for further research, but the number is certainly very low.
    About 3900 of the 9409 theoretically possible tag pairs occur in the Brown Corpus.
    Also, all tags marking closed classes (about two-thirds of all tags) may be eliminated from consideration.
    Also, since VOLSUNGA operates from left to right, it can always decide upon an optimum partial result, and can predict a set of probable successors.
    For these reasons, it is largely robust against ungrammaticality.
    Shannon (1951) performed experiments of a similar sort, asking human subjects to predict the next character of a partially presented sentence.
    The accuracy of their predictions increased with the length of the sentence fragment presented.
    The fact that VOLSUNGA requires a great deal of persistent memory for its dictionary, yet very little temporary space for processing, is appropriate.
    By contrast, the space requirements of CLAWS would overtax the short-term memory of any language user
