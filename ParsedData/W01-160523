 apparent over time.
    Because the RST theory does not differentiate between different levels of the tree structure, a fairly fine-grained set of relations operates between EDUs and EDU clusters at the macrolevel.
    The procedural knowledge available at the EDU level is likely to need further refinement for higher-level text spans along the lines of other work which posits a few macro-level relations for text segments, such as Ferrari (1998) or Meyer (1985).
    Moreover, using the RST approach, the resultant tree structure, like a traditional outline, imposed constraints that other discourse representations (e.g., graph) would not.
    In combination with the tree structure, the concept of nuclearity also guided an annotator to capture one of a number of possible stylistic interpretations.
    We ourselves are eager to explore these aspects of the RST, and expect new insights to appear through analysis of the corpus.
    We anticipate that the RST Corpus will be multifunctional and support a wide range o
