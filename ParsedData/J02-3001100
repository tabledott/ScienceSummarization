cular target word (Table 5, last line).
    Domain information does not seem to help a great deal, given no information about the frame.
    Furthermore, the cross-frame experiments here are dependent on the mapping of frame-level roles to abstract thematic roles.
    This mapping was done at the frame level; that is, FrameNet roles with the same label in two different frames may be translated into two different thematic roles, but all target words in the same frame make use of the same mapping.
    The mapping of roles within a frame is generally one to one, and therefore the choice of mapping has little effect when using statistics conditioned on the target word and on the frame, as in the previous section.
    When we are attempting to generalize between frames, the mapping determines which roles from the training frame are used to calculate probabilities for the roles in the test frames, and the choice of mapping is much more significant.
    The mapping used is necessarily somewhat arbitrary.
    It is i
