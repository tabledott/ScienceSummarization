oughly quadratic in the length of the input to create a packed parse forest represented as a graphstructured stack.
    The statistical disambiguation phase is trained on Susanne treebank bracketings, producing a probabilistic generalized LALR(1) parser (e.g.
    Inui et al., 1997) which associates probabilities with alternative actions in the LR table.
    The parser is passed as input the sequence of most probable lemma-affix-tags found by the tagger.
    During parsing, probabilities are assigned to subanalyses based on the the LR table actions that derived them.
    The n-best (i.e. most probable) parses are extracted by a dynamic programming procedure over subanalyses (represented by nodes in the parse forest).
    The search is efficient since probabilities are associated with single nodes in the parse forest and no weight function over ancestor or sibling nodes is needed.
    Probabilities capture structural context, since nodes in the parse forest partially encode a configuration of the graph-structur
