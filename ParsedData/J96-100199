and where the languages themselves do not involve neat sentence-by-sentence translations).
    Bilingual word correspondences extracted from nonparallel corpora with techniques such as those proposed by Fung (1995a) also look promising.
  
  
    We have presented a method for translating collocations, implemented in Champollion.
    The ability to provide translations for collocations is important for three main reasons.
    First, because they are opaque constructions, they cannot be translated on a word-byword basis.
    Instead, translations must be provided for the phrase as a whole.
    Second, collocations are domain dependent.
    Each domain includes a variety of phrases that have specific meanings and translations that apply only in the given domain.
    Finally, a quick look at a bilingual dictionary, even for two widely studied languages such as English and French, shows that correspondences between collocations in two languages are largely unexplored.
    Thus, the ability to compile a set of tra
