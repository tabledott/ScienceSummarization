level constituent boundaries and labels are present, but there are no dependencies between constituents, as shown by the following sample sentence: (3) [NP Big investment banks] [V P refused to step] [ADVP up] [PP to] [NP the plate] [V P to support] [NP the beleaguered floor traders] [PP by] [V P buying] [NP big blocks] [PP of] [NP stock] , [NP traders] [V P say] .
    Our chunks were derived from the Treebank trees using the conversion described by Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz (2000).
    Thus, the experiments were carried out using &amp;quot;goldstandard&amp;quot; rather than automatically derived chunk boundaries, which we believe will provide an upper bound on the performance of a chunkbased system.
    The information provided by the parse tree can be decomposed into three pieces: the constituent boundaries, the grammatical relationship between predicate and argument, expressed by our path feature, and the head word of each candidate constituent.
    We will examine the contribution of each of these infor
