currence, we archive high performance for test data.
    When we use other learning methods such as Decision Tree, we have to select feature set manually to avoid over-fitting.
    Usually, these feature selection depends on heuristics, so that it is difficult to apply them to other classification problems in other domains.
    Memory based learning method can also handle all available features.
    However, the function to compute the distance between the test pattern and the nearest cases in memory is usually optimized in an ad-hoc way Through our experiments, we have shown the high generalization performance and high feature selection abilities of SVMs.
