 coordination), extend to lexicalized dependency relations (specific verbs) and lexico-syntactic shallow templates.
    The latter include patterns adopted in the literature to extract specific pieces of semantic knowledge.
    For instance, NOUN such as NOUN and such NOUN as NOUN were first proposed by Hearst (1992) as highly reliable patterns for hypernym identification, whereas (the) attribute noun of (a|the) NOUN is ADJ and (a|the) ADJ attribute noun of NOUN were successfully used to identify typical values of concept attributes (Almuhareb and Poesio 2004; Veale and Hao 2008).
    Therefore, the LexDM distributional memory is a repository of partially heterogeneous types of corpus-derived information, differing in their level of abstractness, which ranges from fairly abstract syntactic relations to shallow lexicalized patterns.
    LLexDM contains 3,352,148 links, including inverses.
    The scoring function 6 is the same as that in DepDM, and the number of nonzero tuples is about 355M, including direct a
