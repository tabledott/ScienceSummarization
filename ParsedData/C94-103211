g of tim inlmt sentence, and proceeds char- attar by character.
  At each point in tim sentence, it looks up the combination of the best partial parses ending at the point and word hypotheses tarting at that point.
  If tim connection of a partial parse and a word llypothesis is allowed by the tagging model, a new continuation parse is made and registered in the parse - l i s t .
  The partial path score for the new con- titular,on parse is the product of the best partial path score up to the poi,g, the trigram probability of the last three parts of speech tags and the word output probability for LIfe part of speech 4.
  3 .2  The  Backward  A* Search The backward search uses a table called path-map, whose key is the end position of tile parse  structure, and whose value is a list of parse  structures that have the best partial path scores for each distinct combin~ ties of the start position and the combined state.
  The dilference 1)etween parse - l i s t  and path-map is that path-map is classi/ied by tim s
