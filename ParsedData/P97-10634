#8222;,v) and inversely proportional to their marginal frequencies n(u) and n(v) 1, following (Dunning, 1993)2.
    When the L(u, v) are re-estimated, the model's hidden parameters come into play.
    After initialization, the model induction algorithm iterates: The competitive linking algorithm and its one-to-one assumption are detailed in Section 3.1.
    Section 3.1 explains how to re-estimate the model parameters.
    The competitive linking algorithm is designed to overcome the problem of indirect associations, illustrated in Figure 1.
    The sequences of u's and v's represent corresponding regions of a bitext.
    If uk and vk co-occur much more often than expected by chance, then any reasonable model will deem them likely to be mutual translations.
    If uk and vk are indeed mutual translations, then their tendency to 'The co-occurrence frequency of a word type pair is simply the number of times the pair co-occurs in the corpus.
    However, n(u) = Ev n(u,v), which is not the same as the frequency of
