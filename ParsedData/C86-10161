 in which all the syntactic information is incorporated in the lexicon and the remaining few combinatorial rules that build phrases are function application and composition.
  Definite-clause grammars (Pereira and Warren) can also be encoded in the PATR formalism.
  What these approaches have in common is that syntactic rules and lexieal entries can be written down as sets of attribute-value pairs.
  Moreover, because a value at the end of one path of attributes can be shared by another path, the structures that are generated by such grammars can be thought of as directed graphs Cdags").
  Unification is the key operation for building these structures.
  Because unification is associative and commutative, statements in a unification-based grammar formalism are order-independent and bidirectional with respect to parsing and generation.
  For a comprehensive introduction tounification-based approaches togrammar, see Shieber 1986 (forthcoming).
  The idea that led to the present version of D-PATR was to produce
