ntability learning task and evaluated their performance on Baldwin and Bond&#8217;s (2003) test data.
    We concentrated solely on countable and uncountable nouns, as they account for the vast majority of the data.
    Four models were tested: (a) compare the frequency of the singular and plural forms of the noun; (b) compare the frequency of determiner-noun pairs that are characteristic of countable or uncountable nouns; the determiners used were many for countable and much for uncountable ones; (c) same as model (b), but the det-noun frequencies are normalized by the frequency of the noun; (d) backoff: try to make a decision using det-noun frequencies; if these are too sparse, back off to singular/plural frequencies.
    Unigram and bigram frequencies were estimated from the web using literal queries; for models (a)&#8211;(c) a threshold parameter was optimized on the development set (this parameter determines the ratio of singular/plural frequencies or det-noun frequencies above which a noun was considere
