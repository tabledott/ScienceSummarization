hese context-free rules can be interpreted as saying that a nonterminal symbol A expands into one or more either nonterminal or terminal symbols, a X0 ... Xk.2 A sequence of context-free rule expansions can be represented in a tree, with parents expanding into one or more children below them in the tree.
    Each of the individual local expansions in the tree is a rule in the CFG.
    Nodes in the tree with no children are called leaves.
    A tree whose leaves consist entirely of terminal symbols is complete.
    Consider, for example, the parse tree shown in (a) in Figure 1: the start symbol is St, which expands into an S. The S node expands into an NP followed by a VP.
    These nonterminal nodes each in turn expand, and this process of expansion continues until the tree generates the terminal string, &amp;quot;Spot chased the ball&amp;quot;, as leaves.
    A CFG G defines a language LG, which is a subset of the set of strings of terminal symbols, including only those that are leaves of complete trees root
