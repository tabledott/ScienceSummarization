responds to all NTs that unify with: pos=v ] v - type = be tense - aspect -- past (4) We use these mnemonics to label a parse tree and we also use them to estimate a P-CFG, where the probabil ity of rewriting a NT is given by the probability of rewrit- ing the mnemonic.
  So from a training set we induce a CFG from the actual mnemonic productions that are elicited in parsing the training corpus.
  Using the Inside- Outside algorithm, we can estimate P-CFG from a large corpus of text.
  But since we also have a large corpus of bracketed sentences, we can adapt the Inside-Outside algorithm to reestimate the probability parameters sub- ject to the constraint hat only parses consistent with the Treebank (where consistency is as defined earlier) 136 contribute to the reestimation.
  From a training run of 15,000 sentences we observed 87,704 mnemonic produc- tions, with 23,341 NT mnemonics of which 10,302 were lexical.
  Running on a test set of 760 sentences 32% of the rule templates were used, 7% of the lexical m
