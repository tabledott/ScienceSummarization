 genomics literature relating to Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly).
    The papers were converted to XML and linguistically processed using the RASP toolkit3.
    We annotated six of the papers to form a test set with a total of 380 spec sentences and 1157 nspec sentences, and randomly selected 300,000 sentences from the remaining papers as training data for the weakly supervised learner.
    To ensure selection of complete sentences rather than headings, captions etc., unlabelled samples were chosen under the constraints that they must be at least 10 words in length and contain a main verb.
  
  
    Two separate annotators were commissioned to label the sentences in the test set, firstly one of the authors and secondly a domain expert with no prior input into the guideline development process.
    The two annotators labelled the data independently using the guidelines outlined in section 3.
    Relative F1 (Frel 1 ) and Cohen&#8217;s Kappa (n) were then used to quantify the level of agreement.
