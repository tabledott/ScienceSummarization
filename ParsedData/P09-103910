P) is an optimization problem of the form If the problem is feasible, the optimum is attained at a vertex of the polyhedron that defines the constraint space.
    If we add the constraint x E Zd, then the above is called an integer linear program (ILP).
    For some special parameter settings&#8212;e.g., when b is an integer vector and A is totally unimodular5&#8212;all vertices of the constraining polyhedron are integer points; in these cases, the integer constraint may be suppressed and (3) is guaranteed to have integer solutions (Schrijver, 2003).
    Of course, this need not happen: solving a general ILP is an NP-complete problem.
    Despite this fact, fast solvers are available today that make this a practical solution for many problems.
    Their performance depends on the dimensions and degree of sparsity of the constraint matrix A. Riedel and Clarke (2006) proposed an ILP formulation for dependency parsing which refines the arc-factored model by imposing linguistically motivated &#8220;hard&#8221; co
