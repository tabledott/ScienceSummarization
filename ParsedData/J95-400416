licitly by the current location within the tree.
    There are a number of practical differences between transformation-based error-driven learning and learning decision trees.
    One difference is that when training a decision tree, each time the depth of the tree is increased, the average amount of training material available per node at that new depth is halved (for a binary tree).
    In transformationbased learning, the entire training corpus is used for finding all transformations.
    Therefore, this method is not subject to the sparse data problems that arise as the depth of the decision tree being learned increases.
    Transformations are ordered, with later transformations being dependent upon the outcome of applying earlier transformations.
    This allows intermediate results in 550 &#8226; Brill Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning classifying one object to be available in classifying other objects.
