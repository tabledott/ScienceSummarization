 Functional Parents model employs two types of parents, the and the The a list Figure 3: Sample representation of &amp;quot;with a list&amp;quot; in HBG model.

    If the immediate parent of a constituent has a different syntactic type from that of the constituent, then the immediate parent is also the functional parent; otherwise, the functional parent is the functional parent of the immediate parent.
    The distinction between functional parents and immediate parents arises primarily to cope with unit productions.
    When unit productions of the form XP2 ---&gt; XP1 occur, the immediate parent of XP1 is XP2.
    But, in general, the constituent XP2 does not contain enough useful information for ambiguity resolution.
    In particular, when considering only immediate parents, unit rules such as NP2
