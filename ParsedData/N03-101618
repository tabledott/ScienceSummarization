in this case maybe the two CC tags required to complete the NP are not present in the future context).
    A close approximation to the F estimate can also be computed online especially quickly during parsing.
    Since we are parsing with the Penn treebank covering grammar, almost any (phrasal) non-terminal can be built over almost any span.
    As discussed in Klein and Manning (2001b), the only source of constraint on what edges can be built where is the tags in the rules.
    Therefore, an edge with a label like NP&#8212; &#183; CC NP CC NP can essentially be built whenever (and only whenever) two CC tags are in the edge&#8217;s right context, one of them being immediately to the right.
    To the extent that this is true, F can be approximated by simply scanning for the tag configuration required by a state&#8217;s local rule, and returning 0 if it is present and &#8212;oo otherwise.
    This is the method we used to implement F; exactly parsing with the projected grammar was much slower and did not resu
