to the regular expression.
    We can further notice that the lifting condition ends with a repetition of LD for reasons which will be made clear when discussing the rewriting process.
    A sentential form contains terminal strings and categories paired with a multiset of lifting conditions, called the lift multiset.
    The lift multiset associated to a category C contains 'transiting' lifting conditions: introduced by ancestors of C and passing across C. Three cases must be distinguished when rewriting a category C and its lifting multiset LM: &#8226; LM contains a single lifting condition which dot is situated to its right: LG w SG C..
    In such a case, C must be rewritten by the empty string.
    The situation of the dot at the right of the lifting condition indicates that C has been introduced by its syntactic governor although it has already been introduced by its linear governor earlier in the rewriting process.
    This is the reason why C has been added at the end of the lifting condition. of the
