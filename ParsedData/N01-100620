 The following example shows a sentence with text chunks and part-ofspeech tags: The problem can be transformed into a classification task.
    Following Ramshaw &amp; Marcus' (1999) work in base noun phrase chunking, each word is assigned a chunk tag corresponding to the phrase to which it belongs .
    The following table shows the above sentence with the assigned chunk tags: and the part-of-speech tags were generated by Brill's tagger (Brill, 1995).
    All the systems are trained to completion (until all the rules are learned).
    Table 3 shows the results of the text chunking experiments.
    The performance of the FastTBL algorithm is the same as of regular TBL's, and runs in an order of magnitude faster.
    The ICA algorithm again runs considerably faster, but at a cost of a significant performance hit.
    There are at least 2 reasons that contribute to this behavior: 1.
    The initial state has a lower performance than the one in tagging; therefore the independence assumption might not hold.
