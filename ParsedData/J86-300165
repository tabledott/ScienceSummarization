ntions that will come into play are not known (never by the OCP, hardly ever by the ICP) until the utterances in the discourse have been made.
    Although it is assumed that the participants' common knowledge includes&amp;quot; enough information about the domain to determine various relationships such as supports and generates, it is not assumed that, prior to a discourse, they actually had inferred and are aware of all the relationships they will need for that discourse.
    Because any of the utterances in a segment may contribute information relevant to a complete determination of the DSP, the recognition process is not complete until the end of the segment.
    However, the OCP must be able to recognize at least a generalization of the DSP so that he can make the proper moves with respect to the attentional structure.
    That is, some combination of explicit indicators and intentional and propositional content must allow the OCP to ascertain where the DSP will fit in the intentional structure at the be
