    The grammar presented here was forced for expository reasons to be trivial.
    (We have developed more extensive experimental grammars that can generate relative clauses with gaps and sentences with quantified NPs from quantifled logical forms by using a version of Cooper storage [Cooper, 1983].
    An outline of our treatment of quantification is provided in Section 3.4.)
    Nonetheless, several important properties of the algorithm are exhibited even in the preceding simple example.
    First, the order of processing is not left-to-right.
    The verb was generated before any of its complements.
    Because of this, full information about the subject, including agreement information, was available before it was generated.
    Thus, the nondeterminism that is an artifact of left-to-right processing, and a source of inefficiency in the Earley generator, is eliminated.
    Indeed, the example here was completely deterministic; all rule choices were forced.
    In addition, the semantic information about
