  MCS requires parameter settings to be tuned on a development set.
    Our corpora do not include development sets, so tuning was performed using the lecture transcript corpus described by Malioutov and Barzilay (2006).
    Our system does not require parameter tuning; priors are re-estimated as described in Sections 3.4 and 4.3.
    U&amp;I requires no parameter tuning, and is used &#8220;out of the box.&#8221; In all experiments, we assume that the number of desired segments is provided.
    Preprocessing Standard preprocessing techniques are applied to the text for all comparisons.
    The Porter (1980) stemming algorithm is applied to group equivalent lexical items.
    A set of stop-words is also removed, using the same list originally employed by several competitive systems (Choi, 2000; ter performance.
    BAYESSEG is the cohesion-only Bayesian system with marginalized language models.
    BAYESSEG-CUE is the Bayesian system with cue phrases.
    BAYESSEG-CUE-PROP adds the linguisticallymotivated prop
