ntially automated if we have a suitable bilingual translation lexicon.
    Much research has been done on the best supervised learning approach for WSD (Florian and Yarowsky, 2002; Lee and Ng, 2002; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001; Yarowsky et al., 2001).
    In this paper, we used the WSD program reported in (Lee and Ng, 2002).
    In particular, our method made use of the knowledge sources of part-of-speech, surrounding words, and local collocations.
    We used na&#239;ve Bayes as the learning algorithm.
    Our previous research demonstrated that such an approach leads to a state-of-the-art WSD program with good performance.
    Given an occurrence of w in a new context, we then used the na&#239;ve Bayes classifier to determine the most probable sense of w.
  
  
    We evaluated our approach to word sense disambiguation on all the 29 nouns in the English lexical sample task of SENSEVAL-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001; Kilgarriff 2001).
    The list of 29 nouns is given in Table 3.
