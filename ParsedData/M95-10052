ks generate an equivalence class, the set (A B C D I .
  Technically , the links are a spanning tree of the sets implicit equivalence graph, i .e., thefully - connected graph whose nodes are the entities A, B, C, and D .
  The following figure shows the spanning tree in dark lines, and the rest of the graph in gray lines .
  This is just one such spanning tree for the overall equivalence class ; there are of course I Coreference task defmition ., version 2.0 and earlier.
  45 others, including the "non-problematic" case of &lt;A-B B-C C-D&gt; .
  Either way, a minimal spanning tree of the equivalence relation will always be of size 3, which aligns with th e intuitive notion that three links will always be necessary to make four entitie s coreferential under the criterion of strict identity .
  Returning to the task of scoring coreference for this problematic case, we note that a response of &lt;A-B C-D&gt; induces two equivalence classes, thus partitioning the set of ke y entities into subsets {A B } and { C
