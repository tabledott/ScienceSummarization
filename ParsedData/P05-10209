    Specifically, a positive instance is created for each anaphoric NP, NP&#9985; , and its closest antecedent, NP; and a negative instance is created for NP&#9985; paired with each of the intervening NPs, NP , NP ,, NP&#9985; .
    Unlike Soon et al., Ng and Cardie&#8217;s method generates a positive instance for each anaphoric NP and its most confident antecedent.
    For a non-pronominal NP, the most confident antecedent is assumed to be its closest non-pronominal antecedent.
    For pronouns, the most confident antecedent is simply its closest preceding antecedent.
    Negative instances are generated as in Soon et al.&#8217;s method.
    Feature sets.
    We employ two feature sets for representing an instance, as described below.
    Soon et al.&#8217;s feature set consists of 12 surfacelevel features, each of which is computed based on one or both NPs involved in the instance.
    The features can be divided into four groups: lexical, grammatical, semantic, and positional.
