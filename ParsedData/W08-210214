es of a spine.
    The main issue is how to handle multiple r-adjunctions or s-adjunctions on both sides of a node in a spine, because our derivations do not specify how adjunctions from different sides embed with each other.
    In our approach, the combination operation preserves the height of the different modifiers from the left and right directions.
    To illustrate this, figure 3 shows the result of combining the two structures in figure 2.
    The combination of the left and right modifier structures has led to flat structures, for example the rule VP &#8594; ADVP VP NP in the above tree.
    Note that our r-adjunction operation is different from the usual adjunction operation in TAGs, in that &#8220;wrapping&#8221; adjunctions are not possible, and r-adjunctions from the left and right directions are independent from each other; because of this our grammars are splittable.
