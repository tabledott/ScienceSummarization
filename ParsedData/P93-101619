subject) NP node.
    The attribute +pro represents the hypothesis that the subject of the clause is PRO.
    The meaning of -ppro is that the subject PRO has not yet been protected (from being governed).
    When an item containing -ppro passes through a barrier link, -ppro becomes +ppro which means that the PRO subject has now been protected.
    A PROtheorem violation is detected if +govern and -ppro co-occur in an item.
  
  
    The parser has been implemented in C++, an object-oriented extension of C. The object-oriented paradigm makes the relationships between nodes and links in the grammar network and their software counterparts explicit and direct.
    Communication via message passing is reflected in the message passing metaphor used in object-oriented languages.
    Nodes and links are implemented as objects.
    Figure 6 shows the class hierarchy for nodes.
    The constraints that implement the principles are distributed over the nodes and links in the network.
