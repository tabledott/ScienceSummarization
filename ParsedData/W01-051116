equence of c binary variables in which one binary variable was one and the remaining c &#8722; 1 binary variables were zero.
    We also used a representation in which the words themselves were used as categorical input variables (we call this representation &#8220;lexical&#8221;).
    For this collection of NCs there were 1184 unique nouns and therefore the feature vector for each noun had 1184 components.
    In Table 3 we report the length of the feature vectors for one noun for each model.
    The entire NC was described by concatenating the feature vectors for the two nouns in sequence.
    The NCs represented in this fashion were used as input to a neural network.
    We used a feed-forward network trained with conjugate gradient descent. number corresponds to the level of the MeSH hierarchy used for classification.
    Lexical NN is Neural Network on Lexical and Lexical: Log Reg is Logistic Regression on NN.
    Acc1 refers to how often the correct relation is the top-scoring relation, Acc2 refers to h
