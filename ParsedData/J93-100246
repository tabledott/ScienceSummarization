for large grammars is CPU-intensive.
    As a rough guide, Grosch (1990) quotes LALR(1) table construction for a grammar for Modula-2 taking from about 5 to 50 seconds, so scaling up two orders of magnitude, our timings for the ANLT grammar fall in the expected region.
  
  
    The major problem with attempting to employ a disambiguated training corpus is to find a way of constructing this corpus in an error-free and resource-efficient fashion.
    Even manual assignment of lexical categories is slow, labor-intensive, and error-prone.
    The greater complexity of constructing a complete parse makes the totally manual approach very unattractive, if not impractical.
    Sampson (1987:83) reports that it took 2 person-years to produce the 'LOB tree bank' of 50,000 words.
    Furthermore, in that project, no attempt was made to ensure that the analyses were well formed with respect to a generative grammar.
    Attempting to manually construct analyses consistent with a grammar of any size and sophistication wou
