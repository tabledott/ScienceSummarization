l's tagger (Brill, 1993c), an initial calculation in each pass computes the confusion matrix for the current tag assignments and sorts the entries of that [old-tag x new-tag] matrix, so that candidate rules can then be processed in decreasing order of the maximum possible benefit for any rule changing, say, old tag I to new tag J.
    The search for the best-scoring rule can then be halted when a cell of the confusion matrix is reached whose maximum possible benefit is less than the net benefit of some rule already encountered.
    The power of that approach is dependent on the fact that the confusion matrix for part-ofspeech tagging partitions the space of candidate rules into a relatively large number of classes, so that one is likely to be able to exclude a reasonably large portion of the search space.
    In a chunk tagging application, with only 3 or 4 tags in the effective tagset, this approach based on the confusion matrix offers much less benefit.
    However, even though the confusion matrix does not
