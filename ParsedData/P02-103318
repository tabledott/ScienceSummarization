    This paper presents art unsupervised approach to word sense disambiguation that exploits translations as a proxy for semantic annotation across languages.
    The observation behind the approach, that words having the same translation often share some dimension of meaning, leads to art algorithm in which the correct sense of a word is reinforced by the semantic similarity of other words with which it shares those dimensions of meaning.
    Performance using this algorithm has been rigorously evaluated and is comparable with other unsupervised WSD systems, based ori fair comparison using community-wide test data.
    Because it achieves this performance using crosslanguage data alone, it is likely that improved results can be obtained by also taking advantage of monolingual contextual evidence.
    Although in the end all unsupervised systems are likely to produce precision results inferior to the best supervised algorithms, they are often more prac
