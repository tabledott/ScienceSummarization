ng it simulate an information clerk at a railway station.
    This domain is real, but sufficiently circumscribed so that interchanges between clerk and patrons are relatively short and are directed towards a limited set of goals.
    The program accepts as input simple English sentences, parses them using an ATN parser, and produces as output the speech act(s) it recognized and their associated propositional contents.
    It can handle all the examples discussed here.
    Details of the implementation can be found in Allen [1979].
  
  
    Prior to Austin [1962], logicians considered the meaning of a sentence to be determined only by its truth value.
    However, Austin noted that some sentences cannot be classified as true or false; the utterance of one of these sentences constitutes the performance of an action, and hence he named them performatives.
    To quote Austin: &amp;quot;When I say, before the register or altar, etc., 'I do', I am not reporting on a marriage: I am indulging in it&amp;quot;.
