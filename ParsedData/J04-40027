    This is an important advantage compared to syntax-based translation models (Yamada and Knight 2001; Gildea 2003; Charniak, Knight, and Yamada 2003) that require a parser for source or target language.
    In Section 5, we describe in detail our search algorithm and discuss an efficient implementation.
    We use a dynamic-programming-based beam search algorithm that allows a trade-off between efficiency and quality.
    We also discuss the use of heuristic functions to reduce the number of search errors for a fixed beam size.
    In Section 6, we describe various results obtained on different tasks.
    For the German&#8211;English VERBMOBiL task, we analyze the effect of various system compoArchitecture of the translation approach based on a log-linear modeling approach. nents.
    On the French&#8211;English Canadian HANSARDS task, the alignment template system obtains significantly better results than a single-word-based translation model.
