ing the frequency of a handful of previously-identified linguistic variables: pairs of phonological, lexical, or morphosyntactic features that are semantically equivalent, but whose frequency depends on social, geographical, or other factors (Paolillo, 2002; Chambers, 2009).
    It is left to the experimenter to determine which variables will be considered, and there is no obvious procedure for drawing inferences from the distribution of multiple variables.
    In this paper, we present a method for identifying geographically-aligned lexical variation directly from raw text.
    Our approach takes the form of a probabilistic graphical model capable of identifying both geographically-salient terms and coherent linguistic communities.
    One challenge in the study of lexical variation is that term frequencies are influenced by a variety of factors, such as the topic of discourse.
    We address this issue by adding latent variables that allow us to model topical variation explicitly.
    We hypothesize that ge
