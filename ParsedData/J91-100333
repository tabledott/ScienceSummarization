 anomaly are recognized by evaluating preferences, which produces four kinds of basic &amp;quot;preference-based&amp;quot; relationship or semantic relation: literal, metonymic, metaphorical, and anomalous.
    Within the method, the main difference between metonymy and metaphor is that a metonymy is viewed as consisting of one or more semantic relationships like CONTAINER FOR CONTENTS and PART FOR WHOLE, whereas a metaphor is viewed as containing a relevant analogy.
    I agree with Ortony's remark that metaphor be viewed as contextual anomaly, but would suggest two modifications.
    First, not just metaphor but all of the preferencebased relations should be understood in terms of the presence or absence of contextual constraint violation.
    Second, I prefer the term contextual constraint violation because [1] one of the phenomena detected by contextual violation is anomaly and [2] the selection restriction/preference (on which the met* method is based) is a kind of lexical contextual constraint.
