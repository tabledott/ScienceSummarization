 of all these), and 4 corresponding to genes, chromosome locations, proteins, and cell lines, drawn from online public databases (Cancer GeneticsWeb,2 BBID,3 SwissProt,4 and the Cell Line Database5).
    Feature functions for the lexicons are set to 1 if they match words in the input sequence exactly.
    For lexicon entries that are multi-word, all words are required to match in the input sequence.
    Since no suitable database of terms for the CELL-TYPE class was found online, a lexicon was constructed by utilizing Google Sets,6 an online tool which takes a few seed examples and leverages Google&#8217;s web index to return other terms that appear in similar formatting and context as the seeds on web pages across the Internet.
    Several examples from the training data (e.g.
    &#8220;lymphocyte&#8221; and &#8220;neutrophil&#8221;) were used as seeds and new cell types (e.g.
    &#8220;chondroblast,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t even occur in the training data), were returned.
    The process was repeated un
