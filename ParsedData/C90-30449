  We define it based on the score of the matching expression, because the matching expression determines the translation outi)ut.
  The scores of.the source matching ex- pression and the target matching expression are calculated separately.
  5.1 Score  o f  T rans la t ion  Un i t First, we will define the score of a translation unit.
  The score of a translation unit should reflect the correctness of the translation unit.
  Which translation unit is better?
  Two main fac- t.ors are: 1.
  A larger translation unit is better.
