ter was first hypothesized and then manually adjusted through experiments on 30 training sentences containing CSs.
    These parameters would not be the best, and statistical investigations of large corpora would be preferable.
    However, these parameters are good enough to get reasonably good analysis results, as shown in the experiments section, and to show the appropriateness of our method.
    First, we calculate similarities for all pairs of bunsetsus in the sentence.
    An appropriate similarity value between two bunsetsus is given by the following process: Hyou (BGH; National Language Research Institute 1964).
    The BGH has a six layer abstraction hierarchy, and more than 60,000 words are assigned to the leaves of it.
    If the most specific common layer between two IWs is the kth layer and if k is greater than 2, add (k &#8212; 2) x 2 points.
    If either or both IWs are not contained in the BGH, no addition is made.
    Matching of the generic two layers is ignored to prevent too vague matchin
