tion errors.
    Consider, for example, the occurrence of car in the data shown in Figure 8, which has supposedly resulted from an erroneous extraction.
    The effect of this datum gets washed away, as the estimated probability for VEHICLE, to which car has been generalized, is negligible.
    On the other hand, SA has a merit not shared by MDL, namely its use of the association ratio factors out the effect of absolute frequencies of words, and focuses on their co-occurrence relation.
    Since both MDL and SA have pros and cons, it would be desirable to develop a methodology that combines the merits of the two methods (cf.
    Abe and Li [1996]).
    MDL and LA.
    LA makes its disambiguation decision completely ignoring noun2.
    As Resnik (1993b) pointed out, if we hope to improve disambiguation performance by increasing training data, we need a richer model such as those used in MDL and SA.
    We found that 8.8% of the quadruples in our entire test data were such that they shared the same verb, prep,
