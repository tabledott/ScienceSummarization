Vocabulary and discourse relations are the strongest predictors of readability, followed by average number of verb phrases and length of the text.
    This empirical confirmation of the significance of discourse relations as a readability factor is novel for the computational linguistics literature.
    Note though that for our work we use oracle discourse annotations directly from the PDTB and no robust systems for automatic discourse annotation exist today.
    The significance of the average number of verb phrases as a readability predictor is somewhat surprising but intriguing.
    It would lead to reexamination of the role of verbs/predicates in written text, which we also plan to address in future work.
    None of the other factors showed significant association with readability ratings, even though some correlations had relatively large positive values.
  
  
    In this section, we turn to the question of how the combination of various factors improves the prediction of readability.
    We use the le
