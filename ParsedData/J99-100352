lation lexicon, the largest realigned block was 7x 7 segments.
    Thus, GSA can obviate the need to manually prealign large bitexts.
    Table 6 compares GSA's accuracy on the &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; French/English bitexts with the accuracy of two other alignment algorithms, as reported by Simard, Foster, and Isabelle (1992).
    The error metric counts one error for each aligned block in the reference alignment that is missing from the test alignment.
    To account for the possibility of modularizing the overall alignment task into paragraph alignment followed by sentence alignment, Simard, Foster, and Isabelle (1992) have reported the accuracy of their sentence alignment algorithm when a perfect alignment at the paragraph level is given.
    SIMR/GSA was also tested in this manner, to enable the second set of comparisons in Table 6.
    Due to the scarcity of hand-aligned training bitexts at my disposal, GSA's backingoff heuristics are somewhat ad hoc.
    Even so, GSA perfor
