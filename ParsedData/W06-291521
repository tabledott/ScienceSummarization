 naive Bayes models can successfully uncover the word patterns that reflect author perspective with high accuracy.
    In addition, we develop a novel statistical model to estimate how strongly a sentence conveys perspective, in the absence of sentence-level annotations.
    By introducing latent variables and sharing parameters, the Latent Sentence Perspective Model is shown to capture well how perspectives are reflected at the document and sentence levels.
    The small but positive improvement due to sentence-level modeling in LSPM is encouraging.
    In the future, we plan to investigate how consistently LSPM sentence-level predictions are with human annotations.

    A Gibbs Samplers Based the model specification described in Section 4.2 we derive the Gibbs samplers (Chen et al., 2000) for the Latent Sentence Perspective Model as follows, where dbinom and dmultinom
