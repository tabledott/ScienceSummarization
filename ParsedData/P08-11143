ivated parses of the target language.
    Similarly, Cowan et al. (2006) focus on using syntactically rich representations of source and target parse trees, but they resort to phrase-based translation for modifiers within clauses.
    Finding the right way to balance linguistic analysis with unconstrained data-driven modeling is clearly a key challenge.
    In this paper we address this challenge from a less explored direction.
    Rather than starting with a system based on linguistically motivated parse trees, we begin with a model that is syntactic only in the formal sense.
    We then introduce soft constraints that take source-language parses into account to a limited extent.
    Introducing syntactic constraints in this restricted way allows us to take maximal advantage of what can be learned from parallel training data, while effectively factoring in key aspects of linguistically motivated analysis.
    As a result, we obtain substantial improvements in performance for both Chinese-English and Arabic-E
