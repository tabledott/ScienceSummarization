sus 3), and external resources contribute 0.5 points.
    On the other hand, the semantic sieves do not help (row 3 versus 4).
    The latter result contradicts our initial experiments, where we measured a minor improvement when these sieves were enabled and gold mentions were used.
    Our hypothesis is that, when predicted mentions are used, the semantic sieves are more likely to link spurious mentions to existing clusters, thus introducing precision errors.
    This suggests that a different tuning of the sieve parameters is required for the predicted mention scenario.
    For this reason, we did not use the semantic sieves for our submission.
    Hence, rows 2 and 3 in the table show the performance of our official submission in the development set, in the closed and open tracks respectively.
    The last three rows in Table 3 give insight on the impact of gold information.
    This analysis indicates that using gold linguistic annotation yields an improvement of only 2 points.
    This implies that the q
