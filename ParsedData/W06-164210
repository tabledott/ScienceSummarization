 yoi] (`I hope v ').
    We used a total of 103 domain-independent modality patterns, most of which are derived from the coordinative (roughly `and') -te, -shi, -ueni, -dakedenaku, -nominarazu causal (roughly &#8216;because&#8217;) -tame, -kara, -node adversative (roughly `but') -ga, -kedo, -keredo, - monono, -nodaga Another type of pattern is conjunctive patterns, which allow multiple propositions in a sentence.
    We used a total of 22 conjunctive patterns also derived from the MT method, as exemplified in Table 1.
    In such cases of coordinative clauses and causal clauses, both clauses can be polar clauses.
    On the other hand, no proposition is identified in a conditional clause due to the absence of corresponding conjunctive patterns.
    To assign a polarity to each proposition, polar atoms in the lexicon are compared to the proposition.
    A polar atom consists of polarity, verb or adjective, and optionally, its arguments.
    Example (12) is a simple polar atom, where no argument is specified.
