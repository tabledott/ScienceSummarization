 two-step process.
    The two models that we use are: We select the most likely trees for each word by examining the local context.
    The statistical model we use to decide this is the trigram model that was used by B. Srinivas in his SuperTagging model (Srinivas, 1997).
    The model assigns an n-best lattice of tree assignments associated with the input sentence with each path corresponding to an assignment of an elementary tree for each word in the sentence.
    (for further details, see (Srinivas, 1997)). where T0 ... Tn is a sequence of elementary trees assigned to the sentence W0 ... Wn.
    We get (2) by using Bayes theorem and we obtain (3) from (2) by ignore the denominator and by applying the usual Markov assumptions.
    The output of this model is a probabilistic ranking of trees for the input sentence which is sensitive to a small local context window.
    Once the words in a sentence have selected a set of elementary trees, parsing is the process of attaching these trees together to give us a
