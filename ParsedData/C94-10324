(1) i=1 201 In practice, we consider sentence boundaries ~s special symbols as follows.
  P(W,T) = P(ql#)P(wtltt)P(t,.
  l#, tl)P(w21t~) ~I P(tilti_2,ti_l)P(willi)P(#[t,,_l,?,,) (2) i=3 where "#" indicates the sentence boundary marker.
  If we have some tagged text available, we can estimate the probabilities P(tdti_2,ti_l ) and P(wiltl) by comput- ing the relative frequencies of the corresponding events on this data:.
  N(ti_2, ti-1, tl) P(tifti-2ti-t) = f(qltl-2ti-x) - iV ( t i _ .
  , , t i _ , ) (3) P(wilti) = f(wilt,) -- N(w,t) (1) N(t) where f indicates the relative frequency, N(w, t) is t!,e number of times a given word w appears with tag l, aid N(li_2,ti-l,tl) is the number of times that sequer~ce l~ i _2t i _ l l  i appears in the text.
  It is inevitable to s~ irer from sparse-data problem in the part of speech tag tri- gram probability I .
  To handle open text, trigram Frol:- ability is smoothed by interpolated estimation, wi~ich simply interpolates trlgram, bigram, unigram, and ze- rogram relativ
