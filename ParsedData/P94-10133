ing context.
    Accent restoration is merely an instance of a closelyrelated class of problems including word-sense disambiguation, word choice selection in machine translation, homograph and homophone disambiguation, and capitalization restoration.
    The given algorithm may be used to solve each of these problems, and has been applied without modification to the case of homograph disambiguation in speech synthesis (Sproat, Hirschberg and Yarowsky, 1992).
    It may not be immediately apparent to the reader why this set of problems forms a natural class, similar in origin and solvable by a single type of algorithm.
    In each case it is necessary to disambiguate two or more semantically distinct word-forms which have been conflated into the same representation in some medium.
    In the prototypical instance of this class, wordsense disambiguation, such distinct semantic concepts as river bank, financial bank and to bank an airplane are conflated in ordinary text.
