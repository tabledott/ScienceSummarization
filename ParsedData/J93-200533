ob of identifying verbs that semantically relate to the word tape, it provides no information about how the verbs relate to the noun's qualia structure.
    That is, verbs such as unload, position, and mount are selecting for the formal quale of tape, a physical object that can be physically manipulated with respect to a tape drive.
    Read, write, and copy, on the other hand, relate to the telic role, the function of a tape as a medium for storing information.
    Our hypothesis was that the nominal alternation can help to distinguish the two sets of verbs.
    We reasoned that, if the alternation is based on the container/containee metonymy, then it will be those verbs that apply to the telic role of the direct object that participate in the alternation.
    We tested this hypothesis as follows.
    We generated a candidate set of containees for tape by identifying all the nouns that appeared in the corpus to the left of the adjunct on tape.
    Intersection and set difference for three container nouns.
