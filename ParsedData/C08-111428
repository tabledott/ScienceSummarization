hink, by using one or another kind of analogy.?
			Hofstadter (2007) claimed, ?all meaningcomes from analogies.?
			In NLP, analogical algo rithms have been applied to machine translation(Lepage and Denoual, 2005), morphology (Lep age, 1998), and semantic relations (Turney and Littman, 2005).
			Analogy provides a frameworkthat has the potential to unify the field of seman tics.
			This paper is a small step towards that goal.
