ightly modified from Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard [1987, 157]) did not indicate a difference between the approaches, for the RETAIN-CONTINUE combination in examples (10c) and (10d), the two approaches led to different results (see Table 22 for the BFP algorithm and Table 23 for the FunC algorithm). a. Brennan drives an Alfa Romeo.
    Within the functional approach, the proper name Friedman is unused and, therefore, the leftmost hearer-old discourse entity of (10c).
    Hence, FRIEDMAN is the most preferred antecedent for the pronoun she in (10d) and (10d').
    But is subjecthood really the decisive factor?
    When we replace Friedman with a hearer-new discourse entity, e.g., a professional driver, as in (100,' then the procedures generate inconsistent results, again.
    In the BFP algorithm, the ranking of the Cf list depends only on grammatical roles.
    Hence, DRIVER is ranked higher than BRENNAN in the Cf(106.
    In (10d), the pronoun she is resolved to BRENNAN because of the preference for CONTINU
