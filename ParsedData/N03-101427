e case where all these history representations are used (SSN-Freq 200).
    The biggest decrease in performance occurs when the left-corner ancestor is represented with just its label (ancestor label).
    This implies that more distant top-down constraints and constraints from the left context are playing a big role in the success of the SSN parser, and suggests that parsers which do not include information about this context in their history features will not do well.
    Another big decrease in performance occurs when the most recent child is represented with just its label (child label).
    This implies that more distant bottom-up constraints are also playing a big role, probably including some information 6The validation set is used to avoid repeated testing on the standard testing set.
    Sentences of length greater than 100 were excluded. about lexical heads.
    There is also a decrease in performance when the left-corner child is represented with just its label (lc-child label).
    This implies th
