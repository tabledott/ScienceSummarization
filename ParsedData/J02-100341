ef, existing algorithms are incomplete.
    In particular, we have shown Dale and Reiter&#8217;s (1995) Incremental Algorithm to be intersectively incomplete with respect to Attributes that have overlapping Values and (less surprisingly) in some situations where the class of properties is infinitely large.
    Furthermore, the Incremental Algorithm excludes reference to sets and limits itself to purely intersective combinations of atomic properties, causing the algorithm to be incomplete with respect to the set of all Boolean combinations.
    Having noted these shortcomings, we have modified the Incremental Algorithm in such a way that these limitations are removed.
    The result is a set of generalizations of the Incremental Algorithm, for which we have proven completeness under appropriate assumptions.
    Integration of these different algorithms into one unified algorithm would be a nontrivial enterprise, as we have shown in Section 4.3.
