 authors of the knowledgebased papers in Chapter 5 of Waibel and Lee (1990) have a university affiliation whereas most of the authors of the data-intensive papers in Chapter 6 have an industrial affiliation.
    Fortunately, as a result of improvements in computer technology and the increasing availability of data due to numerous data collection efforts, the data-intensive methods are no longer restricted to those working in affluent industrial laboratories.
    At the time, of course, the knowledge-based approach was not advocated on economic grounds.
    Rather, the knowledge-based approach was advocated as necessary in order to deal with the lack of allophonic invariance.
    The mapping between phonemes and their allophonic realizations is highly variable and ambiguous.
