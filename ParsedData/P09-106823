s it was judged that a test is not a product.
    We evaluated all 20 schemas.
    The 13 mapped schemas used their assigned frames, and we created frame element definitions for the remaining 7 that were consistent with the syntactic positions.
    There were 400 possible arguments (20 schemas, 2 chains each), and 289 were judged correct for a precision of 72%.
    This number includes Person and Organization names as correct fillers.
    A more conservative metric removing these classes results in 259 (65%) correct.
    Most of the errors appear to be from parsing mistakes.
    Several resulted from confusing objects with adjuncts.
    Others misattached modifiers, such as including most as an argument.
    The cooking schema appears to have attached verbal arguments learned from instruction lists (wash, heat, boil).
    Two schemas require situations as arguments, but the dependency graphs chose as arguments the subjects of the embedded clauses, resulting in 20 incorrect arguments in these schema.
