in 18,000 unique words.
    For each concept to which a word belongs, we extracted up to 3 hyponyms, one for each of the top-3 labels for the concept.
    The result was 159,000 hyponym relationships.
    24 are shown in the Appendix.
    Two judges annotated two random samples of 100 relationships: one from all 159,000 hyponyms and one from the subset of 65,000 proper nouns.
    For each instance, the judges were asked to decide whether the hyponym relationship was correct, partially correct or incorrect.
    Table 5 shows the results.
    The strict measure counts a score of 1 for each correctly judged instance and 0 otherwise.
    The lenient measure also gives a score of 0.5 for each instance judged partially correct.

    For example, the wine cluster: Zinfandel, merlot, Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, cabernet, riesling, Sauvignon blanc, Chenin blanc, sangiovese, syrah, Grape, Chianti ... contains some incorrect instances such as grape, appelation,
