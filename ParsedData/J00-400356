ow loose segmentation with recency.
    In an earlier version of the system (Vieira and Poesio 1996), only those definite descriptions that were not resolved with a same-head antecedent were considered as potential antecedents; resolved definite descriptions would be linked to previous NPs, but would not be made available for subsequent resolution.
    (The idea was that the same antecedent used in one resolution could be used to resolve all subsequent mentions cospecifying with that definite description.)
    An important difference between that implementation and the current one is that in the new version, the definites resolved by the system are also made available as potential antecedents of subsequent definites.
    This is because in our previous prototype, errors in identifying an indefinite antecedent were sometimes propagated through a coreference chain, so that the right antecedent would be missed.
    The results are shown in Table 8.
    If we only consider indefinites as potential antecedents, re
