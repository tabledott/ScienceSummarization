he Brown Corpus, the deictic adverbs there and now are always tagged RB (adverb), whereas their counterparts here and then are inconsistently tagged as RB (adverb) or RN (nominal adverb) even in identical syntactic ontexts, such as after a preposition.
  It is clear that reducing the size of the tagset reduces the chances of such tagging inconsistencies.
  2.1.3 Syntactic Function.
  A further difference between the Penn Treebank and the Brown Corpus concerns the significance accorded to syntactic ontext.
  In the Brown Corpus, words tend to be tagged independently of their syntactic function.
  6 For in- stance, in the phrase the one, one is always tagged as CD (cardinal number), whereas 6 An important exception is there, which the Brown Corpus tags as EX (existential there) when it is used as a formal subject and as RB (adverb) when it is used as a locative adverb.
