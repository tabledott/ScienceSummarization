gned a consolidated human-assessment rank to each system based on the number of times that the given system&#8217;s translations were ranked higher than or equal to the translations of any other system in the manual evaluation of the given language pair.
    We then compared the ranking of systems by the human assessments to that provided by the automatic metric system level scores on the complete WMT10 test set for each language pair, using Spearman&#8217;s p rank correlation coefficient.
    The correlations are shown in Table 7 for translations to English, and Table 8 out of English, with baseline metrics listed at the bottom.
    The highest correlation for each language pair and the highest overall average are bolded.
    Overall, correlations are higher for translations to English than compared to translations from English.
    For all language pairs, there are a number of new metrics that yield noticeably higher correlations with human assessments than either of the two included baseline metrics.
