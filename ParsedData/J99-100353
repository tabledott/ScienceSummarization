ms at least as well as, and usually better than, other alignment algorithms for which comparable results have been published.
    Chen (1996) has also published a quantitative evaluation of his alignment algorithm on these reference bitexts, but his evaluation was done post hoc.
    Since the results in this article are based on a gold standard, they are not comparable to Chen's results.
    Among other reasons, error rates based on a gold standard are sometimes inflated by errors in the gold standard and this was indeed the case for the gold standard used here (see Melamed [1996a]).
    It is also an open question whether GSA performs better than the algorithm proposed by Wu (1994).
    The two algorithms have not yet been evaluated on the same test data.
    For now, I can offer only a theoretical reason why SIMR+GSA should be more accurate than the algorithms of Chen and Wu: Bitext maps lead to alignment more directly than a translation model (Chen 1996) or a translation lexicon (Wu 1994), because both seg
