esults than our PCFG model, and achieves this with a beam width of 20.
    Unfortunately his paper does not give statistics which can be directly compared with ours.
    The work by C&amp;C is easier to compare.
    In Figure 4 we reproduce C&amp;C's results on the percentage of sentences (length 18-26) parsed as a function of number of edges used.
    We performed the same experiment, and our results are included there as well.
    This figure makes dramatic the order of magnitude improvement provided by our new scheme, but it is not too easy to read numbers off of it.
    Such numbers are provided in Table 1.
    Our figures were obtained using ri = 1.2.
    As can be seen, our parser requires about one twentieth the number of edges required by C&amp;C.
    Indeed, the low average number of edges to first parse is probably the most striking thing about our results.
    Even allowing for the fact that considerably more edges must be pushed than are popped, the total number of edges required to first parse is
