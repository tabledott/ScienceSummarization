 projection) is substitutable.
    Finally, we subsert this derived struc'We enforce island effects for wh-movement by using a [&#177;extract] feature on substitution nodes.
    This corresponds roughly to the analysis in TAG, where islandhood is (to a large extent) enforced by designating a particular node as the foot node (Kroch &amp; Joshi, 1986). ture into the claims d-tree by substituting the S node of seems at che S complement node of claims, and by inserting the object of adores (which has not yet been used in the derivation) in the d-edge of the claims d-tree above its S node.
    The derived tree is shown in Figure 5.
    The SA-tree for this derivation corresponds to the dependency tree given previously in Figure 2.
    Note that this is the only possible derivation involving these three d-trees, modulo order of operations.
    To see this, consider the following putative alternate derivation.
    We first subsert the to adore d-tree into the seems tree as above, by substituting the anchor component
