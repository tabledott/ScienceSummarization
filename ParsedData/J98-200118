  For both of these reasons, we adopted semantic notions introduced in familiaritystyle accounts in designing our experiments&#8212;in particular, distinctions introduced in Prince's taxonomy.
    Prince studied in detail the connection between a speaker /writer 's assumptions about the hearer /reader and the linguistic realization of noun phrases (Prince 1981, 1992).
    She criticizes as too simplistic the binary distinction between given and new discourse entities that is at the basis of most previous work on familiarity, and proposes a much more detailed taxonomy of &amp;quot;givenness&amp;quot;&#8212;or, as she calls it, assumed familiarity&#8212;meant to address this problem.
    Also, Prince's analysis of noun phrases is closer than the Christophersen/Hawkins taxonomy to a classification of definite descriptions on purely semantic terms: for example, she relates unfamiliar definites based on referent-establishing relative clauses with Hawkins's associative clause and associative anaphoric uses.'
