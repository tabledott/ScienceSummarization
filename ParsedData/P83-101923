, the Stack Copy Editor could be implemented to delete the copy only, without searching through the stack.
    The specifics of the implementation seems not to matter for this discussion of the editing rules.)
    In sentence (9), the initial embedded sentence is expunged by the Stack Copy Editor.
    It will be useful to look a little more closely at the operation of the parser to see the editing rules at work.
    Sentence (10) includes three editing signals which trigger the copy editors.
    (note also that the complement of were is ellipted.)
    I will show a trace of the parser at each of these correction stages.
    The first editor that comes into play is the Surface Copy Editor, which searches for identical strings on either side of an editing signal, and expunges the first copy.
    This is done once for each sentence, before any lexical category assignments are made.
    Thus in effect, the Surface Copy Editor corresponds to a phonetic/phonological matching operation, although it is in fact an ort
