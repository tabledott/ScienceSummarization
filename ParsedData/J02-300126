e did not use this technique on the training set, as we expected that it would add noise to the data, but instead discarded examples with no matching parse constituent.
    Our technique for finding a near match handles common parse errors such as a prepositional phrase being incorrectly attached to a noun phrase at the right-hand edge, and it guarantees that some syntactic category will be returned: the part-of-speech tag of the frame element&#8217;s first word in the limiting case. alization as subject or direct object is one of the primary facts that linking theory attempts to explain.
    It was a motivation for the case hierarchy of Fillmore (1968), which allowed such rules as &#8220;If there is an underlying AGENT, it becomes the syntactic subject.&#8221; Similarly, in his theory of macroroles, Van Valin (1993) describes the ACTOR as being preferred in English for the subject.
    Functional grammarians consider syntactic subjects historically to have been grammaticalized agent markers.
