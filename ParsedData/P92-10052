ken, including: The QLF formalism is a development of Alshawi 1990.
    As before, underspecified QLFs are produced on the basis of a unification grammar.
    Previously, QLF resolution was only partially monotonic; full monotonicity required changes to the original QLF formalism and the resolution and scoping processes.
    These changes have been implemented in a further development of the Core Language Engine (Alshawi 1992), although we will ignore most implementation issues in the present paper.
    The paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 provides the syntax of the QLF language and Section 3 gives some illustrative examples of monotonic QLF resolution.
    Sections 4 and 5 present the semantics of the QLF formalism.
    Section 6 discusses the relationship between monotonic interpretation, Pereira's categorial semantics (Pereira 1990), and context change approaches to semantics.
    Section 7 mentions some benefits of using QLF-like representations in implementing natural language systems.
