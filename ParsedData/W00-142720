ate transducer implementing an analyser can be reversed to produce a generator.
    However, we are not aware of published research on finite-state morphological generators (1) establishing whether in practice they perform with similar efficiency to morphological analysers, (2) quantifying their type/token accuracy with respect to an independent, extensive 'gold standard', and (3) indicating how easily they can be integrated into Larger systems.
    Furthermore, although a number of finite-state compilation toolkits (e.g.
    Karttunen (1994)) are publicly available or can be licensed for research use, associated largescale linguistic ..descrip Lions&#8212;for-example:En&#8212; glish morphological lexicons---are usually commercial products and are therefore not freely available to the NLG research community.
    The work reported here is alsorelated to work on lexicon representation and morphological processing using the DATR representation language (Cahill, 1993; Evans and Gazdar, .1996).
    However, ..we,.
