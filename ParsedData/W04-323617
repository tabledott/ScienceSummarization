individual characters being assigned the same POS tag t. For example, when estimating the probability of &#8220;WTWU&#8221; being tagged NR, we find the product of the probability of &#8220;WT&#8221; being tagged NR, &#8220;W&#8221; being tagged NR, and &#8220;U&#8221; being tagged NR.
    That is, we enforce the constraint that all characters within a segmented word in the presegmented input sentence must have the same POS tag.
    10-fold CV for CTB is repeated for this POS tagger.
    Figure 4 shows the detailed POS tagging accuracy.
    With a one-at-a-time, character-based POS tagger, the average POS tagging accuracy improved to 91.7%, 7.6% higher than that achieved by the one-at-a-time, word-based POS tagger.
    The average training timing was 55 minutes, while testing took about 50 seconds.
