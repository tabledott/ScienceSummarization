 additional hidden variables.
    In statistical alignment models Pr(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1), the alignment aJ1 is introduced as a hidden variable:
  
  
    As specific MT method, we use the alignment template approach (Och et al., 1999).
    The key elements of this approach are the alignment templates, which are pairs of source and target language phrases together with an alignment between the words within the phrases.
    The advantage of the alignment template approach compared to single word-based statistical translation models is that word context and local changes in word order are explicitly considered.
    The alignment template model refines the translation probability Pr(fJ1 |eI1) by introducing two hidden variables zK1 and aK1 for the K alignment templates and the alignment of the alignment templates: The alignment mapping is j &#8594; i = aj from source position j to target position i = aj.
    Search is performed using the so-called maximum approximation: Hence, the search space consists of the set of
