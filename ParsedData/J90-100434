fied NP is simply the variable bound by the store element arising from the NP.
    For rules of this form to work properly, it is essential that distinct bound logical-form variables be represented as distinct constants in the terms encoding the logical forms.
    This is an instance of the problem of coherence discussed in Section 4.1.
    Figure 5 shows the analysis tree traversal for generating the sentence &amp;quot;No program generates every sentence&amp;quot; from the logical form deol(quant(no,p,prog(p) , quant(every,s,sent(s),gen(p,$)))) The numbers labeling nodes in the figure correspond to tree traversal order.
    We will only discuss the aspects of the traversal involving the new grammer rules given above.
    The remaining rules are like the ones in Figure 3, except that nonterminals have an additional store argument where necessary.
    Pivot nodes [b] and [c] result from the application of rule (8) to reverse the unstoring of the quantifiers in the goal logical form.
    The next pivot node is
