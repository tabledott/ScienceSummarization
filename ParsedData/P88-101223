ng to identify the lube oil alarm.
    The latter is quicker since it presents the theoremprover with problems in a piecemeal fashion, but the former frequently results in better interpretations since it is better able to exploit redundancies.
    The analysis of the sentence in Section 4.2 below, for example, requires either the global strategy or very careful axiomatization.
    The bottom-up strategy, with only a view of a small local region of the sentence, cannot recognize and capitalize on redundancies among distant elements in the sentence.
    Ideally, we would like to have detailed control over the proof process to allow a number of different factors to interact in determining the allocation of deductive resources.
    Among such factors would be word order, lexical form, syntactic structure, topic-comment structure, and, in speech, pitch accent.&#176;
  
  
    We will examine two difficult definite reference problems in which the given and the new information are intertwined and must be separated.
