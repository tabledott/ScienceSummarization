 in which these features may be harming performance.
    The PMI values, on the other hand, appear to yield consistent improvement.
    Furthermore on both the 20 and 100-fold test suites the inclusion of all PMI values with lemmas outperforms the use of only the Turney values, suggesting that the incorporation of the available topic relations is helpful.
    Although there is not enough data here to be certain of trends, it is intuitive that the broader PMI values, similarly to the unigrams, would particularly benefit from increased training data, due to their specificity, and therefore their relative sparseness.
    Once again, the information appears to be most fruitfully combined by building SVMs representing semantic values and lemmas separately and combining them in a single hybrid SVM.
    The average score over the four n-fold cross validation experiments for the hybrid SVM is 86.5%, whereas the average score for the second-best performing model, incoporating all semantic value features and lemmas, is
