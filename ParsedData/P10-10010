  Efficient Third-Order Dependency Parsers
  
    We present algorithms for higher-order dependency parsing that are &#8220;third-order&#8221; in the sense that they can evaluate substructures containing three dependencies, and &#8220;efficient&#8221; in the sense that they reonly Importantly, our new parsers can utilize both sibling-style and grandchild-style interactions.
    We evaluate our parsers on the Penn Treebank and Prague Dependency Treebank, achieving unlabeled attachment scores of 93.04% and 87.38%, respectively.
  
  
    Dependency grammar has proven to be a very useful syntactic formalism, due in no small part to the development of efficient parsing algorithms (Eisner, 2000; McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras, 2007), which can be leveraged for a wide variety of learning methods, such as feature-rich discriminative models (Lafferty et al., 2001; Collins, 2002; Taskar et al., 2003).
    These parsing algorithms share an important characteristic: they factor dependency
