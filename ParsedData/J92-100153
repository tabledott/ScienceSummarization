ion (i.e., the range of magnitudes corresponding to each specificity class) necessarily depend on the size and organization of one's concept hierarchy.
    For example, one would assign specificity value 1 to any concept with more members than any immediate specialization of the most abstract concept.
    When a preference cue matches the input, the cue strength is its specificity value; when a concept fails to match the input, the strength is a negative value whose magnitude is usually the specificity of the concept, but it is not always this straightforward.
    Rating the evidence associated with a preference failure is a subtle problem, because there are different types of preference failure to take into account.
    Failure to meet a general preference is always significant, whereas failure to meet a very specific preference is only strong information when a slight relaxation of the preference does not eliminate the failure.
    This presents a bit of a paradox: the greater the specificity of a concept,
