te summary of v sentences containing a total of n words, the summary-level LCS-based F-measure can be computed as follows: Again &#223; is set to a very big number (?
    8 ) in DUC, i.e. only Rlcs is considered.
    LCS&#8746; (ri, C) is the LCS score of the union longest common subsequence between reference sentence ri and candidate summary C. For example, if ri = w1 w2 w3 w4 w5, and C contains two sentences: c1 = w1 w2 w6 w7 w8 and c2 = w1 w3 w8 w9 w5, then the longest common subsequence of ri and c1 is &#8220;w1 w2&#8221; and the longest common subsequence of ri and c2 is &#8220;w1 w3 w5&#8221;.
    The union longest common subsequence of ri, c1, and c2 is &#8220;w1 w2 w3 w5&#8221; and LCS&#8746; (ri, C) = 4/5.
    The normalized pairwise LCS proposed by Radev et al. (page 51, 2002) between two summaries S1 and S2, LCS(S1 ,S2)MEAD , is written as follows: Assuming S1 has m words and S2 has n words, Equation 8 can be rewritten as Equation 9 due to symmetry: We then define MEAD LCS recall (Rlcs-MEAD) and ME
