a CS node in addition to the KB and the EB (Figure 16e).
    When the head of the CS node is found in the next level analysis, the head is considered to be the omitted predicate and the dependency tree is transformed by supplementing it with this predicate in the pre-conjunct, as shown in Figure 16f.
    When the postposition of An example of analyzing a long sentence into a dependency structure. the KB is also omitted (in Figure 16b, p2 is omitted in the KB), the KB is supplemented with the postposition of the EB.
    For example, in the sentence in Figure 17, the CS [DENRYU-GEN-NI(as current source) PNP-TRANSISTOR(the pnp transistor),]- [SWITCHING-NI(as switching) NPNTRANSISTOR-W0(the npn transistor)] is recognized as an incomplete conjunctive structure, since the head of the bunsetsu &amp;quot;DENRYU-GEN-NI(as current source)&amp;quot; in the preconjunct and the bunsetsu &amp;quot;SWITCHING-NI(as switching)&amp;quot; in the post-conjunct are not found, and both of them have the same postposition &amp;quot;
