    We now apply our content-based similarity measure to the candidate pair classification task presented by STRAND.
    Recall that both the original STRAND classifier and those learned using decision tree methods, described in Section 2.2.3, employ only structural features of the documents to determine whether they are translations.
    Here we apply the tsim score to the same task and compare the results with those of the original STRAND classifier. sources.
    We begin with an English-French dictionary (a total of 34,808 entries, 4,021 of which are not one-to-one).7 Next, a word-to-word translation model (Melamed 2000) was trained on the dictionary.
    Note that the parameter estimation task here is very simple; in most cases the pairs are one-word to one-word, making the hidden link structure unambiguous (modulo NULLs).
    The training primarily served the purpose of breaking down multiword entries, informed by the rest of the entries, so as to obtain a fully one-word-to-one-word dictionary.
