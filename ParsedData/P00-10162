    The domain in which our experiments are performed is base noun phrase chunking.
    A significant amount of work has been done in this domain and many different methods have been applied: Church's PARTS (1988) program used a Markov model; Bourigault (1992) used heuristics along with a grammar; Voutilainen's NPTool (1993) used a lexicon combined with a constraint grammar; Juteson and Katz (1995) used repeated phrases; Veenstra (1998), Argamon, Dagan &amp; Krymolowski (1998), Daelemans, van den Bosch &amp; Zavrel (1999) and Tjong Kim Sang &amp; Veenstra (1999) used memory-based systems; Ramshaw &amp; Marcus (1999) and Cardie &amp; Pierce (1998) used rule-based systems, Munoz et al. (1999) used a Winnow
