most events was selected as the protagonist.
    For this evaluation, we only look at verbs.
    All verb clauses involving the protagonist are manually extracted and translated into the narrative events (verb,dependency).
    Exceptions that are not included are verbs in headlines, quotations (typically not part of a narrative), &#8220;be&#8221; properties (e.g. john is happy), modifying verbs (e.g. hurried to leave, only leave is used), and multiple instances of one event.
    The original test set included 100 documents, but those without a narrative chain at least five events in length were removed, leaving 69 documents.
    Most of the removed documents were not stories, but genres such as interviews and cooking recipes.
    An example of an extracted chain is shown in figure 2.
    We evalute with Narrative Cloze using leave-oneout cross validation, removing one event and using the rest to generate a ranked list of guesses.
    The test dataset produces 740 cloze tests (69 narratives with 740 events).
