number of patterns for i extracted from the Susanne corpus divided by the total number of patterns.
    So, p(v -i), the probability of verb v not of class i occurring with a pattern for class i is: -i) = (1 Ipatterns_f or_i n! n, p) = mi(p im The probability of the event happening m or more times is: n,p) = i=m -i)) the probability that m or more occurrences of patterns for i will occur with a verb which is not a member of i, given n occurrences of that verb.
    Setting a threshold of less than or equal to 0.05 yields a 95% or better confidence that a high enough proportion of patterns for i have observed for the verb to be in class 2.3 Discussion Our approach to acquiring subcategorization classes is predicated on the following assumptions: &#8226; most sentences will not allow the application of all possible rules of English complementation; &#8226; some sentences will be unambiguous even given indeterminacy of the (1993:249-253) provides a detailed explanation and justification for the use of this measur
