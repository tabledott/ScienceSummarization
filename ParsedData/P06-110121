hus the resulting change in the set of implied links given by the correct &#8220;carrier&#8221; sense of airline is much higher than that of the &#8220;hose&#8221; sense.
    In fact it is the largest of all the 99 considered hypernym links for continental; H1(continental, airline#n#2) is link #18,736 added to the taxonomy by our algorithm.
  
  
    In order to evaluate our framework for taxonomy induction, we have applied hyponym acquisition to construct several distinct taxonomies, starting with the base of WordNet 2.1 and only adding novel noun hyponyms.
    Further, we have constructed taxonomies using a baseline algorithm, which uses the identical hypernym and coordinate classifiers used in our joint algorithm, but which does not combine the evidence of the classifiers.
    In section 4.1 we describe our evaluation methodology; in sections 4.2 and 4.3 we analyze the fine-grained precision and disambiguation precision of our algorithm compared to the baseline; in section 4.4 we compare the coarse-grained
