 T1 &gt; 4, the average durations are .72 (a =- .67) and .39 (a = 1.64), respectively.
    As will be seen in Section 4.3.2, this correlation does not translate into any high-performing algorithm based primarily on pause duration.
    Inferential link due to implicit argument. errors correlated with one of two kinds of the information used in the NP algorithm: identification of clauses (FICUs) and of inferential links.
    The redefinition of FICU motivated by error analysis led to fewer clauses.
    For example, FICU assignment depends in part on filtering out clausal interjections, utterances that have the syntactic form of clauses but that function as interjections.
    These include phrases like let's see, let me see, I don't know when they occur with no overt or implied verb phrase argument.
    The extensional definition of clausal interjections was expanded, thus certain utterances were no longer classed as FICUs under the revised coding.
    Other changes to the definition of FICUs pertained to senten
