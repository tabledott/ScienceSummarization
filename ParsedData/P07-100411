.
    These K sampled translations and their associated source sentences make up the additional training data Ti.
    Selection using a Threshold: This method compares the score of each single-best translation to a threshold.
    The translation is considered reliable and added to the set Ti if its score exceeds the threshold.
    Else it is discarded and not used in the additional training data.
    The threshold is optimized on the development beforehand.
    Since the scores of the translations change in each iteration, the size of Ti also changes.
    Keep All: This method does not perform any filtering at all.
    It is simply assumed that all translations in the set Xi are reliable, and none of them are discarded.
    Thus, in each iteration, the result of the selection step will be Ti = Xi.
    This method was implemented mainly for comparison with other selection methods.
    3.5 Filtering the Training Data In general, having more training data improves the quality of the trained models.
    However,
