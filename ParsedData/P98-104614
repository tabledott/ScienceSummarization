hich is also a hypernym for other carry verbs not in the intersection.

    The fact that the split sense for these verbs does not appear explicitly in WordNet is not surprising since it is only an extended sense of the verbs, and separation is inferred only when the verb occurs with an appropriate adjunct, such as apart.
