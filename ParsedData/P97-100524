selects the most discriminating cues.
    A dash indicates that an experiment was not run.
    Note.
    Numbers are the percentage of the evaluation subcorpus (N = 97) which was correctly classified on a binary discrimination task.
    The Baseline column tells what percentage would be got correct by guessing No for each level.
    Headers have the same meaning as in Table 1.
    * means significantly better than Baseline at p &lt; .05, using a binomial distribution (N=97, p as per first column).
    Note.
    Numbers are the percentage of the texts actually belonging to the GENRE level indicated in the first column that were classified as belonging to each of the GENRE levels indicated in the column headers.
    Thus the diagonals are correct guesses, and each row would sum to 100%, but for rounding error. and better in 8 cases.
    Such a result is expected if we assume that either cue representation is equally likely to do better than the other (assuming a binomial model, the probability of getting this o
