 hypothesis that has tile minimal connective cost (i.e.
  bigram-ba~sed cost) as derived by certain criteria.
  qo handle unknown words, most Japanese morpho- logical analyzers u,~e character type heuristics [17], which is "a string of the same character type is likely to constitute a word".
  There is one stochastic approach that uses bigram of word formation unit [13].
  tlowever, it does not learn probabilities from training texts, but learns them fiom machine readable dictionaries, and the model is not incorporated in working morphologi- cal analyzers, as fitr as the author knows.
  The unique features of the proposed Japanese mor- phological analyzer is that it can find tile exact N most likely hyl)otheses using part of speech trigram, and it can handle unlmown words using character trigram.
  The algoril.hm can naturally be extended to handle any higher order Markov models.
  Moreover, it can nat- nrally be extended to handle lattice-style input that is often used as t.he output of speech recognition an
