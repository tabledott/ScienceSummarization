uide features with part-of-speech features.
    These features are implicitly added through the polynomial kernel used to train the SVM.
  
  
    In this section, we present an experimental evaluation of the two guided models based on data from the CoNLL-X shared task, followed by a comparative error analysis including both the base models and the guided models.
    The data for the experiments are training and test sets for all thirteen languages from the CoNLL-X shared task on multilingual dependency parsing with training sets ranging in size from from 29,000 tokens (Slovene) to 1,249,000 tokens (Czech).
    The test sets are all standardized to about 5,000 tokens each.
    For more information on the data sets, see Buchholz and Marsi (2006).
    The guided models were trained according to the scheme explained in section 3, with two-fold crossvalidation when parsing the training data with the guide parsers.
    Preliminary experiments suggested that cross-validation with more folds had a negligible impact
