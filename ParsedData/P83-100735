ng a definite description D may be used to express on different occasions of use.
    When D is used referentially, it contributes its denotation to the proposition expressed by S; when it is used attributively, it contributes to the proposition expressed by S a semantic interpretation related to the descriptive content of D. The identity of this semantic interpretation is not something about which Donnellan is explicit.
    Distinct formal treatments of the semantics of definite descriptions in natural language would construe the appropriate interpretation differently.
    In semantic treatments based on possible worlds, the appropriate interpretation would be a (partial) function from possible worlds to objects; in the situation semantics expounded by Barwise and Perry, the appropriate interpretation is a (partial) function from resource situations5 to objects.
    As just described, the referential-attributive distinction appears to be exactly the distinction that Barwise and Perry formulate in terms of th
