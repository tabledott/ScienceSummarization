in English.
    Step 3: Determine the merge/deletion analysis of the prefixes/suffixes in Group II as follows: If prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk occurs in more than one stemtagA context, and its translation probability into NULL tag is the highest, delete the prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk in the stemtagA context.
    If prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk occurs in more than one stemtagA context, and its translation Baseline performances are obtained by Model 1 training and decoding without any segmentation or morphological analysis on Arabic.
    BLEU scores under &#8216;morph analysis&#8217; is obtained by Model 1 training on Arabic morphologically analyzed and English symboltokenized parallel corpus and Model 1 decoding on the Arabic morphologically analyzed input text.5 Impact of Arabic morphological analysis on a phrase translation model with monotone decoding (Tillmann 2003), is shown in Table 3.
    BLEU scores under baseline and morph analysis are obtained in a manner analogous to Model 1 except that the morpholog
