s (Ney 1992), as well as in non&#8212;finite-state acoustic and phonotactic modeling (Lani and Young 1991).
    In some work, context-free grammars are combined with scoring functions that are not strictly probabilistic (Nakagawa 1987), or they are used with context-sensitive and/or semantic probabilities (Magerman and Marcus 1991; Magerman and Weir 1992; Jones and Eisner 1992; Briscoe and Carroll 1993).
    Although clearly not a perfect model of natural language, stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) are superior to nonprobabilistic CFGs, with probability theory providing a sound theoretical basis for ranking and pruning of parses, as well as for integration with models for nonsyntactic aspects of language.
    All of the applications listed above involve (or could potentially make use of) one or more of the following standard tasks, compiled by Jelinek and Lafferty (1991)) The algorithm described in this article can compute solutions to all four of these problems in a single framework, with a number of
