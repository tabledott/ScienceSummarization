			Conversely, we see that Model 2 outper forms Model 1 with the larger label set B, which is consistent with the hypothesis that part-of-speech features become redundant as dependency labels get more informative.
			It is interesting to note that this effect holds even in the case where the dependencylabels are mostly derived from phrase structure cate gories.
			We can also see that the unlabeled attachment score improves, for both models, when the set of dependency labels is extended.
			On the other hand, the labeled attachment score drops, but it must beremembered that these scores are not really comparable, since the number of classes in the classifi cation problem increases from 7 to 50 as we move from the G set to the B set.
			Therefore, we have also included the labeled attachment score restricted to the G set for the parser using the B set (BG), and wesee then that the attachment score improves, espe cially for Model 2.
			(All differences are significant beyond the .01 level; McNemar?s test.)
