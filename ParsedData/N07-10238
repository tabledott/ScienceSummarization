ses (PP), which may be either complement or adjunct.
    As in the case of Figure 1 (in which adjuncts appear in italic), knowing that the PP headed by &#8220;from&#8221; appears in a VP headed by &#8220;fell&#8221; helps us to determine that the PP is a complement to the verb &#8220;fell&#8221;, and that it should presumably not be deleted.
    Conversely, the PP headed by &#8220;because&#8221; modifying the same verb is an adjunct, and can safely be deleted if unimportant.3 Also, as discussed in (Klein and Manning, 2003), POS annotation can be useful as a means of backing off to more frequently occurring head-modifier POS occurrences (e.g., VBD-IN) when specific bilexical cooccurrences are sparsely seen (e.g., &#8220;fell&#8221;-&#8220;from&#8221;).
    At a lower level, lexicalization is clearly desirable for pre-terminals.
    Indeed, current SCFG models such as K&amp;M have no direct way of preventing highly improbable single word removals, such as deletions of adverbs &#8220;never&#8221; or &#8220;nowhe
