me complexity results, we feel that some of them might be improved.
  It is possible to express the parsing problem in a de- cidable deduction system on trees (similar to Lambeks deduction system on categories (1958 and 1961)).
  The grammar can be thought as a five-tuple (VN, ~, O, S, Lex) where: ?
  VN is a finite set of non-terminal symbols, ?
  ~ is a finite set of alphabet symbols, ?
  O is the set of trees constructed with P,* and VN (the elements of Z* having ranked 0).
  Lex is the lexicon , i.e.
  a function from lexical items to finite subsets of O: P?
  --+ 2?(finite).
  A sequent is defined to be of the form: Vl,.. -, rn ~ A, where ri E O and A E VN Two inference rules combine two trees of the left hand side to form a new one.
  One inference rule corresponds to adjunction of two trees, and the other to substitution of a node in one tree by the other tree.
  Once two trees are combined, they are replaced by the resulting tree in the left hand side of the seouent.
  This facts takes into account th
