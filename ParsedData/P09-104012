rojectivity is not a property of a dependency tree in itself, but of the tree in combination with a word order, and that a tree can always be made projective by reordering the nodes.
    For instance, let x be a sentence with dependency tree G = (Vx, A), and let &lt;G be the total order on Vx defined by an inorder traversal of G that respects the local ordering of a node and its children given by the original word order.
    Regardless of whether G is projective with respect to x, it must by necessity be projective with respect to &lt;G.
    We call &lt;G the projective order corresponding to x and G and use it as our canonical way of finding a node order that makes the tree projective.
    By way of illustration, the projective order for the sentence and tree in Figure 1 is: A1 &lt;G hearing2 &lt;G on5 &lt;G the6 &lt;G issue7 &lt;G is3 &lt;G scheduled4 &lt;G today8 &lt;G .9.
    If the words of a sentence x with dependency tree G are already in projective order, this means that G is projective with respect t
