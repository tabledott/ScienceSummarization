tion In a more subtle version of the mixture-of-unigrams model, we model each author as an admixture of regions.
    Thus, the latent variable attached to each author is no longer an index, but rather a vector on the simplex.
    This model is equivalent to supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007): each topic is associated with equivariant Gaussian distributions over the latitude and longitude, and these topics must explain both the text and the observed geographical locations.
    For unlabeled authors, we estimate latitude and longitude by estimating the topic proportions and then applying the learned geographical distributions.
    This is a linear prediction f(2d; a) = (&#65533;zTd alat, 2Td alon) for an author&#8217;s topic proportions zd and topicgeography weights a E R2K.
    Text Regression We perform linear regression to discriminatively learn the relationship between words and locations.
    Using term frequency features xd for each author, we predict locations with wordgeog
