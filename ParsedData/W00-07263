e the details of their conversion algorithm, results may differ in difficult cases, e.g. involving NAC and NX.1 An ADJP constituent inside an NP constituent becomes part of the NP chunk: (NP The (ADJP most volatile) form) [NP the most volatile form] In the Treebank, verb phrases are highly embedded; see e.g. the following sentence which contains four VP constituents.
    Following Ramshaw and Marcus' V-type chunks, this sentence will only contain one VP chunk: ((S (NP-SBJ-3 Mr. Icahn) (VP may not (VP want (S (NP-SBJ *-3) (VP to (VP sell ...))))) . ))
    [NP Mr. Icahn] [vp may not want to sell] It is still possible however to have one VP chunk directly follow another: [NP The impression [NP I] [vp have got] [vp is] [NP they] [vp 'd love to do] [PRT away] [pp with] [NP it].
    In this case the two VP constituents did not overlap in the Treebank.
    Adverbs/adverbial phrases become part of the VP chunk (as long as they are in front of the main verb): (VP could (ADVP very well) (VP show ... )) [vp could very w
