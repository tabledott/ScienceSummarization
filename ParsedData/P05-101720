(2004) on this network, because the shortestpath method cannot incorporate negative links of antonyms.
    We also restrict the test data to 697 adjectives, which is the number of examples that the shortest-path method can assign a non-zero orientation value.
    Since the shortest-path method is designed for 2 seed words, the method is extended to use the average shortest-path lengths for 4 seed words and 14 seed words.
    Table 3 shows the result.
    Since the only difference is their algorithms, we can conclude that the global optimization of the spin model works well for the semantic orientation extraction.
    We next compare the proposed method with a simple bootstrapping method proposed by Hu and Liu (2004).
    We construct a lexical network using synonyms and antonyms.
    We restrict the test data to 1470 adjectives for comparison of methods.
    The result in Table 4 also shows that the global optimization of the spin model works well for the semantic orientation extraction.
    We investigated a
