g to their weights.
    The &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; tree for text (3) has weight 3 and is fully represented in figure 3.
    The PostScript file corresponding to figure 3 was automatically generated by a back-end algorithm that uses &amp;quot;dot&amp;quot;, a preprocessor for drawing directed graphs.
    The convention that we use is that nuclei are surrounded by solid boxes and satellites by dotted boxes; the links between a node and the subordinate nucleus or nuclei are represented by solid arrows, and the links between a node and the subordinate satellites by dotted lines.
    The occurrences of parenthetical information are marked in the text by a &#8212;P&#8212; and a unique subordinate satellite that contains the parenthetical information.
    We believe that there are two ways to evaluate the correctness of the discourse trees that an automatic process builds.
    One way is to compare the automatically derived trees with trees that have been built manually.
    Another way is to evaluate the impact t
