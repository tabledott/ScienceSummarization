graphers), and a new sense inventory used for verb entries (Wordsmyth).
    2 Building a Sense Tagged Corpus with Volunteer Contributions over the Web The sense annotated corpus required for this task was built using the Open Mind Word Expert system (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002) 1.
    To overcome the current lack of sense tagged data and the limitations imposed by the creation of such data using trained lexicographers, the OMWE system enables the collection of semantically annotated corpora over the Web.
    Sense tagged examples are collected using a Web-based application that allows contributors to annotate words with their meanings.
    The tagging exercise proceeds as follows.
    For each target word the system extracts a set of sentences from a large textual corpus.
    These examples are presented to the contributors, who are asked to select the most appropriate sense for the target word in each sentence.
    The selection is made using checkboxes, which list all possible senses of the current target
