not differ significantly on this test set.
    In interpreting these results one must realize, however, that WER results depend on a complex combination of factors, most notably interaction between language models and the acoustic models.
    Since the experiments only varied the language models used in rescoring, it is also informative to compare the quality of these models as reflected by perplexity.
    On this measure, we see a substantial 13% (relative) reduction, which is achieved by both the oracle and the mixture-of-LMs.
    The perplexity reduction for the 1-best LM is only 9.8%, showing the advantage of the mixture approach.
    To better understand the lack of a more substantial reduction in word error, we analyzed the effect of the DA-conditioned rescoring on the individual DAs, i.e., grouping the test utterances by their true DA types.
    Table 12 shows the WER improvements for a few DA types, ordered by the magnitude of improvement achieved.
    As shown, all frequent DA types saw improvement,
