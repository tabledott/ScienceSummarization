nt, backchannel, and other.1 We used spurt segmentation as our unit of analysis instead of sentence segmentation, because our ultimate goal is to build a system that can be fully automated, and in that respect, spurt segmentation is easy to obtain.
    Backchannels (e.g.
    &#8220;uhhuh&#8221; and &#8220;okay&#8221;) were treated as a separate category, since they are generally used by listeners to indicate they are following along, while not necessarily indicating agreement.
    The proportion of classes is the following: 11.9% are agreements, 6.8% are disagreements, 23.2% are backchannels, and 58.1% are others.
    Inter-labeler reliability estimated on 500 spurts with 2 labelers was considered quite acceptable, since the kappa coefficient was .63 (Cohen, 1960).
  
  
    Adjacency pairs (AP) are considered fundamental units of conversational organization (Schegloff and Sacks, 1973).
    Their identification is central to our problem, since we need to know the identity of addressees in agreements and disag
