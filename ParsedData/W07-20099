d the Mode scores give credit where the mode was found in one of the system?s 10 guesses.
			P = ? ai:i?A ? res?ai freqres |Hi| |A| (5) R = ? ai:i?T ? res?ai freqres |Hi| |T | (6) Mode P = ? ai:i?AM 1 if any guess ? ai = mi |AM | (7) Mode R = ? ai:i?TM 1 if any guess ? ai = mi |TM | (8) mw measures For this measure, a system must identify items where the target is part of a multiword and what the multiword is. The annotators do not all have linguistics background, they are simply asked if the target is an integral part of a phrase, and if so what the phrase is. Sometimes this option is usedby the subjects for paraphrasing a phrase of the sentence, but typically it is used when there is a mul tiword.
			For scoring, a multiword item is one with a majority vote for the same multiword with more than 1 annotator identifying the multiword.
			Let MW be the subset of T for which there is such a multiword response from a majority of at least 2 annotators.
			Let mwi ? MW be the multiword identified by majority vote
