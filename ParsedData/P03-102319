    Here the recall means the correct resolved chains over the whole coreferential chains in the data set, and precision means the correct resolved chains over the whole resolved chains.
    In line with the previous experiments, we see reasonable improvement in the performance of the coreference resolution: compared with the baseline approach based on the single-candidate model, the F-measure of approach increases from 69.4 to 71.3 for MUC-6, and from 58.7 to 60.2 for MUC-7.
  
  
    A similar twin-candidate model was adopted in the anaphoric resolution system by Connolly et al. (1997).
    The differences between our approach and theirs are: (1) In Connolly et al.&#8217;s approach, all the preceding NPs of an anaphor are taken as the antecedent candidates, whereas in our approach we use candidate filters to eliminate invalid or irrelevant candidates.
    (2) The antecedent identification in Connolly et al.&#8217;s approach is to apply the classifier to successive pairs of candidates, each time r
