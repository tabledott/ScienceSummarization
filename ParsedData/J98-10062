nerally applicable to new texts, domains, and corpora without needing costly and perhaps error-prone parsing or semantic analysis.
    They require only training corpora in which the sense distinctions have been marked, but therein lies their weakness.
    Obtaining training materials for statistical methods is costly and timeconsuming&#8212;it is a &amp;quot;knowledge acquisition bottleneck&amp;quot; (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992a).
    To open this bottleneck, we use WordNet's lexical relations to locate unsupervised training examples.
    Section 2 describes a statistical classifier, TLC (Topical/Local Classifier), that uses topical context (the open-class words that co-occur with a particular sense), local context (the open- and closed-class items that occur within a small window around a word), or a combination of the two.
    The results of combining the two types of context to disambiguate a noun (line), a verb (serve), and an adjective (hard) are presented.
    The following questions are discussed
