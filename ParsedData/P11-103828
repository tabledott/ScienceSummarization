ect ill-formed word detection, as for the SMS data.
    From Table 3, we see that the general performance of our proposed method on Twitter is better than that on SMS.
    To better understand this trend, we examined the annotations in the SMS corpus, and found them to be looser than ours, because they have different task specifications than our lexical normalisation.
    In our annotation, the annotators only normalised ill-formed word if they had high confidence of how to normalise, as with talkin &#8220;talking&#8221;.
    For ill-formed words where they couldn&#8217;t be certain of the standard form, the tokens were left untouched.
    However, in the SMS corpus, annotations such as sammis &#8220;same&#8221; are also included.
    This leads to a performance drop for our method over the SMS corpus.
    The noisy channel method of Cook and Stevenson (2009) shares similar features with word similarity (&#8220;WS&#8221;), However, when word similarity and context support are combined (&#8220;WS+CS&#8221;), o
