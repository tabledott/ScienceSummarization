rry out experiments on the standard data set of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994).
    Following (Ratnaparkhi,1996; Collins, 2002; Toutanova et al., 2003; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005), we cut the PTB into the training, development and test sets as shown in Table 1.
    We use tools provided by CoNLL-2005 3 to extract POS tags from the mrg files of PTB.
    So the data set is the same as previous work.
    We use the development set to select features and estimate the number of iterations in training.
    In our experiments, we enumerate all the POS tags for each word instead of using a dictionary as in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), since the size of the tag set is tractable and our learning algorithm is efficient enough.
  
  
    Effect of Features: We first run the experiments to evaluate the effect of features.
    We use templates to define features.
    For this set of experiments, we set the beam width B = 3 as a balance between speed and accuracy.
    The guided learning algorithm usually converges on
