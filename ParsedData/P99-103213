as-corrected tag in many cases, but arguing for his or her own tag in some cases.
    Based on the judges' feedback, 22 of the 504 bias-corrected tags are changed, and a second draft of the coding manual is written.
    5.
    A second corpus is annotated by the same four judges according to the new coding manual.
    Each spends about five hours.
    6.
    The results of the second tagging experiment are analyzed using the methods described in section 3, and bias-corrected tags are produced for the second data set.
    Two disjoint corpora are used in steps 2 and 5, both consisting of complete articles taken from the Wall Street Journal Treebank Corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).
    In both corpora, judges assign tags to each non-compound sentence and to each conjunct of each compound sentence, 504 in the first corpus and 500 in the second.
    The segmentation of compound sentences was performed manually before the judges received the data.
