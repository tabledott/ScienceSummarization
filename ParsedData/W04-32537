hrases have been extracted from the text, each one is assigned an SO value.
    The SO of a phrase is determined based upon the phrase&#8217;s pointwise mutual information (PMI) with the words &#8220;excellent&#8221; and &#8220;poor&#8221;.
    PMI is defined by Church and Hanks (1989) as follows: where is the probability that and co-occur.
    The SO for a is the difference between its PMI with the word &#8220;excellent&#8221; and its PMI with the word &#8220;poor.&#8221; The probabilities are estimated by querying the AltaVista Advanced Search engine1 for counts.
    The search engine&#8217;s &#8220;NEAR&#8221; operator, representing occurrences of the two queried words within ten words of each other in a text, is used to define co-occurrence.
    The final SO equation is Intuitively, this yields values above zero for phrases with greater PMI with the word &#8220;excellent&#8221; and below zero for greater PMI with &#8220;poor&#8221;.
    A SO value of zero would indicate a completely neutral semantic orien
