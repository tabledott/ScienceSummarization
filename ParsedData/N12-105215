 robustly available across languages.
    The approach proposed by McDonald et al. (2011) relies on these three assumptions.
    Specifically, by replacing fine-grained language specific part-of-speech tags with universal part-of-speech tags, generated with the method described by Das and Petrov (2011), a universal parser is achieved that can be applied to any language for which universal part-of-speech tags are available.
    Below, we extend this approach to universal parsing by adding cross-lingual word cluster features.
    A cross-lingual word clustering is a clustering of words in two languages, in which the clusters correspond to some meaningful cross-lingual property.
    For example, prepositions from both languages should be in the same cluster, proper names from both languages in another cluster and so on.
    By adding features defined over these clusters, we can, to some degree, re-lexicalize the delexicalized models, while maintaining the &#8220;universality&#8221; of the features.
