ervening punctuation is generated conditioning on the parent, the head, and the right conjunct, including the headwords of the two conjoined phrases, and the intervening CC is similarly generated.
    A simplified version of the probability of generating all these children is summarized as follows: The idea is that using the chain rule, the generation of two conjuncts and that which conjoins them is estimated as one large joint event.20 This scheme of using flags to trigger the Ppun, and PCC parameters is problematic, at least from a theoretical standpoint, as it causes the model to be inconsistent.
    Figure 10 shows three different trees that would all receive the same probability from Collins&#8217; model.
    The problem is that coordinating conjunctions and punctuation are not generated as first-class words, but only as triggered from these punc and coord flags, meaning that the number of such intervening conjunctive items (and the order in which they are to be generated) is not specified.
    So for a
