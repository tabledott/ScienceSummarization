	A Monolingual Tree-based Translation Model for Sentence Simplification
		In this paper, we consider sentence sim plification as a special form of translation with the complex sentence as the source and the simple sentence as the target.
		We propose a Tree-based Simplification Model (TSM), which, to our knowledge, is the first statistical simplification model covering splitting, dropping, reorderingand substitution integrally.
		We also de scribe an efficient method to train our model with a large-scale parallel dataset obtained from the Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia.
		The evaluation shows that our model achieves better readability scores than a set of baseline systems.
	
	
			Sentence simplification transforms long and dif ficult sentences into shorter and more readable ones.
			This helps humans read texts more easilyand faster.
			Reading assistance is thus an important application of sentence simplification, espe cially for people with reading disabilities (Carrollet al, 1999; Inui et al, 2003), low-l
