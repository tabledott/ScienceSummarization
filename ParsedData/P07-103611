    When the constraints are hard, the solution is given by from citations and advertisements.
    Some constraints (represented in the first block of each domain) are global and are relatively difficult to inject into traditional models.
    While all the constraints hold for the vast majority of the data, some of them are violated by some correct labeled assignments. where 1C(x) is a subset of Y for which all Ci assign the value 1 for the given (x, y).
    When the constraints are soft, we want to incur some penalty for their violation.
    Moreover, we want to incorporate into our cost function a measure for the amount of violation incurred by violating the constraint.
    A generic way to capture this intuition is to introduce a distance function d(y, 1Ci(x)) between the space of outputs that respect the constraint,1Ci(x), and the given output sequence y.
    One possible way to implement this distance function is as the minimal Hamming distance to a sequence that respects the constraint Ci, that
