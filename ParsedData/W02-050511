 typically longer than their Arabic equivalents for many reasons.
    First, because Arabic short vowels are not written and need to be &amp;quot;guessed&amp;quot; by the model.
    Second, English names often have silent letters that mostly are not reflected in the Arabic equivalent (e.g., Knight is transliterated as uclyt&amp;quot; ).
    This phenomenon was also reflected in the learned model.
    Here is an example of some of the parameters learned during training: Here are some examples of the letter sequence alignments for pairs of Arabic name/top transliteration as provided by our system.
    Example I: Given the name &amp;quot;r Luc sdam,&amp;quot; its top transliteration was SADDAM, and the letter sequence alignment was: 6To reduce the parameters to be estimated and prevent data sparseness without loss of any practical modeling power, English letter sequences were restricted to a maximum of 3 letters, while Arabic ones were restricted to a maximum of 2 letters.
    Example III: Given the name &amp;qu
