  A Latent Variable Model for Geographic Lexical Variation
  
    The rapid growth of geotagged social media raises new computational possibilities for investigating geographic linguistic variation.
    In this paper, we present a multi-level generative model that reasons jointly about latent topics and geographical regions.
    High-level topics such as &#8220;sports&#8221; or &#8220;entertainment&#8221; are rendered differently in each geographic region, revealing topic-specific regional distinctions.
    Applied to a new dataset of geotagged microblogs, our model recovers coherent topics and their regional variants, while identifying geographic areas of linguistic consistency.
    The model also enables prediction of an author&#8217;s geographic location from raw text, outperforming both text regression and supervised topic models.
  
  
    Sociolinguistics and dialectology study how language varies across social and regional contexts.
