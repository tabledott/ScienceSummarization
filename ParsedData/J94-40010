  A Syntactic Analysis Method Of Long Japanese Sentences Based On The Detection Of Conjunctive Structures
  
    This paper presents a syntactic analysis method that first detects conjunctive structures in a sentence by checking parallelism of two series of words and then analyzes the dependency structure of the sentence with the help of the information about the conjunctive structures.
    Analysis of long sentences is one of the most difficult problems in natural language processing.
    The main reason for this difficulty is the structural ambiguity that is common for conjunctive structures that appear in long sentences.
    Human beings can recognize conjunctive structures because of a certain, but sometimes subtle, similarity that exists between conjuncts.
    Therefore, we have developed an algorithm for calculating a similarity measure between two arbitrary series of words from the left and the right of a conjunction and selecting the two most similar series of words that can reasonably be considered
