etc.) are attractive because the provide structures with well-defined an( coherent properties, but a single one of thes1 - 272 levels does not contain all the information needed for adequate translation.
    The D-structure level of Government-Binding theory, for example, contains information about the predicate-argument relations of a clause but says nothing about the surface constituent order that is necessary to accurately distinguish between old and new information or topic and comment.
    As another example, the functional structures of Lexical-Functional Grammar do not contain the ordering information necessary to determine the scope of quantifiers or other operators.
    Our proposal, as it is set forth below, allows us to state simultaneous correspondences between several levels of source-target representations, and thus is neither interlingual nor transfer-based.
    We can achieve modularity of linguistic specifications, by not requiring conceptually different kinds of linguistic information to be
