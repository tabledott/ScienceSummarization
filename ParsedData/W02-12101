 of robustness.
    Robustness requires not only wide coverage by the grammar (in both syntax and semantics), but also large and extensible lexica as well as interfaces to preprocessing systems for named entity recognition, non-linguistic structures such as addresses, etc.
    Furthermore, applications built on deep NLP technology should be extensible to multiple languages.
    This requires flexible yet well-defined output structures that can be adapted to grammars of many different languages.
    Finally, for use in real-world applications, NLP systems meeting the above desiderata must also be efficient.
    In this paper, we describe the development of a broad coverage grammar for Japanese that is used in an automatic email response application.
    The grammar is based on work done in the Verbmobil project (Siegel 2000) on machine translation of spoken dialogues in the domain of travel planning.
    It has since been greatly extended to accommodate written Japanese and new domains.
    The grammar is couc
