ained optimization problem below by letting Ak = A+k &#8722; A&#8722;k : At the optimal point, the following Karush-KuhunTucker conditions satisfy: A+k &#183; [C &#183; (Ok &#8722; Ek) &#8722; 1/2] = 0, A&#8722;k &#183; [C &#183; (Ek &#8722; Ok) &#8722; 1/2] = 0, and |C &#183; (Ok &#8722; Ek) |&lt; 1/2.
    These conditions mean that both A+k and A&#8722;k are set to be 0 (i.e., Ak = 0), when |C &#183; (Ok &#8722; Ek) |&lt; 1/2.
    A non-zero weight is assigned to Ak, only when |C &#183; (Ok &#8722; Ek) |= 1/2.
    L2-CRFs, in contrast, give the optimal solution when &#948;L&#923; &#948;&#955;k = C &#183; (Ok &#8722; Ek) &#8722; Ak = 0.
    Omitting the proof, (Ok &#8722; Ek) =&#65533; 0 can be shown and L2-CRFs thus give a non-sparse solution where all Ak have non-zero weights.
    The relationship between two reguralizations have been studied in Machine Learning community.
    (Perkins et al., 2003) reported that L1-regularizer should be chosen for a problem where most of given features are irrelevant.
