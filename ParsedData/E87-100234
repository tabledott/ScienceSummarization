    The term two-level morphology, however, is used in a more restricted way, to apply to a system in which no intermediate forms are posited, even in the original grammatical formalism.
    The writer of a grammar using a two-level formalism never needs to think in terms of any representations other than the lexical and the surface ones.
    What he does is to specify, using one formalism or another, a set of transducers, each of which mediates directly between these forms and each of which restricts the allowable pairs of strings in some way.
    The pairs that the system as a whole accepts are those are those that are rejected by none of the component transducers, modulo certain assumptions about the precise way in which they interact, whose details need not concern us.
    Once again, there is a formal procedure that can be used to combine the set of transducers that make up such a system into a single automaton with the same overall behavior, so that the final result is indistinguishable
