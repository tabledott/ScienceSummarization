 affect the accuracy.
    However, if each of them was removed together with another feature, the accuracy decreased drastically.
    This implies that such features had overlapping information.
    Table 7 shows the manual classification of the causes of errors in 100 sentences randomly chosen from the development set.
    In our evaluation, one error source may cause multiple errors of dependencies.
    For example, if a wrong lexical entry was assigned to a verb, all the argument dependencies of the verb are counted as errors.
    The numbers in the table include such double-counting.
    Major causes were classified into three types: argument/modifier distinction, attachment ambiguity, and lexical ambiguity.
    While attachment/lexical ambiguities are well-known causes, the other is peculiar to deep parsing.
    Most of the errors cannot be resolved by features we investigated in this study, and the design of other features is crucial for further improvements.
