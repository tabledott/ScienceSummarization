th the best choice of hyperparameters (&#945; = .003, Q = 1), we achieve average tagging accuracy of 86.8%.
    This far surpasses the MLHMM performance of 74.5%, and is closer to the 90.1% accuracy of CRF/CE on the same data set using oracle parameter selection.
    The effects of &#945;, which determines the probabil2Results of CRF/CE depend on the set of features used and the contrast neighborhood.
    In all cases, we list the best score reported for any contrast neighborhood using trigram (but no spelling) features.
    To ensure proper comparison, all corpora used in our experiments consist of the same randomized sets of sentences used by Smith and Eisner.
    Note that training on sets of contiguous sentences from the beginning of the treebank consistently improves our results, often by 1-2 percentage points or more.
    MLHMM scores show less difference between randomized and contiguous corpora.
