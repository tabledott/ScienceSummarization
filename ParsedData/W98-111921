rences that we observe for a given referent is the result of our supposed &amp;quot;hypothesis about pronoun reference&amp;quot; - that is, the pronoun reference strategy we have provisionally adopted in order to gather statistics or whether the result of some other unidentified process.
    This decision is made by ranking the referents by log-likelihood ratio, termed salience, for each referent.
    The likelihood ratio is adapted from Dunning (1993, page 66) and uses the raw frequencies of each pronoun class in the corpus as the null hypothesis, Pr(gc01) as well as Pr(ref E gci) from equation 9.
    HP(ref E gC;)1 ref gc&#9632; Making the unrealistic simplifying assumption that references of one gender class are completely independent of references for another classes', the likelihood function in this case is just the product over all classes of the probabilities of each class of reference to the power of the number of observations of this class.
