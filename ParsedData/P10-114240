ave a large impact on the performance of a resolver (Barbu and Mitkov, 2001).
    Worse still, assumptions about whether gold or automatically extracted NPs are used are sometimes not explicitly stated, potentially causing results to be interpreted incorrectly.
    To our knowledge, however, the best results on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets using automatically extracted NPs are reported by Yang et al. (2003) (71.3 MUC F-score) and Ng and Cardie (2002c) (63.4 MUC F-score), respectively;8 and the best results on the ACE data sets using gold NPs can be found in Luo (2007) (88.4 ACE-value).
    Second, what lessons can we learn from fifteen years of learning-based coreference research?
    The mention-pair model is weak because it makes coreference decisions based on local information (i.e., information extracted from two NPs).
    Expressive models (e.g., those that can exploit cluster-level features) generally offer better performance, and so are models that are &#8220;global&#8221; in nature.
