D (SENSEVAL), in the spirit of previous evaluation efforts such as the ARPA-sponsored Message Understanding Conferences (e.g., ARPA [1993]), and Text Retrieval Conferences (e.g.
    Harman [1993, 1995]).
    SENSEVAL will see its first results at a subsequent SIGLEX workshop to be held at Herstmonceux Castle, England in September, 1998.
    As noted above, WSD is not an end in itself but rather an &amp;quot;intermediate task&amp;quot; that contributes to an overall task such as information retrieval or machine translation.
    This opens the possibility of two types of evaluation for WSD work (using terminology borrowed from biology): in vitro evaluation, where WSD systems are tested independent of a given application, using specially constructed benchmarks; and evaluation in vivo, where, rather than being evaluated in isolation, results are evaluated in terms of their contribution to the overall performance of a system designed for a particular application, such as machine translation.
