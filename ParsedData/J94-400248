made, display is not realized in the second sentence, and so Cb(Un) is status, which is then the highest ranked element of Cf (Un_i) that is realized in Un, as required by constraint 3 of the Brennan et al. centering algorithm.
    In general, we agree with Alshawi (1987, p. 62) that an algorithm/model relying on the relative salience of all entities evoked by a text, with a mechanism for removing or filtering entities whose salience falls below a threshold, is preferable to models that &amp;quot;make assumptions about a single (if shifting) focus of attention.&amp;quot;' This approach seeks to combine a variety of syntactic, semantic, and discourse factors into a multi-dimensional metric for ranking antecedent candidates.
