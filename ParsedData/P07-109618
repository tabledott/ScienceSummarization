    As shown in Section 4.2, even deterministic inference shows rather good results.
    Our guided learning can be modeled as a search algorithm with Perceptron like learning (Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2005).
    However, as far as we know, the mechanism of bidirectional search with an online learning algorithm has not been investigated before.
    In (Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2005), as well as other similar works (Collins, 2002; Collins and Roark, 2004; Shen and Joshi, 2005), only left-toright search was employed.
    Our guided learning algorithm provides more flexibility in search with an automatically learned order.
    In addition, our treatment of the score of action and the score of hypothesis is unique (see discussion in Section 2.3).
    Furthermore, compared to the above works, our guided learning algorithm is more aggressive on learning.
    In (Collins and Roark, 2004; Shen and Joshi, 2005), a search stops if there is no hypothesis compatible with the gold standard in the queue of candi
