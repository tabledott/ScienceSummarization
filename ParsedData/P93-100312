ses would perhaps be &amp;quot;part in the factory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;part out of the factory&amp;quot;.
    Considered as a translation, this is lame.
    The majority of errors that occur are not the result of incorrect tagging or noun phrase recognition, but are the result of the approximate nature of the correspondence model.
    The correspondences in Table 4 are likewise flawed (in the table, &amp;quot;souris&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;mouse&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tigre de papier&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;paper tiger&amp;quot;): These correspondences are the result of the following sentences: Ei: &amp;quot;It is a roaring rabbit, a toothless tiger.&amp;quot; Fi: &amp;quot;C' est un tigre de papier, un souris qui rugit.&amp;quot; In the case of the alliterative English phrase &amp;quot;roaring rabbit&amp;quot;, the (presumably) rhetorical aspect is preserved as a rhyme in &amp;quot;souris qui rugit&amp;quot;; the result being that &amp;quot;rabbit&amp;quot; corresponds to &amp;quot;souris&amp;quot;
