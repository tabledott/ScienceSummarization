 and non-terminal entries, where non-terminal entries (occurring as pairs in the source and target side) represent placeholders for inserting additional phrases pairs (which again may contain nonterminals) at decoding time.
    While (Chiang, 2005) uses only two nonterminal symbols in his grammar, we introduce multiple syntactic categories, taking advantage of a target language parser for this information.
    While (Yamada and Knight, 2002) represent syntactical information in the decoding process through a series of transformation operations, we operate directly at the phrase level.
    In addition to the benefits that come from a more structured hierarchical rule set, we believe that these restrictions serve as a syntax driven language model that can guide the decoding process, as n-gram context based language models do in traditional decoding.
    In the following sections, we describe our phrase annotation and generalization process followed by the design and pruning decisions in our chart parser.
    We
