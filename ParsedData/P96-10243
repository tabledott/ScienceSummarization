n this section, we first define basic terms and symbols.
    Next, we define the different metrics used in evaluation.
    Finally, we discuss the relationship of these metrics to parsing algorithms.
    Let wa denote word a of the sentence under consideration.
    Let wab denote wa wa +1 ... tvb _ ; in particular let writ denote the entire sequence of terminals (words) in the sentence under consideration.
    In this paper we assume all guessed parse trees are binary branching.
    Let a parse tree T be defined as a set of triples (s, t, X)&#8212;where s denotes the position of the first symbol in a constituent, t denotes the position of the last symbol, and X represents a terminal or nonterminal symbol&#8212;meeting the following three requirements: Let Tc denote the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; parse (the one in the treebank) and let TG denote the &amp;quot;guessed&amp;quot; parse (the one output by the parsing algorithm).
    Let NG denote ITGI, the number of nonterminals in the guessed parse tree, and let
