results on a replication of the experiment reported in Section 8, and the resultant parser is approximately three times faster at returning the three highest-ranked parsers than that presented here.
    In conclusion, the main positive points of the paper are that 1) LR parse tables can be used to define a more context-dependent and adequate probabilistic model of NL, 2) predictive LR parse tables can be constructed automatically from unification-based grammars in standard notation, 3) effective parse table construction and representation techniques can be defined for realistically sized ambiguous NL grammars, 4) semiautomatic LR based parse techniques can be used to efficiently construct training corpora, and 5) the LR parser and ANLT grammar jointly define a useful probabilistic model into which probabilities concerning lexical subcategorization and structurally defined word sense collocations could be integrated.
