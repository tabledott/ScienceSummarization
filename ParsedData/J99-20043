 supertags.
    This method of parsing can also be used to parse sentence fragments such as in spoken utterances where the disambiguated supertag sequence may not combine into a single structure.
  
  
    In this paper, we present a robust parsing approach called supertagging that integrates the flexibility of linguistically motivated lexical descriptions with the robustness of statistical techniques.
    The idea underlying the approach is that the computation of linguistic structure can be localized if lexical items are associated with rich descriptions (supertags) that impose complex constraints in a local context.
    This makes the number of different descriptions for each lexical item much larger than when the descriptions are less complex, thus increasing the local ambiguity for a parser.
    However, this local ambiguity can be resolved by using statistical distributions of supertag co-occurrences collected from a corpus of parses.
    Supertag disambiguation results in a representation that is effec
