vely reestimates rule probabilities to maximize the probability that the grammar used as a stochastic generator would produce the corpus.
    A reestimation algorithm can be used both to refine the parameter estimates for a CNF SCFG derived by other means (Fujisaki et al., 1989) or to infer a grammar from scratch.
    In the latter case, the initial grammar for the inside-outside algorithm consists of all possible CNF rules over given sets N of nonterminals and E of terminals, with suitably assigned nonzero probabilities.
    In what follows, we will take N, E as fixed, n = INI, t = lEi, and assume enumerations N = {A1, An} and E = {b1, ,b}, with A1 the grammar start symbol.
    A CNF SCFG over N, E can then be specified by the n3 + nt probabilities Bps,, of each possible binary rule Ap 24,. and Upon of each possible unary rule Ap bm.
    Since for each p the parameters Bp,q,,. and Upm&#8222; are supposed to be the probabilities of different ways of expanding Ap, we must have for all 1 &lt;p &lt; n For gramma
