alternatives that are being added to the relevant set differ very little from each other, slowing down the training considerably such that the set of possible block translations might not be fully explored.
    As mentioned in Section 2, the current approach is still able to handle real-valued features, e.g. the language model probability.
    This is important since the language model can be trained on a much larger monolingual corpus.
