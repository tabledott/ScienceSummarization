ical ordering often is, so that the (dynamic) hy pergraph can be generated in that order.
			For example, for CKY it is sufficient to generate all items [X, i, j] before all items [Y, i?, j?]
			when j?
			i? &gt; j ? i (X and Y are arbitrary nonterminals).
			Excursus: Derivations and HyperpathsThe work of Klein and Manning (2001) introduces a cor respondence between hyperpaths and derivations.
			When extended to the k-best case, however, that correspondence no longer holds.
			Definition 9.
			(Nielsen et al, 2005) Given a hypergraph H = ?V, E, t,R?, a hyperpath piv of destination v ? V is an acyclic minimal hypergraph Hpi = ?Vpi, Epi, v,R? such that 1.
			Epi ? E. 2.
			v ? Vpi = ?e?Epi (T (e) ? {h(e)}) 3.
			?u ? Vpi, u is either a source vertex or connected to a source vertex in Hpi.As illustrated by Figure 1, derivations (as trees) are dif ferent from hyperpaths (as minimal hypergraphs) in the sense that in a derivation the same vertex can appear more than once with possibly different sub-derivations w
