			Six sets were extracted for the pattern-based approach and five sets for the co occurrence approach (the 15GB corpus was too large to process using the co-occurrence model ? see dependency parsing time estimates in Table 2).
			From each resulting set, we then randomly se lected 50 words along with their top 3 highest ranking is-a relationships.
			For example, Table 4 shows three randomly selected names for the pat tern-based system on the 15GB dataset.
			For each word, we added to the list of hypernyms a human generated hypernym (obtained from an annotator looking at the word without any system or Word Net hyponym).
			We also appended the WordNet hypernyms for each word (only for the top 3 senses).
