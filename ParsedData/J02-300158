 head words.
    In this section we compare three different approaches to the task of generalizing over head words: automatic clustering of a large vocabulary of head words to identify words with similar semantics; use of a hand-built ontological resource, WordNet, to organize head words in a semantic hierarchy; and bootstrapping to make use of unlabeled data in training the system.
    We will focus on frame elements filled by noun phrases, which constitute roughly half the total.
    To find groups of head words that are likely to fill the same semantic roles, an automatic clustering of nouns was performed using word co-occurrence data from a large corpus.
    This technique is based on the expectation that words with similar semantics will tend to co-occur with the same other sets of words.
    For example, nouns describing foods will tend to occur as direct objects of verbs such as eat devour, and savor.
    The clustering algorithm attempts to find such patterns of co-occurrence from the counts of gramma
