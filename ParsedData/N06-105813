he success of this approach is the size of the corpus used for training contextual classifiers.
    We derived training corpora from the English Gigaword corpus, and the average size of a corpus for one classifier is 255,000 sentences.
    We do not attempt to substitute any words that have less that 10,000 appearances in the Gigaword corpus.
  
  
    Our primary goal is to investigate the impact of machine-generated paraphrases on the accuracy of automatic evaluation.
    We focus on automatic evaluation of machine translation due to the availability of human annotated data in that domain.
    The hypothesis is that by using a synthetic reference translation, automatic measures approximate better human evaluation.
    In section 4.2, we test this hypothesis by comparing the performance of BLEU scores with and without synthetic references.
    Our secondary goal is to study the relationship between the quality of paraphrases and their contribution to the performance of automatic machine translation evaluatio
