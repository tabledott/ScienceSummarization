achine translation.
    Katakana phrases are the largest source of text phrases that do not appear in bilingual dictionaries or training corpora (a.k.a.
    &amp;quot;notfound words&amp;quot;), but very little computational work has been done in this area.
    Yamron et al. (1994) briefly mention a pattern-matching approach, while Arbabi et al.
    (1994) discuss a hybrid neural-net/expert-system approach to (forward) transliteration.
    The information-losing aspect of transliteration makes it hard to invert.
    Here are some problem instances, taken from actual newspaper articles: English translations appear later in this article.
    Here are a few observations about back-transliteration that give an idea of the difficulty of the task: The most desirable feature of an automatic back-transliterator is accuracy.
    If possible, our techniques should also be: Like most problems in computational linguistics, this one requires full world knowledge for a 100% solution.
