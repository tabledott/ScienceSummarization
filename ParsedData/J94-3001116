 (cae,dgf) does not meet the conditions because a:g comes between c:d and e:f. The lexical side of this is the same as the lexical side of the T relation a: b, but the pair a:g itself is not in r. Informally, this rule forces the a to be realized as a surface b when it appears between the specified contexts.
    Karttunen et al. (1987) introduced a variant of a surface coercion rule called a surface prohibition.
    This is a rule of the form 7/ A _ p and indicates that a paired substring that comes between instances of A and p and whose lexical side is in the domain of 7- must not itself belong to T. We shall see that the mathematical properties of surface prohibitions follow as immediate corollaries of our surface coercion analysis.
    The notation also permits compound rules of each type.
    These are rules in which multiple context pairs are specified.
    A compound context restriction rule is of the form y Al pl; A2 and is satisfied if each instance of T is surrounded by an instance of some Ak-pk pair
