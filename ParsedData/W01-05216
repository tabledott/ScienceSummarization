treebank) and test (section 23) sets.
    For the Brown data, we reserved every tenth sentence in the corpus as test data, using the other nine for training.
    This may underestimate the difficulty of the Brown corpus by including sentences from the same documents in training and test sets.
    However, because of the variation within the Brown corpus, we felt that a single contiguous test section might not be representative.
    Only the subset of the Brown corpus available in the Treebank II bracketing format was used.
    This subset consists primarily of various fiction genres.
    Corpus sizes are shown in Results for the Brown corpus, along with WSJ results for comparison, are shown in Table 2.
    The basic mismatch between the two corpora is shown in the significantly lower performance of the WSJtrained model on Brown data than on WSJ data (rows 1 and 2).
    A model trained on Brown data only does significantly better, despite the smaller size of the training set.
    Combining the WSJ and Brown tr
