not be modeled well by these TMs.
    To incorporate structural aspects of the language, our channel model accepts a parse tree as an input, i.e., the input sentence is preprocessed by a syntactic parser.
    The channel performs operations on each node of the parse tree.
    The operations are reordering child nodes, inserting extra words at each node, and translating leaf words.
    Figure 1 shows the overview of the operations of our model.
    Note that the output of our model is a string, not a parse tree.
    Therefore, parsing is only needed on the channel input side.
    The reorder operation is intended to model translation between languages with different word orders, such as SVO-languages (English or Chinese) and SOV-languages (Japanese or Turkish).
    The word-insertion operation is intended to capture linguistic differences in specifying syntactic cases.
    E.g., English and French use structural position to specify case, while Japanese and Korean use case-marker particles.
