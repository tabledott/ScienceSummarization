    In a small study, homograph pairs were observed to co-occur roughly 5 times less often than arbitrary word pairs of comparable frequency.
    Regardless of origin, this phenomenon is strong enough to be of significant practical use as an additional probabilistic disambiguation constraint.
    4This latter effect is actually a continuous function conditional on the burstiness of the word (the tendency of a word to deviate from a constant Poisson distribution in a corpus).
    'As most ratios involve a 0 for some observed value, smoothing is crucial.
    The process employed here is sensitive to variables including the type of collocation (adjacent bigrams or wider context), collocational distance, type of word (content word vs. function word) and the expected amount of noise in the training data.
    Details are provided in (Yarowsky, to appear). encountered in other frameworks.
    The algorithm is especially well suited for utilizing a large set of highly non-independent evidence such as found
