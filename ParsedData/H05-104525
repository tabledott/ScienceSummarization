 definition only requires the identifica tion of direct sources, while our task requires the identification of both direct and indirect sources.
			Bethard et al evaluate their system on manuallyannotated FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998) and Prop Bank (Palmer et al, 2005) sentences and achieve 48% recall with 57% precision.
			Our IE pattern learner can be viewed as a crossbetween AutoSlog (Riloff, 1996a) and AutoSlog TS (Riloff, 1996b).
			AutoSlog is a supervised learner that requires annotated training data but does notcompute statistics.
			AutoSlog-TS is a weakly super vised learner that does not require annotated databut generates coarse statistics that measure each pattern?s correlation with relevant and irrelevant docu ments.
			Consequently, the patterns learned by bothAutoSlog and AutoSlog-TS need to be manually re viewed by a person to achieve good accuracy.
			In contrast, our IE learner, AutoSlog-SE, computes statistics directly from the annotated training data, creating a fully automatic variation o
