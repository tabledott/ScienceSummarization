s headed by al ak, ci respectively, and if al ' b&amp;quot; ak c1 cj is the instantiation of a deduction rule, then (b: Da&#8222; .
    , Dak) is also a derivation tree.
    Notice that the D&#8222; .
    .
    .
    Dc, do not occur in this tree: they are side conditions, and although their existence is required to prove that c1 ci could be derived, they do not contribute to the value of the tree.
    We will write al &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; ak to indicate that there is an item derivation tree of the form (b: Da&#8222; .
    .
    .
    ,Dak).
    As mentioned in Section 2.2, we will write x E B if bucket(x) --= B and there is an item derivation tree for x.
    We can continue the example of parsing aaa, now using the item-based CKY parser of Figure 3.
    There are two item derivation trees for the goal item; in Figure 6, we give the first as an example, displaying it as a tree, rather than with angle bracket notation, for simplicity.
    Notice that an item derivation is a tree, not a directed graph.
