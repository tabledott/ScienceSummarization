ordNet 2.1 are listed in Table 1; we label a hyponym link as correct in the coarse-grained evaluation if the novel hyponym is placed under the appropriate supersense.
    This evaluation task is similar to a fine-grained Named Entity Recognition (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002) task with 26 categories; for example, if our algorithm mistakenly inserts a novel non-capital city under the hyponym state capital, it will inherit the correct supersense location.
    Finally, we evaluate the ability of our algorithm to correctly choose the appropriate sense of the hypernym under which a novel hyponym is being added.
    Our labelers categorize each candidate sense-disambiguated hypernym synset suggested by our algorithm into the following categories: A single hyponym/hypernym pair is allowed to be simultaneously labeled 2 and 3.
    Table 2 displays the results of our evaluation of fine-grained precision for the baseline non-joint algorithm (Base) and our joint algorithm (Joint), as well as the relative error reduction (E
