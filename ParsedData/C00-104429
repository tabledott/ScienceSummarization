ersected with other sets (LI4, L l6, L23, and L24).
  For the other two (L 13 and LI 5), predictability is only 1 or 2 points lower (not statistically significant).
  For the man- ually assigned polarity and gradability sets, in one case predictability is lower (L17 &lt; L6), but in the other cases it remains the same or improves.
  The results are even better for the automatically assigned polarity and grad- ability sets: predictability improves when both features are considered in all but one case, when predictability remains the same (L20 &gt; L8; L21 &gt; L9; L22 &gt; LI0; and LI 1 _&lt; L20, L21, and L22).
  5 Conclusion and Future Work This paper presents an analysis of different adjective fea- tures for predicting subjectivity, showing that tlmy are more precise than those previously used for this task.
  Wc establish that lexical semantic features uch as seman- tic orientation and gradability determine in large part the subjectivity status of sentences in which they appear.
  We also present an automa
