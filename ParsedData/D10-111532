uevara (2010) is doing even worse than the multiplicative method, suggesting that a single set of weights does not provide enough flexibility to model a variety of adjective transformations successfully.
    This is at odds with Guevara&#8217;s experiment in which slm outperformed mult and add on the task of ranking predicted ANs with respect to a target observed AN.
    Besides various differences in task definition and model implementation, Guevara trained his model on ANs that include a wide variety of adjectives, whereas our training data were limited to ANs containing one of our 36 test set adjectives.
    Future work should re-evalute the performance of Guevara&#8217;s approach in our task, but under his training regime.
    Looking now at the alm results in more detail, the best median ranks are obtained for very frequent adjectives.
    The top ones are new (median rank: 34), great (79), American (82), large (82) and different (97).
    There is a high inverse correlation between median rank and adjec
