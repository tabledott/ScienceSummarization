ntic similarity measures.
    Their output can be used as features for a learner.
    These measures are not specifically developed for coreference resolution but simply taken &#8216;off-the-shelf&#8217; and applied to our task without any specific tuning &#8212; i.e.
    in contrast to Harabagiu et al. (2001), who weight WordNet relations differently in order to compute the confidence measure of the path.
    To the best of our knowledge, we do not know of any previous work using Wikipedia or SRL for coreference resolution.
    In the case of SRL, this layer of semantic context abstracts from the specific lexical expressions used, and therefore represents a higher level of abstraction than (still related) work involving predicate argument statistics.
    Kehler et al. (2004) observe no significant improvement due to predicate argument statistics.
    The improvement reported by Yang et al. (2005) is rather caused by their twin-candidate model than by the semantic knowledge.
    Employing SRL is closer in spi
