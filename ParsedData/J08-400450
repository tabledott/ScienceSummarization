 we think that some of these recommendations may not be appropriate for CL.
    4.1.1 Generating Data to Measure Reproducibility.
    Krippendorff&#8217;s recommendations were developed for the field of content analysis, where coding is used to draw conclusions from the texts.
    A coded corpus is thus akin to the result of a scientific experiment, and it can only be considered valid if it is reproducible&#8212;that is, if the same coded results can be replicated in an independent coding exercise.
    Krippendorff therefore argues that any study using observed agreement as a measure of reproducibility must satisfy the following requirements: Some practices that are common in CL do not satisfy these requirements.
    The first requirement is violated by the practice of expanding the written coding instructions and including new rules as the data are generated.
    The second requirement is often violated by using experts as coders, particularly long-term collaborators, as such coders may agree not because the
