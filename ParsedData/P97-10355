 decision theory requires a specification of both the objectives of the decision problem and a set of measures (known as attributes in decision theory) for operationalizing the objectives.
    The PARADISE model is based on the structure of objectives (rectangles) shown in Figure 1.
    The PARADISE model posits that performance can be correlated with a meaningful external criterion such as usability, and thus that the overall goal of a spoken dialogue agent is to maximize an objective related to usability.
    User satisfaction ratings (Kamm, 1995; Shriberg, Wade, and Price, 1992; Polifroni et al., 1992) have been frequently used in the literature as an external indicator of the usability of a dialogue agent.
    The model further posits that two types of factors are potential relevant contributors to user satisfaction (namely task success and dialogue costs), and that two types of factors are potential relevant contributors to costs (Walker, 1996).
    In addition to the use of decision theory to create thi
