n its performance, as its limitations affect all measures equally.
  Regardless of the degree of adequacy of its performance, it is a ?level playing field?
  for 16 Although it shares underlying assumptions, our algorithm differs from that of Hirst and St-Onge in its mechanisms.
  In particular, Hirst and St-Onge?s algorithm was based on lexical chains (Morris and Hirst 1991), whereas our algorithm regards regions of text as bags of words.
  17 In fact, there is a semantic bias in human typing errors (Fromkin 1980), but not in the malapropism generator to be described below.
  33 Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1 comparison of the measures.
  Hirst and Budanitsky (2005) discuss the practical aspects of the method and compare it with other approaches to the same problem.
  5.2 Method To test the measures in this application, we need a sufficiently large corpus of malapropisms in their context, each identified and annotated with its correction.
  Since no such corpus of naturally occurring malapropi
