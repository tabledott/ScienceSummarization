become simpler, easier to develop, more portable across domains, and more accurate and robust in the presence of knowledge gaps.
  
  
    In our machine translation experiences, we traced generation disfluencies to two sources:1 (1) incomplete or inaccurate conceptual (interlingua) structures, caused by knowledge gaps in the source language analyzer, and (2) knowledge gaps in the generator itself.
    These two categories of gaps include: The generation system we use, PENMAN (Penman, 1989), is robust because it supplies appropriate defaults when knowledge is missing.
    But the default choices frequently are not the optimal ones; the hybrid model we describe provides more satisfactory solutions.
  
  
    The process of selecting words that will lexicalize each semantic concept is intrinsically linked with syntactic, semantic, and discourse structure issues.2 Multiple constraints apply to each lexical decision, often in a highly interdependent manner.
    However, while some lexical decisions can affect fut
