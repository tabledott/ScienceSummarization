pf, 1935), (Pedersen, Kayaalp, and Bruce, 1996)), there is evidence that our data, when represented by a dissimilarity matrix, can be adequately characterized by a normal distribution.
    However, we will continue to investigate the appropriateness of this assumption.
    In McQuitty's method, clusters are based on a simple averaging of the feature mismatch counts found in the dissimilarity matrix.
    At each step in McQuitty's method, a new cluster, CKL, is formed by merging the clusters CK and CL that have the fewest number of dissimilar features between them.
    The clusters to be merged, CK and CL, are identified by finding the cell (1,k) (or (k,1)), where k 1, that has the minimum value in the dissimilarity matrix.
    Once the new cluster CKL is created, the dissimilarity matrix is updated to reflect the number of dissimilar features between CKL and all other existing clusters.
    The dissimilarity between any existing cluster Cr and CKL is computed as: where DKI is the number of dissimilar features
