atures, including features extracted from a parser that provides a different syntactic view &#8211; a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) parser (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002).
    In the second set of experiments, we explore approaches to identify optimal subsets of features for each argument class, and to calibrate the classifier probabilities.
    We then report on experiments that address the problem of arguments missing from a given syntactic analysis.
    We investigate ways to combine hypotheses generated from semantic role taggers trained using different syntactic views &#8211; one trained using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000), another on a rule-based dependency parser &#8211; Minipar (Lin, 1998), and a third based on a flat, shallow syntactic chunk representation (Hacioglu, 2004a).
    We show that these three views complement each other to improve performance.
  
  
    For our experiments, we use Feb 2004 release of PropBank1 (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Palmer et al., 2005), a corpus in wh
