erable from the pronouns form, as with you, since the distinction is recoverable on the basis of the pronouns position in the parse tree in the parsed version of the corpus.
  Similarly, the Penn Treebank tagset conflates ubordinating conjunctions with prepositions, tagging both categories as IN.
  The distinction between the two categories i not lost, however, since subor- dinating conjunctions can be recovered as those instances of IN that precede clauses, whereas prepositions are those instances of IN that precede noun phrases or preposi- tional phrases.
  We would like to emphasize that the lexical and syntactic recoverability inherent in the POS-tagged version of the Penn Treebank corpus allows end users to employ a much richer tagset han the small one described in Section 2.2 if the need arises.
  2.1.2 Consistency.
  As noted above, one reason for eliminating a POS tag such as RN (nominal adverb) is its lexical recoverability.
  Another important reason for doing so is consistency.
  For instance, in t
