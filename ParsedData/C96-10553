 30 min- utes (see, e.g., (Neff and McCord, 1990; Copestakc et al., 1995; Walker and Amsler, 1986)).
  Given that we are aiming for large-scale lexicons of 20-60,000 words, automation of the acquisition process has become a ne- cessity.
  Previous research in automatic acquisition focuscs primarily on the use of statistical techniques, such as bilingual alignment (Church and Hanks, 1990; Kla- vans and Tzoukermann, 1996; Wu and Xia, 1995), or extraction of syntactic constructions from online dic- tionaries and corpora (Brant, 1993; Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg, 1995).
  Others who have taken a more knowledge-based (interlingual) approach (Lonsdale, Mi- tamura, and Nyberg, 1996) do not provide a means for systematically deriving the relation between sur- face syntactic structures and their underlying semantic representations.
  Those who have taken more argument structures into account, e.g., (Copestake t al., 1995), do not take full advantage of the systematic relation be- tween syntax and semantics during lexic
