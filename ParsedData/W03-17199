    An unfortunate, and sometimes unforseen, complexity in dealing with Chinese text on the computer is the plethora of character sets and character encodings used throughout Greater China.
    This is demonstrated in the Encoding column of Table 1: This variation of encoding is exacerbated by the usual lack of specific declaration in the files.
    Generally a file is said to be &#8220;Big Five&#8221; or &#8220;GB&#8221;, when in actuality the file is encoded in a variation of these.
    This is problematic in systems that utilize Unicode internally, since transcoding back to the original encoding may lose information.
  
  
    We computed a baseline for each of the corpora by compiling a dictionary of all and only the words in the training portion of the corpus.
    We then used this dictionary with a simple maximum matching algorithm to segment the test corpus.
    The results of this experiment are presented in Table 3.
