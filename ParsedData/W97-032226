EM algorithm, a high standard deviation means that the algorithm is not settling on any particular maxima.
    Results may become more consistent if the number of parameters that must be estimated was reduced.
    Figures 6, 7 and 8 show the confusion matrices associated with the disambiguation of concern, inleresi, and help, using Feature Sets A, B, and C, respectively.
    A confusion matrix shows the number of cases where the sense discovered by the algorithm agrees with the manually assigned sense along the main diagonal; disagreements are shown in the rest of the matrix.
    In general, these matrices reveal that both the EM algorithm and Ward's method are more biased toward balanced distributions of senses than is McQuitty's method.
    This may explain the better performance of McQuitty's method in disambiguating those words with the most skewed sense distributions, the adjectives and adverbs.
    It is possible to adjust the EM algorithm away from this tendency towards discovering balanced distributio
