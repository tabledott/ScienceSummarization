tially correct), and &#8220;Incorrect&#8221;.
    The results of the evaluation are presented in Table 1.
    Although the four evaluators were judging four different sets, each clearly rated a higher percentage of the outputs produced by the syntax-based alignment algorithm as &#8220;Correct&#8221;.
    We should note that there are parameters specific to the co-training algorithm that we did not tune to work for this particular corpus.
    In addition, the cotraining algorithm recovered more paraphrase pairs: the syntax-based algorithm extracted 8666 pairs in total with 1051 of them extracted at least twice (i.e. more or less reliable), while the numbers for the co-training algorithm is 2934 out of a total of 16993 pairs.
    This means we are not comparing the accuracy on the same recall level.
    Aside from evaluating the correctness of the paraphrases, we are also interested in the degree of overlap between the paraphrase pairs discovered by the two algorithms so different from each other.
    We find t
