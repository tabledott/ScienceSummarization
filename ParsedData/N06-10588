hrases, and study their contribution to the accuracy of automatic evaluation.
  
  
    The input to our method consists of a reference sentence R = r1 ... rm and a system-generated sentence W = w1 ... wp whose words form the sets R and W respectively.
    The output of the model is a synthetic reference sentence SRW that preserves the meaning of R and has maximal word overlap with W. We generate such a sentence by substituting words from R with contextually equivalent words from W. Our algorithm first selects pairs of candidate word paraphrases, and then checks the likelihood of their substitution in the context of the reference sentence.
    Candidate Selection We assume that words from the reference sentence that already occur in the system generated sentence should not be considered for substitution.
    Therefore, we focus on unmatched pairs of the form {(r, w) r E R &#8722; W, w E W &#8722; R}.
    From this pool, we select candidate pairs whose members exhibit high semantic proximity.
