seized?, ?stations ? seized?, and ?sev eral ? stations?.
			Special syntactic categories are assigned in CCGto lexical items that project unbounded dependen cies, such as the relative pronouns ?who?, ?which?
			and ?that?.
			Coupled with a head-passing mechanism, these categories allow the extraction of long-range dependencies.
			Together with the local word-worddependencies, they create a directed acyclic depen dency graph for each parsed sentence, as shown in Figure 1.
			5.2 Extracting dependencies using a CFG.
			parser Local dependencies can be extracted from a CFG parse tree using simple heuristic rules for findingthe head child for each type of constituent.
			Alter natively, head-modifier dependencies can be directly output by a parser whose model is based on lexical dependencies.
			In our experiments, we used the full parse output from Collins?
			parser (Collins, 1997), in which every non-terminal node is already annotated with head information.
			Because local dependencies assemble into a tree
