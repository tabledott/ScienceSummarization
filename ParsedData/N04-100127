ention detection followed by entity tracking on the ACE&#8217;03 evaluation data.
    Our submission in the evaluation performed well relative to the other participating systems (contractual obligations prevent us from elaborating further).
    The same basic model was used to perform EDT in three languages.
    Our approach is language-independent, in that system on different sets of features (uniformly penalized F-measure), September&#8217;02 data.
    The lower part of each box describes the particular combination of feature types; the arrows show a inclusion relationship between the feature sets. the fundamental classification algorithm can be applied to every language and the only changes involve finding appropriate and available feature streams for each language.
    The entity tracking system uses even fewer languagespecific features than the mention detection systems.
    One limitation apparent in our mention detection system is that it does not model explicitly the genericity of a mention.
