hanism into the grammar rules that chooses left-branching rules in cases of compounds, genitive modification and conjuncts, as we don&#8217;t have enough lexicalsemantic information represented to choose the right dependencies in these cases.4 Secondly, we use a mechanism for hand-coding reading preferences among rules and lexical entries.
    4Consider, for example, genitive modification: The semantic relationship between modifier and modifiee is dependent on their semantic properties: toukyou no kaigi - 'the meeting in Tokyo', watashi no hon - 'my book'.
    More lexical-semantic information is needed to choose the correct parse in more complex structures, such as in watashi no toukyou no imooto &#8211; &#8216;My sister in Tokyo&#8217;.
    Restrictions like head-complement preferred to head-adjunct are quite obvious.
    Others require domain-specific mechanisms that shall be subject of further work.
