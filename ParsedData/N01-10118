 make up the bigram.
    Pointwise Mutual Information quantifies how often two words occur together in a bigram (the numerator) relative to how often they occur overall in the corpus (the denominator).
    However, there is a curious limitation to pointwise Mutual Information.
    A bigram w1w2 that occurs n11 times in the corpus, and whose component words w1 and w2 only occur as a part of that bigram, will result in increasingly strong measures of association as the value of n11 decreases.
    Thus, the maximum pointwise Mutual Information in a given corpus will be assigned to bigrams that occur one time, and whose component words never occur outside that bigram.
    These are usually not the bigrams that prove most useful for disambiguation, yet they will dominate a ranked list as determined by pointwise Mutual Information.
    The Dice Coefficient overcomes this limitation, and can be defined as follows: When n11 = n1+ = n+1 the value of Dice(w1, w2) will be 1 for all values n11.
    When the value of n11
