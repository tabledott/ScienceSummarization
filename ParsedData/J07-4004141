est different configurations of the system, for example different feature sets.
    It may also not be possible to train or run the system on anything other than short sentences (Taskar et al. 2004).
    The supertagger is a key component in our parsing system.
    It reduces the size of the charts considerably compared with naive methods for assigning lexical categories, which is crucial for practical discriminative training.
    The tight integration of the supertagger and parser enables highly efficient as well as accurate parsing.
    The parser is significantly faster than comparable parsers in the NLP literature.
    The supertagger we have developed can be applied to other lexicalized grammar formalisms.
    Another contribution of the article is the development of log-linear parsing models for CCG.
    In particular, we have shown how to define a CCG parsing model which exploits all derivations, including nonstandard derivations.
    These nonstandard derivations are an integral part of the formalism,
