d information retrieval tech- niques (term distribution and frequency) to achieve high robustness and better concept-level generaliza-- tion.
  The core of SUMMARIST is based on the follow- ing equation!
  : summarization = topic identification + topic interpretation + generation.
  These three stages are: Topic Ident i f ieat lon:  Identify the most imtmrtant (central) topics of the texts.
