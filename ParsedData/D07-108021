et al, 2003).
			Third, phrase translation pairs are extracted together with hierarchical phrases by considering holes.
			In the last step, the hierarchical phrases are constrainedso that they follow the target normalized form con straint.
			A 5-gram language model is trained on the English side of the bilingual data combined with the English Gigaword from LDC.First, the use of normalized token types in Sec tion 3.3 is evaluated in Table 1.
			In this setting, all the structural features in Section 3.2 are used, but differentiated by the normalized tokens combinedwith surface forms.
			Our online large-margin train ing algorithm performed 50 iterations constrained 769 Table 2: Experimental results obtained by incrementally adding structural features.
