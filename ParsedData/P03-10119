f times each node has been cloned, at no increase in computational complexity.
    Without such an assumption, the parameter estimation becomes a problem of parsing with crossing dependencies, which is exponential in the length of the input string (Barton, 1985).
  
  
    The tree-to-tree alignment model has tree transformation operations similar to those of the tree-tostring model described above.
    However, the transformed tree must not only match the surface string of the target language, but also the tree structure assigned to the string by the treebank annotators.
    In order to provide enough flexibility to make this possible, additional tree transformation operations allow a single node in the source tree to produce two nodes in the target tree, or two nodes in the source tree to be grouped together and produce a single node in the target tree.
    The model can be thought of as a synchronous tree substitution grammar, with probabilities parameterized to generate the target tree conditioned on the
