sample, sample no.
    10, the Danish system outperforms the Spanish system by 0.07%.
    Let us stress in conclusion at this point that &#8211; when working with small test sets &#8211; it is important to obtain a representative sample, as much as this is possible.
    Translation quality of neighboring sentences correlates positively, therefore we want to chose test sentences from different parts of a larger set.
  
  
    The purpose of experimental testing is to assess the true translation quality of a system on text from a certain domain.
    However, even with the qualifier &#8220;from a certain domain&#8221;, this is an abstract concept, since it has to be computed on all possible sentences in that domain.
    In practice, we will always just be able to measure the performance of the system on a specific sample.
    From this test result, we would like to conclude what the true translation performance is.
    Statistical significance is an estimate of the degree, to which the true translation quality l
