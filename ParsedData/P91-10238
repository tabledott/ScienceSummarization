    Identifying sentence boundaries is not always as easy as it might appear for reasons described in Liberman and Church (to appear).
    It would be much easier if periods were always used to mark sentence boundaries, but unfortunately, many periods have other purposes.
    In the Brown Corpus, for example, only 90% of the periods are used to mark sentence boundaries; the remaining 10% appear in numerical expressions, abbreviations and so forth.
    In the Wall Street Journal, there is even more discussion of dollar amounts and percentages, as well as more use of abbreviated titles such as Mr.: consequently, only 53% of the periods in the the Wall Street Journal are used to identify sentence boundaries.
    For the UBS data, a simple set of heuristics were used to identify sentences boundaries.
    The dataset was sufficiently small that it was possible to correct the remaining mistakes by hand.
    For a larger dataset, such as the Canadian Hansards, it was not possible to check the results by hand.
