pair.
    A second reason was that we intended to use computer simulations of the classification task to supplement the results of our experiments, and we needed a parsed corpus for this purpose; the articles we chose were all part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).
    In the remainder of the paper, we review two existing classification schemes in Section 2 and then discuss our two classification experiments in Sections 3 and 4.
  
  
    When looking for an annotation scheme for definite descriptions, one is faced with a wide range of options.
    At one end of the spectrum there are mostly descriptive lists of definite description uses, such as those in Christophersen (1939) and Hawkins (1978), whose only goal is to assign a classification to all uses of definite descriptions.
    At the other end, there are highly developed formal analyses, such as Russell (1905), Heim (1982), Lobner (1985), Kadmon (1987), Neale (1990), Barker (1991), and Kamp and Reyle (1993), in which the
