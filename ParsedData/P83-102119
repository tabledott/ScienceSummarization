lauses, structure sharing for other derived clauses.
    When copying, care should be taken not to copy variable-free subterms, but to copy just pointers to those subterms instead.
    It is very costly to implement subsumption in its full generality.
    To keep the cost within reasonable bounds, it will be essential to index the derived clauses on at least the predicate symbols they contain &#8212; and probably also, on symbols in certain key argument positions.
    A simplification of full subsumption checking that would appear adequate to block most redundant steps is to keep track of selected literals that have been used exhaustively to generate instantiation steps.
    If another selected literal is an instance of one that has been exhaustively explored, there is no need to consider using it as a candidate for instantiation steps.
    Subsumption would then be only applied to derived unit clauses.
    A major efficiency problem with Earley deduction is that it is difficult to recognize situations in whi
