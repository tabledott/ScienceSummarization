    Section 3 describes how to represent parse trees efficiently, so that all possible parse trees (the parse forest) take at most polynomial space as the ambiguity of a sentence grows exponentially.
    In section 4, several examples are given.
    Section 5 presents several empirical results of the algorithm's practical performance, including comparison with Earley's algorithm.
    In section 6, we discuss how to enhance the algorithm to handle augmented context-free grammars rather than pure context-free grammars.
    Section 7 describes the concept of on-line parsing, taking advantage of left-to-right operation of our parsing algorithm.
    The on-line parser parses a sentence strictly from left to right, and starts parsing as soon as the user types in the first word, without waiting for the end of line.
    Benefits of on-line parsing are then discussed.
    Finally, several versions of on-line parser have been implemented, and they are mentioned in section 8.
