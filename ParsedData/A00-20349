r to this as the &amp;quot;root base cut&amp;quot; (RBC).
    The second is termed the &amp;quot;union base cut&amp;quot; (PBc).
    This is obtained by taking all classes from the union of the two Tcms which are not subsumed by another class in this union.
    Duplicates are removed.
    Probabilities are assigned to the classes of a base cut using the estimates on the original TCM.
    The probability estimate for a hypernym class is obtained by combining the probability estimates for all its hyponyms on the original cut.
    Figure 2 exemplifies this process for two Tcms (Tcml and Tcm2) in an imaginary hierarchy.
    The UBC is at the classes B, C and D. To quantify the similarity between the probability distributions for the target slots we use the a-skew divergence (asp) proposed by Lee (1999).
    1 This measure, defined in equation 2, is a smoothed version of the Kulback-Liebler divergence. p1(x) and p2(x) are the two probability distributions which are being compared.
    The a constant is a value bet
