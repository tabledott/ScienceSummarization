 syntactic subjects, (2) syntactic objects, (3) prepositional attachments, (4) complex nominals, and (5) adjectival/adverbial adjuncts.
    Our approach is to derive the LF directly from the output of the syntactic parser which already resolves structural and syntactic ambiguities.
    Essentially there is a one to one mapping of the words of the text into the predicates in the logic form.
    The predicate names consist of the base form of the word concatenated with the part of speech of the word.
    Each noun has an argument that is used to represent it in other predicates.
    One of the most important features of the Logic Form representation is the fixed-slot allocation mechanism of the verb predicates (Hobbs 1993).
    This allows for the Logic Prover to see the difference between the role of the subjects and objects in a sentence that is not answerable in a keyword based situation.
    Logic Forms are derived from the grammar rules found in the parse tree of a sentence.
    There are far too many gram
