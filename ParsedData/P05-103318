core).
    We then tested our system, using the settings described above.4 Our system achieves an absolute improvement of 0.02 over the baseline (7.5% relative), without using any additional training data.
    This difference is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01).5 See Table 1, which also shows that the relative gain is higher for higher n-grams.
    4Note that we gave Pharaoh wider beam settings than we used on our own decoder; on the other hand, since our decoder&#8217;s chart has more cells, its b limits do not need to be as high.
    The use of hierarchical structures opens the possibility of making the model sensitive to syntactic structure.
    Koehn et al. (2003) mention German (es gibt, there is) as an example of a good phrase pair which is not a syntactic phrase pair, and report that favoring syntactic phrases does not improve accuracy.
    But in our model, the rule would indeed respect syntactic phrases, because it builds a pair of Ss out of a pair of NPs.
    Thus, favoring subtrees in our mo
