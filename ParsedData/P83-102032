e two constituents which preceded the trigger for reanalysis, i.e. that the order of constituents in the VP is where Cl and C2 are the two constituents, and T is the trigger.
    Then these two constituents would be attached to the VP whose head is V before T is encountered, causing the parser (before attaching T) to assert two new predications which would have the force of shifting the two constituents into the verb.
    But which predication could be parser add first?
    If it asserts that D(V, Cl), this violates the Rightmost Daughter Constraint, because only C2 can be lowered under a sibling.
    But if the parser first asserts D(V, C2) then C2 crosses over Cl, which is prohibited by the No Crossover Constraint.
    Therefore, only constituent can have been attached before the reanalysis occurs.
  
  
    We now turn from the consequences of expressing syntactic structure in terms of domination to the use of names within Dtheory.
    As stated above, it is this use of names which really makes D-theory an
