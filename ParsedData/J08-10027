the feature forest model and its application to HPSG parsing.
    We also provide an extensive empirical evaluation of the resulting HPSG parsing approach using real-world text.
    Section 2 discusses a problem of conventional probabilistic models for lexicalized grammars.
    Section 3 proposes feature forest models for solving this problem.
    Section 4 describes the application of feature forest models to probabilistic HPSG parsing.
    Section 5 presents an empirical evaluation of probabilistic HPSG parsing, and Section 6 introduces research related to our proposals.
    Section 7 concludes.
  
  
    Maximum entropy models (Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996) are now becoming the de facto standard approach for disambiguation models for lexicalized or feature structure grammars (Johnson et al. 1999; Riezler et al.
    2000, 2002; Geman and Johnson 2002; Clark and Curran 2003, 2004b; Kaplan et al. 2004; Carroll and Oepen 2005).
