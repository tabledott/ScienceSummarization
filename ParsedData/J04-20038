    Today&#8217;s statistical machine translation systems build upon the work of P. F. Brown and his colleagues at IBM.
    The translation models they presented in various papers between 1988 and 1993 (Brown et al. 1988; Brown et al.
    1990; Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer 1993) are commonly referred to as IBM models 1&#8211;5, based on the numbering in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993).
    The underlying (probabilistic) lexicon contains only pairs of full forms.
    On the other hand, Brown et al. (1992) had already suggested word forms be annotated with morpho-syntactic information, but they did not perform any investigation on the effects.
    et al. (2000), have dealt with the problem of translation with scarce resources.
    AlOnaizan et al. report on an experiment involving Tetun-to-English translation by different groups, including one using statistical machine translation.
    Al-Onaizan et al. assume the absence of linguistic knowledge sources such a
