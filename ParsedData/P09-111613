million phrases using 3-word windows, each KMeans iteration takes about 20 minutes on 1000 CPUs.
    Without using the indexing technique in Section 2.4, each iteration takes about 4 times as long.
    In all our experiments, we set the maximum number of iterations to be 50.
  
  
    Named entity recognition (NER) is one of the first steps in many applications of information extraction, information retrieval, question answering and other applications of NLP.
    Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et. al.
    2001) is one of the most competitive NER algorithms.
    We employed a linear chain CRF with L2 regularization as the baseline algorithm to which we added phrase cluster features.
    The CoNLL 2003 Shared Task (Tjong Kim Sang and Meulder 2003) offered a standard experimental platform for NER.
    The CoNLL data set consists of news articles from Reuters1.
    The training set has 203,621 tokens and the development and test set have 51,362 and 46,435 tokens, respectively.
    We adopted the same e
