he PDT uses so-called analytical functions capturing the type of relation between a dependent and its governing node.
    Thus the number of nodes is equal to the number of tokens (words + punctuation) plus one (an artificial root node with rather technical function is added to each sentence).
    The PDT contains also a traditional morpho-syntactic annotation (tags) at each word position (together with a lemma, uniquely representing the underlying lexical unit).
    As Czech is a HI language, the size of the set of possible tags is unusually high: more than 3,000 tags may be assigned by the Czech morphological analyzer.
    The PDT also contains machine-assigned tags and lemmas for each word (using a tagger described in (Haji 6 and Hladka, 1998)).
    For evaluation purposes, the PDT has been divided into a training set (19k sentences) and a development/evaluation test set pair (about 3,500 sentences each).
    Parsing accuracy is defined as the ratio of correct dependency links vs. the total number of depen
