    The first two of these instances will be labeled as negative, and the last one will be labeled as positive.
    As in the mention-pair model, we train an entity-mention classifier using the SVM learner.
    After training, the resulting classifier is used to identify a preceding cluster for a mention in a test text.
    Specifically, the mentions are processed in a left-to-right manner.
    For each active mention mk, a test instance is created between mk and each of the preceding clusters formed so far.
    All the test instances are then presented to the classifier.
    Finally, mk will be linked to the closest preceding cluster that is classified as coreferent with mk.
    If mk is not classified as coreferent with any preceding cluster, it will be considered discoursenew.
    Note that all partial clusters preceding mk are formed incrementally based on the predictions of the classifier for the first k &#8722; 1 mentions.
