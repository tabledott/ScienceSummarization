larly, the component values inside each source&#8217;s vectors are not to be interpreted in the same manner.
    Nonetheless, they have in common that they originate from distributive corpus statistics. meaning is commonly represented in a highdimensional space, where each component corresponds to some contextual element in which the word is found.
    The contextual elements can be words themselves, or larger linguistic units such as sentences or documents, or even more complex linguistic representations such as the argument slots of predicates.
    A semantic space that is often employed in studying compositionality across a variety of tasks (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011a) uses a context window of five words on either side of the target word, and 2,000 vector dimensions.
    These are the common context words in the British National Corpus (BNC), a corpus of about 100 million tokens.
    Their values are set to the ratio of the probability of the context word given the target
