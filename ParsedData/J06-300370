and Yangarber (2003) also find patterns automatically, but their goal is to mine text for instances of word pairs; the same goal as Hearst (1992) and Berland and Charniak (1999).
    Because LRA uses patterns to build distributed vector representations, it can exploit patterns that would be much too noisy and unreliable for the kind of text mining instance extraction that is the objective of Hearst (1992), Berland and Charniak (1999), Riloff and Jones (1999), and Yangarber (2003).
    Therefore LRA can simply select the highest frequency patterns (step 4 in Section 5.5); it does not need the more sophisticated selection algorithms of Riloff and Jones (1999) and Yangarber (2003).
  
  
    This section describes experiments with 600 noun-modifier pairs, hand-labeled with 30 classes of semantic relations (Nastase and Szpakowicz 2003).
    In the following experiments, LRA is used with the baseline parameter values, exactly as described in Section 5.5.
    No adjustments were made to tune LRA to the noun-modifie
