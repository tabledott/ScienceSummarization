ue, which we use to considerably improve the performance of our system.
    In this work, we used path prefixes of length 4,6,10, and 20.
    When Brown clusters are used as features in the following sections, it implies that all features in the system which contain a word form will be duplicated and a new set of features containing the paths of varying length will be introduced.
    For example, if the system contains the feature concatenation of the current token and the system prediction on the previous word, four new features will be introduced which are concatenations of the previous prediction and the 4,6,10,20 length path-representations of the current word.
    An important question at the inception of the NER task was whether machine learning techniques are necessary at all, and whether simple dictionary lookup would be sufficient for good performance.
    Indeed, the baseline for the CoNLL03 shared task was essentially a dictionary lookup of the entities which appeared in the training data, and it a
