    We observed that ASOsemi prefers &#8216;nugget extraction&#8217; tasks to &#8217;field segmentation&#8217; tasks (Grenager et al., 2005).
    We cannot provide details here owing to the space limitation.
    Intuitively, their word prediction auxiliary problems can capture only a limited number of characteristic behaviors because the auxiliary problems are constructed by a limited number of &#8216;binary&#8217; classifiers.
    Moreover, we should remember that ASOsemi used the human knowledge that &#8216;named entities mostly consist of nouns or adjectives&#8217; during the auxiliary problem construction in their NER experiments.
    In contrast, our results require no such additional knowledge or limitation.
    In addition, the design and training of auxiliary problems as well as calculating SVD are too costly when the size of the unlabeled data increases.
    These facts imply that our SSL framework is rather appropriate for handling large scale unlabeled data.
