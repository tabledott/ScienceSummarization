    Using the canonical mentions when computing some features (e.g., &#8220;spell&#8221;) in the entity-mention model is probably not optimal and it is an area that needs further research.
    When the same mention-pair model is used to score the ACE 2003 evaluation data, an ACE-value is obtained on the systems mentions.
    After retrained with Chinese and Arabic data (much less training data than English), the system got and ACE-value on the system mentions of ACE 2003 evaluation data for Chinese and Arabic, respectively.
    The results for all three languages are among the top-tier submission systems.
    Details of the mention detection and coreference system can be found in (Florian et al., 2004).
    Since the mention-pair model is better, subsequent analyses are done with the mention pair model only.
    To see how each category of features affects the performance, we start with the aforementioned mentionpair model, incrementally remove each feature category, retrain the system and test it on the De
