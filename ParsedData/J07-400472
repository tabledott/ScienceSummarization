    For each equivalence class, we record the individual entry at the root of the subderivation which has the highest score for the class.
    The equivalence classes were defined so that any other individual entry cannot be part of the highest scoring derivation for the sentence.
    The score for a subderivation d is Ei &#955;ifi(d) where fi(d) is the number of times the ith feature occurs in the subderivation.
    The highest-scoring subderivations can be calculated recursively using the highest-scoring equivalence classes that were combined to create the individual entry.
    For the dependency model, the highest scoring dependency structure is required.
    Clark and Curran (2003) outline an algorithm for finding the most probable dependency structure, which keeps track of the highest scoring set of dependencies for each node in the chart.
    For a set of equivalent entries in the chart (a disjunctive node), this involves summing over all conjunctive node daughters which head sub-derivations lead
