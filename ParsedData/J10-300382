tant to examine some recent work that has been done on constructing paraphrase corpora.
    As part of this work, human subjects are generally asked to judge whether two given sentences are paraphrases of each other.
    We believe that a detailed examination of this manual evaluation task provides an illuminating insight into the nature of a paraphrase in a practical, rather than a theoretical, context.
    In addition, it has obvious implications for any method, whether manual or automatic, that is used to evaluate the performance of a paraphrase generator.
    Dolan and Brockett (2005) were the first to attempt to build a paraphrase corpus on a large scale.
    The Microsoft Research Paraphrase (MSRP) Corpus is a collection of 5,801 sentence pairs, each manually labeled with a binary judgment as to whether it constitutes a paraphrase or not.
    As a first step, the corpus was created using a heuristic extraction method in conjunction with an SVM-based classifier that was trained to select likely sententia
