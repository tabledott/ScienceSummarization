between different instances.
    This is because the number of common features between similar instances exponentially increases with size.
    This sometimes leads to overfitting in training , where a test instance very close to an instance in training data is correctly classified, and other instances are classified as a default class.
    This problem can be tackled by several heuristic approaches: i) employing a decay factor to reduce the weights of large sub-structures (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Kashima and Koyanagi, 2002). ii) substituting kernel dot products for the Gaussian function to smooth the original kernel dot products (Haussler, 1999).
    These approaches may achieve better accuracy, however, they yield neither the fast classification nor the interpretable feature space targeted by this paper.
    Moreover, we cannot give a fair comparison in terms of the same feature space.
    The selection of optimal hyperparameters, such as decay factors in the first approach and smoothing parameters in the
