ility P(h, m  |x) of each dependency.
    Our parsers are then modified to ignore any dependency (h, m) whose marginal probability is below 0.0001xmaxh' P(h', m  |x).
    Table 1 provides information on the behavior of the pruning method.
    Table 2 lists the accuracy of Models 1 and 2 on the English and Czech test sets, together with some relevant results from related work.12 The models marked &#8220;&#8224;&#8221; are not directly comparable to our work as they depend on additional sources of information that our models are trained without&#8212; unlabeled data in the case of Koo et al. (2008) and relevant results from related work.
    Note that Koo et al. (2008) is listed with standard features and semi-supervised features.

    All three of the &#8220;&#8224;&#8221; models are based on versions of the Carreras (2007) parser, so modifying these methods to work with our new third
