ords immediately to its left or right.
    Disambiguation is then performed by selecting the word in the confusion set with the highest co-occurrence frequency or probability.
    The web counts were retrieved using literal queries (see Section 2).
    Ties are resolved by comparing the unigram frequencies of the words in the confusion set and defaulting to the word with the highest one.
    Table 5 shows the types of collocations we considered and their corresponding accuracy.
    The baseline (f(t)) in Table 5 was obtained by always choosing the most frequent unigram in the confusion set.
    We used the same test set (2056 tokens from the Brown corpus) and confusion sets as Golding and Schabes (1996), Mangu and Brill (1997), and Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002).
    Table 5 shows that the best result (89.24%) for the webbased approach is obtained with a context of one word to the left and one word to the right of the target word (f (w1,t,w2)).
    The BNC-based models perform consistently worse than the web-ba
