    Generalizing from the specific error classes analyzed in the previous section, a key problem in Chinese parsing seems to be separating nonequivalent classes of IP.
    Two major classes of ambiguity are involved in IP membership: (i) the presence or absence in IP of subjects and adjuncts; and (ii) coordinate attachment of verbal material.
    We found that these ambiguities were most effectively dealt with by marking root IPs as well as those in certain sister contexts.
    Again in this case, CTB annotation practices introduce category conflations that, when reified in a PCFG, lead to false independence assumptions.
    For example, the BA marker is descriptively used in Chinese to preverbalize objects.
    Its syntax, however, is controversial (Bender, 2001).
    In the CTB, BA heads a VP and always has a unique sister IP; but that IP essentially always rewrites as NP VP.
    With these refinements of IP we achieved another 0.4% in error reduction, for a final development set figure of 82.1% LP, 83.1
