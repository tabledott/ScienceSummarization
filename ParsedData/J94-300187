ditions of application were satisfied.
    The intersection of the obligatory filters for all subrules in the batch ensures that at least one subrule is applied at each position where application is allowed.
    Thus the behavior of a left-to-right obligatory batch rule is represented by the composition Again, similar substitutions in the cascades for ordinary obligatory rules will model the behavior of right-to-left and simultaneous application.
    Using only operations that preserve the regularity of string sets and relations, we have modeled the properties of rewriting rules whose components are regular languages over an alphabet of unanalyzable symbols.
    We have thus established that every such rule denotes a regular relation.
    We now extend our analysis to rules involving regular expressions with feature matrices and finite feature variables, as in the Turkish vowel harmony rule discussed in Section 4: aback [ &#8212;consonantal +syllabic &#8212;&#8250; [ aback ] / +syllabic [ +consonantal &#8212;
