 so that a noise word for the &amp;quot;company&amp;quot; cluster may not have been in that particular cluster but may still have appeared under a &amp;quot;company&amp;quot; hypernym elsewhere in the hierarchy.
  
  
    Future work should benefit greatly by using data on the hypernyms of hypernyms.
    In our current tree, the best hypernym for the entire tree is &amp;quot;product&amp;quot;; however, many times nodes deeper in the tree are given this label also.
    For example, we have a cluster including many forms of currency, but because there is little data for these particular words, the only hypernym found was &amp;quot;product&amp;quot;.
    However, the parent of this node has the best hypernym of &amp;quot;currency&amp;quot;.
    If we knew that &amp;quot;product&amp;quot; was a hypernym of &amp;quot;currency&amp;quot;, we could detect that the parent node's label is more specific and simply absorb the child node into the parent.
    Furthermore, we may be able to use data on the hypernyms of hype
