e correspondences have a surprising characteristic: they allow the final range structure (e.g. the semantic structure) to have properties that cannot be inferred from any information present in the intermediate (f-) structure.
    But those properties can obtain only if the intermediate structure is derived from an initial (c-) structure with certain features.
    For example, Kaplan and Maxwell (1988a) exploit this capability to describe semantic structures for coordinate constructions which necessarily contain the logical conjunction appropriate to the string even though there is no reasonable place for that conjunction to be marked in the f-structure.
    In sum, this method of description, which has been called codescription, permits information from a variety of different levels to constrain a particular structure, even though there are no direct correspondences linking them together.
    It provides for modularity of basic relationships while allowing certain necessary restrictions to have their influen
