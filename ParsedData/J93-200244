    Of the 193 verbs listed above, Lerner detects 174 in the untagged version of the Brown Corpus.
    Of these 174, there are 87 for which Lerner does not find sufficient evidence to prove that they have any of the six syntactic frames in question.
    Some of these genuinely do not appear in the corpus with cues for any of the six, while others do appear with cues, but not often enough to provide reliable evidence.
    Given more text, sufficient evidence might eventually accumulate for many of these verbs.
    The 87 that were detected but not assigned any frames are as follows: account act anticipate arch attend bear bend boil bristle brush buzz cast close contain convert culminate deal
