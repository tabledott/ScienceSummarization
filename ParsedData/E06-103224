, comparing systems which employ similar translation strategies (such as comparing phrase-based statistical machine translation systems with other phrase-based statistical machine translation systems), and using Bleu as an objective function to optimize the values of parameters such as feature weights in log linear translation models, until a better metric has been proposed.
    Inappropriate uses for Bleu include comparing systems which employ radically different strategies (especially comparing phrase-based statistical machine translation systems against systems that do not employ similar n-gram-based approaches), trying to detect improvements for aspects of translation that are not modeled well by Bleu, and monitoring improvements that occur infrequently within a test corpus.
    These comments do not apply solely to Bleu.
    Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), Precision and Recall (Melamed et al., 2003), and other such automatic metrics may also be affected to a greater or lesser degree because they are a
