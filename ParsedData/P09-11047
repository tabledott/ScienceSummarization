 a constraint on A1-1 which we will argue is generally beneficial.
    The maximum scoring alignment from AITG can be found in O(n6) time with synchronous CFG parsing; in practice, we can make ITG parsing efficient using a variety of pruning techniques.
    One computational advantage of AITG over A1-1 alignments is that summation over AITG is tractable.
    The corresponding dynamic program allows us to utilize likelihoodbased objectives for learning alignment models (see Section 4).
    Using the same heuristic Dice potentials on the Hansards test set, the maximal scoring alignment from AITG yields 28.4 AER&#8212;2.4 better than A1-1 &#8212;indicating that ITG can be beneficial as a constraint on heuristic alignments.
    An important alignment pattern disallowed by A1-1 is the many-to-one alignment block.
    While not prevalent in our hand-aligned French Hansards dataset, blocks occur frequently in our handaligned Chinese-English NIST data.
    Figure 1 contains an example.
