    Experiments were conducted on the NIST 2008 translation tasks under the conditions of the constrained data track for the language pairs Arabicto-English (aren), English-to-Chinese (enzh), and Chinese-to-English (zhen).
    The development corpora were compiled from test data used in the 2002 and 2004 NIST evaluations.
    Each corpus set provides 4 reference translations per source sentence.
    Table 1 summarizes some corpus statistics.
    Translation results were evaluated using the mixedcase BLEU score metric in the implementation as suggested by (Papineni et al., 2001).
    Translation results were produced with a state-ofthe-art phrase-based SMT system which uses EMtrained word alignment models (IBM1, HMM) and a 5-gram language model built from the Web-1T collection2.
    Translation hypotheses produced on the blind test data were reranked using the MinimumBayes Risk (MBR) decision rule (Kumar and Byrne, 2004; Tromble et al., 2008).
    Each system uses a logli
