ropean languages, there is some regularity in how syntax is expressed, e.g., primarily SVO, prepositional, etc.
    Even though there are some differences with respect to relative location of certain word classes, strong head-modifier POS tag preferences can still help resolve these, especially when no other viable alternatives are available.
    Consider for example an artificial sentence with a tag sequence: &#8216;VERB NOUN ADJ DET PUNC&#8217;.
    The English parser still predicts that the NOUN and PUNC modify the VERB and the ADJ and DET modify the NOUN, even though in the English data such noun phrases are unlikely.5 Unlike most language transfer systems for parsers, the direct transfer approach does not rely on projecting syntax across aligned parallel corpora (modulo the fact that non-gold tags come from a system that uses parallel corpora).
    In this section we describe a simple mechanism for projecting from the direct transfer system using large amounts of parallel data in a similar vein to Hwa et
