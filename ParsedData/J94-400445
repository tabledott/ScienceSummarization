 any position in the RLCS.
  Because the notion of conflation is not meaningful in non-leaf node positions, it would be unreasonable to make the assumption that every non-leaf position without the * marker is conflated.
  The :CONFLATED marker is used to identify truly conflated positions, not just those positions without the * marker.
  614 Bonnie J. Dorr Machine Translation Divergences 4.6 Categorial Divergence Unlike the previous five divergence types, categorial divergence affects the operation of the C$/~, not the ~?T4.
  It is characterized by a situation in which CAT(0) is forced to have a different value than would normally be assigned to T(~ ~) by means of the mapping specified in Figure 7.
  Thus, categorial divergence is formally described as follows: a lexical-semantic type T(~) is related to a syntactic category CAT(~), where CAT(~) ~ CST4(T(~)).
  In such a case, CAT(~) must be specified through lexical parameterization.
  An example of categorial divergence is the case given earlier in (6).
