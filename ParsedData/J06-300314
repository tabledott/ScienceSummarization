ever, experiments do not support this intuition.
    Several algorithms have been evaluated using 80 multiple-choice synonym questions taken from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).
    An example of one of the 80 TOEFL questions appears in Table 2.
    Table 3 shows the best performance on the TOEFL questions for each type of attributional similarity algorithm.
    The results support the claim that lexicon-based algorithms have no advantage over corpus-based algorithms for recognizing synonymy.
    We may distinguish near analogies (mason:stone::carpenter:wood) from far analogies (traffic:street::water:riverbed) (Gentner 1983; Medin, Goldstone, and Gentner 1990).
    In an analogy A:B::C:D, where there is a high degree of relational similarity between A:B and C:D, if there is also a high degree of attributional similarity between A and C, and between B and D, then A:B::C:D is a near analogy; otherwise, it is a far analogy.
    It seems possible that SAT analogy questions might consist largely
