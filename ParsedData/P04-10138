the parse at the time when decision di is chosen.
    The parameters of this model differ from those of the generative model only in that they include the lookahead string in the conditional.
    Although maximizing the joint probability is the same as maximizing the conditional probability, the fact that they have different parameters means that estimating one can be much harder than estimating the other.
    In general we would expect that estimating the joint probability would be harder than estimating the conditional probability, because the joint probability contains more information than the conditional probability.
    In particular, the probability distribution over sentences can be derived from the joint probability distribution, but not from the conditional one.
    However, the unbounded nature of the parsing problem means that the individual parameters of the discriminative model are much harder to estimate than those of the generative model.
    The parameters of the discriminative model include
