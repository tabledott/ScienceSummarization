nment generated by the MSA algorithm&#8212;which may lead to the generation of grammatically incorrect sentences&#8212;by using informative syntactic features.
    In their approach, even if two words are a lexical match&#8212;as defined by Barzilay and Lee (2003)&#8212;they are further inspected in terms of certain pre-defined syntactic features.
    Therefore, when computing the alignment similarity score, two lexically matched words across a sentence pair are not considered to fully match unless their score on syntactic features also exceeds a preset threshold.
    The syntactic features constituting the additional constraints are defined in terms of the output of a chunk parser.
    Such a parser takes as input the syntactic trees of the sentences in a topic cluster and provides the following information for each word: With this information and a heuristic to compute the similarity between two words in terms of their POS and IOB tags, the alignment similarity score can be calculated as the sum of the heur
