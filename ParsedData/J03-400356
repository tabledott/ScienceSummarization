achment points (the chances of seeing a PP modifier are 15.8% and 1.73% in columns 1 and 5 of the table, respectively).
    In example (5), the probability of seeing an NP (adjunct) modifier to do in a nonadjacent but non-verbcrossing environment is 2.11% in sections 2&#8211;21 of the treebank (8 out of 379 cases); in contrast, the chance of seeing an NP adjunct modifying said across a verb is 0.026% (1 out of 3,778 cases).
    The two probabilities differ by a factor of almost 80.
    Figures 16 and 17 show some alternative styles of syntactic annotation.
    The Penn Treebank annotation style tends to leave trees quite flat, typically with one level of structure for each X-bar level; at the other extreme are completely binary-branching representations.
    The two annotation styles are in some sense equivalent, in that it is easy to define a one-to-one mapping between them.
    But crucially, two different annotation styles may lead to quite different parsing accuracies for a given model, even if the two re
