m 2,000 to 5,000 sentences of both English and French per hour on an IBM RS/6000 53011 workstation.
    The alignment algorithm lends itself well to parallelization; we can use the deletion identification mechanism to automatically identify locations where we can subdivide a bilingual corpus.
    While it required on the order of 500 machine-hours to align the newer Hansard corpus, it took only 1.5 days of real time to complete the job on fifteen machines.
  
  
    We have described an accurate, robust, and fast algorithm for sentence alignment.
    The algorithm can handle large deletions in text, it is language independent, and it is parallelizable.
    It requires a minimum of human intervention; for each language pair 100 sentences need to be aligned by hand to bootstrap the translation model.
    The use of lexical information requires a great computational cost.
    Even with numerous approximations, this algorithm is tens of times slower than the Brown and Gale algorithms.
    This is acceptable given
