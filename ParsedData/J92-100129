    The use of :PREF and :RELS.
    The top ten co-occurences with take. and the verb-complement combination make the team are both collocation-inducing expressions.
    Excluded from this classification are unstructured associations among senses that establish the general semantic context, for example, courtroom/defendant.
    (We will discuss this type of association in the next section.)
    Collocations often introduce dynamic word senses, i.e., ones that behave compositionally, but occur only in the context of the expression, making it inappropriate for the system to consider them outside that context.
    For example, the collocation hang from triggers a sense of from that marks an INSTRUMENT.
    In other cases, a collocation simply creates preferences for selected core senses, as in the pairing of the 'opportunit
