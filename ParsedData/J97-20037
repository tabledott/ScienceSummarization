    Sequential string-to-string transducers are used in various areas of natural language processing.
    Both determinization (Mohri 1994c) and minimization algorithms (Mohri 1994b) have been defined for the class of p-subsequential transducers, which includes sequential string-to-string transducers.
    In this section, the theoretical basis of the use of sequential transducers is described.
    Classical and new theorems help to indicate the usefulness of these devices as well as their characterization.
    We consider here sequential transducers, namely, transducers with a deterministic input.
    At any state of such transducers, at most one outgoing arc is labeled with a given element of the alphabet.
    Figure 1 gives an example of a sequential transducer.
    Notice that output labels might be strings, including the empty string E. The empty string is not allowed on input, however.
    The output of a sequential transducer is
