			The first loop ex tracts features from the sentence xi and maps the features to numbers.
			The numbers are grouped into three vectors for the features of all possible edges ?h,d, possible edges in combination withsiblings ?h,d,s and in combination with grandchil 90 te+s tr tp ta rest total te pars.
