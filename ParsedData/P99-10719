dentify theme intersections, sentences must be compared.
    To do this, we need a sentence representation that emphasizes sentence features that are relevant for comparison such as dependencies between sentence constituents, while ignoring irrelevant features such as constituent ordering.
    Since predicateargument structure is a natural way to represent constituent dependencies, we chose a dependency based representation called DSYNT (Kittredge and Mel'aik, 1983).
    An example of a sentence and its DSYNT tree is shown in Figure 3.
    Each non-auxiliary word in the sentence has a node in the DSYNT tree, and this node is connected to its direct dependents.
    Grammatical features of each word are also kept in the node.
    In order to facilitate comparison, words are kept in canonical form.
    In order to construct a DSYNT we first run our sentences through Collin's robust, statistical parser (Collins, 1996).
    We developed a rulebased component that transforms the phrasestructure output of the parser
