The GENIA event annotation was made based on the GENIA event ontology, which uses a loose typing system for the arguments of each event class.
    For example, in Figure 2(a), it is expressed that the binding event involves two proteins, TRAF2 and CD40, and that, in the case of CD40, its cytoplasmic domain takes part in the binding.
    Without constraints on the type of theme arguments, the following two annotations are both legitimate: The two can be seen as specifying the same event at different levels of specificity1.
    Although both alternatives are reasonable, the need to have consistent training and evaluation data requires a consistent choice to be made for the shared task.
    Thus, we fix the types of all non-event primary arguments to be proteins (specifically GGPs).
    For GENIA event annotations involving themes other than proteins, additional argument types were introduced, for example, as follows: Note that the protein, CD40, and its domain, cytoplasmic domain, are associated by argument num
