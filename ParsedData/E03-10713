cG) (Clark, 2002).
    Elimination of the correction feature and use of appropriate smoothing methods result in state of the art performance for both tagging tasks.
  
  
    A conditional ME model, also known as a loglinear model, has the following form: where the functions fi are the features of the model, the A, are the parameters, or weights, and Z(x) is a normalisation constant.
    This form can be derived by choosing the model with maximum entropy (i.e. the most uniform model) from a set of models that satisfy a certain set of constraints.
    The constraints are that the expected value of each feature fi according to the model p is equal to some value Ki (Rosenfeld, 1996): Calculating the expected value according to p requires summing over all contexts x, which is not possible in practice.
    Therefore we use the now standard approximation (Rosenfeld, 1996): where p(x) is the relative frequency of context x in the data.
    This is convenient because p(x) is zero for all those events not seen in the
