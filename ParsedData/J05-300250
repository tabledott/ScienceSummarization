    Table 7 also reveals a downside of the fusion algorithm: Automatically generated sentences contain grammatical errors, unlike fully extracted, human-written sentences.
    Given the high sensitivity of humans to processing ungrammatical sentences, one has to consider the benefits of flexible information selection against the decrease in readability of the generated sentences.
    Sentence fusion may not be a worthy direction to pursue if low grammaticality is intrinsic to the algorithm and its correction requires 14 We cannot apply kappa statistics (Siegel and Castellan 1988) for measuring agreement in the content selection task since the event space is not well-defined.
    This prevents us from computing the probability of random agreement.
    Evaluation results for a human-crafted fusion sentence (RFA2), our system output, the shortest sentence in the theme (baseline 1), the basis sentence (baseline 2), and a simplified version of our algorithm without paraphrasing information (baseline 3). knowl
