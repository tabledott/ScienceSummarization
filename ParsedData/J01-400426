re score on the test documents is statistically significant.5 We found that at the 95% significance level (p = 0.05), our system performed better than three MUC-6 systems, and as well as the rest of the MUC-6 systems.
    Using the Coreference scores of MUC-7 systems and our system. same significance level, our system performed better than four MUC-7 systems, and as well as the rest of the MUC-7 systems.
    Our result is encouraging since it indicates that a learning approach using relatively shallow features can achieve scores comparable to those of systems built using nonlearning approaches.
    It should be noted that the accuracy of our coreference resolution engine depends to a large extent on the performance of the NLP modules that are executed before the coreference engine.
    Our current learning-based, HMM named entity recognition module is trained on 318 documents (a disjoint set from both the MUC-6 and MUC-7 test documents) tagged with named entities, and its score on the MUC-6 named entity task
