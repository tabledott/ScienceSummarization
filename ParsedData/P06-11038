nsiderable knowledge of the languages.
    For example, (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Jung et al., 2000) train English-Arabic and EnglishKorean generative transliteration models, respectively.
    (Knight and Graehl, 1997) build a generative model for backward transliteration from Japanese to English.
    While generative models are often robust, they tend to make independence assumptions that do not hold in data.
    The discriminative learning framework argued for in (Roth, 1998; Roth, 1999) as an alternative to generative models is now used widely in NLP, even in the context of word alignment (Taskar et al., 2005; Moore, 2005).
    We make use of it here too, to learn a discriminative transliteration model that requires little knowledge of the target language.
    We extend our preliminary work in (Klementiev and Roth, 2006) to discover multi-word Named Entities and to take advantage of a dictionary (if one exists) to handle NEs which are partially or entirely translated.
    We take advantage of dynamica
