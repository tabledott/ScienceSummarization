  Centering: A Framework For Modeling The Local Coherence Of Discourse

    This paper attempts to meet that need.
    To accomplish this goal, we have chosen to remove descriptions of many open research questions posed in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) as well as solutions that were only partially developed.

    The paper examines interactions between local coherence and choice of referring expressions; it argues that differences in coherence
