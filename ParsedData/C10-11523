 essary to consider the simplification process as a combination of different operations and treatthem as a whole.
			However, most of the existing models only consider one of these operations.
			Siddharthan (2006) and Petersen and Ostendorf (2007) focus on sentence splitting, while sen tence compression systems (Filippova and Strube, 2008a) mainly use the dropping operation.
			As faras lexical simplification is concerned, word substitution is usually done by selecting simpler syn onyms from Wordnet based on word frequency (Carroll et al, 1999).In this paper, we propose a sentence simplifica tion model by tree transformation which is based 1353 on techniques from statistical machine translation (SMT) (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Yamada andKnight, 2002; Graehl et al, 2008).
			Our model in tegrally covers splitting, dropping, reordering and phrase/word substitution.
			The parameters of ourmodel can be efficiently learned from complex simple parallel datasets.
