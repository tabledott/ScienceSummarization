very-non-parallel data.
    Recent work (Munteanu et al., 2004, Zhao and Vogel, 2002) on extracting parallel sentences from comparable data, and others on extracting paraphrasing sentences from monolingual corpora (Barzilay and Elhadad 2003) are based on the &#8220;find-topic-extract-sentence&#8221; principle which claims that parallel sentences only exist in document pairs with high similarity.
    They all use lexical information (e.g. word overlap, cosine similarity) to match documents first, before extracting sentences from these documents.
    However, the non-parallel corpora used so far in the previous work tend to be quite comparable.
    Zhao and Vogel (2002) used a corpus of Chinese and English versions of news stories from the Xinhua News agency, with &#8220;roughly similar sentence order of content&#8221;.
    This corpus can be more accurately described as noisy parallel corpus.
    Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) mined paraphrasing sentences from weather reports.
    Munteanu et al., (2004) used new
