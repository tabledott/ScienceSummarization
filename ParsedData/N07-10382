ependencies between users&#8217; judgments across different aspects.
    Knowledge of these dependencies can be crucial in predicting accurate ranks, as a user&#8217;s opinions on one aspect can influence his or her opinions on others.
    The algorithm presented in this paper models the dependencies between different labels via the agreement relation.
    The agreement relation captures whether the user equally likes all aspects of the item or whether he or she expresses different degrees of satisfaction.
    Since this relation can often be determined automatically for a given text (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), we can readily use it to improve rank prediction.
    The Good Grief model consists of a ranking model for each aspect as well as an agreement model which predicts whether or not all rank aspects are 'In this paper, ranking refers to the task of assigning an integer from 1 to k to each instance.
    This task is sometimes referred to as &#8220;ordinal regression&#8221; (Crammer and Singer, 2001) and &#
