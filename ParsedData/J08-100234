    Signs with predicate&#8211;argument structures.
    Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 1 Monotonicity: All relations in the daughters&#8217; predicate&#8211;argument structures are percolated to the mother.
    That is, none of the predicate&#8211;argument relations in the daughter phrases disappear in the mother.
    Thus predicate&#8211;argument structures of descendent phrases can be located at lower nodes in a feature forest.
    Predicate&#8211;argument structures usually satisfy the above conditions, even when they include non-local dependencies.
    For example, Figure 15 shows HPSG lexical entries for the wh-extraction of the object of love (left) and for the control construction of try (right).
    The first condition is satisfied because both lexical entries refer to CONT|HOOK of argument signs in SUBJ, COMPS, and SLASH.
    None of the lexical entries directly access ARGX of the arguments.
    The second condition is also satisfied because the values
