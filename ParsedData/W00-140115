Ten subjects who were researchers from AT&amp;T carried out the experiment.
    Each subject made a total of 24 judgments.
    Given the variance between subjects we first normalized the data.
    We subtracted the mean score for each subject from each observed score and then divided this by standard deviation of the scores for that subject.
    As expected our data showed strong correlations between normalized understanding and quality judgments for each sentence variant (r(2)) = 0.94. p &lt; 0.0001).
    Our main hypothesis is that the two tree-based metrics correlate better with both understandability and quality than the string-based metrics.
    This was confirmed.
    Correlations of the two string metrics with normalized understanding for each sentence variant were not significant (r(n = 0.08 and r(,) = 0.23, for simple accuracy and generation accuracy: for both p &gt; 0.05).
    In contrast both of the tree metrics were significant.
    (r(p,) = 0.51 and r(2)) = 0.48: for tree accuracy and generation
