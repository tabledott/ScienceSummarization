hich has the effect that all left dependents are first recognized inside-out, followed by all right dependents, also inside-out, which coincides with the head-driven constituency parsing model of Collins (1999).
    We use the popular online learning algorithm of structured perceptron with parameter averaging (Collins, 2002).
    Following Collins and Roark (2004) we also use the &#8220;early-update&#8221; strategy, where an update happens whenever the goldstandard action-sequence falls off the beam, with the rest of the sequence neglected.
    As a special case, for the deterministic mode, updates always co-occur with the first mistake made.
    The intuition behind this strategy is that future mistakes are often caused by previous ones, so with the parser on the wrong track, future actions become irrelevant for learning.
