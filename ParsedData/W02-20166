c features related to the modifier and modifiee, and the output from the model is either of the tags (D or O).
    In training, the model simulates the parsing algorithm by consulting the correct answer from the training annotated corpus.
    During the training, positive (D) and negative (O) examples are collected.
    In testing, the model consults the trained system and parses the input with the cascaded chunking algorithm.
    We think this proposed cascaded chunking model has the following advantages compared with the traditional probabilistic models.
    If we use the CYK algorithm, the probabilistic model requires O(n3) parsing time, (where n is the number of segments in a sentence.).
    On the other hand, the cascaded chunking model requires O(n2) in the worst case when all segments modify the rightmost segment.
    The actual parsing time is usually lower than O(n2), since most of segments modify segment on its immediate right hand side.
    Furthermore, in the cascaded chunking model, the training
