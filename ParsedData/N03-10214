ir of the link on the LHS.
    Each component of the heir link inherits the lexical head of its parent nonterminal.
    An of a derivation is in Figure 1. nonterminal always lexicalized with the ternonterminals may also be lexicalized represent empty categories.
    The special start nonterminal $ is lexicalized with the special start terminal S. Following Eisner ..4z Satta (1999), we can then that the language of interest is actually : Q'$ E (3) ix[1, 2] (S[fed] $[S] 0.1[1,2] [1, 2, 3] ( NP[cat] [1, 2] S[kormil] [1, 2] [1,3, 2] NP[kota]) S[S]) 0.1[1, 2] [1, 0.1[1,2] N[cat] 2] [1, 3, 2] Pro[ya] V[kormil] [1] ) S[S]) ix[1, 2] [1, 2, 3] ( I fed ) (the cat )) $) 0.1[1, 2] ( (I fed the cat) $) I fed the cat $ 2] [1, 3, 2] ya kormil [1] $ kota kormil) s) kota kormil Figure 1: A 2-L2MTG derivation in English and transliterated Russian: (4-5) DEPEND productions; (6) YIELD productions, followed by rendering. and superclasses of MTG have been studied before.
