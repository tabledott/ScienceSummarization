 classifier to perform disambiguation.
    This paper presents a corpus&#8212;based approach that results in high accuracy by combining a number of very simple classifiers into an ensemble that performs disambiguation via a majority vote.
    This is motivated by the observation that enhancing the feature set or learning algorithm used in a corpus&#8212;based approach does not usually improve disambiguation accuracy beyond what can be attained with shallow lexical features and a simple supervised learning algorithm.
    For example, a Naive Bayesian classifier (Duda and Hart, 1973) is based on a blanket assumption about the interactions among features in a sensetagged corpus and does not learn a representative model.
    Despite making such an assumption, this proves to be among the most accurate techniques in comparative studies of corpus&#8212;based word sense disambiguation methodologies (e.g., (Leacock et al., 1993), (Mooney, 1996), (Ng and Lee, 1996), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997)).
