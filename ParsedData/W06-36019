 [asleep]1 by [sunset]2 . and translate it into Chinese as a passive voice.
    This produces very odd Chinese translation, because here &#8220;was A by B&#8221; in the English sentence is not a passive construction.
    By contrast, our model applies rule r3 only if A is a past participle (VBN) and B is a noun phrase (NP-C).
    This example also shows that, one-level SCFG rule, even if informed by the Treebank as in (Yamada and Knight, 2001), is not enough to capture a common construction like this which is five levels deep (from VP to &#8220;by&#8221;).
    There are also some variations of syntax-directed translators where dependency structures are used in place of constituent trees (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al., 2005).
    Although they share with this work the basic motivations and similar speed-up, it is difficult to specify re-ordering information within dependency elementary structures, so they either resort to heuristics (Lin) or a separate ordering model for linearization (the oth
