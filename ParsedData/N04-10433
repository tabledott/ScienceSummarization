ally reduce the number of annotated examples required.
    However, we also hoped that a third technique, active learning (Cohn et al., 1996; McCallum and Nigam, 1998), would be particularly effective when used in conjunction with hierarchical word clusters.
    Specifically, active learning attempts to select examples for annotation by estimating the system's certainty about the answer, requesting a human judgment only for those cases where it is most uncertain.
    Unfortunately, the issue often comes down to whether a specific word has previously been observed in training: if the system has seen the word, it is certain, if not, it is uncertain.
    Word clusters at various scales, we hoped, would permit more subtle distinctions to influence the system's certainty, increasing the method&#8217;s effectiveness earlier in the process when fewer training examples have been annotated.
  
  
    We view clustering here as a method for estimating the probabilities of low frequency events, particularly events that
