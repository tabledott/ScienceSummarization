n the same language indirectly with the second language as a bridge.
    Their approach builds on one of the initial steps used to train a phrase-based statistical machine translation system (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003).
    Such systems rely on phrase tables&#8212;a tabulation of correspondences between phrases in the source language and phrases in the target language.
    These tables are usually extracted by inducing word alignments between sentence pairs in a training corpus and then incrementally building longer phrasal correspondences from individual words and shorter phrases.
    Once such a tabulation of bilingual phrasal correspondences is available, correspondences between phrases in one language may be inferred simply by using the phrases in the other language as pivots.
    Algorithm 5 shows how monolingual phrasal correspondences are extracted from a bilingual corpus C by using word alignments.
    Steps 3&#8211;7 extract bilingual phrasal correspondences from each sentence pair in the corpus by
