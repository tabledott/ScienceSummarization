is a LN candidate because it ends in a LN keyword &#27743; &#8216;river&#8217;.
    The generative probability of the string given it is a LN would be estimated as P(&#20044;&#33487;&#37324;&#27743; |LN) = P(&#20044;|&lt;LN&gt;) P(&#33487;|&#20044;) P(&#37324;|&#33487;) P(&#27743;|&#37324;) P(&lt;/LN&gt;|&#27743;), where &lt;LN&gt; and &lt;/LN&gt; are symbols denoting the beginning and the end of a LN, respectively.
    ONs are more difficult to identify than PNs and LNs because ONs are usually nested named entities.
    Consider an ON &#20013;&#22269;&#22269;&#38469;&#33322;&#31354;&#20844;&#21496; &#8216;Air China Corporation&#8217;; it contains an LN &#20013;&#22269; &#8216;China&#8217;.
    Like the identification of LNs, an ON candidate is only generated given a character string S&#8217; (less than 15 characters long), if it ends in a keyword in a 1,355-entry ON keyword list such as &#20844;&#21496; &#8216;corporation&#8217;.
    To estimate the generative probability of a nested ON, we introduce word cl
