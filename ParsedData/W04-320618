 template cannot be further enlarged without reducing its sentence set.
    GSL performs template extraction in two main steps: (1) build a compact graph representation of all the parse graphs from S; (2) extract templates from the compact representation.
    A compact graph representation is an aggregate graph which joins all the sentence graphs from S ensuring that all identical spanning sub-structures from different sentences are merged into a single one.
    Therefore, each vertex v (respectively, edge e) in the aggregate graph is either a copy of a corresponding vertex (edge) from a sentence graph Pi or it represents the merging of several identically labeled vertices (edges) from different sentences in S. The set of such sentences is defined as the sentence set of v (e), and is represented through the set of index numbers of related sentences (e.g.
    &#8220;(1,2)&#8221; in the third tree of Figure 2).
    We will denote with Gi the compact graph representation of the first i sentences in S. The parse
