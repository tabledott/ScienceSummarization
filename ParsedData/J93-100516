to observed frequencies that has the right general properties, though it is not likely to be a very good estimate when frequencies are small.
    For our purposes, however&#8212;exploring in general the relation of distribution in a corpus to attachment disambiguation&#8212;we believe it is sufficient.
    Other approaches to adjusting small frequencies are discussed in Church et al. (1991) and Gale, Church, Yarowsky (in press).
    The idea is to use the typical association rates of nouns and verbs to interpolate our probabilities.
    Where f (N , p) = En f (n,p), f (V , p) = E, f (v, p), f (N) = En f (n) and 4 The nonintegral count for send is a consequence of the data-splitting step Ambiguous Attach 2, and the definition of unigram frequencies as a sum of bigram frequencies.
    5 An advantage of the likelihood ratio approach is that we can use it in a Bayesian discrimination framework to take into account other factors that might influence our decision about attachment (see Gale, Church, and Yarowsky [in
