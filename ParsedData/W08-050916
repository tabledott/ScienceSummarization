s property makes it very simple to integrate MGIZA++ into machine translation packages, such as Moses(Koehn et al., 2007).
    One major disadvantage of MGIZA++ is also obvious: lack of scalability.
    Accelerating is limited by the number of CPUs the node has.
    Compared to PGIZA++ on the speed-up factor by each additional CPU, MGIZA++ also shows some deficiency.
    Due to the need for synchronization, there are always some CPU time wasted in waiting.
  
  
    For PGIZA++ we performed training on an ChineseEnglish translation task.
    The dataset consists of approximately 10 million sentence pairs with 231 million Chinese words and 258 million English words.
    We ran both GIZA++ and PGIZA++ on the same training corpus with the same parameters, then ran Pharaoh phrase extraction on the resulting alignments.
    Finally, we tuned our translation systems on the NIST MT03 test set and evaluate them on NIST MT06 test set.
    The experiment was performed on a cluster of several Xeon CPUs, the storage of c
