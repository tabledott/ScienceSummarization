   If we intersect the two alignments, we get a high-precision alignment of high-confidence alignment points.
    If we take the union of the two alignments, we get a high-recall alignment with additional alignment points.
    We explore the space between intersection and union with expansion heuristics that start with the intersection and add additional alignment points.
    The decision which points to add may depend on a number of criteria: In which alignment does the potential alignment point exist?
    Foreign-English or English-foreign?
    Does the potential point neighbor already established points?
    Does &#8220;neighboring&#8221; mean directly adjacent (blockdistance), or also diagonally adjacent?
    Is the English or the foreign word that the potential point connects unaligned so far?
    Are both unaligned?
    What is the lexical probability for the potential point?
    The base heuristic [Och et al., 1999] proceeds as follows: We start with intersection of the two word alignments.
    We only
