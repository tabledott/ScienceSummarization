 state can serve as an English grammar.
    Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce norder statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing n, to matching the output of an English grammar.&amp;quot; [Chomsky, p. 113] Chomslcy's conclusion was based on the observation that constructions such as: have long distance dependencies that span across any fixed length window n. Thus, ngram models are clearly inadequate for many natural language applications.
    However, for the tagging application, the ngram approximation may be acceptable since long distance dependencies do not seem to be very important.
    Statistical ngram models were quite popular in the 1950s, and have been regaining popularity over the past few years.
    The IBM speech group is perhaps the strongest advocate of ngram methods, especially in other applications such as speech recognition.
    Robert Mercer (private communication, 1982) has experimented with the tagging application, using a res
