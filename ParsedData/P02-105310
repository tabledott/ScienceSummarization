    This work is most closely related to Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown&#8217;s (1997) work on predicting the semantic orientation of adjectives.
    They note that there are linguistic constraints on the semantic orientations of adjectives in conjunctions.
    As an example, they present the following three sentences (Hatzivassiloglou &amp; McKeown, 1997): The third sentence is incorrect, because we use &#8220;and&#8221; with adjectives that have the same semantic orientation (&#8220;simple&#8221; and &#8220;well-received&#8221; are both positive), but we use &#8220;but&#8221; with adjectives that have different semantic orientations (&#8220;simplistic&#8221; is negative).
    Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) use a four-step supervised learning algorithm to infer the semantic orientation of adjectives from constraints on conjunctions: This algorithm classifies adjectiv
