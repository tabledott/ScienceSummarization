    For the sentence in 3, the classifiers assign the class F-scope to indicate, L-scope to NF(P), and NONE to the rest of tokens.
    A fourth classifier is a metalearner that uses the predictions of the three classifiers to predict the scope classes.
    An instance represents a pair of a hedge cue and a token from the sentence.
    This means that all tokens in a sentence are paired with all hedge cues that occur in the sentence.
    Hedge cues are those that have been classified as such in the previous phase.
    Only sentences that have hedge cues are selected for this phase.
    The three object classifiers that provi
