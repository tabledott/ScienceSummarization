 was done in a suboptimal word-by-word process, i.e., disambiguating words one at a time.
    Recently, graph-based methods for knowledgebased WSD have gained much attention in the NLP community (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007; Navigli and Lapata, 2007; Mihalcea, 2005; Agirre and Soroa, 2008).
    These methods use well-known graph-based techniques to find and exploit the structural properties of the graph underlying a particular LKB.
    Because the graph is analyzed as a whole, these techniques have the remarkable property of being able to find globally optimal solutions, given the relations between entities.
    Graphbased WSD methods are particularly suited for disambiguating word sequences, and they manage to exploit the interrelations among the senses in the given context.
    In this sense, they provide a principled solution to the exponential explosion problem, with excellent performance.
    Graph-based WSD is performed over a graph composed by senses (nodes) and relations between pairs of senses (edges).
