nificant impact, especially on recall, because the reference lattices include paths where Fugenelemente have been deleted.
  
  
    We now review experiments using segmentation lattices produced by the segmentation model we just introduced in German-English, Hungarian-English, and Turkish-English translation tasks and then show results elucidating the effect of the lattice density parameter.
    We begin with a description of our MT system.
    For all experiments, we used a 5-gram English language model trained on the AFP and Xinua portions of the Gigaword v3 corpus (Graff et al., 2007) with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995).
    The training, development, and test data for German-English and Hungarian-English systems used were distributed as part of the 2009 EACL Workshop on Machine Translation,4 and the Turkish-English data corresponds to the training and test sets used in the work of Oflazer and Durgar ElKahlout (2007).
    Corpus statistics for all language pairs are summarized in Tab
