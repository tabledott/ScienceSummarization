    However, we can confidently claim that interpreting the vectors is not trivial.
    Turney and Littman (2005) used 64 manually generated patterns, whereas LRA uses 4,000 automatically generated patterns.
    We know from Section 6.5 that the automatically generated patterns are significantly better than the manually generated patterns.
    It may be interesting to see how many of the manually generated patterns appear within the automatically generated patterns.
    If we require an exact match, 50 of the 64 manual patterns can be found in the automatic patterns.
    If we are lenient about wildcards, and count the pattern not the as matching * not the (for example), then 60 of the 64 manual patterns appear within the automatic patterns.
    This suggests that the improvement in performance with the automatic patterns is due to the increased quantity of patterns, rather than a qualitative difference in the patterns.
    Turney and Littman (2005) point out that some of their 64 patterns have been used by
