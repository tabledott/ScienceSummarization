			The comparisons are performed separately for each of the subsets of GI-H4 that are characterized by adifferent distance from the core of the lexical cat egory of sentiment.
	
	
			WordNet Entries Word lists for sentiment tagging applications can be compiled using different methods.
			Automatic methods of sentiment annotation at the word level can be grouped into two major categories: (1) corpus-based approaches and (2) dictionary-based3We use the term crisp set to refer to traditional, non fuzzy sets 210 approaches.
			The first group includes methods that rely on syntactic or co-occurrence patternsof words in large texts to determine their sentiment (e.g., (Turney and Littman, 2002; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Grefenstette et al, 2004) and oth ers).
			The majority of dictionary-based approaches use WordNet information, especially, synsets and hierarchies, to acquire sentiment-marked words (Hu and Liu, 2004; Valitutti et al, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004) or
