of its contribution is particularly interesting when it is in conflict with some other factor such as grammatical  function or topic marking.
  This will be discussed further in Section 5.
  Initial Center Instantiation INITIAL CENTER INSTANTIATION is a process by which a discourse entity introduced in a segment-initial utterance becomes the Cb.
  In our framework, this happens as a side effect of the Centering Algorithm.
  Typically, when an interpretation is found for the second utterance in a discourse segment, the Cb becomes instantiated.
  The Cb of an initial utterance Ui is treated as a variable that is then unified with whatever Cb is assigned to the subsequent utterance Ui+l.
  Typically, a discourse entity is introduced as a ga-marked subject, and then is referred to by a zero in a subsequent utterance (Clancy and Downing 1987).
  Consider example 29.
  18 The zero may be interpreted as indirectly referring to the speaker.
  This interpretation is always possible when the verb kureru is used: the us
