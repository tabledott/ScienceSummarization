ty derivation, which is the standard practice in SMT, or for the maximum probability translation which is what we actually want from our model, i.e. the best translation.
    The results clearly indicate the value in optimising translations, rather than derivations.
    Maxtranslation decoding for the model trained on single derivations has only a small positive effect, while for the latent variable model the impact is much larger.6 For example, our max-derivation model trained on the Europarl data translates carte sur la table as on the table card.
    This error in the reordering of card (which is an acceptable translation of carte) is due to the rule (X) &#8212;* (carte X 1, X 1 card) being the highest scoring rule for carte.
    This is reasonable, as carte is a noun, which in the training data, is often observed with a trailing adjective which needs to be reordered when translating into English.
    In the example there is no adjective, but the simple hierarchical grammar cannot detect this.
    The max-
