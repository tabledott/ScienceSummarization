valence relations involving explicit representations of targetlanguage NCCs are more useful than fertility distributions for applications that do translation by table lookup.
    Many authors (e.g.
    Daille et al., 1994; Smadja et al., 1996) define &amp;quot;collocations&amp;quot; in terms of monolingual frequency and part-of-speech patterns.
    Markedly high frequency is a necessary property of NCCs, because otherwise they would fall out of use.
    However, at least for translationrelated applications, it is not a sufficient property.
    Non-compositional translation cannot be detected reliably without looking at translational distributions.
    The deficiency of criteria that ignore translational distributions is illustrated by their propensity to validate most personal names as &amp;quot;collocations.&amp;quot; At least among West European languages, translations of the vast majority of personal names are perfectly compositional.
