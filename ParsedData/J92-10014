n retrieval systems (Krovetz 1989).
    The primary goal of this paper, then, is to describe in detail methods and knowledge that will enable a language analyzer to tag each word with its sense.
    To demonstrate that the approach is sufficiently robust for practical tasks, the article will also discuss the incorporation of the approach into an existing system, TRUMP (Jacobs 1986, 1987, 1989), and the application of it to unrestricted texts.
    The principles that make up the approach are completely general, however, and not just specific to TRUMP.
    An analyzer whose tasks include word-sense tagging must be able to take an input text, determine the concept that each word or phrase denotes, and identify the role relationships that link these concepts.
    Because determining this information accurately is knowledge-intensive, the analyzer should be as flexible as possible, requiring a minimum amount of customization for different domains.
    One way to gain such flexibility is give the system enough gene
