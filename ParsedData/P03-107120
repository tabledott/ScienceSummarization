ibutions are normalized to form two probability distributions l and r, and significant changes of speakership are detected by computing their Jensen-Shannon divergence: where D(l||r) is the KL-divergence between the two distributions.
    Lexical cohesion: we also incorporated the lexical cohesion function computed by LCseg as a feature of the multi-source segmenter in a manner similar to the knowledge source combination performed by (Beeferman et al., 1999) and (T&#168;ur et al., 2001).
    Note that we use both the posterior estimate computed by LCseg and the raw lexical cohesion function as features of the system.
    For every potential boundary BZ, the classifier analyzes features in a window surrounding BZ to decide whether it is a topic boundary or not.
    It is generally unclear what is the optimal window size and how features should be analyzed.
    Windows of various sizes can lead to different levels of prediction, and in some cases, it might be more appropriate to only extract features preceding
