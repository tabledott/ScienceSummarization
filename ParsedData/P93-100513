lly bracketed sentences at the University of Lancaster called the Treebank.
    The Treebank uses 17 non-terminal labels and 240 tags.
    The bracketing of the above sentence is shown in Figure 2.
    A parse produced by the grammar is judged to be correct if it agrees with the Treebank parse structurally and the NT labels agree.
    The grammar has a significantly richer NT label set (more than 10000) than the Treebank but we have defined an equivalence mapping between the grammar NT labels and the Treebank NT labels.
    In this paper, we do not include the tags in the measure of a correct parse.
    We have used about 25,000 sentences to help the grammarian develop the grammar with the goal that the correct (as defined above) parse is among the proposed (by the grammar) parses for a sentence.
    Our most common test set consists of 1600 sentences that are never seen by the grammarian.
    The grammar used in this experiment is a broadcoverage, feature-based unification grammar.
    The grammar is context
