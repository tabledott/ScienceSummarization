undations in the theory of parameterized families of probability distributions and statistical estimation.
    As exemplified in the paper, learning, disambiguation, and evaluation can be given simple, motivated formulations.
    3.
    The derived lexical representations are linguistically interpretable.
    This suggests the possibility of large-scale modeling and observational experiments bearing on questions arising in linguistic theories of the lexicon.
    4.
    Because a simple probabilistic model is used, the induced lexical entries could be incorporated in lexicalized syntax-based probabilistic language models, in particular in head-lexicalized models.
    This provides for potential application in many areas.
    5.
    The method is applicable to any natural language where text samples of sufficient size, computational morphology, and a robust parser capable of extracting subcategorization frames with their fillers are available.
