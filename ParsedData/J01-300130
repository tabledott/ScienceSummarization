    One type of module, a filter, can be used to remove senses from consideration when a knowledge source identifies them as unlikely in context.
    Another type can be used when a knowledge source provides evidence for a sense but cannot identify it confidently; we call these partial taggers (in the spirit of McCarthy's notion of &amp;quot;partial information&amp;quot; [McCarthy and Hayes, 19691).
    The choice of whether to apply a knowledge source as either a filter or a partial tagger depends on whether it is likely to rule out correct senses.
    If a knowledge source is unlikely to reject the correct sense, then it can be safely implemented as a filter; otherwise implementation as a partial tagger would be more appropriate.
    In addition, it is necessary to represent the context of ambiguous words so that this information can be used in the disambiguation process.
    In the system described here these modules are referred to as feature extractors.
    Our sense tagger is implemented within this
