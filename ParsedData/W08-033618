or MT.
    (ii) a higher F measure segmenter does not necessarily outperforms on the MT task.
    To understand what factors other than segmentation F measure can affect MT performance, we introduce another CRF segmenter CRF-Lex that includes lexicon-based features by using external lexicons.
    More details of CRF-Lex will be described in Section 5.1.
    From Table 3, we see that the segmentation F measure is that CRF-Lex &gt; CRF-basic &gt; MaxMatch.
    And now we know that the better segmentation F measure does not always lead to better MT BLEU score, because of in terms of MT performance, CRF-Lex &gt; MaxMatch &gt; CRF-basic.
    In Table 4, we list some statistics of each segmenter to explain this phenomenon.
    First we look at the lexicon size of the MT training and test data.
    While segmenting the MT data, CRF-basic generates an MT training lexicon size of 583K unique word tokens, and MaxMatch has a much smaller lexicon size of 39K.
    CRF-Lex performs best on MT, but the MT training lexicon s
