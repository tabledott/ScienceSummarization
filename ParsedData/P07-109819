t question/answer relations.
    In this scenario, the question&#8217;s syntactic structure does not seem to provide much more information than BOW.
    Secondly, we evaluated the impact of the newly defined PAS and PASN features combined with the best performing previous model, i.e.
    Q(BOW) + A(PT,BOW).
    Figure 5 illustrates the F1-measure plots again according to the cost-factor parameter.
    We observe here that model Q(BOW) + A(PT,BOW,PAS) greatly outperforms model Q(BOW) + A(PT,BOW), proving that the PAS feature is very useful for answer classification, i.e. the improvement is about 2 to 3 points while the difference with the BOW model, i.e.
    Q(BOW) + A(BOW), exceeds 3 points.
    The Q(BOW) + A(PT,BOW,PASN) model is not more effective than Q(BOW) + A(PT,BOW,PAS).
    This suggests either that PAS is more effective than PASN or that when the PT information is added, the PASN contribution fades out.
    To further investigate the previous issue, we finally compared the contribution of the PAS an
