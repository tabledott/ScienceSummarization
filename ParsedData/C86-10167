  The default assumption is that  the const i tuent  [abels also serve as values of cat.
  By declar ing them to be DummyCategories, the grammar  writer  can override this convention.
  The 75 default  dummy symbols are x, Y, and z. instead of (S NP VP), one could just  as well write (xYz ((0 cat) S) (( I  cat) NP) ((2 cat) VP) [t is also legal to leave cat entirely unspecified.
  This option is useful for expressing rules of function application and composit ion in lexically-based categorial grammars .
  2.3 Words  and  Stems In its present  form, D-PATR does not have a morphological analyzer  to relate inflected or derived forms of words to entr ies in a morpheme lexicon.
  All lexcmes must  be entered individually, in ant ic ipat ion of hav ing a better  solution avai lable in the future, D-PATR presently splits the lexicon into two parts: words and stems.
  The format of the two lexicons is the same, but entr ie
