This section is devoted towards evaluating different features obtained from a gold-standard corpus in the task of determining semantic role.
    We use the feature set mentioned in Section 3 as well as features derived from TAGs mentioned in Section 4.
    In this section, we detail the latter set of features.
    We then describe the results of using different feature sets.
    These experiments are performed using the C4.5 decision tree machine learning algorithm.
    The standard settings are used.
    Furthermore, results are always given using unpruned decision trees because we find that these are the ones that performed the best on a development set.
    These features are determined during the extraction of a TAG: Supertag Path.
    This is a path in a tree frame from its preterminal to a particular argument node in a tree frame.
    The supertag path of the subject of the rightmost tree frame in Figure 4 is VBG&#57739;VP&#57739;S&#57740;NP.
    Supertag.
    This can be the tree frame corresponding to
