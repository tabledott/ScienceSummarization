ated using the normalized feature vector from the triple containing the sentence, alignment and logical form as input and the feedback as the label.
    This training example is added to the working set of training examples for this input sentence (line 6).
    All the feedback training examples are used to train a binary classifier whose weight vector is used in the next iteration (line 8).
    The algorithm repeats until no new unique training examples are added to any of the working sets for any input sentence.
    Although the number of possible training examples is very large, in practice the algorithm is efficient and converges quickly.
    Note that this approach is capable of using a wide variety of linear classifiers as the base learner (line 8).
    A policy is required to specify the nature of the working set of training examples (Bl) used for training the base classifier.
    This is pertinent in line 6 of the algorithm.
    Possible policies include: allowing duplicates in the working set (i.e.,
