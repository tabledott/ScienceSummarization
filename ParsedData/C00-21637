  4 Mode l  3 and  Mode l  4 Model:  The fertility models of (Brown et el., 1993) explicitly model the probability l,(?lc) that the En- glish word c~ is aligned to 4,, = E J ]~rench words.
  1087 Model 3 of (Brown et al., 1993) is a zero-order alignment model like Model 2 including in addi- tion fertility paranmters.
  Model 4 of (Brown et al., 1993) is also a first-order alignment model (along the source positions) like the HMM, trot includes also fertilities.
  In Model 4 the alignment position j of an English word depends on the alignment po- sition of tile previous English word (with non-zero fertility) j  .
