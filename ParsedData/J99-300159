    The definitions of CONTINUE and SMOOTH-SHIFT are extended by the condition that Cp(U,) = Cp(li_i), while EXP-CONTINUE and EXP-SMOOTH-SHIFT (expensive CONTINUE and expensive SMOOTH-SHIFT) require the opposite.
    RETAIN and ROUGH-SHIFT fulfill Cp(U,) Cp(1.11) without further extensions.
    Table 21 contains a complete overview of the transition pairs.
    Only those whose second transition fulfills the criterion Cp(U,) = Cp(Ui_i) are labeled as &amp;quot;cheap.&amp;quot; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) define Rule 2 of the centering model on the basis of sequences of transitions.
    Sequences of CONTINUE transitions are preferred over sequences of RETAIN transitions, which are preferred over sequences of SHIFT transitions.
