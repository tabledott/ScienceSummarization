g the contents of the matched cells is useful because it enables a deepened analysis of semantic relations.
    Such an analysis is needed to detect the differences between (20) and (27).
    In the description of CS in Section 4, collation discriminates the one or more semantic relations in each semantic dependency, but treats the semantic relations in one dependency as isolated from and unaffected by the semantic relations in another dependency.
    What is needed is extra processing that interprets the semantic relation(s) in a later dependency with respect to the semantic relation(s) established in an earlier [1, Manima11, drink1, drink1j, [cart, use2, gasolinelth], [distInctive_larget, [10, [[bounds1, distinctl], [extentl, three_dimensionall], [behaviourl, solidi], [compositionl, metall], [animacyl, nonlivinglj, [cart, rolll, [on3, landith [driverl, drivel, cart[, [cart, hovel, [4, whee111], [carl, havel, anginal], [cart, carryl, passengerl]]]]]], [non_relevant, [[same, [3, Eboundsl, distinctl], [bounds1
