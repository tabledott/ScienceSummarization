    This is a very simple approach, but provided significant performance improvements comparing with the stateof-the-art supervised dependency parsers such as (McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
    This paper introduces an alternative method for semi-supervised learning for dependency parsing.
    Our approach basically follows a framework proposed in (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008).
    We extend it for dependency parsing, which we will refer to as a Semi-supervised Structured Conditional Model (SS-SCM).
    In this framework, a structured conditional model is constructed by incorporating a series of generative models, whose parameters are estimated from unlabeled data.
    This paper describes a basic method for learning within this approach, and in addition describes two extensions.
    The first extension is to combine our method with the cluster-based semi-supervised method of (Koo et al., 2008).
    The second extension is to apply the approach to second-order parsing models, more specifically the model
