2001; Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al, 2006)) may be betterequipped to deal with reordering of this type; how ever, in this example they would effectively have to first identify the span of the relative clause, and then move it into the correct position, without any explicit representation of the source language syntax.In this paper, we describe a set of syntactic reordering rules that exploit systematic differences between Chinese and English word order.
			The result ing system is used as a preprocessor for both training and test sentences, transforming Chinese sentences to be much closer to English.
			We report results forthe method on the NIST 2006 evaluation data, us ing the MOSES phrase-based SMT system (Koehnet al, 2007).
			The reordering rules give an improve ment in accuracy from 28.52 to 30.86 BLEU score.
			A concern for methods that make use of Chinese parsers is that these parsers are typically of relativelylow accuracy, particularly given that Chinese re quires a word-segmentation step that is not r
