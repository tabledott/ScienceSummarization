  And it has the information to combine them.
  4 Tlanslation via Matching Expression Figure 1 shows the flow of the translation pro- .
  The translation process consists of three steps: decomposition, transfer, and composi- tion.
  This process generates all candidates of translation using Prologs backtrack mecha- nism.
  4.1 Decompos i t ion In decomposition, the system decomposes a source word-dependency tree(SWD) into trans- lation units, and makes a source matching ex- pression(SME).
  For example, SWD = [[buy,v], [ [he,pron] ] , [ [book,n] , [  [a,det]  ]  , [[on,p], [ [politics ,n], [ [international, adj] ] ] ]
