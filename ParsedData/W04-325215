 small abstract for the purpose of illustration.
    For this example, the lexical units found to have higher &#8220;importance&#8221; by the TextRank algorithm are (with the TextRank score indicated in parenthesis): numbers (1.46), inequations (1.45), linear (1.29), diophantine (1.28), upper (0.99), bounds (0.99), strict (0.77).
    Notice that this ranking is different than the one rendered by simple word frequencies.
    For the same text, a frequency approach provides the following top-ranked lexical units: systems (4), types (3), solutions (3), minimal (3), linear (2), inequations (2), algorithms (2).
    All other lexical units have a frequency of 1, and therefore cannot be ranked, but only listed.
    The data set used in the experiments is a collection of 500 abstracts from the Inspec database, and the corresponding manually assigned keywords.
    This is the same test data set as used in the keyword extraction experiments reported in (Hulth, 2003).
    The Inspec abstracts are from journal papers fro
