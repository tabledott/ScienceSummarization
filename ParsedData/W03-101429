 of the learned patterns, or (2) it contains one of the clues used by the original HPSubj classifier and at least one learned pattern.
    Table 1 shows the performance results on the test set mentioned in Section 3.1 (2197 sentences) for both the original HPSubj classifier and the new version that uses the learned extraction patterns.
    The extraction patterns produce a 7.2 percentage point gain in coverage, and only a 1.1 percentage point drop in precision.
    This result shows that the learned extraction patterns do improve the performance ofthe high-precision subjective sentence classifier, allowing it to classify more sentences as subjective with nearly the same high reliability.
    HP-Subj classifier which do not overlap in non-function words with any of the clues already known by the original system.
    For each pattern, we show an example sentence from our corpus that matches the pattern.
  
  
    This research explored several avenues for improving the state-of-the-art in subjectivity analysis.
