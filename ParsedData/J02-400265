full development corpus for training, without ever using the same data for training and testing. substantial improvement over the baseline in terms of precision and recall of the important categories AIM, BACKGROUND, CONTRAST, and BASIS.
    We use the F-measure, defined by van Rijsbergen (1979) as 2PR P+R, as a convenient way of reporting precision (P) and recall (R) in one value.
    F-measures for our categories range from .61 (TEXTUAL) and .52 (AIM) to .45 (BACKGROUND), .38 (BASIS), and .26 (CONTRAST).
    The recall for some categories is relatively low.
    As our gold standard is designed to contain a lot of redundant information for the same category, this is not too worrying.
    Low precision in some categories (e.g., 34% for CONTRAST, in contrast to human precision of 50%), however, could potentially present a problem for later steps in the document summarization process.
    Overall, we find these results encouraging, particularly in view of the subjective nature of the task and the high compressi
