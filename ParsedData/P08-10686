d clusters for our experiments, we used the Brown clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992).
    We chose to work with the Brown algorithm due to its simplicity and prior success in other NLP applications (Miller et al., 2004; Liang, 2005).
    However, we expect that our approach can function with other clustering algorithms (as in, e.g., Li and McCallum (2005)).
    We briefly describe the Brown algorithm below.
    The input to the algorithm is a vocabulary of words to be clustered and a corpus of text containing these words.
    Initially, each word in the vocabulary is considered to be in its own distinct cluster.
    The algorithm then repeatedly merges the pair of clusters which causes the smallest decrease in the likelihood of the text corpus, according to a class-based bigram language model defined on the word clusters.
    By tracing the pairwise merge operations, one obtains a hierarchical clustering of the words, which can be represented as a binary tree as in Figure 2.
    Within this tree, each
