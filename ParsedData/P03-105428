 = 3, h &lt; 2 markovization is good on its own, it has a large number of states and does not tolerate further splitting well.
    Therefore, we base all further exploration on the v &lt; 2, h &lt; 2 grammar.
    Although it does not necessarily jump out of the grid at first glance, this point represents the best compromise between a compact grammar and useful markov histories.
  
  
    The two major previous annotation strategies, parent annotation and head lexicalization, can be seen as instances of external and internal annotation, respectively.
    Parent annotation lets us indicate an important feature of the external environment of a node which influences the internal expansion of that node.
    On the other hand, lexicalization is a (radical) method of marking a distinctive aspect of the otherwise hidden internal contents of a node which influence the external distribution.
    Both kinds of annotation can be useful.
    To identify split states, we add suffixes of the form -X to mark internal content
