rences on argument heads.
    Grishman &amp; Sterling (1992), Poznanski &amp; Sanfilippo (1993), Resnik (1993), Ribas (1994) and others have shown that it is possible to acquire selection preferences from (partially) parsed data.
    Our system already gathers head lemmas in patterns, so any of these approaches could be applied, in principle.
    In future work, we intend to extend the system in this direction.
    The ability to recognize that argument slots of different subcategorization classes for the same predicate share semantic restrictions/preferences would assist recognition that the predicate undergoes specific alternations, this in turn assisting inferences about control, equi and raising (e.g.
    Boguraev &amp; Briscoe, 1987).
  
  
    Predicate subcategorization is a key component of a lexical entry, because most, if not all, recent syntactic theories 'project' syntactic structure from the lexicon.
    Therefore, a wide-coverage parser utilizing such a lexicalist grammar must have access to an
