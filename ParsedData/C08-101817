ad of using strings (Bannard and CallisonBurch, 2005), we use elementary trees on the En glish side, resulting in a monolingual STSG.
			Weobtain the elementary trees and foreign strings us ing the GKHM algorithm (Galley et al, 2004).
			This takes as input a bilingual word-aligned corpus with trees on one side, and finds the minimal set of tree fragments and their corresponding strings which is consistent with the word alignment.
			This process is illustrated in Figure 2 where the aligned pair on the left gives rise to the rules shown onthe right.
			Note that the English rules and for eign strings shown include variable indices where they have been generalised.
			We estimate p(f |e) and p(e ? |f) from the set of tree-to-string rules and then then pivot each tree fragment to produce STSG rules.
			Figure 3 illustrates the process for the [VP does not VP] fragment.
			Modeling and Decoding Our grammar is much larger and noisier than a grammar extractedsolely for deletion-based compression.
			So, in order t
