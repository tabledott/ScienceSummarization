are searching for the unknown mapping that optimizes equation (2): In Section 3.3, we will introduce an auxiliary quantity that can be evaluated recursively using DP to find this unknown mapping.
    We will explicitly take care of the coverage constraint by introducing a coverage set C of source sentence positions that have already been processed.
    Figure 3 illustrates the concept of the search algorithm using inverted alignments: Partial hypotheses are constructed from bottom to top along the positions of the target sentence.
    Partial hypotheses of length i-1 are extended to obtain partial hypotheses of the length i.
    Extending a partial hypothesis means covering a source sentence position j that has not yet been covered.
    For a given grid point in the translation lattice, the unknown target word sequence can be obtained by tracing back the translation decisions to the partial hypothesis at stage i = 1.
    The grid points are defined in Section 3.3.
