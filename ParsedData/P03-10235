ne of the remaining candidates, if any, as the antecedent.
    For example, &#8220;Closest-First&#8221; (Soon et al., 2001) selects the candidate closest to the anaphor, while &#8220;Best-First&#8221; (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Ng and Cardie, 2002a) selects the candidate with the maximal confidence value.
    One limitation of this model, however, is that it only considers the relationships between a NP encountered and one of its candidates at a time during its training and testing procedures.
    The confidence value reflects the probability that the candidate is coreferential to the NP in the overall distribution2, but not the conditional probability when the candidate is concurrent with other competitors.
    Consequently, the confidence values are unreliable to represent the true competition criterion for the candidates.
    To illustrate this problem, just suppose a data set where an instance could be described with four exclusive features: F1, F2, F3 and F4.
    The ranking of candidates obeys the followi
