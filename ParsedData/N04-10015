from the above mentioned languages &#8212; Arabic, Chinese, English.
    The framework presented in this paper is languageuniversal &#8211; the classification method does not make any assumption about the type of input.
    Most of the feature types are shared across the languages, but there are a small number of useful feature types which are languagespecific, especially for the mention detection task.
    The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the algorithms and feature types used for mention detection.
    Section 3 presents our approach to entity tracking.
    Section 4 describes the experimental framework and the systems&#8217; results for Arabic, Chinese and English on the data from the latest ACE evaluation (September 2003), an investigation of the effect of using different feature types, as well as a discussion of the results.
  
  
    The mention detection system identifies the named, nominal and pronominal mentions introduced in the previous section.
