nces.
    Rule application, for example, could be disambiguated statistically using distributions induced during training.
    We are currently investigating such extensions.
    One approach closely related to ours &#8212; weighted finite-state transducers (e.g.
    (Pereira and Riley, 1997)) &#8212; might provide a principled way to do this.
    We could then consider applying our error-driven pruning strategy to rules encoded as transducers.
    Second, we have only recently begun to explore the use of local repair heuristics.
    While initial results are promising, the full impact of such heuristics on overall performance can be determined only if they are systematically learned and tested using available training data.
    Future work will concentrate on the corpusbased acquisition of local repair heuristics.
    In conclusion, the treebank approach to base NPs provides an accurate and fast bracketing method, running in time linear in the length of the tagged text.
    The approach is simple to understa
