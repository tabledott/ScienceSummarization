as been reported on 519 out of 752 templates, which corresponds to 69%.
    Our algorithm obtained encouraging results, extracting a considerable amount of interesting templates and showing inherent capability of discovering complex semantic relations.
    Concerning overall coverage, we managed to find correct templates for 86% of the verbs (46 out of 53).
    Nonetheless, presented results show a substantial margin of possible improvement.
    In fact yield values (5.5 Low Majority, up to 24 in best cases), which are our first concern, are inherently dependent on the breadth of Web search performed by the ASE algorithm.
    Due to computational time, the maximal number of anchor sets processed for each verb was held back to 30, significantly reducing the amount of retrieved data.
    In order to further investigate ASE potential, we subsequently performed some extended experiment trials raising the number of anchor sets per pivot to 50.
    This time we randomly chose a subset of 10 verbs out of the less fr
