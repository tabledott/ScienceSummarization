s pair, we tokenize the question, we parse the answer sentence, we identify the question terms and answer in the parse tree, and then we make a &amp;quot;cut&amp;quot; in the tree that satisfies the following conditions: Condition a) ensures that the question terms will be identified in the sentence.
    Condition b) helps learn answer types.
    Condition c) brings the sentence closer to the question by compacting portions that are syntactically far from question terms and answer.
    And finally the importance of lexical cues around question terms and answer motivates condition d).
    For the question-answer pair in Figure 1, the algorithm above generates the following training example: Q: When did Elvis Presley die ?
    SA: Presley died PP PP in A_DATE, and SNT.
    Figure 2 represents graphically the conditions that led to this training example being generated.
    Our algorithm for generating training pairs implements deterministically the first two steps in our generative story.
    The algorithm is c
