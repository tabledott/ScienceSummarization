s features; these might indirectly capture some of the subsentential interactions that affect polarity.
    However, both types of approach are based on learning models with a flat bag-of-features: some structural information can be encoded as higher order features, but the final representation of the input is still a flat feature vector that is inherently too limited to adequately reflect the complex structural nature of the underlying subsentential interactions.
    (Liang et al., 2008) Moilanen and Pulman (2007), on the other hand, handle the structural nature of the interactions more directly using the ideas from compositional semantics (e.g., Montague (1974), Dowty et al. (1981)).
    In short, the Principle of Compositionality states that the meaning of a compound expression is a function of the meaning of its parts and of the syntactic rules by which they are combined (e.g., Montague (1974), Dowty et al. (1981)).
    And Moilanen and Pulman (2007) develop a collection of composition rules to assign a s
