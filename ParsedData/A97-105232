ssifier; however, we also require an estimate of the probability that a pattern for class i will occur with a verb which is not a member of subcategorization class i. Brent proposes estimating these probabilities experimentally on the basis of the behaviour of the extractor.
    We estimate this probability more directly by first extracting the number of verbs which are members of each class in the ANLT dictionary (with intuitive estimates for the membership of the novel classes) and converting this to a probability of class membership by dividing by the total number of verbs in the dictionary; and secondly, by multiplying the complement of these probabilities by the probability of a pattern for class i, defined as the number of patterns for i extracted from the Susanne corpus divided by the total number of patterns.
    So, p(v -i), the probability of verb v not of class i occurring with a pattern for class i is: The probability of the event happening m or more times is: Thus P(m,n,p(v -i)) is the probabilit
