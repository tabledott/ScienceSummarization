vector .2 The items contain d-spans, rather than ordinary spans, because sions of a vector.
    E.g., is a vector spanning dimensions 1 through .
    See Melamed (2003) for definitions of cardinality, d-span, and the operators and .
    Parser C needs to know all the boundaries of each item, not just the outermost boundaries.
    Some (but not all) dimensions of an item can be inactive, denoted , and have an empty d-span ().
    The input to Parser C is a tuple of parallel texts, with lengths .
    The notation indicates that the Goal item must span the input from the left of the first word to the right of the last word in each component .
    Thus, the Goal item must be contiguous in all dimensions.
    Parser C begins with an empty chart.
    The only inferences that can fire in this state are those with no antecedent items (though they can have antecedent production rules).
    In Logic C, is the value that the grammar assigns to the terminal production .
    The range of this value depends on the semiring
