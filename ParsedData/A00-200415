 most significant improvement was due to our ranking scheme which linearises the cosine coefficient,.
    Our experiments demonstrate that given insufficient data, the qualitative behaviour of the cosine measure is indeed more reliable than the actual values.
    Although our evaluation scheme is sufficient for this comparative study, further research requires a large scale, task independent benchmark.
    It would be interesting to compare C99 with the multi-source method described in (Beeferman et al., 1999) using the TDT corpus.
    We would also like to develop a linear time and multi-source version of the algorithm.
