    &amp;quot;Type&amp;quot; represents the syntactic categories of wi and w2.3.
    &amp;quot;Distance&amp;quot; is the relative distance between the two words, wi and w2 (e.g., a distance of 1 means w2 occurs immediately after wi and a distance of -1 means it occurs immediately before it).
    A different tuple is produced for each statistically significant word pair and distance.
    Thus, if the same two words occur equally often separated by two different distances, they will appear twice in the list.
    &amp;quot;Strength&amp;quot; (also computed in the earlier version of Xtract) indicates how strongly the two words are related (see [Smadja 89a]).
    &amp;quot;Spread&amp;quot; is the distribution of the relative distance between the two words; thus, the larger the &amp;quot;spread&amp;quot; the more rigidly they are used in combination to one another.
    &amp;quot;Height&amp;quot; combines the factors of &amp;quot;spread&amp;quot; 'In order to get part of speech information we use a stochastic
