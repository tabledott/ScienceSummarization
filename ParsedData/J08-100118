nsional array that captures the distribution of discourse entities across text sentences.
    We follow Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000) in assuming that our unit of analysis is the traditional sentence (i.e., a main clause with accompanying subordinate and adjunct clauses).
    The rows of the grid correspond to sentences, and the columns correspond to discourse entities.
    By discourse entity we mean a class of coreferent noun phrases (we explain in Section 3.3 how coreferent entities are identified).

    Because grammatical relations figure prominently in entity-based theories of local coherence (see Section 2), they
