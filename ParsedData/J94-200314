  Centering is intended to reflect aspects of ATYENTIONAL STATE in a tripartite view of discourse structure that also includes INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE and LINGUISTIC STRUC- TURE (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
  In Grosz and Sidners theory of discourse structure, discourses can be segmented based on intentional structure, and a discourse segment exhibits both local and global coherence.
  Global coherence depends on how each seg- ment relates to the overall purpose of the discourse; local coherence depends on as- pects such as the syntactic structure of the utterances in that segment, the choice of referring expressions, and the use of ellipses.
  CENTERING models local coherence and is formalized as a system of constraints and rules.
  Our analysis uses an adaptation of the Centering algorithm that was developed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard, based on these constrai
