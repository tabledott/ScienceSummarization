recall compared to extracting ngrams.
    The highest F-score is obtained by one of the n-gram runs.
    The largest amount of assigned terms present in the abstracts are assigned by the pattern approach without the tag feature.
    The pattern approach is also the approach which keeps the largest number of assigned terms after that the data have been pre-processed.
    Using phrases means that the length of the potential terms is not restricted to something arbitrary, rather the terms are treat as the units they are.
    However, of the patterns that were selected for the experiments discussed here none was longer than four tokens.
    If looking at all assigned keywords in the training set, 3.0% are then ruled out as potential terms.
    The longest chunks in the test set that were correctly assigned are five tokens long.
    As for when syntactic information is included as a feature (in the form of the POS tag(s) assigned to the term), it is evident from the results presented in this paper that this inform
