 criteria: (1) adding them to the base constraints (those added in advance) would result in an extremely large program, and (2) it must be efficient to detect whether the constraint is violated in y.
    No Cycles (T2) For every possible cycle c for the sentence x we have a constraint which forbids the case where all edges in c are active simultaneously: Comma Coordination (C3) For each symmetric conjunction token i which forms a symmetric coordination and each set of tokens A in x to the left of i with no comma between each pair of successive tokens we add: which forbids configurations where i has the argument tokens A.
    Compatible Coordination Arguments (C4) For each conjunction token i and each set of tokens A in x with incompatible POS tags, we add a constraint to forbid configurations where i has the argument tokens A.
    Selective Projective Parsing (P1) For each pair of triplets (i, j, l1) and (m, n, l2) we add the constraint: For training we use single-best MIRA (McDonald et al., 2005a).
