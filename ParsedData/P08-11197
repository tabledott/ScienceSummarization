s hyponym patterns to extract class instances from the web and then evaluates them further by computing mutual information scores based on web queries.
    The work by (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) on lexical acquisition is similar to ours because they also use graph structures to learn semantic classes.
    However, their graph is based entirely on syntactic relations between words, while our graph captures the ability of instances to find each other in a hyponym pattern based on web querying, without any part-ofspeech tagging or parsing.
  
  
    Our work was motivated by early research on hyponym learning (Hearst, 1992), which applied patterns to a corpus to associate words with semantic classes.
    Hearst&#8217;s system exploited patterns that explicitly link a class name with a class member, such as &#8220;X and other Ys&#8221; and &#8220;Ys such as X&#8221;.
    Relying on surface-level patterns, however, is risky because incorrect items are frequently extracted due to polysemy, idiomatic expressions, par
