ral vs. nonliteral usages using an example from the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE-1) challenge of 2005.
    (This is just an example; we do not compute entailments.)
    In the challenge data, Pair 1959 was: Kerry hit Bush hard on his conduct on the war in Iraq.
    &#8594; Kerry shot Bush.
    The objective was to report FALSE since the second statement in this case is not entailed from the first one.
    In order to do this, it is crucial to know that &#8220;hit&#8221; is being used nonliterally in the first sentence.
    Ideally, we would like to look at TroFi as a first step towards an unsupervised, scalable, widely applicable approach to nonliteral language processing that works on real-world data from any domain in any language.
  
  
    The foundations of TroFi lie in a rich collection of metaphor and metonymy processing systems: everything from hand-coded rule-based systems to statistical systems trained on large corpora.
    Rule-based systems &#8211; some using a type of interlingua (Russell,
