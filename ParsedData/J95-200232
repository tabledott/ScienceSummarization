 compute exact probabilities in cyclic completions is mostly analogous to that for left-recursive predictions.
    The main difference is that unit productions, rather than left-corners, form the underlying transitive relation.
    Before proceeding we can convince ourselves that this is indeed the only case we have to worry about.
    Lemma 4 Let ki X1 Al X2.
    &gt; k2X2 &#8212;&gt; A2X3.
    -&gt; &amp;quot; &gt; k,X, &#8212;&gt; A,X,+1 &#8226; be a completion cycle, i.e., ki A1 =-- Ac, X2 = Xc+1.
    Then it must be the case that Ai = A2 = &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; = A, &#8364;, i.e., all productions involved are unit productions xl &#8212;&gt; x2,.
    .,x&#8212;&gt; x,+1 Proof For all completion chains it is true that the start indices of the states are monotonically increasing, ki &gt; k2 &gt; ... (a state can only complete an expansion that started at the same or a previous position).
    From ki = /cc, it follows that ki = k2 -= &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; = kc.
    Because the current position (dot) also
