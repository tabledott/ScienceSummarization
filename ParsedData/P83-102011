    One particularly interesting class of sentences which seems to defy deterministic accounts is exemplified by (2).
    (2) I drove my aunt from Peoria's car.
    Sentences like (2) contain a constituent which has a misleading leading edge&amp;quot;, an initial right-embedded subconstituent which could itself be the next constituent of whatever structur
