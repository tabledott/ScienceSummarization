y or context source used alone.
    Furthermore, the full iterative bootstrapping clearly yields substantial improvement over the static models, almost exclusively in the form of increased recall (and its corresponding boost the the F-measure).
    Cross-language analysis yields further insight.
    First, recall is much higher for the 4 languages in which case is explicitly marked and is a clue for named entity identification (Romanian, English, Greek and Turkish) than for a language like Hindi, where there are no case distinctions and hence any word could potentially be a named entity.
    A language such as German would be roughly in the middle, where lower-case words have low probability as named entities, but capitalized words are highly ambiguous between common and proper nouns.
    Because approximately 96% of words in the Hindi text are not named entities, without additional orthographic clues the prior probability for &amp;quot;non-entity&amp;quot; is so strong that the morphological or contextual ev
