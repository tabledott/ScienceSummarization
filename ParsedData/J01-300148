also extracted from the text and stored.
    The extracted collocations and surface form combine to represent the context of each ambiguous word.
    The results from the disambiguation modules (filter, partial taggers, and feature extractor) are then presented to a machine learning algorithm to combine their results.
    The algorithm we chose was the TiMBL memory-based learning algorithm (Daelemans et al. 1999).
    Memory-based learning is another name for exemplar-based learning, as employed by Ng and Lee (Section 2.3).
    The TiMBL algorithm has already been used for various NLP tasks including part-of-speech tagging and PP-attachment (Daelemans et al. 1996; Zavrel, Daelemans, and Veenstra 1997).
    Like PEBLS, which formed the core of Ng and Lee's LEXAS system, TiMBL classifies new examples by comparing them against previously seen cases.
    The class of the most similar example is assigned.
    At the heart of this approach is the distance metric A(X, Y) which computes the similarity between instanc
