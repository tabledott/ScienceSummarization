    In this paper, we employ and extend the method described by Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) shown in Figure 1.
    For each seed fact pair for a given template (such as All substrings from these sentences are then extracted.
    The substrings are then subject to simple generalization, to produce candidate patterns: Mozart is replaced by &lt;name&gt;, 1756 is replaced by &lt;birth year&gt;, and all digits are replaced by #.
    These substring templates can (&#8220;Wolfgang Mozart&#8221;,1756). then serve as extraction patterns for previously unknown fact pairs, and their precision in fact extraction can be calculated with respect to a set of currently known facts.
    We examined a subset of the available and desirable extracted information.
    We learned patterns for birth year and occupation, and hand-coded patterns for birth location, spouse, birthday, familial relationships, collegiate affiliations and nationality.
    Other potential patterns currently under investigation include employer/employ
