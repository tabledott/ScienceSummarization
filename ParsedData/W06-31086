phrase pairs.
    This can be easily stored during the extraction of the phrase pairs from the bilingual training corpus.
    If there are multiple possible alignments for a phrase pair, we use the most frequent one.
    The notation is introduced using the illustration in Figure 1.
    There is an example of a left and a right phrase orientation.
    We assume that we have already produced the three-word phrase in the lower part.
    Now, the model has to predict if the start position of the next phrase j&#8242; is to the left or to the right of the current phrase.
    The reordering model is applied only at the phrase boundaries.
    We assume that the reordering within the phrases is correct.
    In the remaining part of this section, we will describe the details of this reordering model.
    The classes our model predicts will be defined in Section 4.2.
    Then, the feature functions will be defined in Section 4.3.
    The training criterion and the training events of the maximum entropy model will be de
