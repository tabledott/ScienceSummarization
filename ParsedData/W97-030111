to a parameter aj, which can be viewed as a &amp;quot;weight&amp;quot; that reflects the importance of the feature.
    The parameters {ai ... an} are found automatically with Generalized Iterative Scaling (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972), or GIS.
    The GIS procedure, as well as the maximum entropy and maximum likelihood properties of the distribution of form (1), are described in detail in (Ratnaparkhi, 1997).
    In general, the maximum entropy framework puts no limitations on the kinds of features in the model; no special estimation technique is required to combine features that encode different kinds of contextual predicates, like punctuation and cons(0, 1, 2).
    As a result, experimenters need only worry about what features to use, and not how to use them.
    -AG PCHUNK PBUILD and We then use the models PT AG, to define a function score, which the search procedure uses to rank derivations of incomplete and complete parse trees.
    For each model, the corresponding conditional probability is defined as
