rticularly important test because the Brown Corpus provides a long-established standard against which accuracy can be measured.
    Third, the algorithm has been completely redesigned so that it establishes the optimal tag assignments in linear time, as opposed to exponential.
    Tests on the one million words of the Brown Corpus show an overall accuracy of approximately 96%, despite the non-use of auxiliary algorithms.
    Suggestions have been given for several possible modifications which might yield even higher accuracies.
    The accuracy and speed of VOLSUNGA make it suitable for use in pre-processing natural language input to parsers and other language understanding systems.
    Its systematicity makes it suitable also for work in computational studies of language learning.
