ble if each word is to be considered at all.
    As an example, we will consider the process by which VOLSUNGA would tag &amp;quot;The man still saw her&amp;quot;.
    We will omit a few ambiguities, reducing the number of paths to 24 for ease of exposition.
    The tags for each word are shown in Table 2.
    The notation is fairly mnemonic, but it is worth clarifying that PPO indicates an objective personal pronoun, and PP$ the possessive thereof, while VBD is a past-tense verb.
    Examples of the various collocational probabilities are illustrated in Table 3 (VOLSUNGA does not actually consider any collocation truly impossible, so zeros are raised to a minimal non-zero value when loaded).
    The product of 1*2*3*2*2*1 ambiguities gives 24 paths through this span.
    In this case, a simple process of choosing the best successor for each word in order would produce the correct tagging (AT NN RB VBD PPO).
    But of course this is often not the case.
    Using VOLSUNGA's method we would first stack &amp;qu
