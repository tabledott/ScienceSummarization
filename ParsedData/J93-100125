lace Pr(W I P) by an approximation in which each word depends only on its own part of speech: In these equations, Pi is the ith part of speech in the sequence P. and W, is the ith word in W. The parameters of this model, the lexical probabilities, Pr( W I P1), and the contextual probabilities, Pr(P t PI-2P1-1), are generally estimated by computing various statistics over large bodies of text.
    One can view the first set of parameters as a dictionary and the second set of parameters as a grammar.
    Traditional methods have tended to ignore lexical preferences, which are the singlemost important source of constraint for part-of-speech tagging, and are sufficient by themselves to resolve 90% of the tags.
    Consider the trivial sentence, &amp;quot;I see a bird,&amp;quot; where every word is almost unambiguous.
    In the Brown Corpus (Francis and Kiitera 1982), the word &amp;quot;I&amp;quot; appears as a pronoun in 5,131 times out of 5,132 100%), &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; appears as a verb in 771 times out o
