tively more frequent patterns, tlowever, at this stage it is not clear to us how useflfl the statistical preference can be, and we use the statistics only relative to a certain threshold, approving any patterns that pass this threshold.
  3 Implementing the Acquisi- tion Phase The use of the statistical model involves two sepa- rate phases.
  The first is the acquisition pha.se, in which the corpus is processed and the statistical database is built.
  The second is the disambigua- tion phase, in which the statistical datab~Lse is used to resolve ambiguities.
  The statistical database contains cooccurrence patterns for various syntactic relations.
  In the ex- periment reported here we have used constraints for the %ubject-verb", "verb-object" and "adjective- noun" relations.
  To locate these relations in the sentences of the corpus, each sentence is parsed by the PEG parser [Jensen 1986].
  Then, a post- processing algorithm identifies the various relations in the parse tree.
  As wa.s noted in [Grishman et
