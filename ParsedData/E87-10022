 that an arbitrary ordered set of rewriting rules can be modeled by a finite-state transducer which can be automatically constructed from them and which serves as well for analyzing surface forms as for generating them from underlying lexical strings.
    A transducer obtained from an ordered set of in the way just outlined is a level the sense that mediates directly between lexical and surface forms without ever the intermediate forms would arise in the course of applying the original rules by one.
    The term morphology, is used a more restricted way, to apply to a system in which no intermediate forms are posited, even in the original grammatical formalism.
    The writer of a grammar using a two-level formalism never needs to think in terms of any representations other than the lexical and the surface ones.
    What he does is to specify, using one formalism or another, a set of transducers, each of which mediates directly between these forms and each of which restricts the allowable pairs of strings in
