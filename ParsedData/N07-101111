    336 documents are used for training, and the remainder for testing.
    All entity types are candidates for coreference (pronouns, named entities, and nominal entities).
    We use the true entity segmentation, and parse each sentence in the corpus using a phrase-structure grammar, as is common for this task.
    We follow Soon et al. (2001) and Ng and Cardie (2002) to generate most of our features for the Pairwise Model.

    In addition to the listed features, we also include conjunctions of size 2, for example &#
