    Contrary to Centering Theory, we remain agnostic to the type of transitions that our models capture (e.g., CONTINUE, SHIFT).
    We simply record whether an entity is mentioned in the discourse and in what grammatical role.
    Our experiments quantitatively measured the predictive power of various linguistic features for several coherence-related tasks.
    Crucially, we find that our models are sensitive to the domain at hand and the type of texts under consideration (human-authored vs. machine generated texts).
    This is an unavoidable consequence of the grid representation, which is entityspecific.
    Differences in entity distribution indicate not only differences in coherence, but also in writing conventions and style.
    Similar observations have been made in other work which is closer in spirit to Centering&#8217;s claims (Hasler 2004; Karamanis et al. 2004; Poesio et al.
    2004).
