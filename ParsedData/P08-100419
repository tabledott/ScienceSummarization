NB on an Open IE task, and shows that O-CRF achieves both double the recall and increased precision relative to O-NB.
    For this experiment, we used the set of 500 sentences3 described in Section 2.
    Both IE systems were designed and trained prior to the examination of the sample sentences; thus the results on this sentence sample provide a fair measurement of their performance.
    While the TEXTRUNNER system was previously found to extract over 7.5 million tuples from a corpus of 9 million Web pages, these experiments are the first to assess its true recall over a known set of relational tuples.
    As reported in Table 2, O-CRF extracts relational tuples with a precision of 88.3% and a recall of 45.2%.
    O-CRF achieves a relative gain in F1 of 63.4% over the O-NB model employed by TEXTRUNNER, which obtains a precision of 86.6% and a recall of 23.2%.
    The recall of O-CRF nearly doubles that of O-NB.
    O-CRF is able to extract instances of the four most frequently observed relation types &#8211;
