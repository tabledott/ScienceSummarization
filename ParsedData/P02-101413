 tests.
    We test for ancestor-descendent relationships in WordNet (SUBCLASS), for example, and also measure the WordNet graph-traversal distance (WNDIST) between NP&#9988; and NP&#9986; .
    Furthermore, we add a new positional feature that measures the distance in terms of the number of paragraphs (PARANUM) between the two NPs.
    The most substantial changes to the feature set, however, occur for grammatical features: we add 26 new features to allow the acquisition of more sophisticated syntactic coreference resolution rules.
    Four features simply determine NP type, e.g. are both NPs definite, or pronouns, or part of a quoted string?
    These features allow other tests to be conditioned on the types of NPs being compared.
    Similarly, three new features determine the grammatical role of one or both of the NPs.
    Currently, only tests for clausal subjects are made.
    Next, eight features encode traditional linguistic (hard) constraints on coreference.
    For example, coreferent NPs must agree
