 an IV word (e.g. the misspelling of can&#8217;t as cant) are outside the scope of this research.
    We also consider that deabbreviation largely falls outside the scope of text normalisation, as abbreviations can be formed freely in standard English.
    Note that single-word abbreviations such as govt &#8220;government&#8221; are very much within the scope of lexical normalisation, as they are OOV and match to a single token in their standard lexical form.
    Throughout this paper, we use the GNU aspell dictionary (v0.60.6)2 to determine whether a token is OOV.
    In tokenising the text, hyphenanted tokens and tokens containing apostrophes (e.g. take-off and won&#8217;t, resp.) are treated as a single token.
    Twitter mentions (e.g.
    @twitter), hashtags (e.g.
    #twitter) and urls (e.g. twitter.com) are excluded from consideration for normalisation, but left in situ for context modelling purposes.
