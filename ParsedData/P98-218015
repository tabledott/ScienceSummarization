node spin101 is linked by a Deep_Subject relation to the undisambiguated form spider.
    On the subsequent pass, this information can be exploited by WSD in assigning sense 101 to the word spin in unrelated definitions: wolf spider 100: any of various spiders...that...do not spin webs.
    This kind of bootstrapping reflects the broader nature of our approach, as discussed in the next section: a fully and accurately disambiguated MindNet allows us to bootstrap senses onto words encountered in free text outside the dictionary domain.
    The creation of MindNet was never intended to be an end unto itself.
    Instead, our emphasis has been on building a broad-coverage NLP understanding system.
    We consider the methodology for creating MindNet to consist of a set of general tools for acquiring, structuring, accessing, and exploiting semantic information from NL text.
    Our techniques for building MindNet are largely rule-based.
    However we arrive at these representations, though, the overall structure
