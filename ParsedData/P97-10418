iteratively improving the initial model.
    Evaluation of the rule sequence is carried out on a test set of data which is independent of the training data.
    If we treat the output of an existing segmentation algorithm' as the initial state and the desired segmentation as the goal state, we can perform a series of transformations on the initial state - removing extraneous boundaries and inserting new boundaries to obtain a more accurate approximation of the goal state.
    We therefore need only define an appropriate rule syntax for transforming this initial approxima'The &amp;quot;existing&amp;quot; algorithm does not need to be a large or even accurate system; the algorithm can be arbitrarily simple as long as it assigns some form of initial segmentation. tion and prepare appropriate training data.
    For our experiments, we obtained corpora which had been manually segmented by native or nearnative speakers of Chinese and Thai.
    We divided the hand-segmented data randomly into training and test sets.
