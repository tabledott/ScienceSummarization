he outcome of our study.
  Therefore, to make the conclusions of our experimental study as applicable as possible to general SRL systems, the architecture of our SRL system follows the most widely used two-step design.
  In the first step, the system is trained to identify argument candi- dates for a given verb predicate.
  In the second step, the system classifies the argument candidates into their types.
  In addition, it is also a simple procedure to prune obvious non-candidates before the first step, and to use post-processing inference to fix incon- sistent predictions after the second step.
  These two additional steps are also employed by our system.
  Our study of shallow and full syntactic information?based SRL systems was done by comparing their impact at each stage of the process.
  Specifically, our goal is to investi- gate at what stage full parsing information is most helpful relative to a shallow parsing?
  Therefore, our experiments were designed so that the compared systems are as similar as
