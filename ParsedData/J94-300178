mplementation operation.
    We must now arrange for the different types of brackets to appear on the input to Replace only in the appropriate circumstances.
    As before, the context identifiers must ensure that none of the brackets can appear unless preceded (or followed) by the appropriate context, and that every occurrence of a context is marked by a bracket freely chosen from the appropriate set of three.
    The Leftcontext and Rightcontext operators given above will have exactly this effect when they are applied with the new meanings given to &lt;, &gt;, and m. The Replace operator must again be modified, however, because it alone distinguishes the different roles of the context brackets.
    The following final definition chooses the correct brackets for all parameters of rule application: The behavior of obligatory rules is modeled by inserting the appropriate filter in the sequence of compositions.
    Left-to-right obligatory rules are modeled by the cascade We remark that even obligatory rules do
