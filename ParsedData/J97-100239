    Note that such move boundaries form a set of independently derived units, which can be used to calculate agreement on transaction segmentation.
    The transcripts did not name the moves or indicate why the potential transaction boundaries were placed where they were.
    Each subject was given the coding instructions and a sample dialogue extract and pair of maps to take away and examine at leisure.
    The coders were asked to return with the dialogue extract coded.
    When they returned they were given a chance to ask questions.
    They were then given the four complete dial
