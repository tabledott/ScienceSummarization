    2002) and quality assessment in the context of a particular information access task in the Newsblaster framework (McKeown et al. 2002).
    In this article, we aim to evaluate the sentence fusion algorithm in isolation from other system components; we analyze the algorithm performance in terms of content selection and the grammaticality of the produced sentences.
    We first present our evaluation methodology (Section 4.1), then we describe our data (Section 4.2), the results (Section 4.3), and our analysis of them (Section 4.4).
    4.1.1 Construction of a Reference Sentence.
    We evaluated content selection by comparing an automatically generated sentence with a reference sentence.
    The reference sentence was produced by a human (hereafter the RFA), who was instructed to generate a sentence conveying information common to many sentences in a theme.
    The RFA was not familiar with the fusion algorithm.
    The RFA was provided with the list of theme sentences; the original documents were n
