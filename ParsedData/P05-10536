hich contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect.
    We also show how semantic information like WordNet and Name List can be equipped to further improve the performance.
    Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that our system outperforms Kambhatla (2004) by about 3 F-measure on extracting 24 ACE relation subtypes.
    It also shows that our system outperforms tree kernel-based systems (Culotta et al 2004) by over 20 F-measure on extracting 5 ACE relation types.
  
  
    Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a supervised machine learning technique motivated by the statistical learning theory (Vapnik 1998).
    Based on the structural risk minimization of the statistical learning theory, SVMs seek an optimal separating hyper-plane to divide the training examples into two classes and make decisions based on support vectors which are selected as the only effective instances in the training set.
    Basically, SVMs are binary classifiers.
    Therefore, we must extend SVMs to multi-class
