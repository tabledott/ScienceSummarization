ic similarity to the MWEs LSA vector as a whole, with the expectation being that low similarity between the MWE as a whole and its component words is indication of the non-compositionality of the MWE.
    The results are given in Table 5.
    It is clear that while Baldwin et al.&#8217;s expectation is borne out in the case of the constituent noun (the non-head), it is not in the case of the constituent verb (the head).
    Even in the case of the nouns, however, the results are, for the most part, markedly inferior to the results we achieved using the composed vectors.
    There are a number of issues that complicate the workability of the unsupervised technique described here.
    We rely on there being enough non-compositional uses of an idiomatic MWE in the corpus that the overall meaning vector for the MWE reflects this usage.
    If the literal meaning is overwhelmingly frequent, this will reduce the effectivity of the method significantly.
    A second problem concerns the relationship between the lite
