    It is quite simple, general in its applicability to a range of unification-based and logic grammar formalisms, and uniform, in that it places only one restriction (discussed below) on the form of the linguistic analyses allowed by the grammars used in generation.
    In particular, generation from grammars with recursions whose well-foundedness relies on lexical information will terminate; top-down generation regimes such as those of Wedekind (1988) or Dymetman and Isabelle (1988) lack this property; further discussion can be found in Section 2.1.
    Unfortunately, the bottom-up, left-to-right processing regime of Earley generation&#8212;as it might be called&#8212;has its own inherent frailties.
    Efficiency considerations require that only grammars possessing a property of semantic monotonicity can be effectively used, and even for those grammars, processing can become overly nondeterministic.
    The algorithm described in this paper is an attempt to resolve these problems in a satisfactory manner.
