ntly their performance will be limited by data sparsity.
			We can al leviate this by categorizing words into classes with varying degrees of generality, and then allowing paths to use both words and their classes.
			Examples of word classes are part-of-speech (POS) tags and generalizations over POS tags such as Noun, Active Verb or Passive Verb.
			The entity type is also used forthe two ends of the dependency path.
			Other poten tially useful classes might be created by associatingwith each noun or verb a set of hypernyms corre sponding to their synsets in WordNet.
			The set of features can then be defined as aCartesian product over these word classes, as illus trated in Figure 3 for the dependency path between?protesters?
			and ?station?
			in sentence S1.
			In this rep resentation, sparse or contiguous subsequences of nodes along the lexicalized dependency path (i.e. path fragments) are included as features simply byreplacing the rest of the nodes with their correspond ing generalizations.The total n
