rmance measures have been obtained automatically using the MUC-6 coreference scoring program (Vilain et al. 1995).
    Table 4 lists the results.
    Precision Recall F-measure rules 87.1% 61.7% 72.3% rules combined 91.3% 58.6% 71.8% +bootstrapping 92.0% 73.9% 81.9% Table 4: Bootstrapping effect on COCKTAIL Table 4 shows that the seed set of rules had good precision but poor recall.
    By combining the rules with the entropy-based measure, we obtained further enhancement in precision, but the recall dropped.
    The application of the bootstrapping methodology determined an enhancement of recall, and thus of the F-measure.
    In the future we intend to compare the overall effect of rules that recognize referential expressions on the overall performance of the system.
    7 Conclusion We have introduced a new data-driven method for corefresolution, implemented in the system.
    Unlike other knowledge-poor methods for corefresolution (Baldwin 1997) (Mitkov 1998), COCKits most performant rules through massive
