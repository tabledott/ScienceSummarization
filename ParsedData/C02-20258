Treebank Construction Although a pre- cise HPSG grammar like the LinGO ERG will typically assign a small number of analyses to a given sentence, choosing among a few or sometimes a few dozen read- ings is time-consuming and error-prone.
  The project is exploring two approaches to automating the disambigua- tion task, (i) seeding lexical selection from a part-of- speech (POS) tagger and (ii) automated inter-annotator comparison and assisted resolution of conflicts.
  Treebank Maintenance and Evolution One of the challenging research aspects of the Redwoods initiative is about developing a methodology for automated up- dates of the treebank to reflect the continuous evolution of the underlying linguistic framework and of the LinGO grammar.
  Again building on the notion of elementary linguistic discriminators, we expect to explore the semi- automatic propagation of recorded disambiguating deci- sions into newer versions of the parsed corpus.
  While it can be assumed that the basic phrase structure inven- tory
