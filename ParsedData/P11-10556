ch relation name r E R, which represents whether the ground fact r(e) is true.
    Including this set of binary random variables enables our model to extract overlapping relations.
    Let S(,,,,,) C E be the set of sentences which contain mentions of both of the entities.
    For each sentence xZ E S(,,,,,) there exists a latent variable ZZ which ranges over the relation names r E R and, importantly, also the distinct value none.
    Zi should tence level assignments Zi = zi signals a mention be assigned a value r E R only when xi expresses of r(e). the ground fact r(e), thereby modeling sentence- The extraction factors 4jextract are given by level extraction.
    &#65533; Figure 1(b) shows an example instantiation of the &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;extract(zi, xi) def = exp &#952;j&#966;j(zi, xi) model with four relation names and three sentences. j We use a conditional probability model that defines a joint distribution over all of the extraction random variables defined above.
    The model is undirected and
