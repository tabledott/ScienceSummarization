 counts.
    For the prediction of word associations they achieved best results when modifying each entry in the cooccurrence matrix using the following formula: Hereby f(i&amp;j) is the frequency of common occurrence of the two words i and j, and f(i) is the corpus frequency of word i.
    However, for comparison, the simulations described below were also conducted using the original co-occurrence matrices (formula 2) and a measure similar to mutual information (formula 3).1 Regardless of the formula applied, the English and the German matrix where both normalized.2 Starting from the normalized English and German matrices, the aim was to determine how far the similarity of the two matrices depends on the correspondence of word order.
    As a measure for matrix similarity the sum of the absolute differences of the values at corresponding matrix positions was used.
    This similarity measure leads to a value of zero for identical matrices, and to a value of 20 000 in the case that a non-zero entry in one of
