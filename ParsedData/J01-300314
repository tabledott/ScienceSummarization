 the verb.
    We make these distinctions explicit by drawing on a standard notion of thematic role, as each class has a distinct pattern of thematic assignments (i.e., different argument structures).
    We assume here that a thematic role is a label taken from a fixed inventory of grammaticalized semantic relations; for example, an Agent is the doer of an action, and a Theme is the entity undergoing an event (Gruber 1965).
    While admitting that such notions as Agent and Theme lack formal definitions (in our work and in the literature more widely), the distinctions are clear enough to discriminate our three verb classes.
    For our purposes, these roles can simply be thought of as semantic labels which are non-decomposable, but there is nothing in our approach that rests on this assumption.
    Thus, our approach would also be compatible with a feature-based definition of participant roles, as long as the features capture such general distinctions as, for example, the doer of an action and the entity act
