hm, since we have restricted the relevant occurrences to a specific type of structure; even relatively common nouns may not occur in the corpus more than a handful of times in such a context.
    The two figures of merit that we employ, one to select and one to produce a final rank, use the following two counts for each noun: To select new seed words, we take the ratio of count 1 to count 2 for the noun in question.
    This is similar to the figure of merit used in R&amp;S, and also tends to promote low frequency nouns.
    For the final ranking, we chose the log likelihood statistic outlined in Dunning (1993), which is based upon the co-occurrence counts of all nouns (see Dunning for details).
    This statistic essentially measures how surprising the given pattern of co-occurrence would be if the distributions were completely random.
    For instance, suppose that two words occur forty times each, and they co-occur twenty times in a millionword corpus.
    This would be more surprising for two completely r
