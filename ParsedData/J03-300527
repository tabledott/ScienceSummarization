thin quotation marks (see Section 2.3 for details).
    This means that we miss any nonadjacent matches, even though a chunker or parser (such as the one used for extracting BNC or NANTC bigrams) would find them.
    An example is an adjectivenoun bigram in which an adverbial intervenes between the adjective and the noun (see Table 1).
    Furthermore, the absence of tagging, chunking, and parsing can also generate false positives, in particular for queries containing words with part-of-speech ambiguity.
    (Recall that our bigram selection procedure ensures that the predicate word, but not the argument word, is unambiguous in terms of its POS tagging in the BNC.)
    As an example, consider process directory, which in our data set is a noun-noun bigram (see Table 2).
    One of the matches returned by Google is (8), in which process is a verb.
    Another example is fund membrane, which is a noun-noun bigram in our data set but matches (9) in Google.
