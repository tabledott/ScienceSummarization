  An Efficient Method For Determining Bilingual Word Classes
  
    In statistical natural language processing we always face the problem of sparse data.
    One way to reduce this problem is to group words into equivalence classes which is a standard method in statistical language modeling.
    In this paper we describe a method to determine bilingual word classes suitable for statistical machine translation.
    We develop an optimization criterion based on a maximumlikelihood approach and describe a clustering algorithm.
    We will show that the usage of the bilingual word classes we get can improve statistical machine translation.
  
  
    Word classes are often used in language modelling to solve the problem of sparse data.
    Various clustering techniques have been proposed (Brown et al., 1992; Jardino and Adda, 1993; Martin et al., 1998) which perform automatic word clustering optimizing a maximum-likelihood criterion with iterative clustering algorithms.
