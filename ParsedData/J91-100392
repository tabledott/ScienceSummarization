nce, contextual influence is present in semantic interpretation in CS.
    Moreover, the notion of relevance is recorded in semantic vectors (Figures 11 and 15) and the extended coherence representations discussed in Section 6.
    Hence, the processes and representations of CS possess basic equipment for handling further kinds of context.
    The met* method is consistent with the view that metaphor is based on similarity, whereas metonymy is based on contiguity (cf.
    Jakobsen and Halle 1956).
