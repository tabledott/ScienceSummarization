based tagger to return multiple tags for a word by making a simple modification to the contextual transformations described above.
    The initial-state annotator is the tagging output of the previously described one-best transformation-based tagger.
    The allowable transformation templates are the same as the contextual transformation templates listed above, but with the rewrite rule: change tag X to tag Y modified to add tag X to tag Y or add tag X to word W. Instead of changing the tagging of a word, transformations now add alternative taggings to a word.
    When allowing more than one tag per word, there is a trade-off between accuracy and the average number of tags for each word.
    Ideally, we would like to achieve as large an increase in accuracy with as few extra tags as possible.
    Therefore, in training we find transformations that maximize the function: Number of corrected errors Number of additional tags In table 3, we present results from first using the one-tag-per-word transformation-base
