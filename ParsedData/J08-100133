rformance at information-ordering.
    The task concerns determining a sequence in which to present a pre-selected set of informationBarzilay and Lapata Modeling Local Coherence bearing items; this is an essential step in concept-to-text generation, multi-document summarization, and other text-synthesis problems.
    The information bearing items can be database entries (Karamanis et al. 2004), propositions (Mellish et al.
    1998) or sentences (Lapata 2003; Barzilay and Lee 2004).
    In sentence ordering, a document is viewed as a bag of sentences and the algorithm&#8217;s task is to try to find the ordering which maximizes coherence according to some criterion (e.g., the probability of an order).
    As explained previously, we use our coherence model to rank alternative sentence orderings instead of trying to find an optimal ordering.
    We do not assume that local coherence is sufficient to uniquely determine a maximally coherent ordering&#8212;other constraints clearly play a role here.
