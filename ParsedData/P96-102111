here terminal symbols come in couples, for example x I y, where x is a Chinese word and y is an English translation of x.2 Any parse tree thus generates two strings, one on the Chinese stream and one on the English stream.
    Thus, the tree: An additional mechanism accommodates a conservative degree of word-order variation between the two languages.
    With each production of the grammar is associated either a straight orientation or an inverted orientation, respectively denoted as follows:
  
  
    In the case of a production with straight orientation, the right-hand-side symbols are visited leftto-right for both the Chinese and English streams.
    But for a production with inverted orientation, the 2 Readers of the papers cited above should note that we have switched the roles of English and Chinese here, which helps simplify the presentation of the new translation algorithm. right-hand-side symbols are visited left-to-right for Chinese and right-to-left for English.
    Thus, the tree: In the special c
