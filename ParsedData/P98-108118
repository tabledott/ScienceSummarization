nteresting cases are very rare.
    To realise the benefits of stacking, either more data is needed or a second stage classifier that is better suited to this type of problem.
  
  
    The relation between the accuracy of combinations (using TagPair) and that of the individual taggers is shown in Table 3.
    The most important observation is that every combination (significantly) outperforms the combination of any strict subset of its components.
    Also of note is the improvement yielded by the best combination.
    The pairwise voting system, using all four individual taggers, scores 97.92% correct on Test, a 19.1% reduction in error rate over the best individual system, viz. the Maximum Entropy tagger (97.43%).
    A major factor in the quality of the combination results is obviously the quality of the best component: all combinations with E score higher than those without E (although M, R and T together are able to beat E alonell).
    After that, the decisive factor appears to be the difference in lan
