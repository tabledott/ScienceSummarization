neral these alw;oaches focus on nouns.
  The measure ()1 conceptual distance among concepts we are looking for should be scnsflive Io: ?
  the length of the shortest palh that connects lhe concepts involved.
  the depth in the hierarchy: concepts in a deeper part of the hierarchy should be ranked closer.
  the density of concepts in the hierarchy: concepts in a dense part of the hierarchy are relatively closer than those in a more sparse region.
  - tile measure should be independent of the lltllllber o1 concepts we are measuring.
  We have experimented willl several fornmlas that follow the four criteria presented above.
  The experiments reported here were pcrformcd using the Conceptual Density formuhl [Agirre &amp; Rigau 95], which compares areas of subhierarchies.
  To illustrate how Conceptual 1)ensity can help to disambiguate a word, in figure I lhe word W has four senses and several context words.
  Each sense of the words belongs to a subhierarchy of WordNct.
  Tile dots in the subhierarchies represen
