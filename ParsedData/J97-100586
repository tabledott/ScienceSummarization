    Our initial hypotheses regarding discourse segmentation were that multiutterance segment units reflect discourse coherence, and that while the semantic dimensions of this coherence may vary, it arises partly from consistency in the speaker's communicative goals (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Polanyi 1988).
    The results from the first part of our study (Section 3) support these hypotheses.
    On a relatively unconstrained linear segmentation task, the number of times different naive subjects identify the same segment boundaries in a given narrative transcript is extremely significant.
    Across the 20 narratives, statistical significance arises where at least three or four out of seven subjects agree on the same boundary location, depending on an arbitrary choice between probabilities of .02 versus .0001 as the significance threshold.
    We conclude that the segment boundaries identified by at least three or four of our subjects provide a statistically validated annotation to the narrative
