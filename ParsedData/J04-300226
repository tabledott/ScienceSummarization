    Throughout this section, we evaluate sets of clues directly, by measuring the proportion of clues that appear in subjective documents or expressions, seeking those that appear more often than expected.
    In later sections, the clues are used together to find subjective sentences and to perform text categorization.
    The following paragraphs give details of the evaluation and experimental design used in this section.
    The proportion of clues in subjective documents or expressions is their precision.
    Specifically, the precision of a set S with respect to opinion pieces is number of instances of members of S in opinion pieces total number of instances of members of S in the data The precision of a set S with respect to subjective elements is number of instances of members of S in subjective elements total number of instances of members of S in the data In the above, S is a set of types (not tokens).
    The counts are of tokens (i.e., instances or occurrences) of members of S. Why use a set
