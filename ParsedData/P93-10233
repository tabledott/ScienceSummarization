, augmented with linguistic information derived from the corpus, and is completely domain independent.
    It demonstrates how high-level semantic knowledge can be computed from large amounts of low-level knowledge (essentially plain text, part-of-speech rules, and optionally syntactic relations).
    The problem of identifying semantically related words has received considerable attention, both in computational linguistics (e.g. in connection with thesaurus or dictionary construction (Sparck-Jones, 1986)) and in psychology (Osgood et al., 1957).
    However, only recently has work been done on the automatic computation of such relationships from text, quantifying similarity between words and clustering them ( (Brown et al., 1992), (Pereira et al., 1993)).
    In comparison, our work emphasizes the use of shallow linguistic knowledge in addition to a statistical model and is original in the use of negative knowledge to constrain the search space.
    Furthermore, we use a flexible architecture which will allo
