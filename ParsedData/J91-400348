 to lexical items other than verbs are quite wide-ranging.
    The next example I will consider concerns scalar modifiers, such as fast, that modify different predicates depending on the head they modify.
    If we think of certain modifiers as modifying only a subset of the qualia for a noun, then we can view fast as modifying only the telic role of an object.
    This allows us to go beyond treating adjectives such as fast as intersective modifiers &#8212; for example, as Ax[cari (x) A fast' (x)].
    Let us assume that an adjective such as fast is a member of the general type (N, N), but can be subtyped as applying to the Telic role of the noun being modified.
    That is, it has as its type, ([N Telic], N).
    This gives rise directly to the different interpretations in Example 52.
    These interpretations are all derived from a single word sense for fast.
    Because the lexical semantics for this adjective indicates that it modifies the telic role of the noun, it effectively acts as an event predicate
