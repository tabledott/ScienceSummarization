peech taggers or syntactic parsers.
    In this paper we present a technique for fully automatic acquisition of rules that guess possible part-of-speech tags for unknown words using their starting and ending segments.
    The learning is performed from a general-purpose lexicon and word frequencies collected from a raw corpus.
    Three complimentary sets of word-guessing rules are statistically induced: prefix morphological rules, suffix morphological rules and ending-guessing rules.
    Using the proposed technique, unknown-word-guessing rule sets were induced and integrated into a stochastic tagger and a rule-based tagger, which were then applied to texts with unknown words.
  
  
    Words unknown to the lexicon present a substantial problem to NLP modules (as, for instance, part-of-speech (os-) taggers) that rely on information about words, such as their part of speech, number, gender, or case.
    Taggers assign a single POS-tag to a word-token, provided that it is known what POS-tags this word can take
