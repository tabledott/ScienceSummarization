 Lavie (2005) is a classifier-based linear time parser.
    The times for the Sagae, Collins, and Charniak parsers were taken from the Sagae and Lavie paper, and were obtained using a 1.8 GHz P4, compared to a 3.2 GHz P4 for the CCG numbers.
    Comparing parser speeds is especially problematic because of implementation differences and the fact that the accuracy of the parsers is not being controlled.
    Thus we are not making any strong claims about the efficiency of parsing with CCG compared to other formalisms.
    However, the results in Table 12 add considerable weight to one of our main claims in this article, namely, that highly efficient parsing is possible with CCG, and that largescale processing is possible with linguistically motivated grammars.
  
  
    An obvious question is how well the CCG parser compares with parsers using different grammar formalisms.
    One question we are often asked is whether the CCG derivations output by the parser could be converted to Penn Treebank&#8211;style trees
