blems of this type can in part be solved by the proposed approach, since every translation once plays the role of the primary translation.
    For each sentence, we obtain a total of M confusion networks and unite them in a single lattice.
    The consensus translation can be chosen among different alignment and reordering paths in this lattice.
    The &#8220;voting&#8221; on the union of confusion networks is straightforward and analogous to the ROVER system.
    We sum up the probabilities of the arcs which are labeled with the same word and have the same start and the same end state.
    These probabilities are the global probabilities assigned to the different MT systems.
    They are manually adjusted based on the performance of the involved MT systems on a held-out development set.
    In general, a better consensus translation can be produced if the words hypothesized by a betterperforming system get a higher probability.
    Additional scores like word confidence measures can be used to score the arc
