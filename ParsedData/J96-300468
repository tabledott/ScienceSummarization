) by the observation that the classifier ficc tiao2 is consistent with long or winding objects like AM ma3-1u4 'road' but not with ma3 'horse.'
    Note that the sets of possible classifiers for a given noun can easily be encoded on that noun by grammatical features, which can be referred to by finite-state grammatical rules.
    Thus, we feel fairly confident that for the examples we have considered from Can's study a solution can be incorporated, or at least approximated, within a finite-state framework.
    With regard to purely morphological phenomena, certain processes are not handled elegantly within the current framework.
    Any process involving reduplication, for instance, does not lend itself to modeling by finite-state techniques, since there is no way that finite-state networks can directly implement the copying operations required.
    Mandarin exhibits several such processes, including A-not-A question formation, illustrated in (3a), and adverbial reduplication, illustrated in (3b): In the part
