 two stages: In the first stage, we compute an alignment between words, and in the second stage, we extract the aligned phrase pairs.
    In our machine translation system, we then use generalized versions of these phrases, called alignment templates, that also include the word alignment and use word classes instead of the words themselves.
    In Section 4, we describe the various components of the statistical translation model.
    The backbone of the translation model is the alignment template feature function, which requires that a translation of a new sentence be composed of a set of alignment templates that covers the source sentence and the produced translation.
    Other feature functions score the well-formedness of the produced target language sentence (i.e., language model feature functions), the number of produced words, or the order of the alignment templates.
    Note that all components of our statistical machine translation model are purely data-driven and that there is no need for linguistica
