 we defined two text units (such as sentences or snippets) to be paraphrases if one of them can generally be substituted for the other without great loss of information (but not necessarily vice versa).
    6 Given a pair of templates produced by a system, the judges marked them as paraphrases if for many instantiations of the templates&#8217; variables, the resulting text units were paraphrases.
    (Several labelled examples were provided to supply further guidance).
    To put the evaluation results into context, we wanted to compare against another system, but we are not aware of any previous work creating templates precisely for the task of generating paraphrases.
    Instead, we made a good-faith effort to adapt the DIRT system (Lin and Pantel, 2001) to the problem, selecting the 6,534 highestscoring templates it produced when run on our datasets.
    (The system of Shinyama et al. (2002) was unsuitable for evaluation purposes because their paraphrase extraction component is too tightly coupled to the u
