two versions of Section 23, one supertagged with SEM-TAG and the other with SYNT-TAG.
    The results are shown in Table 3.
    Evaluation is performed on dependencies excluding leafnode punctuation.
    Each dependency is evaluated according to both whether the correct head and dependent is related as well as whether they both receive the correct part of speech tag.
    The F-measure scores, in the 70% range, are relatively low compared to Collins (1999) which has a corresponding score of around 90%.
    This is perhaps to be expected because Collins (1999) is based on a full parser.
    Note also that the accuracy of LDA is highly dependent on the accuracy of the supertagged input.
    This explains, for example, the fact that the accuracy on SEM-TAG supertagged input is lower than the accuracy with SYNT-TAG supertagged input.
    The output of LDA is a partial dependency parse annotated with TAG structures.
    We can use this output to predict semantic roles of arguments.
    The manner in which this is d
