s to generate the power series.
    Initially let us consider successive approximation.
    Of all the techniques to be presented here, successive approximations most closely resembles the approach taken by most current chart parsers including EQSP (Martin, Church, and Patil 1981).
    The alternative approaches take advantage of certain regularities in the power series in order to produce the same results more efficiently.
    Successive approximation works as follows.
    First we translate grammar (5a) into the equation: where &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; connects two ways of generating an NP and &amp;quot;.&amp;quot; concatenates two parts of an NP.
    In some sense, we want to &amp;quot;solve&amp;quot; this equation for NP.
    This can be accomplished by refining successive approximations.
    An initial approximation NP0 is formed by taking NP to be the empty language, Then we form the next approximation by substituting the previous approximation into equation (7), and simplifying according to the usual rule
