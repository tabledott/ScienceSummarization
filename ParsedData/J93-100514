    We will call this log likelihood ratio the LA (lexical association) score. and Again, the probability of noun attachment does not involve a term indicating that the verb sponsors no (additional) complement; when we observe a prepositional phrase that is in fact attached to the object NP, the verb might or might not have a complement or adjunct following the object phrase.
    2 Thus we are ignoring the fact that the preposition may in fact be licensed by neither the verb nor the noun, as in Example 5.
    3 In earlier versions of this paper we used a t-test for deciding attachment and a different procedure for estimating the probabilities.
    The current procedure has several advantages.
    Unlike the t-test used previously, it is sensitive to the magnitude of the difference between the two probabilities, not to our confidence in our ability to estimate those probabilities accurately.
    And our estimation procedure has the property that it defaults (in case of novel words) to the average behavior fo
