Obj classifier initially labeled roughly 17,000 sentences as objective.
    In order to keep the training set relatively balanced, we used all 17,000 objective sentences and 17,000 of the subjective sentences as training data for the extraction pattern learner.
    17,073 extraction patterns were learned that have frequency &gt; 2 and Pr(subjective  |patterni) &gt; .60 on the training data.
    We then wanted to determine whether the extraction patterns are, in fact, good indicators of subjectivity.
    To evaluate the patterns, we applied different subsets of them to a test set to see if they consistently occur in subjective sentences.
    This test set consists of 3947 sentences, 54% of which are subjective.
    Figure 4 shows sentence recall and pattern (instancelevel) precision for the learned extraction patterns on the test set.
    In this figure, precision is the proportion of pattern instances found in the test set that are in subjective sentences, and recall is the proportion of subjective sentences
