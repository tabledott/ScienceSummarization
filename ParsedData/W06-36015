uld be While Section 3 will define the model formally, we first proceed with an example translation from English to Chinese (note in particular that the inverted phrases between source and target): 1Throughout this paper, we will use LHS and source-side interchangeably (so are RHS and target-side).
    In accordance with our experiments, we also use English and Chinese as the source and target languages, opposite to the Foreign-to-English convention of Brown et al. (1993).
    Figure 3 shows how the translator works.
    The English sentence (a) is first parsed into the tree in (b), which is then recursively converted into the Chinese string in (e) through five steps.
    First, at the root node, we apply the rule r1 which preserves the toplevel word-order and translates the English period into its Chinese counterpart: Then, the rule r2 grabs the whole sub-tree for &#8220;the gunman&#8221; and translates it as a phrase: (r2) NP-C ( DT (the) NN (gunman) ) &#8212;* qiangshou Now we get a &#8220;partial Chinese,
