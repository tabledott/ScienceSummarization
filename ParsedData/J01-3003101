vestigation.
    Thus, an important contribution of the work is the proposed mapping between the thematic assignment properties of the verb classes, and the statistical distributions of their surface syntactic properties.
    We think that using such linguistically motivated features makes the approach very effective and easily scalable: we report a 54% reduction in error rate (a 68% reduction, when the human expert-based upper bound is considered), using only five features that are readily extractable from automatically annotated corpora.
