ffer R never grows in size and that parsing terminates as soon as it becomes empty; the third condition states that arcs added to A can never be removed.
    Note that this is only one of several possible notions of incrementality in parsing.
    A weaker notion would be to only require that the set of arcs is built monotonically (the third condition); a stronger notion would be to require also that nodes in R are processed strictly left to right.
  
  
    Let S = (C, T, cs, Ct) be a transition system for dependency parsing.
    The notions of soundness and completeness, as defined here, can be seen as corresponding to the notions of soundness and completeness for grammar parsing algorithms, according to which an algorithm is sound if it only derives parses licensed by the grammar and complete if it derives all such parses (Shieber, Schabes, and Pereira 1995).
    Depending on the nature of a transition system S, there may not be a transition sequence for every sentence, or there may be more than one such se
