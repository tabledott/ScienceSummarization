ignment, the source sentence fJ1 and the target sentence eI1 are kept fixed, and a full search without re-ordering restrictions is carried out only over the unknown alignment aJ1.
    The language model probability is divided out, and the resulting probability is compared to the Viterbi probability as obtained by the training procedure.
    For 499 training sentences the Viterbi alignment probability as obtained by the forced-alignment search was exactly the same as the one produced by the training procedure.
    In one case the forcedalignment search did obtain a better Viterbi probability than the training procedure.
  
  
    Translation experiments are carried out for the translation directions German to English and English to German (Verbmobil task) and for the translation directions French to English and English to French (Canadian Hansards task).
    Section 4.1 reports on the performance measures used.
    Section 4.2 shows translation results for the Verbmobil task.
