ing the previously generated string &amp;quot;calls&amp;quot;.
    The recursive connection will use the same chain rule, generating the particle &amp;quot;up&amp;quot;, and the new node to be connected [d].
    This node requires the chain rule for connection.
    Again, the recursive generation for the subject yields the string &amp;quot;John&amp;quot;, and the new node to be connected s(finite)/call_up(john,friends).
    This last node connects to the root [b] by virtue of identity.
    This completes the process of generating top-down from the original pivot sentence/decl(call_up(john,friends)).
    All that remains is to connect this pivot to the original root.
    Again, the process is trivial, by virtue of the base case for connection.
    The generation process is thus completed, yielding the string &amp;quot;John calls friends up&amp;quot;.
    The drawing in Figure 4 summarizes the generation process by showing which steps were performed top-down or bottom-up by arrows on the analysis tree branches.
