is overgeneration is constrained, so that elements that tend to occur only at the beginning, middle, or end of the right hand side of a production cannot occur somewhere else.
    If the &amp;quot;Simple&amp;quot; method is used, then no new nonterminals are introduced; using this method, it is not possible to recover the n-ary branching structure from the resulting parse tree, and significant overgeneration occurs.
    Table 4 shows the undergeneration probabilities for each of these possible techniques for handling unary productions and n-ary productions.3 The first number in each column is the probability that a sentence in the training data will have a production that occurs nowhere else.
    The second number is the probability that a test set of 75 sentences drawn from this database will have one ungeneratable sentence: 75/974(1 &#8212; p).4 The table is arranged from least generous to most generous: in the upper left hand corner is a technique Bod might reasonably have used; in that case, the probabili
