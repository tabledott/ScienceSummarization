e and one-to-many relationships.
    Figure 2 shows an example of a manually aligned sentence with S and P labels.
    The quality of an alignment A = {(j, aj)  |aj &gt; 0} is then computed by appropriately redefined precision and recall measures: and the following alignment error rate (AER), which is derived from the well-known F-measure: A manual alignment with S (filled squares) and P (unfilled squares) connections.
    These definitions of precision, recall and the AER are based on the assumption that a recall error can occur only if an S alignment is not found and a precision error can occur only if the found alignment is not even P. The set of sentence pairs for which the manual alignment is produced is randomly selected from the training corpus.
    It should be emphasized that all the training of the models is performed in a completely unsupervised way (i.e., no manual alignments are used).
    From this point of view, there is no need to have a test corpus separate from the training corpus.
