vent: In the GENIA event corpus only one of these is annotated, with preference given to shorter names over longer descriptive ones.
    Thus of the above example events, the latter would be annotated.
    However, as both express the same event, in the shared task evaluation either alternative was accepted as correct extraction of the event.
    In order to implement this aspect of the evaluation, expressions of equivalent entities were annotated as follows: Eq (B cell transcription factor, BSAP) The equivalent entity annotation in the revised GENIA corpus covers also cases other than simple apposition, illustrated in Figure 3.
    A frequent case in biomedical literature involves use of the slash symbol (&#8220;/&#8221;) to state synonyms.
    The slash symbol is ambiguous as it is used also to indicate dimerized proteins.
    In the case of p50/p50, the two p50 are annotated as equivalent because they represent the same proteins at the same state.
    Note that although rare, also explicitly introduced ali
