 the predicted entries for unknown words) is available, we follow the same methodology from Sections 3 and 4 using integer programming to minimize the size of the grammar and then applying EM to estimate parameter values.
    Figure 9 shows comparative results for the 17tagset case when the dictionary is incomplete.
    The second and third rows in the table shows tagging accuracies for different systems when a cutoff of 2 (i.e., all word types that occur with frequency counts &lt; 2 in the test corpus are removed) and a cutoff of 3 (i.e., all word types occurring with frequency counts &lt; 3 in the test corpus are removed) is applied to the dictionary.
    This yields lexicons containing 2,141 and 1,249 words respectively, which are much smaller compared to the original 49,206 word dictionary.
    As the results in Figure 9 illustrate, the IP+EM method clearly does better than all the other systems except for the LDA+AC model.
    The LDA+AC model from Toutanova and Johnson (2008) has a strong ambiguity clas
