n that all lexical categories that have the same syntactic type project the same dependencies.
    It may be possible to use the indices on the PRO-null elements (*-1) in the Treebank to identify and resolve ambiguous cases; we leave this to future research.10 Function application and composition typically result in the instantiation of the lexical head of an argument of some functor category, and therefore create new dependencies, whereas coordination creates a new category whose lexical head lists are concatenations of the head lists of the conjuncts.
    When the (S[ng]\NP1)/NP2 passing is combined with the NP the buck, the lexical head of the NP2 is instantiated with buck.
    Similarly, when the adverb just (S\NP1)/(S\NP)2 is applied to passing the buck, a dependency between just and passing is created: However, because (S\NP1)/(S\NP)2 is a modifier category, the head of the resulting S[ng]\NP is passing, not just (and no dependency is established between just and its NP1).
    In the next step, this S[n
