, PropBank lists multiple constituents as aggregately filling the ARG1 slot of held.
    These cases are detected automatically because the least common ancestor of the argument pieces is actually one of the argument segments.
    In the above example, to chew on subjects such as... depends on Million-dollar conferences because to modifies conferences through a NMOD dependency.
    In these situations, we treat the least common ancestor, e.g., conferences in the above text, as the true argument.
    This heuristic allowed us to merge 1665 (or 0.6% of total) arguments that were initially discontinuous in the PropBank training corpus.
    Empty categories PropBank and NomBank both encode chains of empty categories.
    As with the 2005 shared task (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005), we used the head of the antecedent of empty categories as arguments rather than empty categories.
    Furthermore, empty category arguments with no antecedents were ignored.10 For example, given The man wanted t to make a speech, we assu
