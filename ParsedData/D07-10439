			Clustering algorithms divide an input data set into a number of partitions, or clusters.
			For tasks wheresome target partition can be defined for testing purposes, we define a ?clustering solution?
			as a map ping from each data point to its cluster assignments in both the target and hypothesized clustering.
			In the context of this discussion, we will refer to the target partitions, or clusters, as CLASSES, referring only to hypothesized clusters as CLUSTERS.Two commonly used external measures for as sessing clustering success are Purity and Entropy (Zhao and Karypis, 2001), defined as, Purity = ?kr=1 1n maxi(nir) Entropy = ?kr=1 nrn (?
			1log q ?q i=1 nir nr log nir nr ) where q is the number of classes, k the number of clusters, nr is the size of cluster r, and nir is the number of data points in class i clustered in cluster r. Both these approaches represent plausable ways to evaluate the homogeneity of a clustering solution.However, ou
