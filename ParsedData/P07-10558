uld be the polarity of the document and ysi would indicate whether sentence si is subjective or objective.
    The models presented here are compatible with arbitrary sets of discrete output labels.
    Figure 1 presents a model for jointly classifying the sentiment of both the sentences and the document.
    In this undirected graphical model, the label of each sentence is dependent on the labels of its neighbouring sentences plus the label of the document.
    The label of the document is dependent on the label of every sentence.
    Note that the edges between the input (each sentence) and the output labels are not solid, indicating that they are given as input and are not being modeled.
    The fact that the sentiment of sentences is dependent not only on the local sentiment of other sentences, but also the global document sentiment &#8211; and vice versa &#8211; allows the model to directly capture the importance of classification decisions across levels in fine-tocoarse sentiment analysis.
    The local
