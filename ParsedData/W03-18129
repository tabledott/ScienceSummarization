    The assumption was that if a verb-particle was sufficiently similar to its head verb, then the verb contributed its simplex meaning.
    It gave empirical backing to this assumption by showing that annotator judgements for verbparticle decomposability correlate significantly with non-expert human judgements on the similarity between a verb-particle construction and its head verb.
    Bannard et al. (2003) extended this research in looking explicitly at the task of classifying verb-particles as being compositional or not.
    They successfully combined statistical and distributional techniques (including LSA) with a substitution test in analysing compositionality.
    McCarthy et al. (2003) also targeted verb-particles for a study on compositionality, and judged compositionality according to the degree of overlap in the N most similar words to the verbparticle and head verb, e.g., to determine compositionality.
    We are not the first to consider applying LSA to MWEs.
