    Including only as selectional restriction for targets might help eliminate incorrect building extractions.
    One could argue that this pattern is not likely to find building extractions anyway so the selectional restriction will not matter, but the selectional restriction might help filter out incorrect extractions due to misparses or (e.g., &amp;quot;The White House by reporters.&amp;quot;).
    Ultimately, it is an empirical question whether it is better to include all of the semantic categories associated with a conceptual role or not.
    Finally, we merge the expanded extraction patterns into multi-slot case frames.
    All extraction patterns that share the same trigger word and compatible syntactic constraints are merged into a single structure.
    For example, we would merge all patterns triggered by a specific verb in its passive voice.
    For example, the patter
