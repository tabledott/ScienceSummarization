emCor.
    Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method discovers appropriate predominant senses for words from two domainspecific corpora.
  
  
    The first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised WSD systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account.
    This is shown by the results of the English all-words task in SENSEVAL-2 (Cotton et al., 1998) in figure 1 below, where the first sense is that listed in WordNet for the PoS given by the Penn TreeBank (Palmer et al., 2001).
    The senses in WordNet are ordered according to the frequency data in the manually tagged resource SemCor (Miller et al., 1993).
    Senses that have not occurred in SemCor are ordered arbitrarily and after those senses of the word that have occurred.
    The figure distinguishes systems which make use of hand-tagged data (using HTD) such as SemCor, from those that do not (without HTD).
    The high performance of the first sense baseline is due to the skewed frequency dist
