xt features can be extracted.
    This also explains why &#8220;CS&#8221; features often fail.
    For such cases, the method falls back to context-independent normalisation.
    We found that only 32.6% ill-formed words have all IV words in their context windows.
    Moreover, the IV words may not occur in the dependency bank, further decreasing the effectiveness of context support features.
    Second, the different features are linearly combined, where a weighted combination is likely to give better results, although it also requires a certain amount of well-sampled annotations for tuning.
  
  
    In this paper, we have proposed the task of lexical normalisation for short text messages, as found in Twitter and SMS data.
    We found that most illformed words are based on morphophonemic variation and proposed a cascaded method to detect and normalise ill-formed words.
    Our ill-formed word detector requires no explicit annotations, and the dependency-based features were shown to be somewhat effective, h
