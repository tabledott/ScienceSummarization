    We give here a syntactic description of the QLF constructs for terms and formulasl.
    A QLF term must be one of the following The term index, Idx, uniquely identifies the term expression.
    Cat is a list of feature-value equations, for example &lt;type=pro ,num=sing , &gt;.
    Restr is a first-order, one-place predicate.
    For a resolved term, Quant will be a generalized quantifier (a cardinality predicate holding of two properties) and Reft, the term's 'referent', will be a constant or term index.
    For an 'unresolved' term, Quant and Reft may be meta-variables (_x,_y,...).
    (QLF terms may also be functional applications, though we will ignore these here).
    A QLF formula must be one of the following Predicate is a first or higher-order predicate, including the usual logical operators and, not, etc.
    An argument may be a term, a formula or a lambda abstract.
    Lambda abstracts take the form Var.-Body where Body is a formula or an abstract and Var is a variable ranging over individuals
