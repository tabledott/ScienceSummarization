reading grammatical function from the parse tree, as well as errors in the parser output.
    The voice feature distinguishes between active and passive verbs, and is important in predicting semantic roles because direct objects of active verbs correspond to subjects of passive verbs.
    An instance of a verb was considered passive if it is tagged as a past participle (e.g. taken), unless it occurs as a descendent verb phrase headed by any form of have (e.g. has taken) without an intervening verb phrase headed by any form of be (e.g. has been taken).
    The head word is a lexical feature, and provides information about the semantic type of the role filler.
    Head words of nodes in the parse tree are determined using the same deterministic set of head word rules used by Collins (1999).
    The system attempts to predict argument roles in new data, looking for the highest probability assignment of roles ri to all constituents i in the sentence, given the set of features Fi = {pti, pathi, posi, vi, hi} at ea
