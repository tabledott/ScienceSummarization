0M, including direct and inverse links.
    TypeDM is a 30,693 x 25,336 x 30,693 tensor with density 0.0005%.
    To sum up, the three DM instance models herein differ in the degree of lexicalization of the link set, and/or in the scoring function.
    LexDM is a heavily lexicalized model, contrasting with DepDM, which has a minimum degree of lexicalization, and consequently the smallest set of links.
    TypeDM represents a sort of middle level both for the kind and the number of links.
    These consist of syntactic and lexicalized patterns, as in LexDM.
    The lexical information encoded in the LexDM suffixes, however, is not used to generate different links, but to implement a different counting scheme as part of a different scoring function.
    A weighted tuple structure (equivalently: a labeled DM tensor) is intended as a long-term semantic resource that can be used in different projects for different tasks, analogously to traditional hand-coded resources such as WordNet.
    Coherent with this approa
