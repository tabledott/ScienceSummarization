arate classifiers: Cen and C,n.
    Therefore, in the classification phase, we can obtain two prediction values for a test review.
    We normalize the prediction values into [-1, 1] by dividing the maximum absolute value.
    Finally, the average of the normalized values is used as the overall prediction value of the review.
  
  
    The following three datasets were collected and used in the experiments: Test Set (Labeled Chinese Reviews): In order to assess the performance of the proposed approach, we collected and labeled 886 product reviews (451 positive reviews + 435 negative reviews) from a popular Chinese IT product web site-IT1688.
