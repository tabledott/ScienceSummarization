zero make up one-word cepts; those for which it is zero do not.
    We can easily extend the generative process upon which Models 3, 4, and 5 are based to encompass multi-word cepts.
    We need only include a step for selecting the ceptual scheme and ascribe fertilities to cepts rather than to words, requiring that the fertility of each cept be greater than zero.
    Then, in Equation (29), we can replace the products over words in an English string with products over cepts in the ceptual scheme.
    When we venture beyond one-word cepts, however, we must tread lightly.
    An English string can contain any of 42,005 one-word cepts, but there are more than 1.7 billion possible two-word cepts, more than 74 trillion three-word cepts, and so on.
    Clearly, one must be discriminating in choosing potential multi-word cepts.
    The caution that we have displayed thus far in limiting ourselves to cepts with fewer than two words was motivated primarily by our respect for the featureless desert that multi-word cep
