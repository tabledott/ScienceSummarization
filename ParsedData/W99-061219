&#8226; We say that P has a dominant if there is an i in {1...n} such that pi &gt; 0.5, or in other words if We say that P has an a-semi-dominant with respect to an event k, where c&gt; 1, if it does not have k as dominant and there exist i in {1...n} such that A few comments about these definitions are necessary: it can be easily observed that not every distribution has a dominant, even though it has a maximum value.
    The second definition, of a-semidominant, makes sense if we consider a particular event k that is not relevant (or the result cannot be measured).
    By removing this event and normalizing the rest of the values, we obtain a new distribution (of size n-1) having an a-dominant.
    The core of stage 2 is the bootstrapping procedure.
    The known names (either from the original training list or otherwise learned data) are inserted sequentially into the morphological tries, modifying the probability distributions of the nodes on the paths accordingly (the data structure is illustrated in Figu
