tstrapping process will not get off the ground.
    So we searched for each of the 850 nouns in the bootstrapping corpus, sorted them by frequency, and manually selected 20 high-frequency words that we judged to be strongly subjective.
    Table 3 shows the 20 seed words used for both Meta-Bootstrapping and Basilisk.
    We ran each bootstrapping algorithm for 400 iterations, generating 5 words per iteration.
    Basilisk generated 2000 nouns and Meta-Bootstrapping generated 1996 nouns.4 Table 4 shows some examples of extraction patterns that were discovered to be associated with subjective nouns.
    Meta-Bootstrapping and Basilisk are semi-automatic lexicon generation tools because, although the bootstrapping process is 100% automatic, the resulting lexicons need to be reviewed by a human.5 So we manually reviewed the 3996 words proposed by the algorithms.
    This process is very fast; it takes only a few seconds to classify each word.
    The entire review process took approximately 3-4 hours.
