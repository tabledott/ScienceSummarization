 in the desired types of events.
    The retrieved articles would then be annotated with augmented tree structures to serve as a training corpus.
    Initially, we tried to annotate the training corpus by hand marking, for each sentence, the entire augmented tree.
    It soon became painfully obvious that this task could not be performed in the available time.
    Our annotation staff found syntactic analysis particularly complex and slow going.
    By necessity, we adopted the strategy of hand marking only the semantics.
    Figure 4 shows an example of the semantic annotation, which was the only type of manual annotation we performed.
    To produce a corpus of augmented parse trees, we used the following multi-step training procedure which exploited the Penn TREEBANK Applying this procedure yielded a new version of the semantically annotated corpus, now annotated with complete augmented trees like that in Figure 3.
  
  
    In this section, we describe the algorithm that was used to automatically produce
