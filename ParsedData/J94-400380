rained than a mapping to Roget's categories).
    Also, both methods can distinguish only between senses that are distinguished by the mappings they use: either senses that belong to different classes, or senses that correspond to different target words.
    An interesting difference, though, relates to the feasibility of implementing the two methods for a new domain of texts (in particular technical domains).
    The construction of a bilingual lexicon for a new domain is relatively straightforward and is often carried out for translation purposes.
    The construction of an appropriate classification for the words of a new domain is more complex, and furthermore, it is not clear whether it is possible in every domain to construct a classification that is sufficient for the purpose of sense disambiguation.
    Sense disambiguation methods require a decision model that evaluates the relevant statistics.
    Sense disambiguation thus resembles many other decision tasks, and not surprisingly, several common dec
