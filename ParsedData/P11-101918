ibutes to a large decrease in Pearson&#8217;s correlation.
    In order to test the significance of the improved correlations, we ran one-tailed t-tests with a = 0.05 for the difference between dependent correlations (Williams, 1959; Steiger, 1980).
    The results showed that PoS ngrams, PS rules, the complexity measures, and the estimated error-rate contribute significantly to the improvement of Spearman&#8217;s correlation, while PS rules also contribute significantly to the improvement of Pearson&#8217;s correlation.
    One of the main approaches adopted by previous systems involves the identification of features that measure writing skill, and then the application of linear or stepwise regression to find optimal feature weights so that the correlation with manually assigned scores is maximised.
    We trained a SVM regression model with our full set of feature types and compared it to the SVM rank preference model.
    The results are given in Table 3.
    The rank preference model improves Pearson&#821
