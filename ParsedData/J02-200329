e test set contains nouns, rather than noun senses, and so the sense of the noun that is most probable given the verb and object slot was used.)
    An average difference in depth was then calculated.
    To give an example of how the difference in depth was calculated, suppose (dog) generalized to (placental mammal) via (canine) and (carnivore); in this case the difference would be three.
    The results for various levels of &#945; and different sample sizes are shown in Table 4.
    The figures in each column arise from using the contingency tables based on the complete training data, but with each count in the table multiplied by the percentage at the head of the column.
    Thus the 50% column is based on contingency tables in which each original count is multiplied by 50%, which is equivalent to using a sample one-half the size of the original training set.
    Reading across a row shows how the generalization varies with sample size, and reading down a column shows how it varies with &#945;.
