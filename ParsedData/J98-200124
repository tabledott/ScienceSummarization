uent-mention, corresponding to Hawkins's anaphoric definite descriptions and Prince's discourse-old, and first-mention, including all other definite descriptions.
    Fraurud simplified matters in this way because she was primarily interested in verifying the empirical basis for the claim that familiarity is the defining property of definite descriptions; she also observed, however, that some of the distinctions introduced by Hawkins and Prince led to ambiguities of classification.
    For example, she observed that the reader of a Swedish newspaper can equally well interpret the definite description the king in an article about Sweden by reference to the larger situation or to the content of the article.
    We took into account Fraurud's observations in designing our experiments, and we will compare our results to hers below.
  
  
    For our first experiment evaluating subjects' performance at the classification task, we developed a taxonomy of definite description uses based on the schemes discussed in t
