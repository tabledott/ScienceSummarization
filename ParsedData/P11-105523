ross relations, precision increases 12 points but recall drops 26 points, for an overall reduction in F1 score from 60.5% to 40.3%.
    One final advantage of our model is the modest running time.
    Our implementation of the Riedel et al. (2010) approach required approximately 6 hours to train on NY Times 05-06 and 4 hours to test on the NY Times 07, each without preprocessing.
    Although they do sampling for inference, the global aggregation variables require reasoning about an exponentially large (in the number of sentences) sample space.
    In contrast, our approach required approximately one minute to train and less than one second to test, on the same data.
    This advantage comes from the decomposition that is possible with the deterministic OR aggregation variables.
    For test, we simply consider each sentence in isolation and during training our approximation to the weighted assignment problem is linear in the number of sentences.
    The sentential extraction results demonstrates the advantag
