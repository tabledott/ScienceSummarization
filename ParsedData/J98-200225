ed to the fact we noted earlier that even though MLE can provide the best fit to the given data, the estimation accuracy of the parameters is poor, when applied on a sample of modest size, as there are too many parameters to estimate.
    MLE is likely to estimate most parameters to be zero, and thus suffers from the data sparseness problem.
    Note in Table 4, that MDL avoids this problem by taking into account the model complexity as well as the fit to the data.
    MDL stipulates that the model with the minimum description length should be selected both for data compression and estimation.
    This intimate connection between estimation and data compression can also be thought of as that between estimation and generalization, since in order to compress information, generalization is necessary.
    In our current problem, this corresponds to the generalization of individual nouns present in case frame instances in the data as classes of nouns present in a given thesaurus.
    For example, given the thesaur
