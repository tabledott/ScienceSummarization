ance assignments that were randomly generated for the same texts followed a normal distribution with p = 47 31,o = 004 These results suggest that the agreement among judges is significant Agreement among judges with respect to the importance of each textual unit.
    We considered a textual unit to be labeled consistently if a simple majority of the judges (&gt; 7) assigned the same score to that unit Over'Section 32 gives an example of how the Importance scores were computed all, the judges labeled consistently 140 of the 160 textual units (87%) In contrast, a set of 1000 randomly generated importance scores showed agreement, on average, for only 50 of the 160 textual units p1ng=0 05 The judges consistently labeled 36 of the units as very important, 8 as less important, and 96 as unimportant They were inconsistent with respect to 20 textual units For example, for text (1), the judges consistently labeled units 4 and 12 as very important, units 5 and 6 as less Iraportant, units 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 1
