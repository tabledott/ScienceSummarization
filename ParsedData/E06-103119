    As it could be arguable whether Pearson&#8217;s r is meaningful for categorical data like human MT evaluation, we have also calculated Kendall&#8217;s correlation coefficient T. Because of the high number of samples (= sentences, 4460) versus the low number of categories (= outcomes of adequacy+fluency, 9), we calculated T separately for each source sentence.
    These experiments showed that Kendall&#8217;s T reflects the same tendencies as Pearson&#8217;s r regarding the ranking of the evaluation measures.
    But only the latter allows for an efficient calculation of confidence intervals.
    Consequently, figures of T are omitted in this paper.
    Due to the small number of samples for evaluation on system level (10 and 5, respectively), all correlation coefficients between automatic and human evaluation on system level are very close to 1.
    Therefore, they do not show any significant differences for the different evaluation measures.
