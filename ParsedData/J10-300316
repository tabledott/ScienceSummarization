    Both of these task formulations fall under the category of paraphrase detection or recognition.
    The latter formulation of the task has become popular in recent years (Dolan and Dagan 2005) and paraphrase generation techniques that require monolingual parallel or comparable corpora (discussed in Section 3) can benefit immensely from this task.
    In general, paraphrase recognition can be very helpful for several NLP applications.
    Two examples of such applications are text-to-text generation and information extraction.
    Text-to-text generation applications rely heavily on paraphrase recognition.
    For a multi-document summarization system, detecting redundancy is a very important concern because two sentences from different documents may convey the same semantic content and it is important not to repeat the same information in the summary.
    On this note, Barzilay and McKeown (2005) exploit the redundancy present in a given set of sentences by detecting paraphrastic parts a
