 and language modeling has been suggested in (Beyerlein, 1997; Peters and Klakow, 1999).
  
  
    We have presented a framework for statistical MT for natural languages, which is more general than the widely used source-channel approach.
    It allows a baseline MT system to be extended easily by adding new feature functions.
    We have shown that a baseline statistical MT system can be significantly improved using this framework.
    There are two possible interpretations for a statistical MT system structured according to the sourcechannel approach, hence including a model for Pr(ei) and a model for Pr(fi Iei).
    We can interpret it as an approximation to the Bayes decision rule in Eq.
    2 or as an instance of a direct maximum entropy model with feature functions log Pr(ei) and log Pr(fi |ei).
    As soon as we want to use model scaling factors, we can only do this in a theoretically justified way using the second interpretation.
    Yet, the main advantage comes from the large number of additional po
