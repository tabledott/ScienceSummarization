 each language &#163; and an m, n, k ti Given these values, we now draw the appropriate number of stray an d abstract morphemes from the corresponding distributions: e1, ..., em &#8764; E f1, ..., fn &#8764; F (ei, fi), ..., (ek, f&#65533;k) &#8764; A The sets of morphemes drawn for each language are then ordered: &#732;e1, ..., &#732;em+k &#8764; ORDER|e1, ..., em, ei, ..., ek &#732;f1, ..., &#732;fn+k &#8764; ORDER|f1, ..., fn, f1, ..., fk Finally the ordered morphemes are fused into the words that form the parallel phrases: To keep the model as simple as possible, we employ uniform distributions over the sets of orderings and fusings.
    In other words, given a set of r morphemes (for each language), we define the distribution over permutations of the morphemes to simply be ORDER(&#183;|r) = 1&#65533;&#65533;.
    Then, given a fixed morpheme order, we consider fusing each adjacent morpheme into a single word.
    Again, we simply model the distribution over the r &#8722; 1 fusing decisions uniformly as F
