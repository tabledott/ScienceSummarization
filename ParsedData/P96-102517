ls which has not been seen in training data will get zero probability.
    Thus the parser searches through the space of all trees with nonterminal triples seen in training data.
    Probabilities of baseNPs in the chart are calculated using (19), while probabilities for other constituents are derived from the dependencies and baseNPs that they contain.
    A dynamic programming algorithm is used: if two proposed constituents span the same set of words, have the same label, head, and distance from with the punctuation rule described in section 2.7; (3) is model (2) with POS tags ignored when lexical information is present; (4) is model (3) with probability distributions from the POS tagger.
    LR/LP labeled recall/precision.
    CBs is the average number of crossing brackets per sentence.
    0 CBs, &lt; 2 CBs are the percentage of sentences with 0 or &lt; 2 crossing brackets respectively. join to form a new constituent.
    Each operation gives two new probability terms: one for the baseNP gap tag between t
