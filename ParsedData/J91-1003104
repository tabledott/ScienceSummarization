    I would like to thank the many people at the Cognitive Studies Centre, University of Essex; the Computing Research Laboratory, New Mexico State University; and the Centre for Systems Science, Simon Fraser University, with whom I have had fruitful discussions over the years, especially those in the beliefs group at the CRL (Afzal Ballim, John Barnden, Sylvia Candelaria de Ram, and Yorick Wilks); others at the CRL (including Xiuming Huang, David Farwell, and Eric Dietrich); and colleagues in the CSS who made helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper (Chris Groeneboer, Gary Hall, and Carl Vogel).
    A special word of thanks for the help given by Yorick Wilks, the director of the CRL, and Nick Cercone, the director of the CSS.
    I also gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by SERC Project GR/C/68828 while at Essex, by the New Mexico State Legislature while at NMSU, and by the Advanced Systems Institu
