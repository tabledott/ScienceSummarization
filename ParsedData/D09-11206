e antecedent compatibility filter allows proper and nominal mentions to corefer only with mentions that have the same head (improved in Section 3.2), and pronouns have no compatibility constraints (improved in Section 3.1.2).
    Mention heads are determined by parsing the given mention span with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and using the Collins head rules (Collins, 1999); Poon and Domingos (2008) showed that using syntactic heads strongly outperformed a simple rightmost headword rule.
    The mention type is determined by the head POS tag: proper if the head tag is NNP or NNPS, pronoun if the head tag is PRP, PRP$, WP, or WP$, and nominal otherwise.
    For the selection phase, we order mentions m1, ... , mi_1 according to the position of the head word and select the closest mention that remains after constraint and filtering are applied.
    This choice reflects the intuition of Grosz et al. (1995) that speakers only use pronominal mentions when there are not intervening compatible mention
