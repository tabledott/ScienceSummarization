stop processing the subtree of a constituent whenever the amount of work exceeds that user-specified limit.
    The subtree is discarded, and the parser will move on to another subtree.
    This guarantees that parsing will be finished within reasonable limits of time and memory but at a cost of possibly lower accuracy if it causes the best analysis of a constituent to be discarded.
    As a separate parameter, XLE also lets the user limit the length of medial constituents, i.e., constituents that do not appear at the beginning or the end of a sentence (ignoring punctuation).
    The rationale behind this heuristic is to limit the weight of constituents in the middle of the sentence but still to allow sentence-final heavy constituents.
    This discards constituents in a somewhat more principled way as it tries to capture the psycholinguistic tendency to avoid deep center-embedding.
    When limiting the length of medial constituents, cubictime parsing is possible for sentences up to that length, even with a
