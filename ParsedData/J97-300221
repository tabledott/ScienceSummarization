ected, such as English and Chinese.
    It would not be expected to hold for so-called scrambling or free-word-order languages, or heavily inflected languages.
    However, inflections provide alternative surface cues for determining constituent roles (and 3 As discussed later, in many cases more than one parse tree can generate the same subconstituent matching.
    The trees shown are the canonical parses, as generated by the grammar of Figure 10. the policy station .
    The Security Bureau granted The 24 complete matchings of length four, with ITG parses for 22. thereby matchings), so it would not be necessary to apply the ITG model to such languages.
    On the other hand, to see how ITGs cut combinatorial growth, consider the table in Figure 6, which compares growth in the number of legal complete matchings on a pair of subconstituent sequences.
    The third column shows the number of all possible complete matchings between two constituents with a rank of r subconstituents each (therefore this is also t
