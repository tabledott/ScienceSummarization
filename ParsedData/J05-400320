that the most likely English translation of fj is argmaxei{t(fj|ei),t(ei|fj)}.
    Using both sets of probabilities is likely to help us make a better-informed decision.
    Using this alignment strategy, we follow (Och and Ney 2003) and compute one alignment for each translation direction (f - 4e and e -4 f), and then combine them.
    Och and Ney present three combination methods: intersection, union, and refined (a form of intersection expanded with certain additional neighboring links).
    Thus, for each sentence pair, we compute five alignments (two modified-IBMModel-1 plus three combinations) and then extract one set of general features and five sets of alignment features (as described in the previous section).
    We create training instances for our classifier from a small parallel corpus.
    The simplest way to obtain classifier training data from a parallel corpus is to generate all possible sentence pairs from the corpus (the Cartesian product).
    This generates 5,0002 training instances, out o
