n continues with the next step.
    The first iteration of Step 3 on our example collocation would select the word officielles (among the 11 words in S) as the first candidate translation, with a score of 0.94.
    On the second iteration, the word pair (officielles, langues) is selected (out of 35 pairs that pass the threshold) with a score of 0.95.
    On the third run, the word triplet (honneur, officielles, langues), is selected (out of 61 triplets) with a score of 0.45.
    On the eighth iteration of Step 3, P' has only one element, the 8-tuple (suivantes, doug, deposer, lewis, petitions, honneur, officielles, langues) with a score of 0.20.
    Finally, on the ninth iteration of Step 3, P' is empty and Champollion goes to Step 5.
    Stage 2&#8212;Step 4: Updating the set of possible translations.
    Champollion updates the set of possible translations by setting P equal to the Cartesian product of the surviving translations P' and the collection of words S (i.e., those related to the source collocation
