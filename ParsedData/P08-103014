abeling is better than one human annotator and only 4.7% worse than another.
    For argument labeling we can see that crosssentence inference improved both identification (3.7% higher F-Measure) and classification (6.1% higher accuracy); and cross-document inference mainly provided further gains (1.9%) in classification.
    This shows that identification consistency may be achieved within a narrower context while the classification task favors more global background knowledge in order to solve some difficult cases.
    This matches the situation of human annotation as well: we may decide whether a mention is involved in some particular event or not by reading and analyzing the target sentence itself; but in order to decide the argument&#8217;s role we may need to frequently refer to wider discourse in order to infer and confirm our decision.
    In fact sometimes it requires us to check more similar web pages or even wikipedia databases.
    This was exactly the intuition of our approach.
