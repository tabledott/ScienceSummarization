aggers, such as (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), Brill&#8217;s transformation based tagger (Brill, 1995), and the HMM model of Lee et al. (2000), but nevertheless, the only lexicalization consistently included in tagging models is the dependence of the part of speech tag of a word on the word itself.
    In maximum entropy models, joint features which look at surrounding words and their tags, as well as joint features of the current word and surrounding words are in principle straightforward additions, but have not been incorporated into previous models.
    We have found these features to be very useful.
    We explore here lexicalization both alone and in combination with preceding and following tag histories.
    Table 3 shows the development set accuracy of several models with various lexical features.
    All models use the same rare word features as the models in Table 2.
    The first two rows show a baseline model using the current word only.
    The count cutoff for this feature was 0 in the first model and 2 fo
