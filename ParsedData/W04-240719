f tokens (excluding punctuation) that are as signed the correct head (or no head if the token is a root).
			Since parsing is a sentence-level task, we believe that the overall attachment score should be computed as themean attachment score per sentence, which gives an es timate of the expected attachment score for an arbitrary sentence.
			However, since most previous studies instead use the mean attachment score per word (Eisner, 1996; Collins et al, 1999), we will give this measure as well.In order to measure label accuracy, we also define a la beled attachment score, where both the head and the label must be correct, but which is otherwise computed in the same way as the ordinary (unlabeled) attachment score.
			For parsing accuracy, we use a paired t-test for statistical significance.
	
	
			Table 3 shows the prediction accuracy achieved with memory-based learning for the lexical and non-lexical model, with two different parameter settings for the learner.
