ds, in the sense that the training data are merely positive examples for both types of attachments, which could in principle be extracted from pure corpus data with no human intervention.
    (For example, one could just use unambiguous sentences.)
    The third approach, on the other hand, is a supervised learning method, which requires labeled data prepared by a human being.
    The generalization method we propose falls into the second category, although it can also be used as a component in a combined scheme with many of the above methods (see Brill and Resnik [1994], Alshawi and Carter [1994]).
    We estimate P(noun2 I verb, prep) and P(noun2 I nouni, prep) from training data consisting of triples, and compare them: If the former exceeds the latter (by a certain margin) we attach it to verb, else if the latter exceeds the former (by the same margin) we attach it to nouni.
    In our experiments, described below, we compare the performance of our proposed method, which we refer to as MDL, against the met
