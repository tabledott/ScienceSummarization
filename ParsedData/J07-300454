verbials, hence we translate them as adjuncts and lose such examples, of which there are at least three more, all also involving from and to: As in the case of leftward extraction, including such long-range dependencies in the dependency structure is crucial to correct induction and evaluation of all expressive grammar formalisms.
    Although no leftward-extracting parasitic gaps appear to occur in the Treebank, our grammar and model predicts examples like the following, and will cover them when encountered: Conflict which the system was held to cause, rather than resolve.
    (47) 6.4.1 Argument Cluster Coordination.
    If two VPs with the same head are conjoined, the second verb can be omitted.
    The Treebank encodes these constructions as a VPcoordination in which the second VP lacks a verb.
    The daughters of the second conjunct are coindexed with the corresponding elements in the first conjunct using a = index: In the CCG account of this construction, $5 million right away and additional amounts in
