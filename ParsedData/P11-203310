and Clark (2008) (row &#8216;Z&amp;C08 transition&#8217;), the dynamic-programming arc-standard parser of Huang and Sagae (2010) (row &#8216;H&amp;S10&#8217;), and graphbased models including MSTParser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), the baseline feature parser of Koo et al. (2008) (row &#8216;K08 baeline&#8217;), and the two models of Koo and Collins (2010).
    Our extended parser significantly outperformed the baseline parser, achieving the highest attachment score reported for a transition-based parser, comparable to those of the best graph-based parsers.
    Our experiments were performed on a Linux platform with a 2GHz CPU.
    The speed of our baseline parser was 50 sentences per second.
    With all new features added, the speed dropped to 29 sentences per second.
    As an alternative to Penn2Malt, bracketed sentences can also be transformed into Stanford dependencies (De Marneffe et al., 2006).
    Our parser gave 93.5% UAS, 91.9% LAS and 52.1% UEM when trained and evaluated on Stanford basic dependen
