    This amounts to a novel form of relational clustering, where clustering is done not just on fixed elements in relational tuples, but on arbitrary forms that are built up recursively.
    Third, while most existing approaches (manual or supervised learning) learn to parse both syntax and semantics, unsupervised semantic parsing starts directly from syntactic analyses and focuses solely on translating them to semantic content.
    This enables us to leverage advanced syntactic parsers and (indirectly) the available rich resources for them.
    More importantly, it separates the complexity in syntactic analysis from the semantic one, and makes the latter much easier to perform.
    In particular, meaning composition does not require domain-specific procedures for generating candidate lexicons, as is often needed by supervised methods.
    The input to our USP system consists of dependency trees of training sentences.
    Compared to phrase-structure syntax, dependency trees are the more appropriate star
