			The component probabilities {?z} will decay exponentially in expectation, but there is always some probability of getting a smallercomponent before a larger one.
			The parameter ? de termines the decay of these probabilities: a larger ? implies a slower decay and thus more components.
			Given the component probabilities, the rest of the DP mixture model is identical to the finite mixture model: DP mixture model ? ?
