cise filter cascade was selected.
    Words that the most precise lexicon &amp;quot;didn't know about,&amp;quot; which were found in the second most precise lexicon, were translated next.
    All the other available lexicons were cascaded this way, in the order of their apparent precision, down to the baseline lexicon.
    This &amp;quot;cascaded back-off&amp;quot; strategy maintained the recall of the baseline lexicon, while taking advantage of the higher precision produced by various filter cascades.
    Although more sophisticated translation strategies are certainly possible, BiBLE percent correct scores for cascaded lexicons suffice to test the utility of data filters for machine translation.
    The results in Figure 8 indicate that the filters described in this paper can be used to improve the performance of lexical transfer models by more than 35%.
  
  
    The research presented here makes several contributions to research in machine translation and related fields: The effectiveness of different dat
