 different decision thresholds. paragraph pairs for which this feature would apply (i.e., have a value over the specified threshold).
    Finally, the fifth and sixth columns show the recall and precision on identifying similar paragraphs for each independent feature.
    Note that some features have low applicability over the entire corpus, but target the hard-to-find similar pairs, resulting in significant gains in recall and precision.
    Table 2 presents a selected subset of primitive and composite features in order to demonstrate our results.
    For example, it was not surprising to observe that the most effective primitive feain determining similarity are word, NP, other primitives as not as effective independently.
    This is to be expected since nouns name objects, entities, and concepts, and frequently exhibit more sense constancy.
    In contrast, verbs are functions and tend to shift senses in a more fluid fashion depending on context.
    Furthermore, our technique does not label phrasal verbs
