pronunciation modeling for speech recognition.
    Satta and Henderson (1997) propose a transformation learning method for generic string transduction.
    Brill and Moore (2000) propose an alternative string distance metric and learning algorithm.
    While early statistical machine translation models, such as Brown et al. (1993), did not use any cognate based information to seed their wordto-word translation probabilities, subsequent models (Chen, 1993 and Simard et al., 1992) incorporated some simple deterministic heuristics to increase the translation model probabilities for cognates.
    Other methods have been demonstrated for building bilingual dictionaries using simple heuristic rules includes Kirschner (1982) for English/Czech dictionaries and Chen (1998) for Chinese/English proper names.
    Tiedemann (1999) improves on these alignment seedings by learning all-or-nothing rules for detecting Swedish/English cognates.
