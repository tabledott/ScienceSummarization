sented by a set of eight specialized backbone grammar rules.
    In the grammar, unbounded dependency constructions (UBCs) are analyzed by propagating the preposed constituent through the parse tree as the value of the SLASH feature, to link it with the 'gap' that appears in the constituent's normal position.
    All nonlexical major categories contain the feature, rules in the grammar propagating it between mother and a single daughter; other daughters are marked [SLASH [NOSLASH +1] indicating that the daughter is not 'gapped.'
    Backbone grammar construction would normally lose the information in the unification grammar about where gaps are allowed to occur, significantly degrading the performance of a parser.
    To carry the information over into the backbone we declare that wherever SLASH occurs with a variable value, the value should be expanded out into two values: [NOSLASH +], and a notional value unifying with anything except [NOSLASH +3.
    We have also experimented with a smaller grammar employi
