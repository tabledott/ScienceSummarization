    Here we test both the LTAG While the research of (Marcu et al., 2006) has and CCG supertaggers.
    We interpolate (log-linearly) much in common with the approach proposed here the supertagged components (language model and (such as the syntactified target phrases), there rephrase table) with the components of a standard main a number of significant differences.
    Firstly, PBSMT system.
    Our experiments on the Arabic&#8211; rather than induce millions of xRS rules from parEnglish NIST 2005 test suite show that each of the allel data, we extract phrase pairs in the standard supertagged systems significantly improves over the way (Och &amp; Ney, 2003) and associate with each baseline PBSMT system.
    Interestingly, combining phrase-pair a set of target language syntactic structhe two taggers together diminishes the benefits of tures based on supertag sequences.
