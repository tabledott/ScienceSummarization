 frequent sense in the training data and assigns that to all instances in the test data.
    The Naive Bayesian classifier is based on a feature set where every word that occurs 5 or more times in the training data is included as a feature.
    All of these learned models are used to disambiguate the test data.
    The test data is kept separate until this stage.
    We employ a fine grained scoring method, where a word is counted as correctly disambiguated only when the assigned sense tag exactly matches the true sense tag.
    No partial credit is assigned for near misses.
  
  
    The accuracy attained by each of the learning algorithms is shown in Table 1.
    Column 5 reports the accuracy of the majority classifier, columns 6 and 7 show the best and average accuracy reported by the 10 participating SENSEVAL teams.
    The evaluation at SENSEVAL was based on precision and recall, so we converted those scores to accuracy by taking their product.
    However, the best precision and recall may have come fro
