sistent and the model is accurate; then A+ should be near 1 and Ashould be near 0.
    To find the most probable values of the hidden model parameters A+ and A-, we adopt the standard method of maximum likelihood estimation, and find the values that maximize the probability of the link frequency distributions.
    The one-to-one assumption implies independence between different link types, so that The factors on the right-hand side of Equation 1 can be written explicitly with the help of a mixture coefficient.
    Let r be the probability that an arbitrary co-occurring pair of word types are mutual translations.
    Let B(kin,p) denote the probability that k links are observed out of n co-occurrences, where k has a binomial distribution with parameters n and p. Then the probability that u and v are linked k(u,v) times out of n(u,v) co-occurrences is a mixture of two binomials: One more variable allows us to express T in terms of A+ and A- : Let A be the probability that an arbitrary co-occuring pair of word t
