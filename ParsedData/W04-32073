lish dependency parsing and Korean morphological analysis.
    &#167;4 presents Korean parsing results with various monolingual and bilingual algorithms, including our bilingual parsing algorithm.
    We close by reviewing prior work in areas related to this paper (&#167;5).
  
  
    The joint model used by our bilingual parser is an instance of a stochastic bilingual multitext grammar (2MTG), formally defined by Melamed (2003).
    The 2MTG formalism generates two strings such that each syntactic constituent&#8212;including individual words&#8212;in one side of the bitext corresponds either to a constituent in the other side or to &#8709;.
    Melamed defines bilexicalized MTG (L2MTG), which is a synchronous extension of bilexical grammars such as those described in Eisner and Satta (1999) and applies the latter&#8217;s algorithmic speedups to L2MTG-parsing.
    Our formalism is not a precise fit to either unlexicalized MTG or L2MTG since we posit lexical dependency structure only in one of the languages (E
