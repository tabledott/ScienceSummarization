presentations are equivalent under some one-to-one mapping.
    A parsing model does not need to be tied to the annotation style of the treebank on which it is trained.
    The following procedure can be used to transform trees in both training and test data into a new representation: Alternative annotation styles for a sentence S with a verb head V, left modifiers X1, X2, and right modifiers Y1, Y2: (a) the Penn Treebank style of analysis (one level of structure for each bar level); (b) an alternative but equivalent binary branching representation.
    Alternative annotation styles for a noun phrase with a noun head N, left modifiers X1, X2, and right modifiers Y1, Y2: (a) the Penn Treebank style of analysis (one level of structure for each bar level, although note that both the nonrecursive and the recursive noun phrases are labeled NP; (b) an alternative but equivalent binary branching representation; (a) our modification of the Penn Treebank style to differentiate recursive and nonrecursive NPs (in some s
