    Top-down generation using this rule will be forced to expand the lower VP before its complement, since Compl is uninstantiated initially.
    But application of the rule can recur indefinitely, leading to nontermination.
    The problem arises because there is no limit to the size of the subcategorization list.
    Although one might propose an ad hoc upper bound for lexical entries, even this expedient may be insufficient.
    In analyses of Dutch cross-serial verb constructions (Evers, 1975; Huybrechts, 1984), subcategorization lists such as these may be appended by syntactic rules (Moortgat, 1984; Steedman, 1985; Pollard, 1988), resulting in indefinitely long lists.
    Consider the Dutch sentence dat [Jan [Marie [de oppasser [de olifanten that John Mary the keeper the elephants (zag helpen voeren]]]] saw help feed that John saw Mary help the keeper feed the elephants The string of verbs is analysed by appending their subcategorization lists as follows: Subcategorization lists under this analysis can h
