of concepts dominated by concept c, including c itself.
    For example, (animal) is the set consisting of those concepts corresponding to kinds of animals (including (animal) itself).
    The probability of a concept appearing as an argument of a predicate is written p(c | v, r), where c is a concept in WordNet, v is a predicate, and r is an argument position.3 The focus in this article is on the arguments of verbs, but the techniques discussed can be applied to any predicate that takes nominal arguments, such as adjectives.
    The probability p(c  |v, r) is to be interpreted as follows: This is the probability that some noun n in syn(c), when denoting concept c, appears in position r of verb v (given v and r).
    The example used throughout the article is p((dog)  |run,subj), which is the conditional probability that some noun in the synset of (dog), when denoting the concept (dog), appears in the subject position of the verb run.
    Note that, in practice, no distinction is made between the different se
