on is used to control the learning margin between pairs of translations with different ranks as described in Section 3.5.
    There are many candidates for .
    The following definition for is one of the simplest solutions.
    We will use this function in our experiments on MT reranking.
  
  
    We provide experimental results on the NIST 2003 Chinese-English large data track evaluation.
    We use the data set used in (SMT Team, 2003).
    The training data consists of about 170M English words, on which the baseline translation system is trained.
    The training data is also used to build language models which are used to define feature functions on various syntactic levels.
    The development data consists of 993 Chinese sentences.
    Each Chinese sentence is associated with 1000-best English translations generated by the baseline MT system.
    The development data set is used to estimate the parameters for the feature functions for the purpose of reranking.
    The test data consists of 878 Chinese
