igure 4, we list the first twenty transformations learned from training on the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal Corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).12 The first transformation states that a noun should be changed to a verb if 12 Version 0.5 of the Penn Treebank was used in all experiments reported in this paper. the previous tag is TO, as in: to/TO conflictINNVB with.
    The second transformation fixes a tagging such as: might/MD vanishIVBP&#8212;*VB.
    The third fixes might/MD not reply/NN&#8212;VB.
    The tenth transformation is for the token 's, which is a separate token in the Penn Treebank.
    's is most frequently used as a possessive ending, but after a personal pronoun, it is a verb (John 's, compared to he 's).
    The transformations changing IN to WDT are for tagging the word that, to determine in which environments that is being used as a synonym of which.
    In general, no relationships between words have been directly encoded in stochastic n-gram taggers.'
