 A is a d-link X together with a vector of d-spans a in normal form.
    The cardinality of an item is the total number of intervals in its d-span vector.
    Binarized MTG productions can be inferred under generalizations of the ID and LP constraints described in Section 3.
    We use two helper functions to express these constraints.
    + is the concatenation operator for d-spans: Given two d-spans, it outputs the union of their intervals in normal form.12 The 0 function computes the role template that describes the relative positions of the intervals in two d-spans.
    E.g., if v = (1, 3; 8, 9) and a = (7,8), then v + o- = (1, 3; 7, 9) and v 0 o- = [1], [2, 1].
    Both operators apply componentwise to vectors of d-spans.
    With their help, we state the composition inference rule of Parser A: The space complexity of Parser A is a function of the maximum number of boundaries stored in its item signatures, and the number INI of nonterminals in the grammar.
    The maximum number of required boundaries is
