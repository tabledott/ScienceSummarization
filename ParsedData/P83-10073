    Each S, has a single center, a set of centers, Cb(S) serves to link S to the preceding discourse, while Cf(S) provides a set of entities to which the succeeding discourse may be linked.
    To avoid confusion, the phrase 'the center' will he used to refer only to Cb(S).
    To clarify the notion of center, we will consider a number of discourses illustrating the various factors that combined in (abstractly) and in its identification in a discourse.
    In Section 5 we define center more precisely, show how it relates to Sidner's [19811 immediate focus and potential foci, and discuss how the linkages established by the centers of a sentence help to determine the degree of intelligibility of a discourse.
    We begin by showing that
