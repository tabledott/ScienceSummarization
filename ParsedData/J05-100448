lthough for the relevant verbs additional semantic information is provided through the mapping to VerbNet.
  The PropBank semantic roles for a given VerbNet class may not correspond to the semantic elements highlighted by a particular FrameNet frame, as shown by the examples of Table 5.
  In this case, FrameNet?s COMMERCE frame includes roles for Buyer (the receiver of the goods) and Seller (the receiver of the money) and assigns these roles consistently to two sentences describing the same event: FrameNet annotation: (37) [ Buyer Chuck] bought [ Goods a car] [ Seller from Jerry] [ Payment for $1000].
  (38) [ Seller Jerry] sold [ Goods a car] [ Buyer to Chuck] [ Payment for $1000].
