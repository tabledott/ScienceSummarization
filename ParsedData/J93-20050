  Lexical Semantic Techniques For Corpus Analysis
  
    In this paper we outline a research program for computational linguistics, making extensive use of text corpora.
    We demonstrate how a semantic framework for lexical knowledge can suggest richer relationships among words in text beyond that of simple co-occurrence.
    The work suggests how linguistic phenomena such as metonymy and polysemy might be exploitable for semantic tagging of lexical items.
    Unlike with purely statistical collocational analyses, the framework of a semantic theory allows the automatic construction of predictions about deeper semantic among words appearing in systems. illustrate the approach for the acquisition of lexical information for several classes of nominals, and how such techniques can fine-tune the lexical structures acquired from an initial seeding of a machine-readable dictionary.
    In addition to conventional lexical semantic relations, we show how information concerning lexical presuppositions and preference
