y in terms of number of words per type) limits the usefulness of the approach on the Switchboard corpus.
    The benefits of DA modeling might therefore be more pronounced on corpora with more even DA distribution, as is typically the case for task-oriented dialogues.
    Task-oriented dialogues might also feature specific subtypes of general DA categories that might be constrained by discourse.
    Prior research on task-oriented dialogues summarized in the next section, however, has also found only small reductions in WER (on the order of 1%).
    This suggests that even in task-oriented domains more research is needed to realize the potential of DA modeling for ASR.
    As indicated in the introduction, our work builds on a number of previous efforts in computational discourse modeling and automatic discourse processing, most of which occurred over the last half-decade.
    It is generally not possible to directly compare quantitative results because of vast differences in methodology, tag set, type and am
