of its verb.
    This does not imply that there must be lexical entries not only for all the verbs in the language but that there must be such an entry for each of the subjects that the verb might have.
    What it does mean is that the subject must be unifiable with any description the verb gives of its subject and thus provides automatically both for any selectional restrictions that a verb might place on its subject but also for agreement in person and number between subject and verb.
    Objects are handled in an analogous manner.
    Thus, the lexical entries for the French verb forms connait and sait might be as follows: Obj = [Cat = NP] Each requires its subject to be third person, singular and animate.
    Taking a rather simplistic view of the difference between these verbs for the sake of the example, this lexicon states that connatt takes noun phrases as objects, whereas sait takes sentences.
  
  
    Consider now the French sentence Jean connatt Marie which is presumably a reasonable rendering of
