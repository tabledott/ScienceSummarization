t is to treat the proposal not as a new coefficient, but rather as a distance metric to be plugged into a weighted coefficient like &#945;.
    Let A and B be two nodes in a hierarchical tagset, let L be the set of all leaf nodes in the tagset, and let P(l|T) be the probability of selecting a leaf node l given an arbitrary node T when the probability mass of T is distributed uniformly to all the nodes dominated by T. We can reinterpret Melamed&#8217;s modification of Equation (4) in Melamed and Resnik (2000) as a metric measuring the distance between nodes A and B.
    This metric has the desirable properties&#8212;it is 0 when tags A and B are identical, 1 when the tags do not overlap, and somewhere in between in all other cases.
    If we use this metric for Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945; we find that observed agreement is exactly the same as in Melamed and Resnik (2000) with the product operator replaced by minimum (Melamed&#8217;s modification).
    We can also use other distance metrics with &#945;.
