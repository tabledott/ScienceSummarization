cases, this criterion is too rigid, as it will consider perfectly acceptable translations as incorrect.
    However, since we use it mainly to compare our results with those obtained from the human translations and the commercial system, this criterion is sufficient.
    The actual accuracy figures might be slightly higher than what we report here.
    In order to evaluate human performance at this task, we compared the translations by the original human translators with the correct translations on the goldstandard.
    The errors made by the original human translators turned out to be numerous, ranging from simple spelling errors (e.g., Custa Rica vs. Costa Rica) to more serious errors such as transliteration errors (e.g., John Keele vs. Jon Kyl) and other translation errors (e.g., Union Reserve Council vs. Federal Reserve Board).
