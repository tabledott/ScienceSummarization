  The agreement maximization process is discussed in depth in Section 5.
  This process is based on the assumption that typically, all instances of a surface form in a document have the same meaning.
  Nonetheless, there are a non-negligible number of cases in which the one sense per discourse assumption (Gale et al., 1992) does not hold.
  To address this problem, we employ an iterative approach, of shrinking the context size used to disambiguate surface forms for which there is no dominating entity disambiguation at document level, perform- ing the disambiguation at the paragraph level and then at the sentence level if necessary.
  The model of storing the information ex- tracted from Wikipedia into two databases.
  3 Information Extraction from Wikipedia We discuss now the extraction of entities and the three main types of disambiguation clues (entity surface forms, category tags, and contexts) used by the implemented system.
  While this information extraction was perform
