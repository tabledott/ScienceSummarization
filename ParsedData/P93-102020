eline for examining the performance of our algorithms, we compare the boundaries produced by the algorithms to boundaries of strength Ti &gt; 4.
    These are the statistically validated boundaries discussed above, i.e., those boundari !t, identified by 4 or more subjects.
    Note that recall for Ti &gt; 4 corresponds to percent agreement for boundaries.
    We also examine the evaluation metrics for each algorithm, cross-classified by the individual levels of boundary strength.
  
  
    Our procedure for encoding the input to the referring expression algorithm takes 4 factors into account, as documented in (Passonneau, 1993a).
    Briefly, we construct a 4-tuple for each referential NP: &lt;FIC, NP, i, I&gt;.
    FIC is clause location, NP is surface form, i is referential identity, and I is a set of inferential relations.
    Clause location is determined by sequentially assigning distinct indices to each functionally independent clause (FIC); an FIC is roughly equivalent to a tensed clause that is neithe
