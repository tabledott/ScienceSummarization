ds such as Resnik&#8217;s, but found them to have all the same problems as directly applying these approaches to the SP task.7 Guided by the fact that we have a relatively small number of topics (600 total, 300 for each argument) we simply chose to label them manually.
    By labeling this small number of topics we can infer class-based preferences for an arbitrary number of relations.
    In particular, we applied a semi-automatic scheme to map topics to WordNet.
    We first applied Resnik&#8217;s approach to automatically shortlist a few candidate WordNet classes for each topic.
    We then manually picked the best class from the shortlist that best represented the 20 top arguments for a topic (similar to Table 1).
    We marked all incoherent topics with a special symbol 0.
    This process took one of the authors about 4 hours to complete.
    To evaluate how well our topic-class associations carry over to unseen relations we used the same random sample of 100 relations from the pseudo-disambiguation exp
