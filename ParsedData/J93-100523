esent purpose, we decided to make an attachment choice in all cases, in some cases relying on controversial theoretical considerations, or relatively unanalyzed intuitions.
    In addition to the problematic cases, 120 of the 1000 triples identified automatically as instances of the verb&#8212;object&#8212;preposition configuration turned out in fact to be other constructions, often as the result of parsing errors.
    Examples of this kind were given above, in the context of our description of the construction of the verb&#8212;noun&#8212; preposition table.
    Some further misidentifications that showed up in the test sample are: identifying the subject of the complement clause of say as its object, as in Example 10, which was identified as (say ministers from), and misparsing two constituents as a single-object noun phrase, as in Example 11, which was identified as (make subject to).
    First, consider how the simple structural attachment preference schemas perform at predicting the outcome in our test s
