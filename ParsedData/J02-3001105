m are still quite preliminary.
    For example, our system currently assumes knowledge of the correct frame type for the target word to determine the semantic roles of its arguments.
    A more complete semantic analysis system would thus require a module for frame disambiguation.
    It is not clear how difficult this problem is and how much it overlaps with the general problem of word-sense disambiguation.
    Much else remains to be done to apply the system described here to the interpretation of general text.
    One technique for dealing with the sparseness of lexical statistics would be the combination of FrameNet data with named-entity systems for recognizing times, dates, and locations, the effort that has gone into recognizing these items, typically used as adjuncts, should complement the FrameNet data, which is more focused on arguments.
    Generalization to predicates for which no annotated data are available may be possible using other lexical resources or automatic clustering of predicates.
