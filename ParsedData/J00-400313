n problem is distinguishing between larger situation and bridging descriptions; see also Fraurud (1990) and Poesio and Vieira (1998).
  
  
    The results just discussed led us to adopt a model of definite descriptions processing advanced in Fraurud (1990) and further elaborated in Poesio and Vieira (1998), according to which interpreting definite descriptions in written discourse is not just a matter of checking whether there is a suitable antecedent for the description, but also involves a classification task: recognizing whether a description is, in Fraurud's terms, first-mention or subsequent-mention&#8212;or, in our terminology, direct anaphora, discourse-new, or bridging.
    The crucial aspect of Fraurucl's proposal is the idea that interpreting definite descriptions is not just a matter of looking for an antecedent; separate rules for recognizing first-mention definite descriptions are needed as well.
    The fact that there was so much disagreement about bridging descriptions and their anchors led u
