although the representation of the task is as simple as the simple events.
    We attribute the reason to the fact that Task 3 is the only task of which the annotation is not bound to textual clue, thus no text-bound annotation was provided.
    Figure 4 shows a scatter plot of the performance of the participating systems during the system development period.
    The performance evaluation comes from the log of the online evaluation system on the development data.
    It shows the best performance and the average performance of the participating systems were trending upwards up until the deadline of final submission, which indicates there is still much potential for improvement.
    Table 8 shows experimental results of a system ensemble using the final submissions.
    For the experiments, the top 3&#8211;10 systems were chosen, and the output of each system treated as a weighted vote8.
    Three weighting schemes were used; &#8220;Equal&#8221; weights each vote equally; &#8220;Averaged&#8221; weights each v
