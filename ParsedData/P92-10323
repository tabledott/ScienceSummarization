ust as part of speech taggers (e.g., Church (1988)) can now input unrestricted text and assign each word with the most likely part of speech with fairly reasonable accuracy and efficiency.
    The availability of massive lexicographic databases offers a promising route to overcoming the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.
    More than thirty years ago, BarHillel (1960) predicted that it would be &amp;quot;futile&amp;quot; to write expert-system-like rules by-hand (as they had been doing at Georgetown at the time) because there would be no way to scale up such rules to cope with unrestricted input.
    Indeed, it is now well-known that expert-systemlike rules can be notoriously difficult to scale up, as Small and Reiger (1982) and many others have observed: &amp;quot;The expert for THROW is currently six pages long.., but it should be 10 times that size.&amp;quot; Bar-Hillel was very early in realizing the scope of the problem; he observed that people have a large set of facts at their disposal, and it is not o
