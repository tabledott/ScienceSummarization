    The success of this approach is dependent on marking missing syntactic constituents as missing semantic roles as that reference resolution can know when to look for referents.
  
  
    This paper describes the SDC PUNDIT, (Prolog UNDerstands Integrated Text), system for processing natural language messages.1 PUNDIT, written in Prolog, is a highly modular system consisting of distinct syntactic, semantic and pragmatics components.
    Each component draws on one or more sets of data, including a lexicon, a broad-coverage grammar of English, semantic verb decompositions, rules mapping between syntactic and semantic constituents, and a domain model.
    This paper discusses the communication between the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic modules that is necessary for making implicit linguistic information explicit.
    The key is letting syntax and semantics recognize missing linguistic entities as implicit entities, so that they can be labelled as such, and reference resolution can be directed to find
