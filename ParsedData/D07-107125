 maps a parse tree y to its associated logical form.
			Initialization: Set parameters w to initial values described in section 6.2.
			Set ? = ?0.
			Algorithm: ? For t = 1 . . .
			T, i = 1 . . .
			n : Step 1: (Check correctness) ? Let y?

			w ? f(xi, y) . ? If L(y?) = zi, go to the next example.
			Step 2: (Lexical generation) ? Set ? = ? ?
			GENLEX(xi, zi) . ? Let y?
			= argmaxy?GEN(xi,zi;?)
			w ? f(xi, y) . ? Define ?i to be the set of lexical entries in y?.
			Set lexicon to ? = ? ?

			w ? f(xi, y) . ? If L(y?) 6= zi : ? Set w = w + f(xi, y?)
			f(xi, y?)
			Output: Lexicon ? together with parameters w. Figure 4: An online learning algorithm.
			updates, which are simpler and cheaper to compute.As in ZC05, the algorithm assumes an initial lex icon ?0 that contains two types of entries.
			First, we compile entries such as Boston := NP : boston for entities such as cities, times and month-names that occur in th
