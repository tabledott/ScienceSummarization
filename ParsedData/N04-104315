s to exhibit a 25% reduction in error over the baseline system (because of limitations in the experimental framework discussed earlier, active learning can provide no additional gain at this operating point).
  
  
    The work presented here extends a substantial body of previous work (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Lin et al., 2003; Boschee et al, 2002; Collins and Singer, 1999; Yarowsky, 1995) that all focuses on reducing annotation requirements through a combination of (a) seed examples, (b) large unannotated corpora, and (c) training example selection.
    Moreover, our work is based largely on existing techniques for word clustering (Brown et al., 1990), discriminative training (Collins 2002), and active learning.
    The synthesis of these techniques, nevertheless, proved highly effective in achieving our primary objective of reducing the need for annotated data.
    Much work remains to be done.
    In an effort to move rapidly toward our primary objective, we investigated only one t
