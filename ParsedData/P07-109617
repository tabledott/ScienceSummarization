e negative samples are exactly those we will face during inference with the current weight vector.
    In our experiments, we have used Averaged Perceptron (Collins, 2002; Freund and Schapire, 1999) and Perceptron with margin (Krauth and M&#180;ezard, 1987) to improve performance.
  
  
    Tsuruoka and Tsujii (2005) proposed a bidirectional POS tagger, in which the order of inference is handled with the easiest-first heuristic.
    Gim&#180;enez and M`arquez (2004) combined the results of a left-toright scan and a right-to-left scan.
    In our model, the order of inference is dynamically incorporated into the training of the local classifier.
    Toutanova et al. (2003) reported a POS tagger based on cyclic dependency network.
    In their work, the order of inference is fixed as from left to right.
    In this approach, large beam width is required to maintain the ambiguous hypotheses.
    In our approach, we can handle tokens that we are most confident about first, so that our system does not need a large
