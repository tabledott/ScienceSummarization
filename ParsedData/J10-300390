whereas the phrase pair (was of profound significance, could have very long-term effects) will be aligned as a possible correspondence.
    Other examples of possible correspondences could include the same stem expressed as different parts-of-speech (such as (significance, significantly)) or two non-synonymous verbs (such as (this is also, this also marks)).
    For more details on the alignment guidelines that were provided to the annotators, we refer the reader to (Callison-Burch, Cohn, and Lapata 2006).
    Extensive experiments are conducted to measure inter-annotator agreements and obtain good agreement values but they are still low enough to confirm that it is difficult for humans to recognize paraphrases even when the task is formulated differently.
    Overall, such a paraphrase corpus with detailed paraphrase annotations is much more informative than a corpus containing binary judgments at the sentence level such as the MSRP corpus.
    As an example, because the corpus contains paraphrase annotation
