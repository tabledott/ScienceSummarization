can more accurately model the errors people make.
    A formal presentation of our model follows.
    Let Part(w) be the set of all possible ways of partitioning string w into adjacent (possibly null) substrings.
    For a particular partition R&#8712;Part(w), where |R|=j (R consists of j contiguous segments), let Ri be the ith segment.
    Under our model, One particular pair of alignments for s and w induces a set of edits that derive s from w. By only considering the best partitioning of s and w, we can simplify this to: We do not yet have a good way to derive P(R  |w), and in running experiments we determined that poorly modeling this distribution gave slightly worse performance than not modeling it at all, so in practice we drop this term.
  
  
    To train the model, we need a training set consisting of {si, wi} string pairs, representing spelling errors si paired with the correct spelling of the word wi.
    We begin by aligning the letters in si with those in wi based on minimizing the edit distance
