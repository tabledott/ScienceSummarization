phrases, we can check how many of them are recovered by our method.
    Table 2 gives the percentage of pairs recovered for each range of average sentence length (ASL) in the group.
    Not surprisingly, we get higher recall with shorter sentences, since long sentences tend to differ in their syntactic structures fairly high up in the parse trees, which leads to fewer mergings at the lexical level.
    The recall on the task of extracting lexical synonyms, as defined by WordNet, is not high.
    But after all, this is not what our algorithm has been designed for.
    It&#8217;s worth noticing that the syntax-based algorithm also picks up many paraphrases that are not identified as synonyms in WordNet.
    Out of 3217 lexical paraphrases that are learned by our system, only 493 (15.3%) are WordNet synonyms, which suggests that paraphrasing is a much richer and looser relation than synonymy.
    However, the WordNetbased recall figures suggest that WordNet can be used as an additional source of information to b
