    The only other application of the EM algorithm to word&#8212;sense disambiguation is described in (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1995).
    There the EM algorithm is used as part of a supervised learning algorithm to distinguish city names from people's names.
    A narrow window of context, one or two words to either side, was found to perform better than wider windows.
    The results presented are preliminary but show an accuracy percentage in the mid-nineties when applied to Dixon, a name found to be quite ambiguous.
    It should be noted that the EM algorithm relates to a large body of work in speech processing.
    The Baum&#8212;Welch forward&#8212;backward algorithm (Baum, 1972) is a specialized form of the EM algorithm that assumes the underlying parametric model is a hidden Markov model.
    The Baum&#8212;Welch forward&#8212; backward algorithm has been used extensively in speech recognition (e.g.
    (Levinson, Rabiner, and Sondhi, 1983), (Kupiec, 1992)), (Jelinek
