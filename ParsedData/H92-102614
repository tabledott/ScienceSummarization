ision tree building algorithm to extract statistical parameters that would improve the Viterbi rate.
  The grammarians task remains that of improving the arty-consistertt ra e. The history-based grammar model is distinguished from the context-free grammar model in that each constituent structure depends not only on the input string, but also the entire history up to that point in the sentence.
  In HBGs, history is interpreted as any element of the out- put structure, or the parse tree, which has already been determined, including previous words, non-terminal cat- egories, constituent structure, and any other linguistic information which is generated as part of the parse struc- ture.
  The  HBG Mode l Unlike P-CFG which assigns a probability to a mnemonic production, the HBG model assigns a probability to a rule template.
  Because of this the HBG formulation al- lows one to handle any grammar formalism that has a derivation process.
  For the HBG model, we have defined about 50 syntactic categories, referred
