ked for eventual violations of this principle.
  In this way many ambigu- ous primary labels may be safely discarded.
  Here is an example sentence, fully analyzed and unambiguous in all respects but the one syntactic ambiguity remaining for the word in: Bill Bill "&lt;Proper&gt; N NOM SG "@SUBJ saw see" &lt;SVO&gt; V PAST" @+FMAINV the the" DET" @DN&gt; little little" A ABS" @AN&gt; dog dog" N NOM SG" @OBJ in in" PREP "@&lt;NOM @ADVL the the" DET" @DN&gt; park park" N NOM SG "@&lt;P 5 There is no non-semantic way of resolving the attachment ambiguity of the adverbial in the park.
  This ambiguity is therefore properly unresolved.
  In CGP, all ambiguities are there after morpho- syntactic mapping and require no additional process- ing load.
  Notice in passing that CGP makes an interesting prediction which might be relevant from the viewpoint of mental language processing.
  Dis- ambiguation, i.e.
  finding a unique interpretation by applying constraints, requires more effort than leav.o ing all or many ambi
