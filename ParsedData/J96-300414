veral reasons why this approach will not in general work: level.
    For example, in Northern dialects (such as Beijing), a full tone (1, 2, 3, or 4) is changed to a neutral tone (0) in the final syllable of many words: *)-A dongl-gual 'winter melon' is often pronounced dongl-gua0.
    The high 1 tone of would not normally neutralize in this fashion if it were functioning as a word on its own.

    TTS systems in general need to do more than simply compute the pronunciations of individual words; they also need to compute intonational phrase boundaries in long utterances and assign relative prominence to words in those utterances.
    It has been shown for English (Wang and Hirschberg 1992; Hirschberg 1993; Sproat 1994, inter alia) that grammatical part of speech provides useful information for these tasks.
    Given that part-of-speech labels are properties of words rather than morphemes, it follows that one cannot do part-of-speech assignment without having access to word-boundary information.
