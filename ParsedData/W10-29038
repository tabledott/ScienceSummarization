on combined with the nature of the inference problem defines the semantic parsing model.
    The key to producing a semantic parser involves defining a model and a learning algorithm to obtain w. In order to exemplify these concepts we consider the Geoquery domain.
    Geoquery contains a query language for a database of U.S. geographical facts.
    Figure 1 illustrates concrete examples of the terminology introduce.
    The input sentences x are natural language queries about U.S. geography.
    The meaning representations z are logical forms which can be executed on the database to obtain a response which we denote with r. The alignment y captures the associations between x and z.
    Building a semantic parser involves defining the model (feature function &#934; and inference problem) and a learning strategy to obtain weights (w) associated with the model.
    We defer discussion of our model until Section 4 and first focus on our learning strategy.
