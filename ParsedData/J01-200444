ample, in Figure 1(a), there is a VP that spans the words &amp;quot;chased the ball&amp;quot;.
    Evaluation is carried out on a hand-parsed test corpus, and the manual parses are treated as correct.
    We will call the manual parse GOLD and the parse that the parser returns TEST.
    Precision is the number of common constituents in GOLD and TEST divided by the number of constituents in TEST.
    Recall is the number of common constituents in GOLD and TEST divided by the number of constituents in GOLD.
    Following standard practice, we will be reporting scores only for non-part-of-speech constituents, which are called labeled recall (LR) and labeled precision (LP).
    Sometimes in figures we will plot their average, and also what can be termed the parse error, which is one minus their average.
    LR and LP are part of the standard set of PARSEVAL measures of parser quality (Black et al. 1991).
    From this set of measures, we will also include the crossing bracket scores: average crossing brackets (CB
