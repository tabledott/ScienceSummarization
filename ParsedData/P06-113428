    However, such searches may veer off course down objective paths.
    The subjectivity labels assigned to senses could be consulted to keep the search traveling along subjective paths.
    Finally, there could be different strategies for exploiting subjectivity annotations and word sense.
    While the current setting considered a pipeline approach, where the output of a subjectivity annotation system was fed to the input of a method for semantic disambiguation, future work could also consider the role of word senses as a possible way of improving subjectivity analysis, or simultaneous annotations of subjectivity and word meanings, as done in the past for other language processing problems.
    Acknowledgments We would like to thank Theresa Wilson for annotating senses, and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
