 language processing tasks, including question answering and the identification of lexical relations (such as meronomy and hyponymy).
    In addition, IE patterns encode the different ways in which a piece of information can be expressed in text.
    For example, &#8220;Acme Inc. fired Jones&#8221;, &#8220;Acme Inc. let Jones go&#8221;, and &#8220;Jones was given notice by his employers, Acme Inc.&#8221; are all ways of expressing the same fact.
    Consequently the generation of extraction patterns is pertinent to paraphrase identification which is central to many language processing problems.
    We begin by describing the general process of pattern induction and an existing approach, based on the distribution of patterns in a corpus (Section 2).
    We then introduce a new algorithm which makes use of WordNet to generalise extraction patterns (Section 3) and describe an implementation (Section 4).
    Two evaluation regimes are described; one based on the identification of relevant documents and another wh
