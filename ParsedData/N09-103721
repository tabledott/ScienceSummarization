mains saw improvements in the range of 3&#8211; 4%, with performance on the VOA data improving by nearly 9%, which is a 45% reduction in error.
    There was no clear trend in terms of precision versus recall, or the different entity types.
    The first place to look for improvements is with the boundaries for named entities.
    Once again looking at all of the data combined, in the baseline model there were 203 entities where part of the entity was found, but one or both boundaries were incorrectly identified.
    The joint model corrected 72 of those entities, while incorrectly identifying the boundaries of 37 entities which had previously been correctly identified.
    In the baseline NER model, there were 243 entities for which the boundaries were correctly identified, but the type of entity was incorrect.
    The joint model corrected 80 of them, while changing the labels of 39 entities which had previously been correctly identified.
    Additionally, 190 entities were found which the baseline model ha
