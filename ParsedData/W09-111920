chieves 71.91 F1 score on the test set (Tjong and De Meulder, 2003).
    It turns out that while problems of coverage and ambiguity prevent straightforward lookup, injection of gazetteer matches as features in machine-learning based approaches is critical for good performance (Cohen, 2004; Kazama and Torisawa, 2007a; Toral and Munoz, 2006; Florian et al., 2003).
    Given these findings, several approaches have been proposed to automatically extract comprehensive gazetteers from the web and from large collections of unlabeled text (Etzioni et al., 2005; Riloff and Jones, 1999) with limited impact on NER.
    Recently, (Toral and Munoz, 2006; Kazama and Torisawa, 2007a) have successfully constructed high quality and high coverage gazetteers from Wikipedia.
    In this work, we use a collection of 14 highprecision, low-recall lists extracted from the web that cover common names, countries, monetary units, temporal expressions, etc.
    While these gazetteers have excellent accuracy, they do not provide sufficie
