    Therefore, we achieve additional parser diversity with the same algorithm, simply by varying the direction of parsing.
    We refer to the two parsers as LR and RL.
    The deterministic parser of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) uses an algorithm similar to Nivre and Scholz&#8217;s, but it makes several successive leftto-right passes over the input instead of keeping a stack.
    To increase parser diversity, we used a version of Yamada and Matsumoto&#8217;s algorithm where the direction of each of the consecutive passes over the input string alternates from left-to-right and right-to-left.
    We refer to this parser as LRRL.
    The large-margin parser described in (McDonald et al., 2005) was used with no alterations.
    Unlike the deterministic parsers above, this parser uses a dynamic programming algorithm (Eisner, 1996) to determine the best tree, so there is no difference between presenting the input from left-to-right or right-to-left.
    Three different weight configurations were considere
