rms takes about 43 minutes with a minimum cutoff of 5, the efficiency/performance trade-off is particularly important from the perspective of implementing a practical extraction system.
  
  
    Even with a minimum cutoff of 30 as a reasonable compromise between speed and accuracy, extracting a thesaurus for 70 terms takes approximately 20 minutes.
    If we want to extract a complete thesaurus for 29,737 terms left after the cutoff has been applied, it would take approximately one full week of processing.
    Given that the size of the training corpus could be much larger (cf.
    Curran and Moens (2002)), which would increase both number of attributes for each term and the total number of terms above the minimum cutoff, this is not nearly fast enough.
    The problem is that the time complexity of thesaurus extraction is not practically scalable to significantly larger corpora.
    Although the minimum cutoff helps by reducing n to a reasonably small value, it does not constrain m in any way.
    In fact,
