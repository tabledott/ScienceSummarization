ss information.
    The t-entities include event triggers (Localization, Binding, etc), protein references (Protein) and references to other entities (Entity).
    A t-entity is represented by a pair, (entitytype, text-span), and assigned an id with the prefix &#8220;T&#8221;, e.g.
    T1&#8211;T3 in Figure 1.
    An event is expressed as an n-tuple of typed t-entities, and has a id with prefix &#8220;E&#8221;, e.g.
    E1.
    An event modification is expressed by a pair, (predicate-negationor-speculation, event-id), and has an id with prefix &#8220;M&#8221;, e.g.
    M1.
    The BioNLP task targets semantically rich event extraction, involving the extraction of several different classes of information.
    To facilitate evaluation on different aspects of the overall task, the task is divided to three sub-tasks addressing event extraction at different levels of specificity.
    Task 1.
    Core event detection detection of typed, text-bound events and assignment of given proteins as their primary arguments.
