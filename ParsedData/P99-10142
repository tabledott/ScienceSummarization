f slots in a subcat frame.
    The induction of labels for slots in a frame is based upon estimation of a probability distribution over tuples consisting of a class label, a selecting head, a grammatical relation, and a filler head.
    The class label is treated as hidden data in the EMframework for statistical estimation.
  
  
    In our clustering approach, classes are derived directly from distributional data&#8212;a sample of pairs of verbs and nouns, gathered by parsing an unannotated corpus and extracting the fillers of grammatical relations.
    Semantic classes corresponding to such pairs are viewed as hidden variables or unobserved data in the context of maximum likelihood estimation from incomplete data via the EM algorithm.
    This approach allows us to work in a mathematically welldefined framework of statistical inference, i.e., standard monotonicity and convergence results for the EM algorithm extend to our method.
    The two main tasks of EM-based clustering are i) the induction of a smooth
