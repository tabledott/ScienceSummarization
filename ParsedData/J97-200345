diction with the infinity of C, and will therefore prove that the algorithm terminates.
    Let w E C, and consider a shortest path 7ro from a state 10 E I to qo labeled with the input string w and with total cost cr(7r0).
    Similarly consider a shortest path in from E Ito gi labeled with the input string w and with total cost cr(n-i).
    By definition of the subset construction we have: (A(i1) + cr(71-1)) &#8212; (A(io) cr(71-0)) = c(qi,w).
    Assume that w I &gt; 112112 &#8212; 1.
    Using the lemma 1, there exists a factorization of 7r0 and iti of the type: Since in and 7T/ are shortest paths, we have: O(7n0) = o-(71-) + 01(Po, u2,po) and 0*(70 = c(lri)&#177;01 (pi, u2, pi).
    Hence: (A(ii)+0(7r)) &#8212; (.\(io)&#177;(7(4)) = c(qi,w).
    By induction on 170, we can therefore find shortest paths Ho and 1-11 from 10 to qo (resp. ii to gi) with length less or equal to l(2112 &#8212;1 and such that (A(ii)+a(111)) &#8212; (A(io)+0-(11o)) = c(ql, w).
    Since c(I11) &#8212; cr(II0) E R(q0, qi), c(qi,w)
