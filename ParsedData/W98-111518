dges which are plausible given their surrounding preterminals; information which is ignored by the exhaustive maximum likelihood parser.
    Alternatively, it may be that because our FOM causes our parser to prefer edges with a high inside times (estimated) outside probability, it is in fact partially mimicking Goodman's (Goodman, 1996) 'Labelled Recall' parsing algorithm, which does not return the highest probability parse but attempts to maximize labelled bracket recall with the test set.
    Finally, it is interesting to note that the minimum number of edges per parse is reached when 77 1.65, which is considerably larger than the theoretical estimate of 1.3 given earlier.
    Notice that one effect of increasing r/ is to raise the FOM for longer constituents.
    It may be that on average a partial parse is completed fastest if larger constituents receive more attention since they are more likely to lead quickly to a complete analysis, which would be one consequence of the larger than expected n. This last
