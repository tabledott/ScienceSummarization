 is preferred over the one in figure 6.
  
  
    There are three basic phases to this algorithm.
    First the proposed anchors are constructed, then they are filtered, and finally, they are classified and ranked.
    The proposed anchors represent all the cospecification relationships available for this utterance.
    Each step is discussed and illustrated in figure 7.
    It would be possible to classify and rank the proposed anchors before filtering them without any other changes to the algorithm.
    In fact, using this strategy This filter doesn't eliminate any of the proposed anchors in this example.
    Even though [A4] and [A5] are contraindexed we have not proposed the same co-specifier due to agreement.
    This filter eliminates proposed anchors ii, iii, iv.
    This filter doesn't eliminate any of the proposed anchors.
    The proposed Cb was realized as a pronoun.
    Anchor i is classified as a retention based on the transition state definition. one could see if the highest ranked proposal pass
