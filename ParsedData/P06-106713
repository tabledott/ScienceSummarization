instance, the outbound distortion component attempts to capture what is typically translated immediately after the word that has just been translated.
    Do we tend to translate words that precede it or succeed it?
    Which word position to translate next?
    Our distortion parameters are directly estimated from word alignments by simple counting over alignment links in the training data.
    Any aligner such as (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999) or (Vogel et al., 1996) can be used to obtain word alignments.
    For the results reported in this paper word alignments were obtained using a maximum-posterior word aligner4 described in (Ge, 2004).
    We will illustrate the components of our model with a partial word alignment.
    Let us assume that our source sentences is (f10, f250 )6, and our target sentence is (e410, e20), and their word alignment is a = ((f10, e410), (f300, e20)).
    Word Alignment a can be rewritten as a1 = 1 and a2 = 3 (i.e., the second target word is aligned to the third source word).
