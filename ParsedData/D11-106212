    As a useful extension, we annotate any possible entailment relation between the two text fragments, including: i) bidirectional entailment (i.e. semantic equivalence between T and H), ii) unidirectional entailment from T to H, and iii) unidirectional entailment from H to T. The resulting pairs can be easily used to generate not only standard RTE datasets9, but also general-purpose collections featuring multi-directional entailment relations.
    We collect large amounts of CLTE pairs carrying out the most difficult part of the process (the creation of entailment-annotated pairs) at a monolingual level.
    Starting from a set of parallel sentences in n languages, (e.g.
    L1, L2, L3), n entailment corpora are created: one monolingual (L1/L1), and n-1 crosslingual (L1/L2, and L1/L3).
    The monolingual corpus is obtained by modifying the sentences only in one language (L1).
    Original and modified sentences are then paired and annotated to form an entailment dataset for L1.
    The CLTE corpora a
