    Regarding WordNet methods, both WN30 and WN30g perform similarly on the similarity subset, but WN30g obtains the best results by far on the relatedness data.
    These results are congruent with our expectations: two words are similar if their synsets are in close places in the WordNet hierarchy, and two words are related if there is a connection between them.
    Most of the relations in WordNet are of hierarchical nature, and although other relations exist, they are far less numerous, thus explaining the good results for both WN30 and WN30g on similarity, but the bad results of WN30 on relatedness.
    The disambiguated glosses help find connections among related concepts, and allow our method to better model relatedness with respect to WN30.
    The low results for MCR16 also deserve some comments.
    Given the fact that MCR16 performed very well on the RG dataset, it comes as a surprise that it performs so poorly for the similarity subset of WordSim353.
