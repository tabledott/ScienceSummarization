n ([5,6,8,11]).
    Since we were working with English rather than Spanish, and did not view a large tag set as a problem, we preferred [6,11] over [5,8] for this work.
    We modified the system in [11] a number of ways, as indicated in Figure 1 and as explained further in [7].
    The MRDA system requires one &#8220;general tag&#8221; per DA, and attaches a variable number of following &#8220;specific tags&#8221;.
    Excluding nonlabelable cases, there are 11 general tags and 39 specific tags.
    There are two disruption forms (%-, %--), two types of indecipherable utterances (x, %) and a non-DA tag to denote rising tone (rt).
    An interface allowed annotators to play regions of speech, modify transcripts, and enter DA and adjacency pair information, as well as other comments.
    Meetings were divided into 10 minute chunks; labeling time averaged about 3 hours per chunk, although this varied considerably depending on the complexity of the dialog.
