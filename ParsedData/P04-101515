 be attached at each attachment site, giving 6 ways of incorporating the next word in the example.
    For illustration, assume that the set B is {(S,NP,VP), (NP,NN,NN), (NP,NN,&#175;S), (S,NP,VP)}.
    Then some of the 6 possible attachments may be disallowed because they create triples that are not in the set B.
    For example, in figure 2 attaching either of the VP chains under the NP is disallowed because the triple (NP,NN,VP) is not in B.
    Similarly, attaching the NN chain under the S will be disallowed if the triple (S,NP,NN) is not in B.
    In contrast, adjoining (NN , can) under the NP creates a single triple, (NP,NN,NN), which is allowed.
    Adjoining either of the VP chains under the S creates two triples, (S,NP,VP) and (NP,NN,&#175;S), which are both in the set B.
    Note that the &#8220;allowable chains&#8221; in our grammar are what Costa et al. (2001) call &#8220;connection paths&#8221; from the partial parse to the next word.
    It can be shown that the method is equivalent to parsing w
