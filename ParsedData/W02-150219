erarchy to predict where conflicts are likely to arise and bring these to the engineer&#8217;s attention, possibly inspired by the approach under development at CSLI for the dynamic maintenance of the LinGO Redwoods treebank (Oepen et al., 2002).
    Finally, while initial development of the matrix has been and will continue to be highly centralized, we hope to provide support for proposed matrix improvements from the user community.
    User feedback will already come in the form of case studies for the library as discussed in Section 5 above, but also potentially in proposals for modification of the matrix drawing on experiences in grammar development.
    In order to provide users with some cross-linguistic context in which to develop and evaluate such proposals themselves, we intend to provide some sample matrix-derived grammars and corresponding testsuites with the matrix.
    A user could thus make a proposed change to the matrix, run the testsuites for several languages using the supplied grammars whic
