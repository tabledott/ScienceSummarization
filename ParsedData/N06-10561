 complete, formal, symbolic, meaning representation (MR) of a sentence.
    Semantic parsing has found its way in practical applications such as natural-language (NL) interfaces to databases (Androutsopoulos et al., 1995) and advice taking (Kuhlmann et al., 2004).
    Figure 1 shows a sample MR written in a meaning-representation language (MRL) called CLANG, which is used for ((bowner our {4}) (do our {6} (pos (left (half our))))) If our player 4 has the ball, then our player 6 should stay in the left side of our half. encoding coach advice given to simulated soccerplaying agents (Kuhlmann et al., 2004).
    Prior research in semantic parsing has mainly focused on relatively simple domains such as ATIS (Air Travel Information Service) (Miller et al., 1996; Papineni et al., 1997; Macherey et al., 2001), in which a typcial MR is only a single semantic frame.
    Learning methods have been devised that can generate MRs with a complex, nested structure (cf.
    Figure 1).
    However, these methods are mostly bas
