 were only children (UNARY-DT) captured this distinction.
    The same external unary annotation was even more effective when applied to adverbs (UNARY-RB), distinguishing, for example, as well from also).
    Beyond these cases, unary tag marking was detrimental.
    The F1 after UNARY-INTERNAL, UNARY-DT, and UNARY-RB was 78.86%.
  
  
    The idea that part-of-speech tags are not fine-grained enough to abstract away from specific-word behaviour is a cornerstone of lexicalization.
    The UNARY-DT annotation, for example, showed that the determiners which occur alone are usefully distinguished from those which occur with other nominal material.
    This marks the DT nodes with a single bit about their immediate external context: whether there are sisters.
    Given the success of parent annotation for nonterminals, it makes sense to parent annotate tags, as well (TAG-PA).
    In fact, as figure 3 shows, exhaustively marking all preterminals with their parent category was the most effective single annotation
