orrespond to those in the training memory.
    For example, consider the training sentence [ NN ] VB [ ADJ NN NN ] ADV PP [ NN ] .
    We may now examine the occurrence in this sentence of several possible tiles: VB [ ADJ NN occurs positively in the sentence, and NN NN ADV also occurs positively, while NN [ NN ADV occurs negatively in the training sentence, since the bracket does not correspond.
    The positive evidence for a tile is measured by its positive count, the number of times the tile (including brackets) occurs in the training memory with corresponding brackets.
    Similarly, the negative evidence for a tile is measured by its negative count, the number of times that the POS sequence of the tile occurs in the training memory with noncorresponding brackets (either brackets in the training where they do not occur in the tile, or vice versa).
    The total count of a tile is its positive count plus its negative count, that is, the total count of the POS sequence of the tile, regardless of bracket pos
