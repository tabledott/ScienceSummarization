 individual sentences.
    Because the discourse structures had been built on top of sentences already associated with syntactic trees from the Penn Treebank, we were able to create a composite corpus which allowed us to perform an empirically driven syntax-discourse relationship study.
    This composite corpus was created by associating each sentence in the discourse corpus with its corresponding Penn Treebank syntactic parse tree and its corresponding sentence-level discourse tree .
    Although human annotators were free to build their discourse structures without enforcing the existence of wellformed discourse sub-trees for each sentence, in about 95% of the cases in the (RST-DT, 2002) corpus, there exists a discourse sub-tree associated with each sentence .
    The remaining 5% of the sentences cannot be used in our approach, as no well-formed discourse tree can be associated with these sentences.
    Therefore, our Training section consists of a set of 5809 triples of the form which are used to train t
