	A Statistical Semantic Parser That Integrates Syntax And Semantics
		We introduce a learning semantic parser,SCISSOR, that maps natural-language sentences to a detailed, formal, meaning representation language.
		It first usesan integrated statistical parser to pro duce a semantically augmented parse tree, in which each non-terminal node has both a syntactic and a semantic label.
		A compositional-semantics procedure is then used to map the augmented parse tree into a final meaning representation.
		We evaluate the system in two domains, a natural-language database interface and an interpreter for coaching instructions in robotic soccer.
		We present experimentalresults demonstrating that SCISSOR produces more accurate semantic representa tions than several previous approaches.
