at is planar but not projective: while there are no crossing edges, the yield of the node 1 (the set 11, 3}) does not form an interval.
    Using the notation linked(i, j) as an abbreviation for the statement &#8216;there is an edge from i to j, or vice versa&#8217;, we formalize planarity as follows: Definition 4 A dependency graph is planar, if it does not contain nodes a, b, c, d such that linked(a, c) A linked(b, d) A a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d .
    Yli-Jyr&#228; (2003) proposes multiplanarity as a generalization of planarity suitable for modelling dependency analyses, and evaluates it experimentally using data from DDT.
    Definition 5 A dependency graph G = (V ; E) is m-planar, if it can be split into m planar graphs such that E = E1U- - -UEm.
    The planar graphs Gi are called planes.
    As an example of a dependency forest that is 2planar but not planar, consider the graph depicted in Figure 2b.
    In this graph, the edges (1, 4) and (3, 5) are crossing.
    Moving either edge to a separate graph par
