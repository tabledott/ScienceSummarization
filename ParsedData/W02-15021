 (Flickinger, 2000), German (M&#168;uller &amp; Kasper, 2000), and Japanese (Siegel, 2000; Siegel &amp; Bender, 2002).
    Despite being couched in the same general framework and in some cases being written in the same formalism and consequently being compatible with the same parsing and generation software, these grammars were developed more or less independently of each other.
    They each represent between 5 and 15 person years of research efforts, and comprise 35&#8211;70,000 lines of code.
    Unfortunately, most of that research is undocumented and the accumulated analyses, best practices for grammar engineering, and tricks of the trade are only available through painstaking inspection of the grammars and/or consultation with their authors.
    This lack of documentation holds across frameworks, with certain notable exceptions, including Alshawi (1992), M&#168;uller (1999), and Butt, King, Ni&#732;no, &amp; Segond (1999).
    Grammars which have been under development for many years tend to be very dif
