ace also enables SIMR to recover chains that were missed because of an inversion in the translation.
    Nonmonotonic TBM segments result in a characteristic map pattern, as a consequence of the injectivity of bitext maps.
    SIMR has no problem with small nonmonotonic segments inside chains.
    However, the expanding rectangle search strategy can miss larger nonmonotonic segments that do not fit inside one chain.
    In Figure 8, the vertical range of segment j corresponds to a vertical gap in SIMR's first-pass map.
    The horizontal range of segment j corresponds to a horizontal gap in SIMR's first-pass map.
    Similarly, any nonmonotonic segment of the TBM will occupy the intersection of a vertical gap and a horizontal gap in the monotonic first-pass map.
    Furthermore, switched segments are usually adjacent and relatively short.
    Therefore, to recover nonmonotonic segments of the TBM, SIMR needs only to search gap intersections that are close to the first-pass map.
    There are usually very few
