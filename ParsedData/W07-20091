 there is no clear choice of inventory for any given task (other than the use of a parallel corpus for a specific language pair for a machine translation application).
			The lexical substitution task follows on fromsome previous ideas (McCarthy, 2002) to examine the capabilities of WSD systems built by re searchers on a task which has potential for NLP applications.
			Finding alternative words that canoccur in given contexts would potentially be useful to many applications such as question answer ing, summarisation, paraphrase acquisition (Daganet al, 2006), text simplification and lexical acquisi tion (McCarthy, 2002).
			Crucially this task does not specify the inventory for use beforehand to avoidbias to one predefined inventory and makes it eas ier for those using automatically acquired resources to enter the arena.
			Indeed, since the systems in SemEval did not know the candidate substitutes for a word before hand, the lexical resource is evaluatedas much as the context based disambiguation com ponent
