&amp;quot;, which is why the NCC &amp;quot;ess&amp;quot; was validated.
    NCCs like &amp;quot;tio&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ough&amp;quot; are built up over multiple iterations, sometimes out of pairs of previously discovered NCCs.
    The other two experiments were carried out on transcripts of Canadian parliamentary debates, known as the Hansards.
    French and English versions of these texts were aligned by sentence using the method of Gale &amp; Church (1991).
    Morphological variants in both languages were stemmed to a canonical form.
    Thirteen million words (in both languages combined) were used for training and another two and a half million were used for testing.
    All translation models were induced using the method of Melamed (1997).
    Six iterations of the NCC discovery algorithm were run in &amp;quot;two-sided&amp;quot; mode, using the objective function /, and five iterations were run using the objective function V. Each iteration took approximately 78 hours on a 167MHz UltraSPARC proce
