ise relations that hold between a mention and its antecedent (Hobbs, 1979; Kehler et al., 2008).
    Our discourse module utilizes this pairwise perspective to define each Zi in terms of an intermediate &#8220;antecedent&#8221; variable Ai.
    Ai either points to a previous antecedent mention position (Ai &lt; i) and &#8220;steals&#8221; its entity assignment or begins a new entity (Ai = i).
    The choice of Ai is parametrized by affinities s7r(i, j; X) between mention positions i and j.
    Formally, this process is described as: For each mention position, i = 1, ... , n, Draw antecedent position Ai E {1, ... , i}: Here, K denotes the number of entities allocated in the first i-1 mention positions.
    This process is an instance of the sequential distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process (DD-CRP) of Blei and Frazier (2009).
    During inference, we variously exploit both the A and Z representations (Section 4).
    For nominal and pronoun mentions, there are several well-studied anaphora cues, includi
