ccurrence of noun compounds in many texts, this suggests that the use of these techniques in probabilistic parsers will result in higher performance in broad coverage natural language processing.

    For instance, parsing noun compounds appears to require detailed world knowledge that is unavailable outside a limited domain (Sparck Jones, 1983).
    Yet, far from being an obscure, endangered species, the n
