retical standing.
    Each entry also includes examples.
    Currently there are frames for about 1600 verbs in the corpus, with a total of 2402 rolesets.
    Since we did not yet have access to a corpus annotated with rolesets, we concentrate in this paper on predicting the role labels for the arguments.
    It is only once we have both that we can interpret the relation between predicate and argument at a very fine level (for example, truck in he kicked the truck withhay as the destination of the loading action).
    We will turn to the problem of assigning rolesets to predicates once the data is available.
    We note though that preliminary investigations have shown that for about 65% of predicates (tokens) in the WSJ, there is only one roleset.
    In a further 7% of predicates (tokens), the set of semantic labels on the arguments of that predicate completely disambiguates the roleset.
  
  
    Gildea and Palmer (2002) show that semantic role labels can be predicted given syntactic features derived from
