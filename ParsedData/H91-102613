  How do we know that house is more associated with chambre than with communes?
  Note that mutual information does not distinguish these two pairs.
  Recall the mutual information I(x;y) is computed by Prob(x,y) l?g2 Prob(x)Prob(y) where Prob(x,y) = a/N, Prob(x) = (a + b)/N, and Prob(y) = (a + c)/N.
  If we plug these numbers into the formulas, we find that house and chambre actually have a lower mutual information value than house and 154 communes: l(house;chambre) = 4.1 while l(house;communes) = 4.2.
  Mutual information picks up t
