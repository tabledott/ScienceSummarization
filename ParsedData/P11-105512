    The vector does not arg maxy,z p(y, z|xi; 0).
    We then compute the feahave a bit for the special none relation; if there is no tures for these assignments and do a simple additive relation between the two entities, all bits are zero. update.
    The final algorithm is detailed in Figure 2.

    To support learning, as described above, we need to compute assignments arg maxz p(z|x, y; &#952;) and arg maxy,z p(y, z|x; &#952;).
    In this section, we describe algorithms for both cases that use the deterministic OR nodes to simplify the required computations.
    Predicting the most likely joint extraction arg maxy,z p(y, z|x; &#952;) can be done efficiently given the structure of our model.
    In particular, we note that the factors &#934;join represent deterministic dependencies between Z and Y, which when satisfied do not affect the probability of the solution.
    It is thus sufficient to independently compute an ass
