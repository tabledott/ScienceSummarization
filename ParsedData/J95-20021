 form, and combines computations for (a) through (d) in a single algorithm.
    Finally, the algorithm has simple extensions for processing partially bracketed inputs, and for finding partial parses and their likelihoods on ungrammatical inputs.
  
  
    We describe an extension of Earley's parser for stochastic context-free grammars that computes the following quantities given a stochastic context-free grammar and an input string: a) probabilities of successive prefixes being generated by the grammar; b) probabilities of substrings being generated by the nonterminals, including the entire string being generated by the grammar; c) most likely (Viterbi) parse of the string; d) posterior expected number of applications of each grammar production, as required for reestimating rule probabilities.
    Probabilities (a) and (b) are computed incrementally in a single left-to-right pass over the input.
    Our algorithm compares favorably to standard bottom-up parsing methods for SCFGs in that it works efficiently o
