 did not mark a sentence boundary and were identified such by very simple preprocessing program.
    The other two errors involved two short sentences for which the SAT did not give an alignment.
    Processing time increased essentially linearly (per pass): the first pass took 8.3 min, the second 3.2 mm, and it further decreased until the last pass, which took 2.1 min.
    (Initialization took 4.2 min.)
    Note that the error rate depends crucially on the kind of &amp;quot;annealing schedule&amp;quot; used: if the thresholds that allow a word pair in the WAT to influence the SAT are lowered too fast, only a few passes are needed, but accuracy deteriorates.
    For example, in an application where the process terminated after only three passes, the accuracy was only in the eighties (estimated on the basis of the first 120 sentences of the English Hansard text checked by hand).
    Since processing time after the first pass is usually already considerably lower, we have found that a high accuracy can safely b
