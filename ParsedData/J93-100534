    AP sample COBUILD approach about as at with corpora) it is advantageous to be able to achieve increased precision in exchange for discarding a proportion of the data.
    From another perspective, our results are less good than what might be demanded.
    The performance of the human judges with access just to the verb-noun-preposition triple is a standard of what is possible based on this information, and the lexical association procedure falls somewhat short of this standard.
    The analysis of underlying relations indicated some particular areas in which the procedure did not do well, and where there is therefore room for improvement.
    In particular, performance on adjuncts was poor.
