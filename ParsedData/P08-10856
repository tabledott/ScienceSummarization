y of supervised stochastic taggers is around 96%&#8211;97% (Manning and Schutze, 1999).
    Merialdo (1994) reports an accuracy of 86.6% for an unsupervised token-based EMestimated HMM, trained on a corpus of about 1M words, over a tagset of 159 tags.
    Elworthy (1994), in contrast, reports accuracy of 75.49%, 80.87%, and 79.12% for unsupervised word-based HMM trained on parts of the LOB corpora, with a tagset of 134 tags.
    With (artificially created) good initial conditions, such as a good approximation of the tag distribution for each word, Elworthy reports an improvement to 94.6%, 92.27%, and 94.51% on the same data sets.
    Merialdo, on the other hand, reports an improvement to 92.6% and 94.4% for the case where 100 and 2,000 sentences of the training corpus are manually tagged.
    Later, Banko and Moore (2004) observed that earlier unsupervised HMM-EM results were artificially high due to use of Optimized Lexicons, in which only frequent-enough analyses of each word were kept.
