l-now, shows the current pertbrmance of the Proteus system.
  The base called Ultiolt con- tains the union of ExDIScO and Manual-Now.
  We find these results very encouraging: Pro- teus performs better with the patterns discov- ered by ExI)IscO than it did after one month of manual tinting and development; in fact, this perfi)rmance is close to current levels, which are the result of substantial additional devel- opmeut.
  These results umst be interpreted, however, with several caveats.
  First, Proteus performance depends on many fimtors besides the event patterns, such as the quality of name re, cognition, syntactic mmlysis, anaphora reso~ lution, inferencing, etc.
  Several of these were improved since the MUC formal evaluation, so some of the gain over the MUC formal evalua- tion score is attritmtable to these factors.
  How~ ever, all of the other scores are comparable in these regards.
  Second, as we noted above, the patterns were reviewed and augmented manu- ally, so the overall procedure is not enti
