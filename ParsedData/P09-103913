set of outgoing arcs.
    The two first conditions can be easily expressed by linear constraints on the incidence vector z: Condition 3 is somewhat harder to express.
    Rather than adding exponentially many constraints, one for each potential cycle (like Riedel and Clarke, 2006), we equivalently replace condition 3 by 30.
    B is connected.
    Note that conditions 1-2-3 are equivalent to 1-230, in the sense that both define the same set Y(x).
    However, as we will see, the latter set of conditions is more convenient.
    Connectedness of graphs can be imposed via flow constraints (by requiring that, for any v &#8712; V \ {0}, there is a directed path in B connecting 0 to v).
    We adapt the single commodity flow formulation for the (undirected) minimum spanning tree problem, due to Magnanti and Wolsey (1994), that requires O(n2) variables and constraints.
    Under this model, the root node must send one unit of flow to every other node.
    By making use of extra variables, 0i , h0aiaEA, to denote the
