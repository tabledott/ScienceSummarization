requencies of the three thematic assignments.
    First, we note that the specification of an Agent of Causation for transitive unergatives (such as race) and unaccusatives (such as melt) indicates a causative construction.
    Causative constructions relate two events, the causing event and the core event described by the intransitive verb; the Agent of Causation is the Agent of the causing event.
    This double event structure can be considered as more complex than the single event that is found in a transitive object-drop verb (such as play) (Stevenson and Merlo 1997b).
    The simplicity test thus indicates that the causative unergatives and unaccusatives are marked in comparison to the transitive object-drop verbs.
    We further observe that the causative transitive of an unergative verb has an Agent thematic role in object position which is subordinated to the Agent of Causation in subject position, yielding an unusual &amp;quot;double agentive&amp;quot; thematic structure.
    This lexical causativiz
