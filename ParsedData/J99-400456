lt with before we can actually begin parsing.
    A semiring parser computes the values of items in the order of the buckets they fall into.
    Thus, before we can begin parsing, we need to know which items fall into which buckets, and the ordering of those buckets.
    There are three approaches to determining the buckets and ordering that we will discuss in this section.
    The first approach is a simple, brute-force enumeration of all items, derivable or not, followed by a topological sort.
    This approach will have suboptimal time and space complexity for some item-based descriptions.
    The second approach is to use an agenda parser in the Boolean semiring to determine the derivable items and their dependencies, and to then perform a topological sort.
    This approach has optimal time complexity, but typically suboptimal space complexity.
    The final approach is to use bucketing code specific to the item-based interpreter.
    This achieves optimal performance for additional programming effort.
