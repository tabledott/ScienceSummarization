 simple and non-recursive noun phrase.
			In many cases, Base NPs represent holistic and non-divisible concepts, and thus accurate translation of them from one language to another is extremely important in applications like machine translation, cross language information retrieval, and foreign language writing assistance.
			In this paper, we propose a new method for Base NP translation, which contains two steps: (1) translation candidate collection, and (2) translation selection.
			In translation candidate collection, for a given Base NP in the source language, we look for its translation candidates in the target language.
			To do so, we use a word-to-word translation dictionary and corpus data in the target language on the web.
			In translation selection, we determine the possible translation(s) from among the candidates.
			We use non-parallel corpus data in the two languages on the web and employ one of the two methods which we have developed.
			In the first method, we view the problem as that of clas
