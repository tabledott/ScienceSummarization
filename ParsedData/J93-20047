  The Brown Corpus assigns a separate tag to pre-qualifiers (quite, rather, such), pre-quantifiers (all, half, many, nary) and both.
  The Penn Treebank, on the other hand, assigns all of these words to a single category PDT (predeterminer).
  Further examples of lexically recoverable categories are the Brown Corpus categories PPL (singular eflexive pronoun) and PPLS (plural reflexive pronoun), which we col- lapse with PRP (personal pronoun), and the Brown Corpus category RN (nominal adverb), which we collapse with RB (adverb).
  Beyond reducing lexically recoverable distinctions, we also eliminated certain POS distinctions that are recoverable with reference to syntactic structure.
  For instance, the Penn Treebank tagset does not distinguish subject pronouns from object pronouns even in cases where the distinction is not recov
