s, a significant step forward from the complement/adjunct distinction recovered in model 2 of the current article.
    Charniak (2001) gives measurements of perplexity for a lexicalized PCFG.
    Gildea (2001) reports on experiments investigating the utility of different features in bigram lexical-dependency models for parsing.
    Miller et al. (2000) develop generative, lexicalized models for information extraction of relations.
    The approach enhances nonterminals in the parse trees to carry semantic labels and develops a probabilistic model that takes these labels into account.
    Collins et al. (1999) describe how the models in the current article were applied to parsing Czech.
    Charniak (2000) describes a parsing model that also uses Markov processes to generate rules.
    The model takes into account much additional context (such as previously generated modifiers, or nonterminals higher in the parse trees) through a maximum-entropy-inspired model.
    The use of additional features gives clear im
