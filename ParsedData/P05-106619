negative particle (i.e., a word tagged as PTKNEG), then the negative particle is moved to directly follow the finite verb.
    As an example, the previous example now has the negative particle nicht moved, to give the following clause structure:
  
  
    This section describes experiments with the reordering approach.
    Our baseline is the phrase-based MT system of (Koehn et al., 2003).
    We trained this system on the Europarl corpus, which consists of 751,088 sentence pairs with 15,256,792 German words and 16,052,269 English words.
    Translation performance is measured on a 2000 sentence test set from a different part of the Europarl corpus, with average sentence length of 28 words.
    We use BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) to measure translation accuracy.
    We applied our reordering method to both the training and test data, and retrained the system on the reordered training data.
    The BLEU score for the new system was 26.8%, an improvement from 25.2% BLEU for the baseline system.
