essage is a probability distribution over values v of V , normalized by a scaling constant n. Alternatively, messages may be left as unnormalized distributions, choosing n =&#65533; 1 only as needed to prevent over- or underflow.
    Messages are initialized to uniform distributions.
    Whenever we wish, we may compute the beliefs at V and F: These beliefs do not truly characterize the expected behavior of Gibbs sampling (&#167;4.1), since the products in (5)&#8211;(6) make conditional independence assumptions that are valid only if the factor graph is acyclic.
    Furthermore, on cyclic (&#8220;loopy&#8221;) graphs, BP might only converge to a local optimum (Weiss and Freedman, 2001), or it might not converge at all.
    Still, BP often leads to good, fast approximations.
  
  
    One iteration of standard BP simply updates all the messages as in equations (3)&#8211;(4): one message per edge of the factor graph.
    Therefore, adding new factors to the model increases the runtime per iteration additively,
