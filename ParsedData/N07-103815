he words in individually trained PRanking models.
  
  
    In this section, we prove that our model is able to perfectly rank a strict superset of the training corpora perfectly rankable by m ranking models individually.
    We first show that if the independent ranking models can individually rank a training set perfectly, then our model can do so as well.
    Next, we show that our model is more expressive by providing a simple illustrative example of a training set which can only be perfectly ranked with the inclusion of an agreement model.
    First we introduce some notation.
    For each training instance (xt, yt), each aspect i &#57747; 1...m, and each rank r &#57747; 1...k, define an auxiliary variable y[i]t r with y[i]t r = &#8722;1 if y[i]t &#57743; r and y[i]t r = 1 if y[i]t &gt; r. In words, y[i]t r indicates whether the true rank y[i]t is to the right or left of a potential rank r. Now suppose that a training set (x1, y1), ..., (xT , yT) is perfectly rankable for each aspect independently.
