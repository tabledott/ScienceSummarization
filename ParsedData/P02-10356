    For estimation purposes using the WSJ treebank, the grammar was modified to parse part of speech tags and labeled bracketing.
    A stripped down version of the WSJ treebank was created that used only those POS tags and labeled brackets relevant for determining grammatical relations.
    The WSJ labeled brackets are given LFG lexical entries which constrain both the c-structure and the f-structure of the parse.
