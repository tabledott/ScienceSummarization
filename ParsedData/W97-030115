ivation */ sentence length, we would expect it to run in linear observed time with respect to sentence length.
    Figure 8 confirms our assumptions about the linear observed running time.
  
  
    The maximum entropy parser was trained on sections 2 through 21 (roughly 40000 sentences) of the Penn Treebank Wall St. Journal corpus, release 2 (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1994), and tested on section 23 (2416 sentences) for comparison with other work.
    All trees were stripped of their semantic tags (e.g., -LOC, -BNF, etc.
    ), coreference information(e.g., *-1), and quotation marks ( &amp;quot; and &amp;quot; ) for both training and testing.
    The PARSEVAL (Black and others, 1991) measures compare a proposed parse P with the corresponding correct treebank parse T as follows: A constituent in P is &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; if there exists a constituent in T of the same label that spans the same words.
    Table 5 shows results using the PARSEVAL measures, as well as results using the slightly
