experimental results for five categories.
    Finally, we discuss our experiences with additional categories and seed word lists, and summarize our results.
  
  
    Our work is based on the observation that category members are often surrounded by other category members in text, for example in conjunctions (lions and tigers and bears), lists (lions, tigers, bears...), appositives (the stallion, a white Arabian), and nominal compounds (Arabian stallion; tuna fish).
    Given a few category members, we wondered whether it would be possible to collect surrounding contexts and use statistics to identify other words that also belong to the category.
    Our approach was motivated by Yarowsky's word sense disambiguation algorithm (Yarowsky, 1992) and the notion of statistical salience, although our system uses somewhat different statistical measures and techniques.
    We begin with a small set of seed words for a category.
    We experimented with different numbers of seed words, but were surprised to find that
