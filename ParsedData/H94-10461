uristic took advantage of prior occurrences of words together in the same sentences, little improvement was observed.
  The semantic concordance is still too small to estimate the potential limits of a co-occurrence h uristic.
  INTRODUCTION It is generally recognized that systems for automatic seine identification should be evaluated against a null hypothesis.
  Gale, Church, and Yarowsky [1] suggest hat the appropriate basis for comparison would be a system that assumes that each word is being used in its most frequently occurring sere.
  They review the litera- ture on how well word-disambiguation programs perform; as a lower bound, they estimate that the most frequent sense of polysemous words would be correct 75% of the time, and they pro- pose that any sense-identification system that does not give the correct sense of polysemous words more than 75% of the time would not be worth serious consideration.
  The value of setting such a lower bound is obvious.
  However, Gale" Church, and Yarowsky [I] do not
