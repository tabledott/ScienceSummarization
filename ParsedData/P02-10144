    Section 4 describes and evaluates the expanded feature set.
    We conclude with related and future work in Section 5.
  
  
    Our baseline coreference system attempts to duplicate both the approach and the knowledge sources employed in Soon et al. (2001).
    More specifically, it employs the standard combination of classification and clustering described above.
    Building an NP coreference classifier.
    We use the C4.5 decision tree induction system (Quinlan, 1993) to train a classifier that, given a description of two NPs in a document, NP&#9986; and NP&#9988; , decides whether or not they are coreferent.
    Each training instance represents the two NPs under consideration and consists of the 12 Soon et al. features, which are described in Table 1.
    Linguistically, the features can be divided into four groups: lexical, grammatical, semantic, and positional.2 The classification associated with a training instance is one of COREFERENT or NOT COREFERENT depending on whether the NPs co-r
