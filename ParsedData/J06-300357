and Littman (2005) inserted a 5-second delay between each two queries.
    Since the WMTS is running locally, there is no need for delays.
    VSM-WMTS processed the questions in only one day.
    The average performance of college-bound senior high school students on verbal SAT questions corresponds to a recall (percent correct) of about 57% (Turney and Littman 2005).
    The SAT I test consists of 78 verbal questions and 60 math questions (there is also an SAT II test, covering specific subjects, such as chemistry).
    Analogy questions are only a subset of the 78 verbal SAT questions.
    If we assume that the difficulty of our 374 analogy questions is comparable to the difficulty of the 78 verbal SAT I questions, then we can estimate that the average college-bound senior would correctly answer about 57% of the 374 analogy questions.
    Of our 374 SAT questions, 190 are from a collection of ten official SAT tests (Claman 2000).
    On this subset of the questions, LRA has a recall of 61.1%, compared to a
