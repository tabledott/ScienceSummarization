n discovery requires no annotation of the input corpus, as opposed to requiring POS tagging or partial or full parsing; (3) we discover general symmetric patterns, as opposed to using a few hard-coded ones such as &#8216;x and y&#8217;; (4) the cliqueset graph algorithm in stage 3 is novel.
    In addition, we demonstrated the relatively language independent nature of our approach by evaluating on very large corpora in two languages3.
    Section 2 surveys previous work.
    Section 3 describes pattern discovery, and Section 4 describes the formation of categories.
    Evaluation is presented in Section 5, and a discussion in Section 6.
  
  
    Much work has been done on lexical acquisition of all sorts.
    The three main distinguishing axes are (1) the type of corpus annotation and other human input used; (2) the type of lexical relationship targeted; and (3) the basic algorithmic approach.
    The two main approaches are pattern-based discovery and clustering of context feature vectors.
    Many of the p
