on, tagging and parsing using our different models and our standard data split are summarized in Table 1.
    In addition we report for each model its performance on goldsegmented input (GS) to indicate the upper bound 11Overt definiteness errors may be seen as a wrong feature rather than as wrong constituent and it is by now an accepted standard to report accuracy with and without such errors. for the grammars&#8217; performance on the parsing task.
    The table makes clear that enriching our grammar improves the syntactic performance as well as morphological disambiguation (segmentation and POS tagging) accuracy.
    This supports our main thesis that decisions taken by single, improved, grammar are beneficial for both tasks.
    When using the segmentation pruning (using HSPELL) for unseen tokens, performance improves for all tasks as well.
    Yet we note that the better grammars without pruning outperform the poorer grammars using this technique, indicating that the syntactic context aids, to some exten
