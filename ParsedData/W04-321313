t which is simple and computationally feasible. thus captures consistent relations between a verb and a class of nouns, regardless of the slot in which the noun occurs.
    Verb classes have been shown to be very important in capturing generalizations across verb behaviour in computational systems (e.g., Palmer, 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001).
    In semantic role labelling using VerbNet, they are particularly relevant since the classes are based on a commonality of role-labelled syntactic frames (Kipper et al., 2000).
    The class of a verb in our model is its VerbNet class that is compatible with the current frame.
    When multiple classes are compatible, we apportion the counts uniformly among them.
    For probability , then, we generalize over all verbs in a class of the target verb, giving us much more extensive data over relevant role assignments to a particular slot.
  
  
    We have described the frame matcher that produces a set of slots with candidate role lists (some unambiguous), and our bac
