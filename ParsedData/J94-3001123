 rule 0:b c:c d:d can be used to illustrate the important issues.
    If this is the only rule in a grammar, then clearly that grammar should allow the string pair (cd, cbd) but disallow the pair (cd, ced), in which e appears instead of b between the surface c and d. It should also disallow the pair (cd, cd), in which c and d are adjacent on both sides and no epenthesis has occurred.
    This is consistent with the intuition that the 0 in the rule stands for the absence of explicit lexical string material, and that therefore the rule must force a surface b when lexical c and d are adjacent.
    In our analysis this interpretation of 0 is expressed by having the Intro relation freely introduce O's between any other symbols, mimicking the fact that c can be regarded as freely appearing everywhere.
    The pair (cd, cbd) is allowed as the composition of pairs (cd, cOd) and (c0d, cbd); the first pair belongs to the Intro relation and the second is sanctioned by the rule.
    But because O's are introduced freely,
