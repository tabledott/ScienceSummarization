olid knowledge of rhetorical structure theory(RST) The analysts were asked to build one RS-tree for each text We took then the RS-trees built by the analysts and used our formalization of RST (Marcu, 1996, Marcu, 1997b) to associate with each node in a tree its salient units The salient units were computed recursively, associating with each leaf in an RS-tree the leaf itself, and to each internal node the salient units of the nucleus or nuclei of the rhetorical relation corresponding to that node We then computed for each textual unit a score, depending on the depth in the tree where it occurred as a salient unit the textual units that were salient units of the top nodes in a tree had a higher score than those that were salient units of the nodes found at the bottom of a tree Essentially, from a rhetorical structure tree, we derived an importance score for each textual unit the importance scores ranged from 0 to n where n was the depth of the RS-treet Table 1 presents the scores that were derived from the RS-
