    The first system trained on the Propbank is by Giidea and Palmer (2002), who reported 82.8% in accuracy on Cold Standard parses when the constituents that are semantic arguments are given, 67.6% and 53.6% (fmeasure) using Cold Standard and automatic parses respectively when the constituents for the arguments have to be first identified.
    Since then, various degrees of improvement have been reported (Giidea and Hockenmaier, 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003; Chen and Rambow, 2003).
    As far as we know the best results so far are reported by (Pradhan et al., 2004), where a wide range of features, including features extracted from named entities, verb clusters and verb senses, temporal cue words, dynamic context, are tested with an SVM classifier.
    Their system achieved an accuracy of 93.0% on known constituents and 89.4% (f-measure) on unknown constituents using Cold Standard parses.
    They did not report results that use automatic parses with this version of the data, but using a previous version
