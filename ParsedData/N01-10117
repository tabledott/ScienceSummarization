g distribution of data.
    For the experiments in this paper, we identified the top 100 ranked bigrams that occur more than 5 times in the training corpus associated with a word.
    There were no cases where rankings produced by G2, X2, and Fisher's exact test disagreed, which is not altogether surprising given that low frequency bigrams were excluded.
    Since all of these statistics produced the same rankings, hereafter we make no distinction among them and simply refer to them generically as the power divergence statistic.
    The Dice Coefficient is a descriptive statistic that provides a measure of association among two words in a corpus.
    It is similar to pointwise Mutual Information, a widely used measure that was first introduced for identifying lexical relationships in (Church and Hanks, 1990).
    Pointwise Mutual Information can be defined as follows: (Dunning, 1993) argues in favor of G2 over X2, especially when dealing with very sparse and skewed where w1 and w2 represent the two words that
