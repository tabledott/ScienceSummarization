  A general-purpose processor-building fimction, taking a priority func- tion and success criterion fnnction as arguments, returns an object that corresponds to the architecture instance.
  The object can be sent initialization items as arbitrary lemmas of the usual form.
  Whenever a successful lemma is constructed (according to the success criterion) it is returned, along with a continuation function that can be called if further sohttions are needed.
  No processing is done after a successflfl lemma has been pro?ed unless further solutions are requested.
  Using this implementation, wehave built instances of the architec- ture for Barley parsing and the other parsing variants described in this paper, including the shift/reduce simulator.
  In addition, a generator was built that is complete for semantically monotonic grammars.
  It is interesting to note that the generator is more than an order of magni- tude faster than our original PATR generator, which worked purely by 617 top-down depth-first backt
