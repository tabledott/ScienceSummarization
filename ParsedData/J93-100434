he UBS French and English texts is more difficult than aligning the English and German, because the French and English Extracting a subcorpus with lower error rate.
    The fact that the score is such a good predictor of performance can be used to extract a large subcorpus that has a much smaller error rate.
    In general, we can trade off the size of the subcorpus and the accuracy by setting a threshold and rejecting alignments with a score above this threshold.
    The horizontal axis shows the size of the subcorpus, and the vertical axis shows the corresponding error rate.
    An error rate of about 2/3% can be obtained by selecting a threshold that would retain approximately 80% of the corpus. versions are separated by two translations, both being translations of the German original.
    In addition, IBM samples only the 1-1 alignments, which are much easier than any other category, as one can see from Table 6.
    Given these differences in testing methodology as well as the differences in the algorithm
