he documents, substituting randomly chosen pairs of words (for instance, banana and kalashmkov) with artificially ambiguous terms (banana/kalashnikov).
    While his results are very interesting, it remains unclear, in our opinion, whether they would be corroborated with real occurrences of ambiguous words.
    There is also other minor weakness in Sanderson's experiments.

    Besides disambiguation. many attempts have been done to exploit WordNet for text retrieval purposes.
    Mainly two aspects have been addressed: the enrichment of queries with semantically-related terms, on one hand, and the comparison of queries and documents via conceptual distance measures, on the other.
    Query expansion with WordNet has shown to be potentially relevant to enhance recall, as it permits matching relevant doc
