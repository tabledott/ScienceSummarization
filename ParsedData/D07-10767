the parse trees using the feature-based methods.
			Zhou et al (2006) further improved the performance by ex ploring the commonality among related classes in a class hierarchy using hierarchical learning strategy.
			As an alternative to the feature-based methods, the kernel-based methods (Haussler, 1999) have been proposed to implicitly explore various features in a high dimensional space by employing a kernel to cal culate the similarity between two objects directly.
			In particular, the kernel-based methods could be very effective at reducing the burden of feature engineer ing for structured objects in NLP researches, e.g. the tree structure in relation extraction.
			Zelenko et al (2003) proposed a kernel between two parse trees, which recursively matches nodes from roots to leaves in a top-down manner.
			For each pair of matched nodes, a subsequence kernel on their child nodes is invoked.
			They achieved quite success on two simple relation extraction tasks.
