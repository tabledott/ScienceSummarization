ncorporation of context-specific knowledge into alignment probabilities.
    A critical reader may pose the question, &#8220;Why invent a new statistical model for this purpose, when existing, proven models are available to train on a given word alignment?&#8221; We will demonstrate experimentally that, for the purposes of refinement, our model achieves better results than a comparable existing alternative.
    We will first present this model in its most general form.
    Next, we describe an alignment algorithm that integrates this model with linguistic constraints in order to produce high quality word alignments.
    We will follow with our experimental results and discussion.
    We will close with a look at how our work relates to other similar systems and a discussion of possible future directions.
  
  
    In this section we describe our probability model.
    To do so, we will first introduce some necessary notation.
    Let E be an English sentence e1, e2, ... , em and let F be a French sentence f1,
