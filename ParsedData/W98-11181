simplest of the common message understanding tasks.
    The objective is to identify and categorize all members of certain categories of &amp;quot;proper names&amp;quot; from a given corpus.
    The specific test bed which will be the subject of this paper is that of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7), in which the task was to identify &amp;quot;names&amp;quot; falling into one of seven categories: person, organization, location, date, time, percentage, and monetary amount.
    This paper describes a new system called &amp;quot;Maximum Entropy Named Entity&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;MENE&amp;quot; (pronounced &amp;quot;meanie&amp;quot;).
    By working within the framework of maximum entropy theory and utilizing a flexible object-based architecture, the system is able to make use of an extraordinarily diverse range of knowledge sources in making its tagging decision.
    These knowledge sources include capitalization features, lexical features, and features indicating the current section of text
