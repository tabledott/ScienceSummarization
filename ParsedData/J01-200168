larger corpus of 500,000 words, 64 suffixes are tested for splitting, and 31 are split, including tions, ists, ians, ened, lines, ents, and ively.
    Note that what it means to say that &amp;quot;suffixes are checked to see if they are spurious amalgams&amp;quot; is that each suffix is checked to see if it is the concatenation of two independently existing suffixes, and then if that is the case, the entire description length of the corpus is recomputed under the alternative analysis; the reanalysis is adopted if and only if the description length decreases.
    The same holds for the other heuristics discussed immediately below.'
    Following this stage, the signatures are studied to determine if there is a consistent pattern in which all suffixes from the signature begin with the same letter or sequence of letters, as in te.ting.ts.'
    Such signatures are evaluated to determine if the description length improves when such a signature is modified to become e.ing.s, etc.
    It is necessary to precede this
