    Since its introduction by Och (2003), minimum error rate training (MERT) has been widely adopted for training statistical machine translation (MT) systems.
    However, MERT is limited in the number of feature weights that it can optimize reliably, with folk estimates of the limit ranging from 15 to 30 features.
    One recent example of this limitation is a series of experiments by Marton and Resnik (2008), in which they added syntactic features to Hiero (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007), which ordinarily uses no linguistically motivated syntactic information.
    Each of their new features rewards or punishes a derivation depending on how similar or dissimilar it is to a syntactic parse of the input sentence.
    They found that in order to obtain the greatest improvement, these features had to be specialized for particular syntactic categories and weighted independently.
