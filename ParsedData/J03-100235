mbine A1 and A2 into one alignment matrix A using the following combination methods: determined.
    The elements of this intersection result from both Viterbi alignments and are therefore very reliable.
    Then, we extend the alignment A iteratively by adding alignments (i, j) occurring only in the alignment A1 or in the alignment A2 if neither fj nor ei has an alignment in A, or if both of the following conditions hold: Obviously, the intersection of the two alignments yields an alignment consisting of only one-to-one alignments with a higher precision and a lower recall than either one separately.
    The union of the two alignments yields a higher recall and a lower precision of the combined alignment than either one separately.
    Whether a higher precision or a higher recall is preferred depends on the final application for which the word alignment is intended.
    In applications such as statistical machine translation (Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999), a higher recall is more important (Och and Ney 2000
