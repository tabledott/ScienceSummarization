 that it is applicable to lexical resources which do not have the hierarchical structure that WordNet does, but do have definitions associated with word senses.
  
  
    We have devised a method that uses raw corpus data to automatically find a predominant sense for nouns in WordNet.
    We use an automatically acquired thesaurus and a WordNet Similarity measure.
    The automatically acquired predominant senses were evaluated against the hand-tagged resources SemCor and the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task giving us a WSD precision of 64% on an all-nouns task.
    This is just 5% lower than results using the first sense in the manually labelled SemCor, and we obtain 67% precision on polysemous nouns that are not in SemCor.
    In many cases the sense ranking provided in SemCor differs to that obtained automatically because we used the BNC to produce our thesaurus.
    Indeed, the merit of our technique is the very possibility of obtaining predominant senses from the data at hand.
    We have demonstrated t
