ing nodes in correct derivations. only correct dependencies; dmax(d) returns the same value but for disjunctive node d. Recursive definitions of these functions are given in Figure 5; the base case occurs when conjunctive nodes have no disjunctive daughters.
    The algorithm identifies all those root nodes heading derivations which produce just the correct dependencies, and traverses the chart top-down marking the nodes in those derivations.
    The insight behind the algorithm is that, for two conjunctive nodes in the same equivalence class, if one node heads a sub-derivation producing more correct dependencies than the other node (and each sub-derivation only produces correct dependencies), then the node with less correct dependencies cannot be part of a correct derivation.
    The conjunctive and disjunctive nodes appearing in correct derivations form a new feature forest, which we call a correct forest.
    The correct forest forms a subset of the complete forest (containing all derivations for the sente
