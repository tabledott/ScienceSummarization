    The above features are all defined on sentence pairs, and are included in the binary classifier and ranking model.
  
  
    In the sequence model, we use additional distortion features, which only look at the difference between the position of the previous and current aligned sentences.
    One set of features bins these distances; another looks at the absolute difference between the expected position (one after the previous aligned sentence) and the actual position.
    Features derived from Wikipedia markup Three features are derived from Wikipedia&#8217;s markup.
    The first is the number of matching links in the sentence pair.
    The links are weighted by their inverse frequency in the document, so a link that appears often does not contribute much to this feature&#8217;s value.
    The image feature fires whenever two sentences are captions of the same image, and the list feature fires when two sentences are both items in a list.
    These last two indicator features fire with a negative value w
