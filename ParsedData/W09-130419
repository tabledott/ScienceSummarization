    An informed baseline system has been created by tagging as hedge cues the tokens with the words listed in (4) above.
    The list has been extracted from the training corpus.
    The results are shown in Table 2.
    The fact that the results are lower for the papers and clinical subcorpora can be explained by the fact that the list of cues has been extracted from the training corpus.
    Table 3 shows the results of the system.
    The results of the system for abstracts and papers are higher than baseline, but for clinical they are lower.
    This is due to the fact that in the baseline system the hedge cue or that accounts for 24.53 % of the hedge cues is 100 % correct, whereas the system achieves only 0.72 % of correct predictions.
    The score obtained by or is also the reason why the system produces lower results for the clinical subcorpus.
    In the abstracts subcorpus the hedge cue that has the biggest proportion of false positives is or.
