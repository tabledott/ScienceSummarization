cope inside or outside probably.
    While the details of modifier placement, which parts of speech can modify which kinds of phrases, etc., differ across languages, we believe that all languages display a distinction between scopal and intersective modification.
    Accordingly, the types necessary for describing these two kinds of modification are included in the matrix.
    The types isect-mod-phrase and scopal-modphrase (shown in Figures 1 and 2) encode the information necessary to build up in a compositional manner the modifier portions of the MRSs in (2) and (3).
    These types are embedded in the type hierarchy of the matrix.
    Through their supertype headmod-phr-simple they inherit information common to many types of phrases, including the basic feature geometry, head feature and non-local feature passing, and semantic compositionality.
    These types also have subtypes in the matrix specifying the two word-order possibilities (pre- or post-head modifiers), giving a total of four subtypes.2 The mo
