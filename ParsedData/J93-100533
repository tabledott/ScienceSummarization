able associations might be confusing.
    Furthermore, our procedure undoubtedly gained advantage from the fact that the test items are drawn from the same body of text as the training corpus.
    Nevertheless, the results of this comparison suggest that for the purpose of this paper, a partially parsed corpus is a better source of information than a dictionary.
    This conclusion should not be overstated, however.
    Table 6 showed that most of the associations in each lexicon are not found in the others.
    Table 8 is a sample of a verb&#8212;preposition association dictionary obtained by merging information from the AP sample and from COBUILD, illustrating both the common ground and the differences between the two lexicons.
    Each source of information provides intuitively important associations that are missing from the other.
  
  
    In our judgment, the results of the lexical association procedure are good enough to make it useful for some purposes, in particular for inclusion in a parser such as
