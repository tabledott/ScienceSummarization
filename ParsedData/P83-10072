re major factors in the generation and interpretation of nonpronominal definite referring expressions.- Local coherence and centering have greater effect on the processing of pronominal expressions.
    In Section 5 we shall describe the rules governing the use of these kinds of expressions and shall explain why additional processing by the hearer (needed for drawing additional inferences) is involved when pronominal expressions are used to refer to globally focused entities or nonpronominal expressions are used to refer to centered entities.
    Many approaches to language interpretation have ignored these differences, depending instead on powerful inference mechanisms to identify the referents of referring expressions.
    Although such approaches may suffice, especially for well-formed texts, they are insufficient in general.
    In particular, such approaches will not work for generation.
    Here the relationships among focusing, coherence, and referring expressions are essential and must be explicitly p
