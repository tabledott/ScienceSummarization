ion mark occurs prehead, it is 17 Throughout this article we use the notation L(w, t)i to refer to the three items that constitute a fully lexicalized left-modifying nonterminal, which are the unlexicalized label Li, its headword wLi, and its part of speech tLi, and similarly for right modifiers.
    We use L(t)i to refer to the two items Li and tLi of a partially lexicalized nonterminal.
    Finally, when we do not wish to distinguish between a left and right modifier, we use M(w, t)i, M(t)i, and Mi. not generated via this mechanism.19 Furthermore, even if there is arbitrary material between the right conjunct and the head, the parameters effectively assume that the left conjunct is always the head-child.
    For example, in Figure 9, the rightmost NP (bushy bushes) is considered to be conjoined to the leftmost NP (short grass), which is the head-child, even though there is an intervening NP (tall trees).
    The new parameters are incorporated into the model by requiring that all modifying nonterminals be g
