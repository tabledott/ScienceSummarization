ftware problems accounted for 20% of the incorrect cases, another 30% were due to semantic errors like misclassification of a noun phrase into person or company, singular/plural etc.
    The remaining errors were due to incorrect noun phrase identification, failure to recognize pleonastic-it or other cases where there is no instance of an antecedent.
    However, 25% of the errors were due directly to the rules of CogNIAC being plain wrong.
  
  
    CogNIAC is both an engineering effort and a different approach to information processing in variable knowledge contexts.
    Each point is addressed in turn.
    A question raised by a reviewer asked whether there was any use for high precision coreference given that it is not resolving as much coreference as other methods.
    In the first experiment, the high precision version of CogNIAC correctly resolved 62% of the pronouns as compared to the resolve all pronouns version which resolved 79% of them--a 27% loss of overall recall.
    The answer to this question
