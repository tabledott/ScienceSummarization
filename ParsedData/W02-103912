 head crossings while the S P and P alignments have 32.16% and 35.47% respectively, with similar relative percentages for modifier crossings.
    Also as before, half to two-thirds of crossings in the S P and P alignments are due to phrasal translations.
    More interestingly, we see that modifier crossings remain significantly less prevalent than head crossings (e.g.
    14.45% vs. 32.16% for the S P case) and that this is true uniformly across all parameter settings.
    This indicates that heads are more intimately involved with their modifiers than modifiers are with each other and therefore are more likely to be involved in semi-phrasal constructions.
  
  
    Since it is clear that crossings are too prevalent to ignore, it is informative to try to understand exactly what constructions give rise to them.
    To that end, we examined by hand all of the head crossings produced using the S alignments with phrasal filtering.
    Table 3 shows the results of this analysis.
    The first thing to note is tha
