ork in markovizing out from the head child, despite the grammar being unlexicalized, because this seems the best way to capture the traditional linguistic insight that phrases are organized around a head (Radford, 1988).
    Both parent annotation (adding context) and RHS markovization (removing it) can be seen as two instances of the same idea.
    In parsing, every node has a vertical history, including the node itself, parent, grandparent, and so on.
    A reasonable assumption is that only the past v vertical ancestors matter to the current expansion.
    Similarly, only the previous h horizontal ancestors matter (we assume that the head child always matters).
    It is a historical accident that the default notion of a treebank PCFG grammar takes v = 1 (only the current node matters vertically) and h = oc (rule right hand sides do not decompose at all).
    On this view, it is unsurprising that increasing v and decreasing h have historically helped.
    As an example, consider the case of v = 1, h = 1.
