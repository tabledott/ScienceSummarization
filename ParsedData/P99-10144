    For further applications of our clustering model see Rooth et al. (1998).
    We seek to derive a joint distribution of verbnoun pairs from a large sample of pairs of verbs v E V and nouns n E N. The key idea is to view v and n as conditioned on a hidden class c e C, where the classes are given no prior interpretation.
    The semantically smoothed probability of a pair (v, n) is defined to be: The joint distribution p(c, v, n) is defined by p(c, v , n) = p(c)p(vic)p(nic).
    Note that by construction, conditioning of v and n on each other is solely made through the classes c. In the framework of the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977), we can formalize clustering as an estimation problem for a latent class (LC) model as follows.
    We are given: (i) a sample space)) of observed, incomplete data, corresponding to pairs from V x N, (ii) a sample space X of unobserved, complete data, corresponding to triples from Cx V x N, (iii) a set X(y) = {x E X I x = (c, y), c E CI of comp
