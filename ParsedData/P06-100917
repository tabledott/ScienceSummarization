 37 sentence trial set and a 447 sentence testing set.
    Unlike the unsupervised entrants in the 2003 task, we require word-aligned training data, and therefore must cannibalise the test set for this purpose.
    We follow Taskar et al. (2005) by using the first 100 test sentences for training and the remaining 347 for testing.
    This means that our results should not be directly compared to those entrants, other than in an approximate manner.
    We used the original 37 sentence trial set for feature used these as our training and test sets, respectively.
    For parameter tuning, we used the 17 sentence trial set from the Romanian-English corpus in the 2003 NAACL task (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).
    For this task we have used the same test data as the competition entrants, and therefore can directly compare our results.
    The word alignments in this corpus were only annotated with sure (S) alignments, and therefore the AER is equivalent to the Fi score.
    In the shared task it was found that mode
