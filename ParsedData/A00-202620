here is no guarantee that the tuning will result in 100% generation accuracy.
    Our approach differs from the corpus-based surface generation approaches of (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) and (Berger et al., 1996).
    (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) maps from semantics to words with a concept ontology, grammar, and lexicon, and ranks the resulting word lattice with corpus-based statistics, whereas NLG2 and NLG3 automatically learn the mapping from semantics to words from a corpus.
    (Berger et al., 1996) describes a statistical machine translation approach that generates text in the target language directly from the source text.
    NLG2 and NLG3 are also statistical learning approaches but generate from an actual semantic representation.
    This comparison suggests that statistical MT systems could also generate text from an &amp;quot;interlingua&amp;quot;, in a way similar to that of knowledgebased translation systems.
    We suspect that our statistical generation approach should perform accurately in doma
