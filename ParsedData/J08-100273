any features on parse results can be incorporated into a model, whereas our method forces feature functions to be defined locally on conjunctive nodes.
    We will discuss the trade-off between the approximation solution and the locality of feature functions in Section 6.3.
    Non-probabilistic statistical classifiers have also been applied to disambiguation in HPSG parsing: voted perceptrons (Baldridge and Osborne 2003) and support vector machines (Toutanova, Markova, and Manning 2004).
    However, the problem of exponential explosion is also inevitable using their methods.
    As described in Section 6.1, an approach similar to ours may be applied, following the study of Taskar et al. (2004).
    A series of studies on parsing with LFG (Johnson et al. 1999; Riezler et al.
    2000, 2002) also proposed a maximum entropy model for probabilistic modeling of LFG parsing.
    However, similarly to the previous studies on HPSG parsing, these groups had no solution to the problem of exponential explosion of unpa
