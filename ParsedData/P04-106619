y of aligning to the null word than rare words, which tend to be content words that do have a translation.
    Finally, we also effectively add extra null words to every sentence in this heuristic model, by multiplying the null word probabilities by a constant, as described in Section 5.
  
  
    We trained and evaluated our various modifications to Model 1 on data from the bilingual word alignment workshop held at HLT-NAACL 2003 (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).
    We used a subset of the Canadian Hansards bilingual corpus supplied for the workshop, comprising 500,000 English-French sentences pairs, including 37 sentence pairs designated as &#8220;trial&#8221; data, and 447 sentence pairs designated as test data.
    The trial and test data had been manually aligned at the word level, noting particular pairs of words either as &#8220;sure&#8221; or &#8220;possible&#8221; alignments, as described by Och and Ney (2003).
    To limit the number of translation probabilities that we had to store, we first computed
