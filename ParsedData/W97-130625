   In these cases it not only fails; it gives no indication that it has failed and offers no help in finding the real antecedent.
    Hobbs then articulates a vision of what the appropriate technology is, which entails inference over an encoding of world knowledge.
    But is world knowledge inherent in resolving all pronouns as Hobbs skepticism seems to convey?
    It has not been clear up to this point whether any anaphora can be resolved with high confidence given that there are clear examples which can only be resolved with sophisticated world knowledge, e.g. the Winograd city council sentences.
    But the results from the first and second experiments demonstrate that it is possible to have respectable recall with very high precision (greater than 90%) for some kinds of pronominal resolution.
    However, good performance does not necessarily falsify Hobbs' skepticism.
    The high precision component of CogNIAC still makes mistakes, 8-9% error for the first experiment--it is harder to evaluate the secon
