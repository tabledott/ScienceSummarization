on of linguistically fine-grained analysis tools and expressive stochastic disambiguation models.
    A second goal of our approach is to apply the standard evaluation methods for parsing to an automatic evaluation of summarization quality for sentence condensation systems.
    Instead of deploying costly and non-reusable human evaluation, or using automatic evaluation methods based on word error rate or n-gram match, summarization quality can be evaluated directly and automatically by matching the reduced f-structures that were produced by the system against manually selected f-structures that were produced by parsing a set of manually created condensations.
    Such an evaluation only requires human labor for the construction and manual structural disambiguation of a reusable gold standard test set.
    Matching against the test set can be done automatically and rapidly, and is repeatable for development purposes and system comparison.
    As shown in an experimental evaluation, a close correspondence can b
