e.
    Rule 1 instructs us to create two children, both labeled A.
    The edge to the first child is labeled / and the edge to the second child is labeled 2.
    The constraint (1 1) = (2 1) indicates that the / child of the / child of x is identical to the 1 child of the 2 child of x.
    We create an unlabeled node to represent this grandchild of x and direct appropriately labeled edges from the children, yielding (b).
    We proceed to expand the newly introduced nodes.
    We choose rule 3 to expand the first A node.
    In this case, a child with edge labeled I already exists, so we use it rather than creating a new one.
    Rule 3 instructs us to label this child a, yielding (c).
    Now we expand the second A node.
    Again we choose rule 3.
    We are instructed to label the 1 child a, but it already has that label, so we do not need to do anything.
    Finally, in (d), the only remaining node is the bottom-most node, labeled a.
    Since its label is a terminal category, it does not need to be expa
