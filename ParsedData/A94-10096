s have the same tags and lexical probabilities, and whenever one of the words is looked up, then the data common to all of them is used.
    Re-estimation on any of the words in a class therefore counts towards re-estimation for all of them'.
    The results of the Xerox experiment appear very encouraging.
    Preparing tagged corpora either by hand is labour-intensive and potentially error-prone, and although a semi-automatic approach can be used (Marcus et al., 1993), it is a good thing to reduce the human involvement as much as possible.
    However, some careful examination of the experiment is needed.
    In the first place, Cutting et a/. do not compare the success rate in their work with that achieved from a hand-tagged training text with no re-estimation.
    Secondly, it is unclear how much the initial biasing contributes the success rate.
    If significant human intervention is needed to provide the biasing, then the advantages of automatic training become rather weaker, especially if such interven
