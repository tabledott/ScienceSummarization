he DSO corpus (191 words).
    Escudero et al. (2000) evaluated k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, Winnow-based, and LazyBoosting algorithms on the DSO corpus.
    The recent work of Pedersen (2001a) and Zavrel et al. (2000) evaluated a variety of learning algorithms on the SENSEVAL1 data set.
    However, all of these research efforts concentrate only on evaluating different learning algorithms, without systematically considering their interaction with knowledge sources.
    Ng and Lee (1996) reported the relative contribution of different knowledge sources, but on only one word &#8220;interest&#8221;.
    Stevenson and Wilks (2001) investigated the interaction of knowledge sources, such as part-of-speech, dictionary definition, subject codes, etc. on WSD.
    However, they do not evaluate their method on a common benchmark data set, and there is no exploration on the interaction of knowledge sources with different learning algorithms.
    Participating systems at SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2 tend to report accur
