n process only graphs with costs lower than five points are worth investigating.
    In fact, there are only a few distinguishing graphs that cost less than this.
    After a number of iterations the algorithm will find the cheapest solution (given this particular, simple definition of the cost function), which is (iii) in Figure 7.
    That this distinguishing graph does not include type information does not necessarily mean that such information should not be realized.
    It means only that type information is, strictly speaking, not necessary to distinguish the intended referent from the distractors.
    We return to this issue in Section 5.2.
    Figure 8 sketches the part of the algorithm that tests for subgraph isomorphism, matchGraphs.
    This function is called each time the distractor set is calculated.
    It tests whether the pair (v,H) can refer to (w, G), or put differently, it checks whether there exists an isomorphism 7r such that H C&#960; G with 7r.v = w. The function matchGraphs first dete
