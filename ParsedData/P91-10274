    One obvious strategy would be to wait for sentences where there is only one candidate verb; unfortunately, it is very difficult to know for certain how many verbs occur in a sentence.
    Finding some of the verbs in a text reliably is hard enough; finding all of them reliably is well beyond the scope of this work.
    Finally, any system applied to real input, no matter how carefully designed, will occasionally make errors in finding the verb and determining its subcategorization frame.
    The more times a given verb appears in the corpus, the more likely it is that one of those occurrences will cause an erroneous judgment.
    For that reason any learning system that gets only positive examples
