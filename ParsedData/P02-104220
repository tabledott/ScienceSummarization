 far as long-range dependencies are concerned, it is similarly hard to give a precise evaluation.
    Note that the scores in Table 2 currently conflate extracted and in-situ arguments, so that the scores for the direct objects, for example, include extracted objects.
    The scores for the relative pronoun categories give a good indication of the performance on extraction cases, although even here it is not possible at present to determine exactly how well the parser is performing at recovering extracted arguments.
    In an attempt to obtain a more thorough analysis, we analysed the performance of the parser on the 24 cases of extracted objects in the goldstandard Section 00 (development set) that were passed down the object relative pronoun category Sdcl&#10015; NPX NPX NPX .10 Of these, 10 (41.7%) were recovered correctly by the parser; 10 were incorrect because the wrong category was assigned to the relative pronoun, 3 were incorrect because the relative pronoun was attached to the wrong noun, and 1 was
