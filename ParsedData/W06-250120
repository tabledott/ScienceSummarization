imental results that the Gloss Vector measure corresponds the most with human judgment of relatedness (with a correlation of almost 0.9).
    We believe this is probably because the Gloss Vector measure most closely imitates the representation of concepts in the human mind.
    (Miller and Charles, 1991) suggest that the cognitive representation of a word is an abstraction derived from its contexts (encountered by the person).
    Their study also suggested the semantic similarity of two words depends on the overlap between their contextual representations.
    The Gloss Vector measure uses the contexts of the words and creates a vector representation of these.
    The overlap between these vector representations is used to compute the semantic similarity of concepts.
    (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) additionally perform singular value decomposition (SVD) on their context vector representation of words and they show that reducing the number of dimensions of the vectors using SVD more accurately simulates learn
