ision list is used to classify new examples by identifying the highest line in the list that matches the given context and returning the indicated 6Problems arise when an observed count is 0.
    Clearly the probability of seeing cOte in the context of poisson is not 0, even though no such collocation was observed in the training data.
    Finding a more accurate probability estimate depends on several factors, including the size of the training sample, nature of the collocation (adjacent bigrams or wider context), our prior expectation about the similarity of contexts, and the amount of noise in the training data.
    Several smoothing methods have been explored here, including those discussed in (Gale et al., 1992).
    In one technique, all observed distributions with the same 0-denominator raw frequency ratio (such as 2/0) are taken collectively, the average agreement rate of these distributions with additional held-out training data is measured, and from this a more realistic estimate of the likelihood r
