S, we conclude that there is no set cover of size &lt; n for S. Figure 4 illustrates the intuitive correspondence between source word selection and minimum set covering.
  
  
    The two proofs point up separate factors in MT decoding complexity.
    One is wordorder selection.
    But even if any word order will do, there is still the problem of picking a concise decoding in the face of overlapping bilingual dictionary entries.
    The former is more closely tied to the source model, and the latter to the channel model, though the complexity arises from the interaction of the two.
    We should note that Model 1 is an intentionally simple translation model, one whose primary purpose in machine translation has been to allow bootstrapping into more complex translation models (e.g., IBM Models 2-5).
    It is easy to show that the intractability results also apply to stronger &amp;quot;fertility/distortion&amp;quot; models; we assign zero probability to fertilities other than 1, and we set up uniform distortio
