single sink node t1.
    Similarly, nodes in G2 whose in-degree is zero are combined into a single source node s2.
    Let N1 and N2 denote the number of arcs in G1 and G2, respectively.
    By construction, NiN2E|.
    Both subgraphs are smaller than G and thus, due to the induction hypothesis, their lower envelopes consist of at most N1 and N2 line segments, respectively.
    We further notice that either envelope is a convex hull whose constituent line segments inscribe a convex polygon, in the following denoted by P1 and P2.
    Now, we combine both subgraphs into a single graph G1by merging the sink node t1 in G1 with the source node s2 in G2.
    The merged node is an articulation point whose removal would disconnect both subgraphs, and hence, all paths in G1that start at the source node s and stop in the sink node t lead through this articulation point.
    The graph G1has at least as many cost minimizing paths as G, although these paths as well as their associated costs might be different from those i
