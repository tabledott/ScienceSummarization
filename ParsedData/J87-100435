ng algorithm, and its application to on-line natural language interfaces has been discussed.
    A pilot on-line parser was first implemented in MacLisp at the Computer Science Department, Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU) as a part of the author's thesis work (Tomita 1985).
    The empirical results in section 5 are based on this parser.
    CMU's machine translation project (Carbonell and Tomita 1986) adopts on-line parsing for multiple languages.
    It can parse unsegmented sentences (with no spaces between words, typical in Japanese).
    To handle unsegmented sentences, its grammar is written in a character-based manner; all terminal symbols in the grammar are characters rather than words.
    Thus, morphological rules, as well as syntactic rules, are written in the augmented context-free grammar.
    The parser takes about 1-3 seconds CPU time per sentence on a Symbolics 3600 with about 800 grammar rules; its response time (real time), however, is less than a second due to on-line parsing.
