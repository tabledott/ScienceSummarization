ther of the corpora.
    If a person is given two parallel texts and asked to match up the sentences in them, it is natural for him to look at the words in the sentences.
    Elaborating this intuitively appealing insight, researchers at Xerox and at ISSCO [Kay, 1991, Catizone et al., 1989] have developed alignment algorithms that pair sentences according to the words that they contain.
    Any such algorithm is necessarily slow and, despite the potential for highly accurate alignment, may be unsuitable for very large collections of text.
    Our algorithm makes no use of the lexical details of the corpora, but deals only with the number of words in each sentence.
    Although we have used it only to align parallel French and English corpora from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament, we expect that our technique would work on other French and English corpora and even on other pairs of languages.
