  For instance, none of the alternative relations 'an investigator of corruption' (the correct one) or 'researcher of corruption' (the incorrect one) was observed in the parsed corpus.
    In this case it is possible to perform the correct selection if we used only statistics about the cooccurrences of 'corruption' with either 'investigator' or 'researcher', without looking for any syntactic relation (as in Church and Hanks (1990) ).
    The use of this statistic is a subject for further research, but our initial data suggests that it can substantially increase the applicability of the statistical method with just a little decrease in its precision.
    Another way to deal with the lack of statistical data for the specific words in question is to use statistics about similar words.
    This is the basis for Sadler's Analogical Semantics (1989) which has not yet proved effective.
    His results may be improved if more sophisticated techniques and larger corpora are used to establish similarity between words (
