    The object preference of 'drink' is for a drink, i.e., a potable liquid.
    It seems that it is metaphorical for cars to &amp;quot;drink&amp;quot; a liquid commonly used up by cars, e.g., gasoline, but anomalous if the liquid has nothing to do with cars, e.g., coffee, as in (27).
    The problem of understanding the differences between sentences (20) and (27) requires some further observations about the nature of semantic relations, principally that the differences are caused by the combinations of semantic relations found in the sentences and the relationships between those relations.
    Below is a suggestion as to how deeper semantic processing might discriminate the differences between the two sentences.
    Before getting to the deeper processing, we need a better semantic vector notation.
