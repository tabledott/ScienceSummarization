ocal to the enhanced node; and (ii) a unique preterminal/terminal pair identified as the head of the node.
    These practices have correlates in contemporary linguistic theory as principles of locality and lex3An algorithm to determine the head daughter of every non-terminal node is necessary for the dependency model and for grammar markovization (Collins, 1999), and since the CTB and ETB have different grammars, we did write a simple headfinder for the CTB grammar.
    4For unknown words we estimated P(wordltag) based on the first character of the word. foreign investment icalism (Sag and Wasow, 1999).
    For headship, the choices of node enhancement strategy are fairly limited; for enrichment by local context, there are far more choices.
    Of the simplest local-context enrichment strategies, the one that has proven effective on a systematic basis involves parent annotation; (Johnson, 1998) showed that when uniformly applied, it considerably improved WSJ Treebank parsing.
