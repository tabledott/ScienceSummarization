n almost all cases, the words with both S and O senses show improvement, while the others show small degradation or no change.
    This suggests that if a subjectivity label is available for the words in a lexical resource (e.g. using Algorithm 1 from Section 4), such information can be used to decide on using a subjectivity-aware system, thereby improving disambiguation accuracy.
    One of the exceptions is disc, which had a small benefit, despite not having any subjective senses.
    As it happens, the first sense of disc is phonograph record. phonograph record, phonograph recording, record, disk, disc, platter &#8211; (sound recording consisting of a disc with continuous grooves; formerly used to reproduce music by rotating while a phonograph needle tracked in the grooves) The improvement can be explained by observing that many of the training and test sentences containing this sense are labeled subjective by the classifier, and indeed this sense frequently occurs in subjective sentences such as &#8220;Th
