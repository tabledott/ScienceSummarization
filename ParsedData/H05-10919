nt paths, with each path replicated into three similar paths due to coordination.
			Our current approach considers only one of the shortest paths, nevertheless it seems reasonable to investigate usingall of them as multiple sources of evidence for rela tion extraction.
			There may be cases where e1 and e2 belongto predicate-argument structures that have no argument in common.
			However, because the dependency graph is always connected, we are guaranteed to find a shortest path between the two enti ties.
			In general, we shall find a shortest sequence of predicate-argument structures with target predicates P1, P2, ..., Pn such that e1 is an argument of P1, e2 isan argument of Pn, and any two consecutive predi cates Pi and Pi+1 share a common argument (whereby ?argument?
			we mean both arguments and com plements).
	
	
			The shortest path between two entities in a depen dency graph offers a very condensed representationof the information needed to assess their relationship.
