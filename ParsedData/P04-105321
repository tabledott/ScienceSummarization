ext in this way will have to be carefully evaluated.
    It is future work to determine the best context word length.
    We tried single linkage and average linkage as well as complete linkage for making clusters.
    Complete linkage was the best clustering method because it yielded the highest F-measure.
    Furthermore, for the other two clustering methods, the threshold of cosine similarity producing the best F-measure was different in the two domains.
    In contrast, for complete linkage the optimal threshold was almost the same in the two domains.
    The best threshold of cosine similarity in complete linkage was determined to be just above 0; when this threshold reaches 0, the F-measure drops suddenly because the pairs need not share any words.
    A threshold just above 0 means that each combination of NE pairs in the same cluster shares at least one word in common &#8212; and most of these common words were pertinent to the relations.
    We consider that this is relevant to context word length.
