    1998), measuring textual cohesion (Morris and Hirst 1991), and word sense disambiguation (Lesk 1986).
    On the other hand, since measures of relational similarity are not as well developed as measures of attributional similarity, the potential applications of relational similarity are not as well known.
    Many problems that involve semantic relations would benefit from an algorithm for measuring relational similarity.
    We discuss related problems in natural language processing, information retrieval, and information extraction in more detail in Section 3.
    This article builds on the Vector Space Model (VSM) of information retrieval.
    Given a query, a search engine produces a ranked list of documents.
    The documents are ranked in order of decreasing attributional similarity between the query and each document.
    Almost all modern search engines measure attributional similarity using the VSM (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto 1999).
    Turney and Littman (2005) adapt the VSM approach to m
