rall text coherence measure can be easily obtained by averaging the cosines for all pairs of adjacent sentences Si and Si+1: This model is a good point of comparison for several reasons: (a) it is fully automatic and has relatively few parameters (i.e., the dimensionality of the space and the choice of similarity function), (b) it correlates reliably with human judgments and has been used to analyze discourse structure, and (c) it models an aspect of local coherence which is orthogonal to ours.
    The LSA model is lexicalized: coherence amounts to quantifying the degree of semantic similarity between sentences.
    In contrast, our model does not incorporate any notion of similarity: coherence is encoded in terms of transition sequences that are document-specific rather than sentence-specific.
    Our implementation of the LSA model followed closely Foltz, Kintsch, and Landauer (1998).
    We constructed vector-based representations for individual words from a lemmatized version of the North American News Co
