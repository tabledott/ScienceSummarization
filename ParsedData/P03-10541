t, in the absence of further annotation, more vertical annotation is better &#8211; even exhaustive grandparent annotation.
    This is not true for horizontal markovization, where the variableorder second-order model was superior.
    The best has an 79.74, already a substantial improvement over the baseline.
    In the remaining sections, we discuss other annotations which increasingly split the symbol space.
    Since we expressly do not smooth the grammar, not all splits are guaranteed to be beneficial, and not all sets of useful splits are guaranteed to co-exist well. particular, while markovization is good on its own, it has a large number of states and does not tolerate further splitting well.
    Therefore, base all further exploration on the ROOT S&amp;quot;ROOT 4: An error which can be resolved with the (incorrect baseline parse shown). grammar.
    Although it does not necessarily jump out of the grid at first glance, this point represents the best compromise between a compact grammar and useful ma
