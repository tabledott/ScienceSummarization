    Each of these probabilities in turn affects multiple arcs in the composed FST of Fig.

    We offer a theorem that highlights the broad applicability of these modeling techniques.4 If f(input, output) is a weighted regular relation, then the following statements are equivalent: (1) f is a joint probabilistic relation; (2) f can be computed by a Markovian FST that halts with probability 1; (3) f can be expressed as a probabilistic regexp, i.e., a regexp built up from atomic expressions a : b (for a E E U {E}, b E A U {E}) using concatenation, probabilistic union +p, and probabilistic closure *p. For defining conditional relations, a good regexp language is unknown to us, but they can be defined in several other ways: (1) via FSTs as in Fig.
    1c, (2) by compilation of weighted rewrite rules (Mohri and Sproat, 1996), (3) by
