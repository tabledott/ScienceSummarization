significantly worse.
    It is important to note that the length of documents matters.
    As noted before, many of the documents in the EuroParl collection consist of short, formulaic sentences.
    Restricting the query/target pairs to only those with query and target documents that are both longer than 50 words results in significant improvement and reduced variance: the average proportion of query documents for which the true translation is ranked highest goes from 53.9% to 72.7%.
    Performance continues to improve with longer documents, most likely due to better topic inference.
    Results vary by language.
    Table 5 shows results for all target languages with English as a query language.
    Again, English generally performs better with Romance languages than Germanic languages.
  
  
    Directly parallel translations are rare in many languages and can be extremely expensive to produce.
    However, the growth of the web, and in particular Wikipedia, has made comparable text corpora &#8211; docume
