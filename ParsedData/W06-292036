rd column shows how the ranking for each participant changes (or not: &#8216;=&#8217;) if the unlabeled attachment scores, as shown in the fourth column, are used.
    The fifth column shows how the ranking changes (in comparison to LAS) if the label accuracies, as shown in the sixth column, are used. aIn Bick&#8217;s method, preference is given to the assignment of dependency labels. bSchiehlen derived the constituent labels for his PCFG approach from the DEPREL values. cDue to the bug (see footnote with Table 5). can be seen in Table 1, there are very few new FORM values in the test data, which is an indication of many dialogues in the treebank being similar.
    In addition, parsing units are short on average.
    Finally, the set of DEPREL values is very small and consequently the ratio between (C)POSTAG and DEPREL values is extremely favorable.
    It would be interesting to apply the shared task parsers to the Kyoto University Corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997), which is the standard treebank for Japane
