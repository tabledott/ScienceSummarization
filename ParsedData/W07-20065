words (e.g. WordNet senses of procedural were mapped to ODE senses of procedure, etc.).
			When this mapping was not straightforward, we just adopted the WordNet sense inventory for that word.We released the entire sense groupings (those in duced from the manual mapping for words in the test set plus those automatically derived on the other words) and made them available to the participants.
			2.3 Sense Annotation.
			All open-class words (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) with an existing sense in the WordNetinventory were manually annotated by the third author.
			Multi-word expressions were explicitly iden tified in the test set and annotated as such (this wasmade to allow a fair comparison among systems independent of their ability to identify multi-word ex pressions).
			We excluded auxiliary verbs, uncovered phrasal and idiomatic verbs, exclamatory uses, etc. The annotator was allowed to tag words with multiple coarse senses, but was asked to make a single sense assignment whenever possible.
