iated subsertion-insertion constraint (SIC).
    A SIC is a finite set of elementary node addresses (ENAs).
    An ENA n specifies some elementary d-tree a E D, a component of a and the address of a node within that component of a.
    If a ENA q is in the SIC associated with a d-edge between qi and q2 in an elementary d-tree a then n cannot appear properly within the path that appears from i to 712 in the derived tree 7 E T(G).
    Each node of elementary d-trees has an associated sister-adjunction constraint (SAC).
    A SAC is a finite set of pairs, each pair identifying a direction (left or right) and an elementary d-tree.
    A SAC gives a complete specification of what can be sisteradjoined at a node.
    If a node ti is associated with a SAC containing a pair (d, a) then the d-tree a can be d-sister-adjoined at q.
    By definition of sisteradjunction, all substitution nodes and all nodes at the top of d-edges can be assumed to have SACs that are the empty-set.
    This prevents sister-adjunction at th
