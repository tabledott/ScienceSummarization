 ever, using binary rules for inference is not enough.
			First, a predicate that can have multiple arguments may still occur with only one of its arguments.For example, in ?The acquisition of TCA was successful?, ?TCA?
			is the only argument of ?acqui sition?.
			Second, some predicate expressions are unary by nature.
			For example, modifiers, such as ?the elected X?, or intransitive verbs.
			In addition, it appears more tractable to learn all variations for each argument of a predicate separately than to learn them for combinations of argument pairs.For these reasons, it seems that unary rule learn ing should be addressed in addition to binary rule learning.
			We are further motivated by the fact thatsome (mostly supervised) works in IE found learn ing unary templates useful for recognizing relevant named entities (Riloff, 1996; Sudo et al, 2003; Shinyama and Sekine, 2006), though they did notattempt to learn generic knowledge bases of entail ment rules.This paper investigates acquisition of unary entai
