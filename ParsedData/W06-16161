lso made in the case of McDonald et al.&#8217;s (2005b) non-projective dependency parsing model.
    Here attachment decisions are made independently of one another'.
    However, often such assumptions can not be justified.
    For example in dependency parsing, if a subject has already been identified for a given verb, then the probability of attaching a second subject to the verb is zero.
    Similarly, if we find that one coordination argument is a noun, then the other argu'If we ignore the constraint that dependency trees must be cycle-free (see sections 2 and 3 for details). ment cannot be a verb.
    Thus decisions are often co-dependent.
    Integer Linear Programming (ILP) has recently been applied to inference in sequential conditional random fields (Roth and Yih, 2004), this has allowed the use of truly global constraints during inference.
    However, it is not possible to use this approach directly for a complex task like non-projective dependency parsing due to the exponential number of constrai
