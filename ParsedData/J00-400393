osals in the literature is that we paid considerably more attention to the problem of identifying discourse-new definite descriptions.'
    Previous work on computational methods for definite description resolution can be divided in two camps: proposals that rely on commonsense reasoning (and are therefore either mainly theoretical or domain dependent), and systems that can be quantitatively evaluated, such as those competing on the coreference task in the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conference (Sundheim 1995).
    We discuss these two types of work in turn.
    The crucial characteristic of these proposals is that they exploit hand-coded commonsense knowledge, and cannot therefore be tested on just any arbitrary text.
    Some of them are simply tested on texts that were especially built for the purpose of testing the system (Carter 1987; Carbonell and Brown 1988); systems like the Core Language Engine are more robust, but they have to be applied to a domain restricted enough that all relevant kn
