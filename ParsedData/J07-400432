sing CCG is that the recovery of long-range dependencies can be integrated into the parsing process in a straightforward manner, rather than be relegated to such a post-processing phase (Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman 2002; Hockenmaier 2003a; Clark, Steedman, and Curran 2004).
    Another advantage of CCG is that providing a compositional semantics for the grammar is relatively straightforward.
    It has a completely transparent interface between syntax and semantics and, because CCG is a lexicalized grammar formalism, providing a compositional semantics simply involves adding semantic representations to the lexical entries and interpreting the small number of combinatory rules.
    Bos et al. (2004) show how this can be done for the grammar and parser described in this article.
    Of course some of these advantages could be obtained with other grammar formalisms, such as TAG, LFG, and HPSG, although CCG is especially well-suited to analysing coordination and long-range dependencies.
    For example, the
