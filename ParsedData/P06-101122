parallel sentence pairs.
    The work of Deng et. al (2006) also deals with sub-sentential fragments.
    However, they obtain parallel fragments from parallel sentence pairs (by chunking them and aligning the chunks appropriately), while we obtain them from comparable or non-parallel sentence pairs.
    Since our approach can extract parallel data from texts which contain few or no parallel sentences, it greatly expands the range of corpora which can be usefully exploited.
  
  
    We have presented a simple and effective method for extracting sub-sentential fragments from comparable corpora.
    We also presented a method for computing a probabilistic lexicon based on the LLR statistic, which produces a higher quality lexicon.
    We showed that using this lexicon helps improve the precision of our extraction method.
    Our approach can be improved in several aspects.
    The signal filtering function is very simple; more advanced filters might work better, and eliminate the need of applying additional he
