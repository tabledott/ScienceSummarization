purpose of extraction.
    A closely related model to ours is that of Mei et al. (2007) which performs joint topic and sentiment modeling of collections.
    Our model differs from theirs in many respects: Mei et al. only model sentiment predictions for the entire document and not on the aspect level; They treat sentiment predictions as unobserved variables, whereas we treat them as observed signals that help to guide the creation of topics; They model co-occurrences solely on the document level, whereas our model is based on MG-LDA and models both local and global contexts.
    Recently, Blei and McAuliffe (2008) proposed an approach for joint sentiment and topic modeling that can be viewed as a supervised LDA (sLDA) model that tries to infer topics appropriate for use in a given classification or regression problem.
    MAS and sLDA are similar in that both use sentiment predictions as an observed signal that is predicted by the model.
    However, Blei et al. do not consider multiaspect ranking or look at
