e proof of this claim becomes immediate.
			Any TAG in which all foot nodes are im- mediate children of their associated root generates a tree path language that is regular.
			~Thus, a synchronous TAG (like the grammar presented in Figure 1) whose semantic component forms a TAG with this property necessarily obeys the regular language constraint on long-distance semantic dependencies.
	
	
			To exemplify the formalism's utility, we briefly and in- formally describe its application to the semantics of id- ioms and quantifiers.
			A companion paper (Abeill6 et al, 1990) uses a mapping between two TAGs for automatic translation between natural anguages, and constitutes a further application of the synchronous TAG concept.
			5This is a folk theorem whose straighlforward proof is left as an exercise for the reader, 3 255 More expansive descriptions of these analyses will be forthcoming in joint work with Anne Abeilld (idioms and translation) and Anthony Kroch (quantifiers).
