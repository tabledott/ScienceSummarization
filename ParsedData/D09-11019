evel feature, which has the value TRUE if X is true between the active mention and any mention in the preceding cluster under consideration.
    Contrary to common wisdom, this entity-mention model underperforms its mention-pair counterpart in spite of the generalization from mention-pair to cluster-level features.
    In Yang et al.&#8217;s (2004) entity-mention model, a training instance is composed of an active mention mk, a preceding cluster C, and a mention mj in C that is closest in distance to mk in the associated text.
    The feature set used to represent the instance is primarily composed of features that describe the relationship between mj and mk, as well as a few cluster-level features.
    In other words, the model still relies heavily on features used in a mention-pair model.
    In particular, the inclusion of mj in the feature vector representation to some extent reflects the authors&#8217; lack of confidence that a strong entity-mention model can be trained without mention-pair-based feature
