mpetitive evaluation and more closely-matched systems.
  
  
    We used the results of the manual evaluation to analyze the translation quality of the different systems that were submitted to the workshop.
    In our analysis, we aimed to address the following questions: Tables 8&#8211;10 show the system ranking for each of the translation tasks.
    For each language pair, we define a system as &#8216;winning&#8217; if no other system was found statistically significantly better (using the Sign Test, at p G 0.10).
    In some cases, multiple systems are listed as winners, either due to a large number of participants or a low number of judgments per system pair, both of which are factors that make it difficult to achieve statistical significance.
    We start by examining the results for the individual system track for the European languages (Table 8).
    In SpanishHEnglish and GermanHEnglish, unconstrained systems are observed to perform better than constrained systems.
    In other language pairs, particu
