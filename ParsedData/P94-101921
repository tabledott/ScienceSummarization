 correct rate 57.8% before encoding the meaning of the unknown verb arguments; and a correct rate 99.45% after giving the unknown English words conceptual meanings in the system's conceptual hierarchy.
    The second test set contains 116 sentences including sentences with non-concrete objects, metaphors, etc.
    The lexical selection of the system got a correct rate of 31% before encoding the unknown verb arguments, a 75% correct rate after adding meanings and a 88.8% correct rate after extended selection process applied.
    The extended selection process relaxes the constraints and attempts to find out the best possible target verb with the similarity measure.
    From these tests, we can see the benefit of defining the verbs on several cognitive domains.
    The conceptual hierarchical structure provides a way of measuring the similarities among different verb senses; with relaxation, metaphorical processing becomes possible.
    The correct rate is improved by 13.8% by using this extended selection proc
