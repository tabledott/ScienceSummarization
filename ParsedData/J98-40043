ic PCFG model (Charniak 1997), it seems reasonable to first attempt to better understand the properties of PCFG models themselves.
    It is well known that natural language exhibits dependencies that context-free grammars (CFGs) cannot describe (Culy 1985; Shieber 1985).
    But the statistical independence assumptions embodied in a particular PCFG description of a particular natural language construction are in general much stronger than the requirement that the construction be generated by a CFG.
    We show below that the PCFG extension of what seems to be an adequate CFG description of PP attachment constructions performs no better than PCFG models estimated from non-CFG accounts of the same constructions.
    More specifically, this paper studies the effect of varying the tree structure representation of PP modification from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view.
    It compares PCFG models induced from treebanks using several different tree representations, including the representation used
