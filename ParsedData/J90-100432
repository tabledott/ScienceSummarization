    Furthermore, for each such category whose semantics can be the scope of a quantifier, there will be an optional nonchain rule to take the top element of an ordered store and apply it to the semantics of the category.
    For example, here is the rule for sentences: s(Form, GO-G, Store)/quant(Q,X,R,S) ---&gt; (8) s(Form, GO-G, [qterm(Q,X,R)IStore])/S.
    The term quant(Q,X,R,S) represents a quantified formula with quantifier Q, bound variable X, restriction R, and scope S; qterm(Q,X,R) is the corresponding store element.
    In addition, some mechanism is needed to combine the stores of the immediate constituents of a phrase into a store for the phrase.
    For example, the combination of subject and complement stores for a verb into a clause store is done in one of our test grammars by lexical rules such as vp(finite, [np(_, S0)/0, np(3-sing, SS)/S], SC)/gen(S,O) --&gt; (9) [generates], (shuffle(SS, SO, SC)]. which states that the store SC of a clause with main verb &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; a
