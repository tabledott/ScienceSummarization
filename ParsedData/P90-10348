, gives us a reasonable ranking of terms, with it near the bottom.
    For any two nouns in the sample, we can ask what verb contexts they share.
    The distributional hypothesis is that nouns are similar to the extent that they share contexts.
    For example, Table 3 shows all the verbs which wine and beer can be objects of, highlighting the three verbs they have in common.
    The verb drink is the key common factor.
    There are of course many other objects that can be sold, but most of them are less alike than wine or beer because they can't also be drunk.
    So for example, a car is an object that you can have and sell, like wine and beer, but you do not &#8212; in this sample (confirming what we know from the meanings of the words) -typically drink a car.
  
  
    We propose the following metric of similarity, based on the mutual information of verbs and arguments.
    Each noun has a set of verbs that it occurs with (either as subject or object), and for each such relationship, there is a mutual i
