on schemes used.
    Comparison with Penn Treebank parsers would be difficult because, for many constructions, the Penn Treebank trees and CCG derivations are different shapes, and reversing the mapping Hockenmaier used to create CCGbank would be very difficult.
    Hence we challenge other parser developers to map their own parse output into the version of DepBank used here.
    One aspect of parser evaluation not covered in this paper is efficiency.
    The CCG parser took only 22.6 seconds to parse the 560 sentences in DepBank, with the accuracy given earlier.
    Using a cluster of 18 machines we have also parsed the entire Gigaword corpus in less than five days.
    Hence, we conclude that accurate, large-scale, linguistically-motivated NLP is now practical with CCG.
  
  
    We would like to thanks the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.
