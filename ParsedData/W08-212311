  CONTROLLERHASOBJ.
  Binary feature that is true if the link between the predicate verb chain and its parent is OPRD, and the parent has an object.
  This feature is meant to resolve control ambiguity as in Figure 2.
  The grammatical function of the ar- gument node.
  For direct dependents of the predicate, this is identical to the RELPATH.

  3.2 Linguistically Motivated Global Constraints The following three global constraints were used to filter the candidates generated by the pipeline.
  CORE ARGUMENT CONSISTENCY.
  Core argu- ment labels must not appear more than once.
  DISCONTINUITY CONSISTENCY.
  If there is a la- bel C-X, it must be preceded by a
