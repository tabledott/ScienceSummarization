ree&#8212;appears in the best model with more than four features.
    Also unexpectedly, two of the superficial cohesion features appear in the larger models: F10 is the average word overlap over nouns and pronouns and F11 is the average number of pronouns per sentence.
    Entity grid features also make their way into the best models when more features are used for prediction: S-X, O-O, O-X, N-O transitions (F19, F22, F23, F30).
  
  
    In this section we consider the problem of pairwise ranking of text readability.
    That is, rather than trying to predict the readability of a single document, we consider pairs of documents and predict which one is better.
    This task may in fact be the more natural one, since in most applications the main concern is with the relative quality of articles rather than their absolute scores.
    This setting is also beneficial in terms of data use, because each pair of articles with different average readability scores now becomes a data point for the classification task.
