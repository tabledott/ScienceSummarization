ence-level fluency evaluation.
    For the overall evaluation of sentences for fluency and adequacy, the metric based on headword chain performs better than BLEU in both sentencelevel and corpus-level correlation with human judgments.
    The kernel based metrics, though poor in sentence-level evaluation, achieve the best results in corpus-level evaluation, where sparse data are less of a barrier.
    Our syntax-based measures require the existence of a parser for the language in question, however it is worth noting that a parser is required for the target language only, as all our measures of similarity are defined across hypotheses and references in the same language.
    Our results, in particular for the primarily structural STM, may be surprising in light of the fact that the parser is not designed to handle ill-formed or ungrammatical sentences such as those produced by machine translation systems.
    Modern statistical parsers have been tuned to discriminate good structures from bad rather than good s
