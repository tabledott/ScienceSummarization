d, and more severe, problem of the exhaustive approach.
    We need to consider candidate translations.
    With typical values of Q = 110 and m = 10, which we observed in our corpus, the above formula evaluates to 5.2.
    1013, or more than 50 trillion candidate translations.
    Clearly, we need to reduce this number to a more practical value.
    Our algorithm achieves this reduction by filtering out groups of words not having a high similarity with the source collocation, assuming that such groups will not be part of the translation.
    Let ri (i &gt; 2) be the fraction of proposed translations with i words which pass the threshold Td.
    Let 131 be the number of translations with i words that are examined by Champollion, and Si the number of these translations that actually survive the thresholds and will be used to generate the candidate translations with i +1 words.
    Clearly, Si =-- P1 Q, P2 = (?
    ), and Si = ri &#8226; P, for i &gt; 2.
    During the generation of the candidate translations o
