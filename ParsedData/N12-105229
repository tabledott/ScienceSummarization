wing data sets.
    For DA, DE, EL, ES, IT, NL, PT and SV, we use the predefined training and evaluation data sets from the CoNLL 2006/2007 data sets (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).
    For EN we use sections 02-21, 22, and 23 of the Penn WSJ Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) for training, development and evaluation.
    For FR we used the French Treebank (Abeill&#180;e and Barrier, 2004) with splits defined in Candito et al. (2010).
    For KO we use the Sejong Korean Treebank (Han et al., 2002) randomly splitting the data into 80% training, 10% development and 10% evaluation.
    For RU we use the SynTagRus Treebank (Boguslavsky et al., 2000; Apresjan et al., 2006) randomly splitting the data into 80% training, 10% development and 10% evaluation.
    For ZH we use the Penn Chinese Treebank v6 (Xue et al., 2005) using the proposed data splits from the documentation.
    Both EN and ZH were converted to dependencies using v1.6.8 of the Stanford Converter (De Marneffe et al., 2006).
