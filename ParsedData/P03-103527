proved source-channel models outperforms the greedy approach (with a slight but statistically significant different i.e., P &lt; 0.01 according to the t test) because the use of context model resolves more ambiguities in segmentation.
    The most promising property of our approach is that the source-channel models provide a flexible framework where a wide variety of linguistic knowledge and statistical models can be combined in a unified way.
    As shown in Rows 3 to 6, when components are switched on in turn by activating corresponding class models, the overall word segmentation performance increases consistently.
    We also conduct an error analysis, showing that 86.2% of errors come from NER and factoid detection, although the tokens of these word types consist of only 8.7% of all that are in the test set.
    We compare our system &#8211; henceforth SCM, with other two Chinese word segmentation systems7: 7 Although the two systems are widely accessible in mainland China, to our knowledge no standard ev
