d the best currently available broad-coverage parsing systems, which exploit lexical as well as purely syntactic information (Charniak 1997).
    In order to better understand just why the parent annotation transform performs so much better than the other transforms, transformation/detransformation experiments were performed in which the parent annotation transform was performed selectively either on all nodes with a given category label, or all nodes with a given category label and parent category label.
    Figure 10 depicts the effect of selective application of the parent annotation transform on the change of the average of precision and recall with respect to the Id transform.
    It is clear that distinguishing the context of NP and S nodes is responsible for an important part of the improvement in performance.
    Merely distinguishing root from nonroot S nodes&#8212;a distinction made in early transformational grammar but ignored in more recent work&#8212;improves average precision and recall by appro
