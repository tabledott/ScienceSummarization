call these the ITG constraints.
    The second constraints are the IBM constraints (Berger et al., 1996).
    In the next section, we will describe these constraints from a theoretical point of view.
    Then, we will describe the resulting search algorithm and its extension for word graph generation.
    Afterwards, we will analyze the Viterbi alignments produced during the training of the alignment models.
    Then, we will compare the translation results when restricting the search to either of these constraints.
  
  
    In this section, we will discuss the reordering constraints from a theoretical point of view.
    We will answer the question of how many word-reorderings are permitted for the ITG constraints as well as for the IBM constraints.
    Since we are only interested in the number of possible reorderings, the specific word identities are of no importance here.
    Furthermore, we assume a one-to-one correspondence between source and target words.
    Thus, we are interested in the number of wo
