estion arises with automatically constructed thesauri (Pereira et al., 1993; Lin, 1998).
    While the extracted pairs are indeed similar, they are not paraphrases.
    For example, while &#8220;dog&#8221; and &#8220;cat&#8221; are recognized as the most similar concepts by the method described in (Lin, 1998), it is hard to imagine a context in which these words would be interchangeable.
    The first attempt to derive paraphrasing rules from corpora was undertaken by (Jacquemin et al., 1997), who investigated morphological and syntactic variants of technical terms.
    While these rules achieve high accuracy in identifying term paraphrases, the techniques used have not been extended to other types of paraphrasing yet.
    Statistical techniques were also successfully used by (Lapata, 2001) to identify paraphrases of adjective-noun phrases.
    In contrast, our method is not limited to a particular paraphrase type.
  
  
    The corpus we use for identification of paraphrases is a collection of multiple Engli
