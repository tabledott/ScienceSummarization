stification for targeting these errors comes from inspection of several corpora of non-native writing.
			In the NICT Japanese Learners of English (JLE) corpus (Izumi et al 2004), 26.6% of all errors are determiner related, and about 10% are preposition related, making these two error types the dominant ones in the corpus.
			Although the JLE corpus is based on transcripts of spoken language, we have no reason to believe that the situation in written English is substantially different.
			The Chinese Learners of English Corpus (CLEC, Gui and Yang 2003) has a coarser and somewhat inconsistent error tagging scheme that makes it harder to isolate the two errors, but of the non-orthographic errors, more than 10% are determiner and number related.
			Roughly 2% of errors in the corpus are tagged as preposition-related, but other preposition errors are subsumed under the ?collocation error?
			category which makes up about 5% of errors.
