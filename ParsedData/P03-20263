osed in an error tag to be replaced by the corrected version.
    We applied different methods to detecting these two kinds of errors.
    Omission-type errors were detected by estimating whether or not a necessary word string was missing in front of each word, including delimiters.
    We also estimated to which category the error belonged during this process.
    What we call &#8220;error categories&#8221; here means the 45 error categories that are defined in our error tagset.
    (e.g. article and tense errors) These are different from &#8220;error types&#8221; (omission or replacement).
    As we can see from Fig.
    1, when more than one error category is given, we have two ways of choosing the best one.
    Method A allows us to estimate whether there is a missing word or not for each error category.
    This can be considered the same as deciding which of the two labels (E: &#8220;There is a missing word.&#8221; or C: &#8220;There is no missing word.&#8221;) should be inserted in front of each word.
