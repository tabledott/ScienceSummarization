 set after maximumBLEU training.
    Then during test, we adapt the length of the translation output by adjusting the weight of the word count feature such that the expected output/source length ratio is met.
    In our experiments, we apply length adaptation to the system combination output at the level of the whole test corpus.
    The development (dev) set used for system combination parameter training contains 1002 sentences sampled from the previous NIST MT Chinese-to-English test sets: 35% from MT04, 55% from MT05, and 10% from MT06-newswire.
    The test set is the MT08 Chinese-to-English &#8220;current&#8221; test set, which includes 1357 sentences from both newswire and web-data genres.
    Both dev and test sets have four references per sentence.
    As inputs to the system combination, 10-best hypotheses for each source sentence in the dev and test sets are collected from each of the eight single systems.
    All outputs on the MT08 test set were true-cased before scoring using a log-linear conditi
