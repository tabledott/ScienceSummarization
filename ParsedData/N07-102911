llows: Testing the sentence-level combination has the same steps as the tuning apart from all estimation steps; i.e., steps 1, 3, 5 and 7.
  
  
    The phrase-level combination is based on extracting a new phrase translation table from each system&#8217;s target-to-source phrase alignments and re-decoding the source sentence using this new translation table and a language model.
    In this work, the target-tosource phrase alignments were available from the individual systems.
    If the alignments are not available, they can be automatically generated; e.g., using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).
    The phrase translation table is generated for each source sentence using confidence scores derived from sentence posteriors with system-specific total score scaling factors and similarity scores based on the agreement among the phrases from all systems.
    Each phrase has an initial confidence based on the sentence posterior estimated from an -best list in the same fashion as in Section 3.2.
