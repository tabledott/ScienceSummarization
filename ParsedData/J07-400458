es are equivalent when they interact in the same manner with both the generation of subsequent parse structure and the statistical parse selection.
    In practice, this means that equivalent entries have the same span; form the same structures, that is, the remaining derivation plus dependencies, in any subsequent parsing; and generate the same features in any subsequent parsing.
    Back pointers to the daughters indicate how an individual entry was created, so that any derivation plus dependency structure can be recovered from the chart.
    The second role of the packed charts is to allow recovery of the highest scoring derivation or dependency structure without enumerating all derivations.
    And finally, packed charts are an instance of a feature forest, which Miyao and Tsujii (2002) show can be used to efficiently estimate expected values of features, even though the expectation may involve a sum over an exponential number of trees in the forest.
