    Probabilistic translation models whose parameters reflect universal properties of translational equivalence and/or existing knowledge about particular languages and language pairs benefit from the best of both the empiricist and rationalist traditions.
    This article presents three such models, along with methods for efficiently estimating their parameters.
    Each new method is designed to account for an additional universal property of translational equivalence in bitexts: Quantitative evaluation with respect to independent human judgments has shown that each of these three estimation biases significantly improves translation model accuracy over a baseline knowledge-free model.
    However, these biases will not produce the best possible translation models by themselves.
    Anyone attempting to build an optimal translation model should infuse it with all available knowledge sources, including syntactic, dictionary and cognate information.
