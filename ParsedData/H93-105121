  CONCLUSION The convergence of the response patterns for the three methods suggests that each of the classifiers is extracting as much data as is available in word counts from training contexts.
  If this is the case, any technique that uses only word counts will not be significantly more accurate than the techniques tested here.
  Although the degree of polysemy does affect the diffi- culty of the sense resolution task, a greater factor of per- formance is the difficulty of resolving individual senses.
  Using hindsight, it is obvious that the tezt sense is hard for these statistical methods to learn because one can talk or write about anything.
  In effect, all words be- tween a pair of quotation marks are noise (unless line is wit
