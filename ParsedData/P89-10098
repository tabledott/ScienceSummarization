  However, see Dale (1988) for a sug- gestion as to how the few instances of/onc-dbt~a.e pronom- inalimtion that  do exist might be explained by means  of a theory of discourse structure like that  suggested by Gross and Sidner (1986).
  I f  the status includes the features [centre, +] and [oblig,-], then this participant should be omitted from the surface semantic struc- ture altogether.
  In the former case, this will result in a pronominal reference as in Remove them, where the surface se- mantic structure corresponding to the pronominal form is as follows: i nd~z  = z s ta tus  : [ SS = "1 g iven
