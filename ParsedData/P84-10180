  Functional Unification Grammar: A Formalism For Machine Translation
  
    Arg = (Sense Var) P2 = Arg = (Sense Var)1 This, in turn, is readily interpretable as a description of the logical expression Vq.dog(q)AP(g) It remains to provide verbs with a sense that provides a suitable for is, for (Sense Prop P2 Pred).
    An example would be the following: Cat = V Lex = barks Tense = Pres Pers = 3 Subj = {Num = Sing Anim = + Obj = NONE = [P2 = [Fred = bark]]] IV Conclusion It has not been possible in this paper to give more than an impression of how an experimental machine translation system might be constructed based on FUG.
    I hope, however, that it has been possible to convey something of the value of monotonic systems for this purpose.
    Implementing FUG in an efficient way requires skill and a variety of little known techniques.
    However, the programs, though subtle, are not large and, once written, they provide the grammarian and lexicographer with an emmense wealth of expressive devices.
