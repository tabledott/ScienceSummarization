 are detected by the previously described dynamic programming method as overlapping each other, in this case yl &lt; x3, there is a variety of possible cases according to the relation among xl, x2, and yl and that among y2, y3, and x3 as shown in Figure 9.
    These 16 possible cases of two CSs overlapping each other are classified into three different relations, and the correction of CSs is performed for each relation in the following way: Brother relation (case F in Figure 9): In the previous step of detecting the scopes of CSs, a CS that consists of more than two conjuncts is detected as composed of consecutive CSs, each of which consists of two conjuncts.
    In this case, two adjoining CSs have a brother relation.
    Consecutive CSs that are in a brother relation are merged into one CS.
    Parent&#8212;child relation (cases A, B, C, D, E, G, M, and N in Figure 9): Another actual relation between two CSs is a parent&#8212;child relation, in which a pre- or post-conjunct of a CS includes another CS.
