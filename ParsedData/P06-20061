arge lexicalized probabilistic contextfree like (PCFG-like) models trained on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) subset of the Penn TreeBank (PTB).
    Evaluation of these systems has been mostly in terms of the PARSEVAL scheme using tree similarity measures of (labelled) precision and recall and crossing bracket rate applied to section 23 of the WSJ PTB.
    (See e.g.
    Collins (1999) for detailed exposition of one such very fruitful line of research.)
    We evaluate the comparative accuracy of an unlexicalized statistical parser trained on a smaller treebank and tested on a subset of section 23 of the WSJ using a relational evaluation scheme.
    We demonstrate that a parser which is competitive in accuracy (without sacrificing processing speed) can be quickly developed without reliance on large in-domain manually-constructed treebanks.
    This makes it more practical to use statistical parsers in diverse applications needing access to aspects of predicate-argument structure.
    We define a lexicalized stat
