peech tags x is given by where r(x) is the part of speech tag of the root of the parse tree z, z is an edge from parent zp to child zc in direction zd, either left or right, and vz indicates valency&#8212;false if zp has no other children further from it in direction zd than zc, true otherwise.
    The valencies vr/vl are marked as true if x has any children on the left/right in z, false otherwise.
  
  
    Gra&#231;a et al. (2008) introduce an estimation framework that incorporates side-information into unsupervised problems in the form of linear constraints on posterior expectations.
    In grammar transfer, our basic constraint is of the form: the expected proportion of conserved edges in a sentence pair is at least &#951; (the exact proportion we used was 0.9, which was determined using unlabeled data as described in Section 5).
    Specifically, let Cx be the set of directed edges projected from English for a given sentence x, then given a parse z, the proportion of conserved edges is f (x, z) = |CX |Ez
