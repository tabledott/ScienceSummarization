  The Stanford Typed Dependencies Representation
  
    This paper examines the Stanford typed dependencies representation, which was designed to provide a straightforward description of grammatical relations for any user who could benefit from automatic text understanding.
    For such purposes, we argue that dependency schemes must follow a simple design and provide semantically contentful information, as well as offer an automatic procedure to extract the relations.
    We consider the underlying design principles of the Stanford scheme from this perspective, and compare it to the GR and PARC representations.
    Finally, we address the question of the suitability of the Stanford scheme for parser evaluation.
  
  
    The Stanford typed dependencies representation was designed to provide a simple description of the grammatical relationships in a sentence that could easily be understood and effectively used by people without linguistic expertise who wanted to extract textual relations.
