e predict types over nominal mentions that are more difficult to judge from surface forms.
    In this task, the plurality of errors are confusions between the GPE (geo-political entity) and ORG entity types, which have very similar distributions.
  
  
    Our model is able to acquire and exploit knowledge at either the level of individual entities (&#8220;Obama&#8221; is a &#8220;president&#8221;) and entity types (&#8220;company&#8221; can refer to a corporation).
    As a result, it leverages semantic constraints more effectively than systems operating at either level alone.
    In conjunction with reasonable, but simple, factors capturing discourse and syntactic configurational preferences, our entity-centric semantic model lowers coreference error rate substantially, particularly on semantically disambiguated references, giving a sizable improvement over the state-of-the-art.11 Acknowledgements: This project is funded in part by the Office of Naval Research under MURI Grant No.
