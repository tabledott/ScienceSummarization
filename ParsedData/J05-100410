class has caused it to subdivide, or use intersections of, Levin?s original classes, adding an additional level to the hierarchy (Dang et al.
  We are also extending the coverage by adding new classes (Korhonen and Briscoe 2004).
  Our objective with the Proposition Bank is not a theoretical account of how and why syntactic alternation takes place, but rather to provide a useful level of repre- sentation and a corpus of annotated data to enable empirical study of these issues.
  We have referred to Levin?s classes wherever possible to ensure that verbs in the same classes are given consistent role labels.
  However, there is only a 50% overlap between verbs in VerbNet and those in the Penn TreeBank II, and PropBank itself does not define a set of classes, nor does it attempt to formalize the semantics of the roles it defines.
  While lexical resources such as Levin?s classes and VerbNet provide information about alternation patterns and their semantics, the frequency of these alternations and their effect on
