    If the verb in an English sentence has a prepositional phrase as a child, the prepositional phrase is often placed before the direct object in the Korean counterpart.
    As shown in Figure 3, &#8220;&#65533;&#65533;dl P, &#8221; (&#8220;with a bat&#8221;) is actually between &#8220; L&#8221; (&#8220;John&#8221;) and &#8220;&#65533; &#65533;&#65533;&#8221; (&#8220;the ball&#8221;).
    Another common reordering phenomenon is when a verb has an adverbial clause modifier.
    In that case, the whole adverbial clause is moved together to be in front of the subject of the main sentence.
    Inside the adverbial clause, the ordering follows the same verb reordering rules, so we recursively reorder the clause.
    Our verb precedence rule, as in Table 1, can cover all of the above reordering phenomena.
    One way to interpret this rule set is as follows: for any node whose POS tag is matches VB* (VB, VBZ, VBD, VBP, VBN, VBG), we group the children node that are phrasal verb particle (prt), auxiliary verb (aux)
