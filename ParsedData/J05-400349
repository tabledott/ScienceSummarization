valuates these sentences in the context of an MT system and shows that they bring improvement under special circumstances (i.e., a language model constructed from reference translations) designed to reduce the noise introduced by the automatically extracted corpus.
    We go even further and demonstrate that our method can extract data that improves end-to-end MT performance without any special processing.
    Moreover, we show that our approach works even when only a limited amount of initial parallel data (i.e., a low-coverage dictionary) is available.
    The problem of aligning sentences in comparable corpora was also addressed for monolingual texts.
    Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) present a method of aligning sentences in two comparable English corpora for the purpose of building a training set of text-totext rewriting examples.
    Monolingual parallel sentence detection presents a particular challenge: there are many sentence pairs that have low lexical overlap but are nevertheless parallel.
