s about observed word associations in specific positions.
  Later work from the AI community relied heavily upon selectional restrictions for verbs, although pri- marily in terms of features exhibited by their arguments ( uch as +DRINKABLE) rather than in terms of individual words or word classes.
  More recent work [Brown et al.
  1991][Hearst 1991] has utilized a set of discrete local questions (such as word-to-the-right) in the development of statistical decision procedures.
  However, astrong trend in recent years is to treat a reasonably wide context window as an unordered bag of in- dependent evidence points.
  This technique from information retrieval has been used in neural networks, Bayesian discrim- inators, and dictionary definition matching.
  In a comparative paper in this volume [Leacock et al.
  1993], all three methods under investigation used words in wide context as a pool of evidence independent of relative position.
  It is perhaps not a coincidence that this work has focused almost exclus
