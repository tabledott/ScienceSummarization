of an utterance.
    It does not serve as a general preference measure for antecedence.
    The items in the forward center list, Cf, are ranked according to the hierarchy of grammatical roles.
    For an utterance Un, Cb(Un) is required to be the highest ranked element of Cf (1.1i) that is realized in U.
    If an element E in the list of possible forward centers, Cf (11,_1), is identified as the antecedent of a pronoun in LIE, then E is realized in U.
    The Brennan et al. centering algorithm does not require that the highest ranked element of Cf (Un_i ) actually be realized in Un, but only that Cb(1.1&amp;quot;,) be the highest ranked element of Cf (Un_i) which is, in fact, realized in U. Antecedent selection is constrained by rules that sustain cohesion in the relations between the backward centers of successive utterances in a discourse, but it is not determined directly by the role hierarchy used to rank the forward centers of a previous utterance.
    Therefore, an NP in Un_1 that is relatively low in
