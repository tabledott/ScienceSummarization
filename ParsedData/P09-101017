zed incorrectly.
    In this case, we assign the history a reward of -1.
    This reward is not guaranteed to penalize all incorrect histories, because there may be false positive matches between the sentence and the environment.
    When at least one word matches, we assign a positive reward that linearly increases with the percentage of words assigned to non-null commands, and linearly decreases with the number of output actions.
    This reward signal encourages analyses that interpret all of the words without producing spurious actions.
    Our second application is to a puzzle game called Crossblock, available online as a Flash game.7 Each of 50 puzzles is played on a grid, where some grid positions are filled with squares.
    The object of the game is to clear the grid by drawing vertical or horizontal line segments that remove groups of squares.
    Each segment must exactly cross a specific number of squares, ranging from two to seven depending on the puzzle.
