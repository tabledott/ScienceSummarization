ymbol into the two right hand side symbols in reverse order in the two languages.
    One special case of ITG is the bracketing ITG that has only one nonterminal that instantiates exactly one straight rule and one inverted rule.
    The ITG we apply in our experiments has more structural labels than the primitive bracketing grammar: it has a start symbol 5, a single preterminal C, and two intermediate nonterminals A and B used to ensure that only one parse can generate any given word-level alignment, as discussed by Wu (1997) and Zens and Ney (2003).
    As an example, Figure 1 shows the alignment and the corresponding parse tree for the sentence pair Je les vois / I see them using the unambiguous bracketing ITG.
    A stochastic ITG can be thought of as a stochastic CFG extended to the space of bitext.
    The independence assumptions typifying S-CFGs are also valid for S-ITGs.
    Therefore, the probability of an S-ITG parse is calculated as the product of the probabilities of all the instances of rules in
