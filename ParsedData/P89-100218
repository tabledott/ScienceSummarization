nd unification algorithm is thus as follows: connect(Pivot, Root) :% trivially connect pivot to root unify(Pivot, Root).
    Now, we need only define the notion of an applicable chain or nonchain rule.
    A nonchain rule is applicable if the semantics of the left-hand-side of the rule (which is to become the pivot) matches that of the root.
    Further, we require a top-down check that syntactically the pivot can serve as the semantic head of the root.
    For this purpose, we assume a predicate chained_nodes that codifies the transitive closure of the semantic head relation over categories.
    This is the correlate of the link relation used in left-corner parsers with topdown filtering; we direct the reader to the discussion by Matsumoto et al. (1983) or Pereira and Shieber (1985, p. 182) for further information.
    A chain rule is applicable to connect a pivot to a root if the pivot can serve as the semantic head of the rule and the left-hand-side of the rule is appropriate for linking to the root.
