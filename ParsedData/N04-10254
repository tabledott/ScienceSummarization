requency data smoothed across grades using kernel regression for the words (clockwise from top left): &#8216;red&#8217;, &#8216;determine&#8217;, &#8216;the&#8217;, and &#8216;perimeter&#8217;. ability measures when authoring the graded passages, making the data somewhat artificial and biased toward traditional semantic variables.

    Before defining a classification model, we examined the corpus for trends in word frequency.
    One obvious pattern was that more difficult words were introduced a
