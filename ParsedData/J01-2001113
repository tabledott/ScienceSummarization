complexity motivates a little bit more notation to simplify it.
    First, we can compute the change in the pointers to the signatures, and the information that each signature contains regarding the count of its stems and suffixes 36 We beg the reader's indulgence in recognizing that we prepend the operator A immediately to the left of the name of a set to indicate the change in the size of the counts of the set, which is to say, &amp;quot;AW&amp;quot; is shorthand for &amp;quot;A([W])&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;A(W)&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;A((W))&amp;quot;. as in (10a).
    But the heart of the matter is the treatment of the stems and suffixes within the signatures, given in (10b)&#8212;(10d).
    Bear in mind, first of all, that each signature consists of a list of pointers to stems, and a list of pointers to suffixes.
    The treatment of suffixes is given in (10d), and is relatively straightforward, but the treatment of stems (10c) is a bit more complex.
    Recall that all items on the stem list will be po
