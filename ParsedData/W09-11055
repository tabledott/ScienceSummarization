ts, regardless of their distance from the negation signal.
    Their hybrid system that combines regular expression matching with grammatical parsing achieves 92.60% recall and 99.80% precision.
    Additionally, Boytcheva et al. (2005) incorporate the treatment of negation in a system, MEHR, that extracts from electronic health records all the information required to generate automatically patient chronicles.
    They report 57% of negations correctly recognised.
    The above-mentioned research applies rule-based algorithms to negation finding.
    Machine learning techniques have been used in some cases.
    Averbuch et al. (2004) developed an algorithm that uses information gain to learn negative context patterns.
    Golding and Chapman (2003) experiment with Naive Bayes and Decision Trees to distinguish whether a medical observation is negated by the word not in a corpus of hospital reports.
    They report a maximum of 90% F-score.
    Goryachev et al. (2006) compare the performance of four different m
