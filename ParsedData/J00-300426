 extend the calculation to the next state.
    To find the optimal state sequence is simply a matter of recording with each state which incoming transition is associated with the greatest probability, and traversing that path in the reverse direction once the final node is reached.
    These models can be generated dynamically by proceeding to predict each character in turn.
    Figure 6(a) shows the beginning of the tree that results.
    First, the initial node t is expanded into its two children, t. and to.
    Then, these are expanded in turn.
    The first has one child, &#8226;o, because a space cannot be followed by another space.
    The second has two, o&#8226; and ob.
    Figure 6(b) shows the further expansion of the .o node.
    However, the two children that are created already exist in the tree, and so the existing versions of these nodes are used instead, as in Figure 6(c).
    If this procedure is conThe space insertion procedure as implemented. tinued, the graph structure of Figure 5(a) will
