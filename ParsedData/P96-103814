g dialogues, Flammia (Flammia and Zue, 1995) reports an average pairwise K of .45 for five labelers and of .68 for the three most similar labelers.
    An important issue in applying the 1&#163; coefficient is how one calculates the expected agreement using prior distributions of categories.
    We first calculated the prior probabilities for our data based simply on the distribution of SBEG versus non-SBEG labels for all labelers on one of the nine directiongiving tasks in this study, with separate calculations for the read and spontaneous versions.
    This task, which represented about 8% of the data for both speaking styles, was chosen because it was midway in planning complexity and in length among all the tasks.
    Using these distributions, we calculated tz coefficients for each pair of labelers in each condition for the remaining eight tasks in our corpus.
    The observed percentage of SBEG labels, prior distribution for SBEG, average of the pairwise n scores, and standard deviations for those score
