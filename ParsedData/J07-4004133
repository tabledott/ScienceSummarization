rovides an upper bound for the CCG parser.
    Briscoe and Carroll (2006) give a rough comparison of RASP with the Parc LFG parser (Kaplan et al. 2004) on DepBank, obtaining similar results overall, but acknowledging that the results are not strictly comparable because of the different annotation schemes used.
  
  
    We might expect the CCG parser to perform better than RASP on this data because RASP is not tuned to newspaper text and uses an unlexicalized parsing model.
    On the other hand the relatively low upper bound for the CCG parser on DepBank demonstrates the considerable disadvantage of evaluating on a resource which uses a different annotation scheme to the parser.
    Our feeling is that the overall F-score on DepBank understates the accuracy of the CCG parser, because of the information lost in the translation.
    One aspect of the CCGbank evaluation which is more demanding than the DepBank evaluation is the set of labeled dependencies used.
    In CCGbank there are many more labeled depende
