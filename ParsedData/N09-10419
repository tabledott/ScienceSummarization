6;C represents the core content of a document set.
    Intuitively, &#966;C does not include words which are common amongst several document collections (modeled with the BACKGROUND topic), or words which don&#8217;t appear across many documents (modeled with the DOCSPECIFIC topic).
    Also, because topics are tied together at the sentence level, words which frequently occur with other content words are more likely to be considered content words.
    We ran our topic model over the DUC 2006 document collections and estimated the distribution &#966;C(&#183;) for each document set.15 Then we extracted a summary using the KLSUM criterion with our estimated &#966;C in place of the the raw unigram distribution.
    Doing so yielded 6.3 R-2 without stop words (see TOPICSUM in table 1); while not a statistically significant improvement over KLSUM, it is our first model which outperforms SUMBASIC with statistical significance.
    Daum&#180;e III and Marcu (2006) explore a topic model similar to ours for query-focus
