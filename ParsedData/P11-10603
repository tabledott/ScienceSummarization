epresentation, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which is both simple and expressive (Section 2).
    The logical forms in this framework are trees, which is desirable for two reasons: (i) they parallel syntactic dependency trees, which facilitates parsing and learning; and (ii) evaluating them to obtain the answer is computationally efficient.
    We trained our model using an EM-like algorithm (Section 3) on two benchmarks, GEO and JOBS (Section 4).
    Our system outperforms all existing systems despite using no annotated logical forms.
  
  
    We first present a basic version (Section 2.1) of dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which captures the core idea of using trees to represent formal semantics.
    We then introduce the full version (Section 2.2), which handles linguistic phenomena such as quantification, where syntactic and semantic scope diverge.
    We start with some definitions, using US geography as an example domain.
    Let V be the set of all values, which inclu
