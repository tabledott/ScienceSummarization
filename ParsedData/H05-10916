lmost exclu sively concentrated in the shortest path between e1 and e2 in the undirected version of the dependency graph.
			If entities e1 and e2 are arguments of the same predicate, then the shortest path between them willpass through the predicate, which may be con nected directly to the two entities, or indirectly through prepositions.
			If e1 and e2 belong to different predicate-argument structures that share a common argument, then the shortest path will pass through this argument.
			This is the case with the shortest pathbetween ?stations?
			and ?workers?
			in Figure 1, passing through ?protesters?, which is an argument com mon to both predicates ?holding?
			and ?seized?.
			In Table 1 we show the paths corresponding to the four relation instances encoded in the ACE corpus for thetwo sentences from Figure 1.
			All these paths sup port the LOCATED relationship.
			For the first path, it is reasonable to infer that if a PERSON entity (e.g. ?protesters?)
			is doing some action (e.g. ?seized?)
