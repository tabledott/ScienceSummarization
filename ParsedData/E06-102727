ith semantic tags.
			It has been shown here that the inter-annotator agreement tends to fall as we proceed from the core of a fuzzysemantic category to its periphery.
			Therefore, the disagreement between the annota tors does not necessarily reflect a quality problem in human annotation, but rather a structural property of the semantic category.This suggests that inter-annotator disagree ment rates can serve as an important source of empirical information about the structural properties of the semantic category and canhelp define and validate fuzzy sets of seman tic category members for a number of NLP tasks and applications.
