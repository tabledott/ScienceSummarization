types of information and hence can be analyzed in a number of ways.
    In the ParGram analysis, the c-structure analysis is left relatively free according to language particular needs and slightly varying theoretical assumptions.
    For instance, the Norwegian grammar, unlike the other grammars, implements the principles in (Bresnan, 2001) concerning the relationship between an X -based c-structure and the f-structure.
    This allows Norwegian specifiers to be analyzed as functional heads of DPs etc., whereas they are constituents of NPs in the other grammars.
    However, at the level of f-structure, this information is part of a complex SPEC feature in all the grammars.
    Thus parallelism is maintained at the level of f-structure even across different theoretical preferences.
    An example is shown in (3) for Norwegian and English in which the SPEC consists of a QUANT(ifier) and a POSS(essive) (SPEC can also contain information about DETerminers and DEMONstratives).
