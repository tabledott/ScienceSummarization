 to the formalism.
    For instance, the application of techniques for preprocessing of g,ranintars in order to gain efficiency may fail to terminate, as in left-corner and LR algorithms.
    Algorithms performing top-down prediction (e.g. top-down backtrack parsing, Earley's algorithm) may not terminate at parse time.
    Implementing backtracking regimens&#8212;useful for instance for generating parses in some particular order, say, in order of syntactic preference&#8212;is in general difficult when LR-style and top-down backtrack techniques are eliminated.
    In this paper, we discuss a solution to the problem of extending parsing algorithms to formalisms with possibly infinite nonterminal domains, a solution based on an operation we call restriction.
    In Section 2, we summarize traditional proposals for solutions and problems inherent in them and propose an alternative approach to a solution using restriction.
    In Section 3, we present some technical background including a brief description of the
