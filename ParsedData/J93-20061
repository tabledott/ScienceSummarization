ies all known syntactic and semantic constraints, and learning case frame information for verbs from example uses.
    From these experiments, we are convinced that probabilistic models based on annotated corpora can effectively reduce the ambiguity in processing text and can be used to acquire lexical information from a corpus, by supplementing knowledge-based techniques.
    Based on the results of those experiments, we have constructed a new natural language system (PLUM) for extracting data from text, e.g., newswire text.
  
  
    Natural language processing, and AT in general, have focused mainly on building rule-based systems with carefully handcrafted rules and domain knowledge.
    Our own natural language database query systems, JANUS (Weischedel et al. 1989), ParlanceTm,1 and Delphi (Stallard 1989), have used these techniques quite successfully.
    However, as we move from the application of understanding database queries in limited domains to applications of processing open-ended text, we found c
