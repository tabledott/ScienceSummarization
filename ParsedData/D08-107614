hen propagated over the outgoing arcs by associating each e c outp(vq) with a copy of the combined envelope.
    This copy is modified by adding the parameters (slope and y-intercept) of the line gp(e) to the envelope&#8217;s constituent line segments.
    The envelopes of the incoming arcs are no longer needed and can be deleted in order to release memory.
    The envelope computed at the sink node is by construction the convex hull over all translation hypotheses represented in the lattice, and it compactly encodes those candidates which maximize the decision rule Eq.
    (1) for any point along the line &#955;M-ydM .
    Algorithm 2 shows the pseudo code.
    Note that the component E.x does not change and therefore requires no update.
    It remains to verify that the suggested algorithm is efficient in both running time and memory.
    For this purpose, we first analyze the complexity of Algorithm 1 and derive from it the running time of Algorithm 2.
    After sorting, each line object in Algorithm 1 is
