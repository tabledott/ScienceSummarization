ra contain topic aligned documents which are not translations of each other.
    The corpora Fung and Cheung (2004) examine are quasi-comparable: they contain bilingual documents which are not necessarily on the same topic.
    Wikipedia is a special case, since the aligned article pairs may range from being almost completely parallel (e.g., the Spanish and English entries for &#8220;Antiparticle&#8221;) to containing almost no parallel sentences (the Spanish and English entries for &#8220;John Calvin&#8221;), despite being topic-aligned.
    It is best characterized as a mix of noisy parallel and comparable article pairs.
    Some Wikipedia authors will translate articles from another language; others write the content themselves.
    Furthermore, even articles created through translations may later diverge due to independent edits in either language.
  
  
    In this section, we will focus on methods for extracting parallel sentences from aligned, comparable documents.
