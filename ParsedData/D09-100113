(e.g., &#8220;borders&#8221;, &#8220;shares a border with&#8221;), any form in the cluster representing the state of Utah (e.g., &#8220;the beehive state&#8221;), and any form in the cluster representing the state of Idaho (e.g., &#8220;Idaho&#8221;).
    Conditioned on the clusters, the choices of individual lambda forms are independent of each other.
    To handle variable number of arguments, we follow Davidsonian semantics and further decompose a lambda form into the core form, which does not contain any lambda variable (e.g., borders(n1)), and the argument forms, which contain a single lambda variable (e.g., Ax2.nsubj(n1, x2) and Ax3.dobj(n1, x3)).
    Each lambda-form cluster may contain some number of argument types, which cluster distinct forms of the same argument in a relation.
    For example, in Stanford dependencies, the object of a verb uses the dependency dobj in the active voice, but nsubjpass in passive.
    Lambda-form clusters abstract away syntactic variations of the same meaning.
