in Hebrew might be harder than in Arabic.
    It could also mean that the tag set used for the Arabic corpora has not been adapted to the specific nature of Arabic morphology (a comment also made in (Habash and Rambow, 2005)).
    We propose an unsupervised morpheme-based HMM to address the data sparseness problem.
    In contrast to Bar-Haim et al., our model combines segmentation and morphological disambiguation, in parallel.
    The only resource we use in this work is a morphological analyzer.
    The analyzer itself can be generated from a word list and a morphological generation module, such as the HSpell wordlist (Har'el and Kenigsberg, 2004).
  
  
    The lexical items of word-based models are the words of the language.
    The implication of this decision is that both lexical and syntagmatic relations of the model, are based on a word-oriented tagset.
    With such a tagset, it must be possible to tag any word of the language with at least one tag.
    Let us consider, for instance, the Hebrew phras
