  task for the prediction step of Ear leys  a lgor i thm is performed using the const i tuent from the original rule ra ther  than its current  instance.
  A s imi lar  problem arises when an inactive edge is entered on the chart.
  When the parser has instant ia ted C as c:" and entered it on the chart,  it has to find all the incoming active edges at the start ing vertex of C" that could be extended with the newly found const i tuent.
  If(" were :m atomic symbol, this task would be simple because it would involve only simple equal ity checks: because C" is a feature set, we would have to use unif ication, which is a more t ime-consuming operation.
  I) PATR avoids the problem ent irely by keeping track, as part  of the prediction step, of what  edges C" could be used to extend.
  When an active edge is entered on the chart ,  one piece of information in the edge label is a pointer to the edges that could be extended with it.
  Init ial ly, the list contains only the edge that  generated the new edge; other
