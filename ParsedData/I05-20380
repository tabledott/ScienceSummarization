	Syntax Annotation for the GENIA Corpus
		Linguistically annotated corpus based on texts in biomedical domain has been constructed to tune natural language processing (NLP) tools for bio textmining.
		As the focus of information extraction is shifting from "nominal" information such as named entity to "verbal" information such as function and interaction of substances, applica tion of parsers has become one of the key technologies and thus the corpus annotated for syntactic structure of sen tences is in demand.
		A subset of the GENIA corpus consisting of 500 MEDLINE abstracts has been annotated for syntactic structure in an XML based format based on Penn Treebank II (PTB) scheme.
		Inter-annotator agreement test indicated that the writ ing style rather than the contents of the research abstracts is the source of the difficulty in tree annotation, and that annotation can be stably done by linguists without much knowledge of bi ology with appropriate guidelines regarding to linguistic phenomena par ticular to
