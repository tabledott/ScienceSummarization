3, j5] ]) .
  %% el &lt;-&gt; jl, e2 &lt;-&gt; j3, e3 &lt;-&gt; j5 Each number with prefix e or j in word- dependency trees represents the ID of the sub- tree.
  Each node in a tree contains a word (in root form) and its syntactic ategory.
  A corre- spondence link is represented as a pair of iDs.
  3.2 T rans la t ion  Un i t A word-dependency (sub)tree which has a cor- respondence link is transhttable; .g.
  el,  e2, e3, j l ,  j3, j5.
  A translatable tree in which some translatable subtrees are removed is also trans- lata.ble; e.g.
  e l -e2,  e l -e3,  e l -e2-e3,  j l - j3 , j l - j5 ,  j l - j a - jS .
  Both of them are tra.nslat- M)le fragments.
  Sadler calls them translation w,,its[Sadler 89a,].
  3.3 Match ing  Express ion Next we will introduce the concept matching expression.
  Matching expression(ME) is de- fined as the following: &lt;HE&gt; : :=  [&lt;ID&gt;I&lt;ME-Commands&gt;] &lt;ME-Commands&gt; : : = [] or [&lt;ME-Command&gt; I &lt;ME-Commands&gt;] &lt;ME-Command&gt; : := [d, &lt; ID&gt;]
