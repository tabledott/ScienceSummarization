ch pattern, in the present framework.
    The precision of the patterns obtained from one QA-pair example in algorithm 1 is calculated from the documents obtained in algorithm 2 for other examples of the same question type.
    In other words, the precision scores are calculated by cross-checking the patterns across various examples of the same type.
    This step proves to be very significant as it helps to eliminate dubious patterns, which may appear because the contents of two or more websites may be the same, or the same web document reappears in the search engine output for algorithms 1 and 2.
    Algorithm 1 does not explicitly specify any particular question type.
    Judicious choice of the QA example pair therefore allows it to be used for many question types without change.
  
  
    Using the patterns to answer a new question we employ the following algorithm:
  
  
    From our Webclopedia QA Typology (Hovy et al., 2002a) we selected 6 different question types: BIRTHDATE, LOCATION, INVENTOR, DISCO
