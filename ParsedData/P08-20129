gnificantly higher than any published system.
    The V scorer (Amit and Baldwin, 1998) was proposed to overcome several shortcomings of the MUC scorer.
    However, coreference resolution is a clustering task, and many cluster scorers already exist.
    In addition to the MUC and V scorers, we also evaluate using cluster f-measure (Ghosh, 2003), which is the standard f-measure computed over true/false coreference decisions for pairs of mentions; the Rand index (Rand, 1971), which is pairwise accuracy of the clustering; and variation of information (Meila, 2003), which utilizes the entropy of the clusterings and their mutual information (and for which lower values are better).
    Our results are summarized in Table 1.
    We show performance for both baseline classifiers, as well as our ILP-based classifier, which finds the most probable legal assignment to the variables representing coreference decisions over pairs of mentions.
    For comparison, we also give the results of the COREFILP system of Denis and
