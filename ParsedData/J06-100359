and success in malapropism detection requires success at both stages.
  For the first stage, we say that a word is suspected of being a malapropism (and the word is a suspect) if it is judged to be unrelated to other words nearby; the word is a correct suspect if it is indeed a malapropism and a false suspect if it isn?t.
  At the second stage, we say that, given a suspect, an alarm is raised when a spelling variation of the suspect is judged to be related to a nearby word or words; and if an alarm word is a malapropism, we say that the alarm is a true alarm and that the malapropism has been detected; otherwise, it is a false alarm.
  Then we can define precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure (F) for 18 Articles too small to warrant such a replacement (19 in total) were excluded from further consideration.
