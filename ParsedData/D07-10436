the size of thedataset and the distribution of class sizes.
			There fore, instead of taking the raw conditional entropy, we normalize this value by the maximum reduction in entropy the clustering information could provide, specifically, H(C).
			Note that H(C|K) is maximal (and equals H(C)) when the clustering provides no new information ? the class distribution within each cluster is equal to the overall class distribiution.
			H(C|K) is 0 when each cluster contains only members of a single class,a perfectly homogenous clustering.
			In the degen erate case where H(C) = 0, when there is only a single class, we define homogeneity to be 1.
			For a perfectly homogenous solution, this normalization, H(C|K) H(C) , equals 0.
			Thus, to adhere to the conventionof 1 being desirable and 0 undesirable, we define ho mogeneity as: h = { 1 if H(C,K) = 0 1?
