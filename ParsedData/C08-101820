sions to the model in (5)also necessitate changes in the training proce dure.
			Recall that training the basic model of Cohn and Lapata (2007) requires finding the maximiserof H(y) in (3).
			Their model uses a chart-based al gorithm for this purpose.
			As in decoding we also use a beam search for training, thereby avoiding the exponential time complexity of exact search.The beam search requires an estimate of the qual ity for incomplete derivations.
			We use the margin rescaling objective, H m in (3), and approximatethe loss using the current (incomplete) loss param eter values in each chart cell.
			We use a wide beam of 200 unique items or 500 items in total to reduce the impact of the approximation.
			Our loss functions are tailored to the task anddraw inspiration from metrics developed for ex tractive compression but also for summarisation and machine translation.
			They are based on the Hamming distance over unordered bags of items.
			This measures the number of predicted items that did not appear
