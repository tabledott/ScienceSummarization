A rather different approach to language understanding, which contains a substantial sense discrimination component, is the Word Expert Parser (Small 1980, 1983; Small and Reiger 1982; Adriaens 1986, 1987, 1989; Adriaens and Small 1988).
    The approach derives from the somewhat unconventional theory that human knowledge about language is organized primarily as knowledge about words rather than rules.
    Their system models what its authors feel is the human language understanding process: a co-ordination of information exchange among word experts about syntax and semantics as each determines its involvement in the environment under question.
    Each expert contains a discrimination net for all senses of the word, which is traversed on the basis of information supplied by the context and other word experts, ultimately arriving at a unique sense, which is then added to a semantic representation of the sentence.
    The well-known drawback of the system is that the word experts need to be extremely large and
