put.
    For example, in a communication frame, noun phrases headed by &amp;quot;Bill&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;brother&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; are more likely to be the SpEAKER, while those headed by &amp;quot;proposal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;story&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;question&amp;quot; are more likely to be the Topic.
    To predict argument roles in new data, we wish to estimate the probability of each role given these five features and the predicate p: P(rlpt, path, position, voice, hw, p).
    Due to the sparsity of the data, it is not possible to estimate this probability from the counts in the training.
    Instead, we estimate probabilities from various subsets of the features, and interpolate a linear combination of the resulting distributions.
    The interpolation is performed over the most specific distributions for which data are available, which can be thought of as choosing the topmost distributions available from a backoff lattice, shown in We applied the same system, using the same f
