te the algorithm with an example.
    Suppose the scene graph G is as given in Figure 3 and that we want to generate a referring expression for object d1 Sketch of the main function (makeReferringExpression) and the subgraph construction function (findGraph). in this graph.
    Let us assume for the sake of illustration that the cost function is defined in such a way that adding a vertex or an edge always costs one point.
    Thus, for each v E VH and for each e E EH: cost(v) = cost(e) = 1.
    (In the next section we describe a number of more interesting cost functions and discuss the impact these have on the output of the algorithm.)
    We call the function makeReferringExpression (given in Figure 6) with d1 as parameter.
    In this function the variable bestGraph (for the best solution found up to that point) is initialized as the null graph (there is no best solution yet), and the variable H (for the distinguishing subgraph under construction) is initialized as the graph containing only vertex d1 (i.e.,
