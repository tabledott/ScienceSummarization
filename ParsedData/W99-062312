that disagrees with the majority hypothesis instead of the majority hypothesis itself.
    This is the only important case, because otherwise the simple majority combining technique would pick the correct constituent.
    One side of the decision making process is when we choose to believe a constituent should be in the parse, even though only one parser suggests it.
    We call such a constituent an isolated constituent.
    If we were working with more than three parsers we could investigate minority constituents, those constituents that are suggested by at least one parser, but which the majority of the parsers do not suggest.
    Adding the isolated constituents to our hypothesis parse could increase our expected recall, but in the cases we investigated it would invariably hurt our precision more than we would gain on recall.
    Consider for a set of constituents the isolated constituent precision parser metric, the portion of isolated constituents that are correctly hypothesized.
    When this metric is
