le&#8217;s research system in that it runs at faster speeds at the expense of somewhat lower translation quality.
    On the other hand, the training data used by Google is unconstrained, which means that it may have an advantage compared to the research systems evaluated in this workshop, since they were trained using only the provided materials.
    In total, we received 87 primary system submissions along with 42 secondary submissions.
    These were made available to participants in the system combination shared task.
    Based on feedback that we received on last year&#8217;s system combination task, we provided two additional resources to participants: In addition to soliciting system combination entries for each of the language pairs, we treated system combination as a way of doing multi-source translation, following Schroeder et al. (2009).
    For the multi-source system combination task, we provided all 46 primary system submissions from any language into English, along with an additional 32 seconda
