    Given that whether or not an adjective or an adverb is removed does not affect the conciseness of the sentence significantly and the system lacks of reliability in making such decisions, we decide not to remove adjectives and adverbs.
    On average, the system reduced the length of the 500 sentence by 32.7% (based on the number of words), while humans reduced it by 41.8%.
    The probabilities we computed from the training corpus covered 58% of instances in the test corpus.
    When the corpus probability is absent for a case, the system makes decisions based on the other two sources of knowledge.
    Some of the errors made by the system result from the errors by the syntactic parser.
    We randomly checked 50 sentences, and found that 8% of th
