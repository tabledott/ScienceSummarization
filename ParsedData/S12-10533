n problem, where judgments about semantic equivalence and novelty depend on the possibility to fully or partially translate a text fragment into the other.
    The recent advances on monolingual TE on the one hand, and the methodologies used in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) on the other, offer promising solutions to approach the CLTE task.
    In line with a number of systems that model the RTE task as a similarity problem (i.e. handling similarity scores between T and H as useful evidence to draw entailment decisions), the standard sentence and word alignment programs used in SMT offer a strong baseline for CLTE.
    However, although representing a solid starting point to approach the problem, similarity-based techniques are just approximations, open to significant improvements coming from semantic inference at the multilingual level (e.g. cross-lingual entailment rules such as &#8220;perro&#8221;&#8594;&#8220;animal&#8221;).
    Taken in isolation, similaritybased techniques clearly fall short of p
