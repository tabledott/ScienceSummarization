	Long-Distance Dependency Resolution In Automatically Acquired Wide-Coverage PCFG-Based LFG Approximations
		This paper shows how finite approximations of long distance dependency (LDD) resolution can be obtained automatically for wide-coverage, robust, probabilistic Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) resources acquired from treebanks.
		We extract LFG subcategorisation frames and paths linking LDDreentrancies from f-structures generated automati cally for the Penn-II treebank trees and use them in an LDD resolution algorithm to parse new text.Unlike (Collins, 1999; Johnson, 2002), in our ap proach resolution of LDDs is done at f-structure (attribute-value structure representations of basicpredicate-argument or dependency structure) with out empty productions, traces and coindexation in CFG parse trees.
		Currently our best automaticallyinduced grammars achieve 80.97% f-score for f structures parsing section 23 of the WSJ part of the Penn-II treebank and evaluating against the DCU1051 and 80.24% against the PA
