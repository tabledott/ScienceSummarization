we use Model 2 as the starting point, we observe a significant improvement when we use the neighborhood alignments and the pegged alignments.
    If we use only the Viterbi alignment, the results are significantly worse than using additionally the neighborhood of the Viterbi alignment.
    If we use HMM as the starting point, we observe a much smaller effect.
    We conclude that using more alignments in training is a way to avoid a poor local optimum.
    Table 8 shows the computing time for performing one iteration of the EM algorithm.
    Using a larger set of alignments increases the training time for Model 4 and Model 5 significantly.
    Since using the pegging alignments yields only a moderate improvement in performance, all following results are obtained by using the neighborhood of the Viterbi alignment without pegging.
    Tables 9 and 10 show the effect on the alignment error rate of smoothing the alignment and fertility probabilities.
    We observe a significant improvement when we smooth the ali
