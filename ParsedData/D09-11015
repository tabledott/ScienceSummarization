ference data sets, cluster rankers outperform three competing models &#8212; mention-pair, entitymention, and mention-ranking models &#8212; by a large margin.
    Also, our joint-learning approach to discourse-new detection and coreference resolution consistently yields cluster rankers that outperform those adopting the pipeline architecture.
    Equally importantly, cluster rankers are conceptually simple and easy to implement and do not rely on sophisticated training and inference procedures to make coreference decisions in dependent relation to each other, unlike relational coreference models (see McCallum and Wellner (2004)).
    Bridging the gap between machine-learning approaches and linguistically-motivated approaches to coreference resolution.
    While machine learning approaches to coreference resolution have received a lot of attention since the mid90s, popular learning-based coreference frameworks such as the mention-pair model are arguably rather unsatisfactory from a linguistic point of view.
