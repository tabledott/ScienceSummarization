ion to sentence length, binned into ten-word intervals (1&#8211;10, 11-20, etc.).
    As expected, Malt and MST have very similar accuracy for short sentences but Malt degrades more rapidly with increasing sentence length because of error propagation (McDonald and Nivre, 2007).
    The guided models, MaltMST and MSTMalt, behave in a very similar fashion with respect to each other but both outperform their base parser over the entire range of sentence lengths.
    However, except for the two extreme data points (0&#8211;10 and 51&#8211;60) there is also a slight tendency for MaltMST to improve more for longer sentences and for MSTMalt to improve more for short sentences, which indicates that the feature-based integration allows one parser to exploit the strength of the other.
    Figure 3(a) plots precision (top) and recall (bottom) for dependency arcs of different lengths (predicted arcs for precision, gold standard arcs for recall).
    With respect to recall, the guided models appear to have a slight advant
