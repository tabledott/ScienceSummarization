nce of arcs, starting from the initial state of D and labeled with an element S of H x p, which is terminated with a weighted arc labeled with an element of e x P. The weight represents the estimated cost (negative log probability) of the word.
    Next, we represent the input sentence as an unweighted finite-state acceptor (FSA) I over H. Let us assume the existence of a function Id, which takes as input an FSA A, and produces as output a transducer that maps all and only the strings of symbols accepted by A to themselves (Kaplan and Kay 1994).
    We can then define the best segmentation to be the cheapest or best path in Id(I) o D* (i.e., Id(I) composed with the transitive closure of D).6 Consider the abstract example illustrated in Figure 2.
    In this example there are four &amp;quot;input characters,&amp;quot; A, B, C and D, and these map respectively to four &amp;quot;pronunciations&amp;quot; a, b, c and d. Furthermore, there are four &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; represented in the dictionary.
    These
