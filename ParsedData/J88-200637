    I assume that in response to recognizing this kind of embedded narrative, the listener creates a new node of E/S structure and shifts TF there, caching the previous value of TF for possible resumption later.
    The temporal location of this new node vis-a-vis the previous TF will depend on information in the tensed clause and on the listener's world knowledge.
