ioning on the type of n and the position of the child &#966;n(n).
    We continue to PUSH until reaching a leaf.
    This process is a first-degree Markov walk through the tree, conditioning on the current node The jobs are career oriented . sitions implied by the unique shortest path from the word oriented (aj_ = 5) to the word the (aj = 1). and its immediate surroundings at each step.
    We enforce the property that &#961;(aj_,aj,t) be unique by staging the process and disallowing zero distance moves in stage 2.
    Figure 2 gives an example sequence of tree transitions for a small parse tree.
    The parameterization of this distortion model follows directly from its generative process.
    Given a path &#961;(aj_,aj,t) with r = k + m + 3 nodes including the two leaves, the nearest common ancestor, k intervening nodes on the ascent and m on the descent, we express it as a triple of staged tree transitions that include k POPs, a STOP, a MOVE, and m PUSHes: Next, we assign probabilities to each tree transit
