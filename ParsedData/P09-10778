00; Pitler et al., 2008).
    However, in the absence of explicit markers, the most easily accessible features are the words in the two text spans of the relation.
    Intuitively, one would expect that there is some relationship that holds between the words in the two arguments.
    Consider for example the following sentences: The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the &#8221;closedend fund mania&#8221; of the 1920s, Mr.
    Foot says, when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular.
    They fell into oblivion after the 1929 crash.
    The words &#8220;popular&#8221; and &#8220;oblivion&#8221; are almost antonyms, and one might hypothesize that their occurrence in the two text spans is what triggers the contrast relation between the sentences.
    Similarly, a pair of words such as (rain, rot) might be indicative of a causal relation.
    If this hypothesis is correct, pairs of words (w1, w2) such that w1 appears in the first sentence and w2 appears in the second sentence would be good features for
