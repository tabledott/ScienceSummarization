    We should emphasize that our evaluation is of course per-document and does not reflect cross-document coreference decisions, only the gains through crossdocument sharing (see section 6.2).
  
  
    Up until now, we&#8217;ve discussed Gibbs sampling, but we are not interested in sampling from the posterior P(Z|X), but in finding its mode.
    Instead of sampling directly from the posterior distribution, we instead sample entities proportionally to exponentiated entity posteriors.
    The exponent is given by exp ci k&#8722;1, where i is the current round number (starting at i = 0), c = 1.5 and k = 20 is the total number of sampling epochs.
    This slowly raises the posterior exponent from 1.0 to ec.
    In our experiments, we found this procedure to outperform simulated annealing.
    We also found sampling the T, G, and N variables to be particularly inefficient, so instead we maintain soft counts over each of these variables and use these in place of a hard sampling scheme.
    We also foun
