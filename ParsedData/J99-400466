 almost all parsers of interest.
    One parsing algorithm that would seem particularly difficult to describe is Tomita's graph-structured-stack LR parsing algorithm.
    This algorithm at first glance bears little resemblance to other parsing algorithms.
    Despite this lack of similarity, Sikkel (1993) gives an item-based description for a Tomita-style parser for the Boolean semiring, which is also more efficient than Tomita's algorithm.
    Sikkel's parser can be easily converted to our format, where it can be used for w-continuous semirings in general.
    Graham, Harrison, and Ruzzo (1980) describe a parser similar to Earley's, but with several speedups that lead to significant improvements.
    Essentially, there are three improvements in the GHR parser.
    First, epsilon productions are precomputed; second, unary productions are precomputed; and, finally, completion is separated into two steps, allowing better dynamic programming.
