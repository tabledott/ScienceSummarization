ing in less than 0.5% of the training set sen tences do not constitute a feature.
			ASCII smileys and other punctuation sequences containing two or more consecutive punctuation symbols were used as single-word features.
			Word features alsoinclude the substituted meta-words for URLs, ref erences and hashtags (see Subsection 4.1).
			3.1.2 Pattern-based featuresOur main feature type is based on surface pat terns.
			For automated extraction of patterns, we followed the pattern definitions given in (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006).
			We classified words into high-frequency words (HFWs) and content words (CWs).
			A word whose corpus frequency is more (less) than FH (FC) is considered to be a HFW(CW).We estimate word frequency from the train ing set rather than from an external corpus.
			Unlike (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006), we consider allsingle punctuation characters or consecutive se quences of punctuation characters as HFWs.
			We also consider URL, REF, and HASHTAG tags as HFWs for pattern extraction.
