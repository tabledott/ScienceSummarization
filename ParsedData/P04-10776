ere performers to measuring fluency.
    However, they have the advantage that we can apthem on sentence level while longer would not differentiate any sentences with length shorter than 12 words (i.e. no 12-gram matches).
    We plan to explore their correlation with human judgments on sentence-level in the future.
    We also confirmed empirically that adequacy and fluency focused on different aspects of machine translations.
    Adequacy placed more emphasis on terms co-occurred in candidate and reference translations as shown in the higher correlations in Stem set than Case set in Table 1; while the reverse was true in the terms of fluency.
    The evaluation results of ROUGE-L, ROUGE- W, and ROUGE-S in machine translation evaluation are very encouraging.
    However, these measures in their current forms are still only applying string-to-string matching.
    We have shown that better correlation with adequacy can be reached by applying stemmer.
    In the next step, we plan to extend them to accommodate
