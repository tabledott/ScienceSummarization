e model only in that the first cluster has been split into two, the recall score abruptly falls to 50%.
    In order to provide empirical evidence in addition to the theoretical discussion above, and be able to estimate an upper bound on the values of the evaluation metrics, we evaluated each human model against all the other human models, using the same evaluation method which was used for the system; the results ranged from 38 to 72% for recall, 1 to 12% for fallout, 38 to 81% for precision, and, covering a remarkably short range, 49 to 59% for F-measure7, indicating that the performance of the system is not far behind human performance.
    In order to provide a lower bound for the evaluation metrics and thus show that the system's scores are not close to the scores of the human judges simply by chance, we performed a Monte Carlo analysis (Rubinstein, 1981) for the evaluation metrics, by repeatedly creating random partitions of the sample adjectives and evaluating the results.
    Then we estimated a smoot
