ermining features that better discriminate unaccusative and object-drop verbs.
    One potential explanation that we can exclude is that the pattern of results is due simply to the frequencies of the verbs-that is, that more frequent verbs are more accurately classified.
    We examined the relation between classification accuracy and log 8 For all previous results, we reported an accuracy measure (the percentage of correct classifications out of all classifications).
    Using the terminology of true or false positives/negatives, this is the same as truePositives/(truePositives falseNegatives).
    In the earlier results, there are no falsePositives or trueNegatives, since we are only considering for each verb whether it is correctly classified (truePositive) or not (falseNegative).
    However, when we turn to analyzing the data for each class, the possibility arises of having falsePositives and trueNegatives for that class.
    Hence, here we use the balanced F score, which calculates an overall measure of
