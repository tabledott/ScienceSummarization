his strategy is certainly simple-minded but, as noted earlier, it achieves an accuracy of 43%.
    In the present system, a statistical parser is used (see (Charniak, 1997)) simply as a tagger.
    This apparent parser overkill is a control to ensure that the part-of-speech tags assigned to words are the same when we use the previous noun heuristic and the Hobbs algorithm, to which we wish to compare the previous noun method.
    In fact, the only part-of-speech tags necessary are those indicating nouns and pronouns.
    Obviously a much superior strategy would be to apply the anaphora-resolution strategy from previous sections to finding putative referents.
    However, we chose to use only the Hobbs distance portion thereof.
    We do not use the &amp;quot;mention&amp;quot; probabilities P(alma), as they are not given in the unmarked text.
    Nor do we use the gender/animiticity information gathered from the much smaller hand-marked text, both because we were interested in seeing what unsupervised learning
