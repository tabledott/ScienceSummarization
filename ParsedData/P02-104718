ed industrial production fell in Jan- (4) uary 3.4% from a year earlier but rose 0.4% from December, the government said We repeated the experiment we carried out in conjunction with the Raw corpus on the data derived from the BLIPP corpus as well.
    Table 4 summarizes the results.
    Overall, the performance of the systems trained on the most representative word pairs in the BLIPP corpus is clearly lower than the performance of the systems trained on all the word pairs in the Raw corpus.
    But a direct comparison between two classifiers trained on different corpora is not fair because with just 100,000 examples per relation, the systems trained on the Raw corpus are much worse than those trained on the BLIPP data.
    The learning curves in Figure 1 are illuminating as they show that if one uses as features only the most representative word pairs, one needs only about 100,000 training examples to achieve the same level of performance one achieves using 1,000,000 training examples and features defined ov
