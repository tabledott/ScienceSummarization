 et al. (2009) with randomly generated scores on automata transitions.
    We again recover exact solutions more often than the Martins et al. relaxations.
    Note that with random parameters the percentage of exact solutions is significantly lower, suggesting that the exactness of decoding of the trained models is a special case.
    We speculate that this is due to the high performance of approximate decoding with i in place of Y under the trained models for fi; the training algorithm described in section 6 may have the tendency to make the LP relaxation tight.
    % of Head Automata Recomputed the Martins et al. (2009) method, presumably because it leverages the underlying structure of the problem, rather than using a generic solver.
    Here we describe an important optimization in the dual decomposition algorithms.
    Consider the algorithm in Figure 1.
    At each iteration we must find gram.
