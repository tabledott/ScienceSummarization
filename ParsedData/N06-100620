reversed by negative polarity markers (The gangster managed to escape |= The gangster escaped while The gangster didn&#8217;t manage to escape 6|= The gangster escaped).
    To capture these phenomena, we compiled small lists of &#8220;factive&#8221; and non-factive verbs, clustered according to the kinds of entailments they create.
    We then determine to which class the parent of the text aligned with the hypothesis root belongs to.
    If the parent is not in the list, we only check whether the embedding text is an affirmative context or a negative one.
    Quantifier features.
    These features are designed to capture entailment relations among simple sentences involving quantification, such as Every company must report |= A company must report (or The company, or IBM).
    No attempt is made to handle multiple quantifiers or scope ambiguities.
    Each quantifier found in an aligned pair of text/hypothesis words is mapped into one of five quantifier categories: no, some, many, most, and all.
    The no
