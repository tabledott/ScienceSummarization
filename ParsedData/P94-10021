technical texts by headings and subheadings which divide the text into coherent segments; Brown &amp; Yule (1983:140) state that this kind of division is one of the most basic in discourse.
    However, many expository texts consist of long sequences of paragraphs with very little structural demarcation.
    This paper presents fully-implemented algorithms that use lexical cohesion relations to partition expository texts into multi-paragraph segments that reflect their subtopic structure.
    Because the model of discourse structure is one in which text is partitioned into contiguous, nonoverlapping blocks, I call the general approach TextTiling.
    The ultimate goal is to not only identify the extents of the subtopical units, but to label their contents as well.
    This paper focusses only on the discovery of subtopic structure, leaving determination of subtopic content to future work.
    Most discourse segmentation work is done at a finer granularity than that suggested here.
    However, for lengthy wri
