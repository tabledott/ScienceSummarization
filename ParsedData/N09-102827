a hierarchical phrase-based system can extract better rules and hence achievesbetter translation quality.
    We also point out that hierarchical phrase-based systems require a chart parsing algorithm during decoding.
    Compared to the efficient dynamic programming in phrase-based systems, it is much slower.
    This makes our approach more appealing in a realtime statistical machine translation system.
  
  
    In this paper, we present a novel precedence reordering approach based on a dependency parser.
    We successfully applied this approach to systems translating English to 5 SOV languages: Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Urdu and Turkish.
    For all 5 languages, we achieve statistically significant improvements in BLEU scores over a state-of-the-art phrasebased baseline system.
    The amount of training data for the 5 languages varies from around 17M to more than 350M words, including some noisy data from the web.
    Our proposed approach has shown to be robust and versatile.
