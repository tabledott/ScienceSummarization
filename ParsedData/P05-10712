aluation (that we are aware of), (Diab et al., 2004), does not use a morphological analyzer.
    In this paper, we show that the use of a morphological analyzer outperforms other tagging methods for Arabic; to our knowledge, we present the best-performing wide-coverage tokenizer on naturally occurring input and the bestperforming morphological tagger for Arabic.
  
  
    Arabic words are often ambiguous in their morphological analysis.
    This is due to Arabic&#8217;s rich system of affixation and clitics and the omission of disambiguating short vowels and other orthographic diacritics in standard orthography (&#8220;undiacritized orthography&#8221;).
    On average, a word form in the ATB has about 2 morphological analyses.
    An example of a word with some of its possible analyses is shown in Figure 1.
    Analyses 1 and 4 are both nouns.
    They differ in that the first noun has no affixes, while the second noun has a conjunction prefix (+ +w &#8216;and&#8217;) and a pronominal possessive suffix ( + +y
