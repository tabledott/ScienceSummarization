tically related verb is more likely to yield another VNIC, as in keep/lose one&#8217;s cool (Nunberg et al., 1994).
    Let be the set of the most similar nouns to the noun of the target pair .
    We calculate the association strength for the target pair, and for each of its variants, , using pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Church et al., 1991): where and is the target noun; is the set of all transitive verbs in the corpus; is the set of all nouns appearing as the direct object of some verb; is the frequency of and occurring as a verb&#8211;object pair; is the total frequency of the target verb with any noun in ; is the total frequency of the noun in the direct object position of any verb in .
    Lin (1999) assumes that a target expression is non-compositional if and only if its value is significantly different from that of any of the variants.
    Instead, we propose a novel technique that brings together the association strengths ( values) of the target and the variant expressions into a single measur
