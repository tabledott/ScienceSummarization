Li and Abe [1996]) is how the accuracy of class-based estimation techniques compare when automatically acquired classes, as opposed to the manually created classes from WordNet, are used.
    The pseudo-disambiguation task described here has also been used to evaluate clustering algorithms (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, 1993; Rooth et al., 1999), but with different data, and so it is difficult to compare the results.
    A related issue is how the structure of WordNet affects the accuracy of the probability estimates.
    We have taken the structure of the hierarchy for granted, without any analysis, but it may be that an alternative design could be more conducive to probability estimation.
