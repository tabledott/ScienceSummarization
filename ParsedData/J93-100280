ion, which has 20 parses of which the most highly ranked is correct.
    Parse tree for a person or thing that supports or helps.
    Figure 13 shows the highest-ranked analysis assigned to one definition of aid.
    This is an example of a false positive which, in this case, is caused by the lack of a lexical entry for support as an intransitive verb.
    Consequently, the parser finds, and ranks highest, an analysis in which supports and helps are treated as transitive verbs forming verb phrases with object NP gaps, and that supports or helps as a zero relative clause with that analyzed as a prenominal subject&#8212;compare a person or thing that that supports or helps.
    It is difficult to fault this analysis and the same is true for the other false positives we have looked at.
    Such false positives present the biggest challenge to the type of system we are attempting to develop.
    One hopeful sign is that the analyses assigned such examples appear to have low probabilities relative to most probable
