nts whole frame accuracy.
    All differences in ALL arguments F-Measure are statistically significant according to a paired Wilcoxon signed rank test.
    JOINTLOCAL is significantly better than LOCAL (p &lt; .001), LABELSEQ is significantly better than JOINTLOCAL (p &lt; .001), and ALLJOINT is significantly better than LABELSEQ (p &lt; .001).
    We performed the Wilcoxon signed rank test on per-proposition ALL arguments F-Measure for all models.
    We also note that the joint models have fewer features than the local model.
    This is due to the fact that the local model has seen many more negative examples and therefore more unique features.
    The joint features are not very numerous compared to the local features in the joint models.
    The ALLJOINT model has around 30% more features than the JOINTLOCAL model.
    These experiments showed that the label sequence features were very useful, especially on CORE arguments, increasing the F-Measure on these arguments by two points when added to the JOINTL
