 grammar matrix, discuss the interaction of basic construction types and semantic composition in unification grammars by means of a detailed example, and consider extensions to the core inventory that we foresee and an evaluation methodology for the matrix proper.
  
  
    We have produced a preliminary version of the grammar matrix relying heavily on the LinGO project&#8217;s English Resource Grammar, and to a lesser extent on the Japanese grammar developed jointly between DFKI Saarbr&#168;ucken (Germany) and YY Technologies (Mountain View, CA).
    This early version of the matrix comprises the following comIncluded with the matrix are configuration and parameter files for the LKB grammar engineering environment (Copestake, 2002).
    Although small, this preliminary version of the matrix already reflects the main goals of the project: (i) Consistent with other work in HPSG, semantic representations and in particular the syntax-semantics interface are developed in detail; (ii) the types of the matrix are e
