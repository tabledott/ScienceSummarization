ture values.
    Regarding the last four features, we measured the similarity between sentences the same way as we did with phrases in section 3.
    Note that this is the cosine of the angle between senVeci1 and senVeci2.
    This enables us to observe the similarity or dissimilarity of two sentences independent of their sentence length.
    Even though each contained word increases or decreases the norm of the resulting sentence vector, this does not distort the overall similarity value, due to normalization.
    The lengths of Seni1 and Seni2 are simply the number of words they contain.
    The unigram overlap feature value may be viewed as the cardinality of the intersection of each sentence&#8217;s multisetbag-of-words.
    The latter is encoded in the alreadyintroduced wdCount vectors.
    Therefore, In order to establish which features work best for each representation and composition method, we exhaustively explored all combinations on a development set (20% of the original MSRPC training set).
