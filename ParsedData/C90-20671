 in the system's lexicon, together with restriction mechanisms such as case role selection.
			However, it is often impractical to manually encode such information, especially for generalized text where the variety and meaning of words is potentially unrestricted.
			Furthermore, restriction mechanisms usually operate within a single sentence~ and thus the broader context cannot assist in the disambiguation process.
			in this paper, we describe a means tor automatically building Very Large Neural Networks (VLNNs) from definition texts in machine-readable dictionaries, and denmnstrate he use of these networks for WSD.
			Our method brings together two earlier, independent approaches to WSD: the use of machine-readable dictionaries and spreading and activation models.
			The automatic onstruction of VLNNs enables real-size experiments with neural networks, which in turn The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of St~phanc tlari6 and Gavin Huntlcy to the work presented in this paper.
