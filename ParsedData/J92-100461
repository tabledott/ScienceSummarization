e, it creates a blank frame and inserts it into a &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; slot in the frame that was handed to it.
    It passes the blank frame to its children, who will then fill it appropriately, labeling it as a QSET or as a REFERENCE.
    It then passes along to the right sibling the same frame that was handed to it from above, with the completed topic slot filled with the information delivered by the children.
    The raw frame that is realized through the treewalk is post-processed to simplify some of the structure, as well as to augment or interpret expressions such as relative time.
    For example, the predicate modifier in &amp;quot;flights leaving at ten a.m.&amp;quot; is simplified from a predicate leave to a modifier slot labeled departure-time.
    An expression such as &amp;quot;next Tuesday&amp;quot; is interpreted relative to today's date to fill in an actual month, date, and year.
    Following this post-analysis step, the frame is merged with references contained in a history record, to
