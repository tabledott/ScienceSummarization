ation with 82% accuracy.
    We then classified several sets of adjectives according to the links inferred in this way and labeled them as positive or negative, obtaining 92% accuracy on the classification task for reasonably dense graphs and 100% accuracy on the labeling task.
    Simulation experiments establish that very high levels of performance can be obtained with a modest number of links per word, even when the links themselves are not always correctly classified.
    As part of our clustering algorithm's output, a &amp;quot;goodness-of-fit&amp;quot; measure for each word is computed, based on Rousseeuw's (1987) silhouettes.
    This measure ranks the words according to how well they fit in their group, and can thus be used as a quantitative measure of orientation, refining the binary positive&#8212;negative distinction.
    By restricting the labeling decisions to words with high values of this measure we can also increase the precision of our system, at the cost of sacrificing some coverage.
