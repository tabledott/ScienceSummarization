 such as reports and descriptions - requires domain-specific knowledge about how to communicate in that domain.
    That knowledge we call &amp;quot;domain communication knowledge&amp;quot; (DCK).
    For example, in describing secure system designs 3Incrementality within the realizer has little practical benefit when the realizer is reasonably fast; its study is mainly motivated by psycholinguistic considerations.
    Therefore, there was no attempt in Joyce to make the realizer incremental. you must relate the security level of each component, but not, say, the number of ports or their security levels.
    Furthermore, the connectivity of components should be stated before their functionality.
    In the flow analyzer text, the security levels of the components need not be communicated at all, but if a component (other than the final component of the path) downgrades information, it must be stated whether and why the component is secure.
    This very precise knowledge about which domain information needs t
