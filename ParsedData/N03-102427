    More experiments need to be carried out in order to assess extrinsically whether the FSAs we produce can be used to yield higher agreement scores between human and automatic assessments of translation quality.
    In our future work, we wish to experiment with more flexible merging algorithms and to integrate better the top-down and bottom-up processes that are used to induce FSAs.
    We also wish to extract more abstract paraphrase patterns from the current representation.
    Such patterns are more likely to get reused &#8211; which would help us get reliable statistics for them in the extraction phase, and also have a better chance of being applicable to unseen data.
