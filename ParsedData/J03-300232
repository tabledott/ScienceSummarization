distance threshold, and matching of non-one-word to one-word entries in the dictionary.
    An example of two texts with links shown.
    There are seven link tokens, five of which are lexical (non-NULL) in X (the English side), six in Y (French).
  
  
    The approach discussed thus far relies heavily on document structure.
    However, as Ma and Liberman (1999) point out, not all translators create translated pages that look like the original page.
    Moreover, structure-based matching is applicable only in corpora that include markup, and there are certainly multilingual collections on the Web and elsewhere that contain parallel text without structural tags.
    Finally, other applications for translation detection exist, such as subdocument text alignment and cross-lingual duplicate detection (i.e., location of already-existing translations in a multilingual corpus).
    All these considerations motivate an approach to matching translations that pays attention to similarity of content, whether or not si
