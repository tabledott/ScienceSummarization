r training and test data.
    Based on the features used by our system and without bias towards any modification, we modified each script in one of the following ways: ii.
    Swap words that have the same PoS within a sentence Although the above modifications do not exhaust the potential challenges a deployed AA system might face, they represent a threat to the validity of our system since we are using a highly related feature set.
    In total, we create 30 such &#8216;outlier&#8217; texts, which were given to an ESOL examiner for marking.
    Using the &#8216;outlier&#8217; scripts as well as their original/unmodified versions, we ran our system on each modification separately and calculated the correlation between the predicted values and the examiner&#8217;s scores.
    Table 6 presents the results.
    The predicted values of the system have a high correlation with the examiner&#8217;s scores when tested on &#8216;outlier&#8217; texts of modification types i(a), i(b) and i(c).
    However, as i(c) has a
