en making use of relatively large amounts of parallel text, text such as the Canadian Hansards, which are available in multiple languages.
  The translation can often be used in lieu of hand-labeling.
  For example, con- sider the polysemous word sentence, which has two ma- jor senses: (1) a judicial sentence, and (2), a syntactic sentence.
  We can collect a number of sense (1) examples by extracting instances that are translated as peine, and we can collect a number of sense (2) examples by extract- ing instances that are translated as phrase.
  In this way, we have been able to acquire a considerable amount of testing and training material for developing and testing our disambiguation algorithms.
  The use of bilingual materials for discrimination deci- sions in machine tranlation has been discussed by Brown and others (1991), and by Dagan, Itai, and Schwall (1991).
  The use of bilingual materials for an essentially monolingual purpose, sense disambiguation, is similar in method, but differs in purpose.
