t this point we have a preliminary clustering &#8212; no very rare words will be included, and some common words will also not be assigned, because they are ambiguous or have idiosyncratic distributional properties.
  
  
    Ambiguity can be handled naturally within this framework.
    The context distribution p(w) of a particular ambiguous word w can be modelled as a linear combination of the context distributions of the various clusters.
    We can find the mixing coefficients by minimising efficients that sum to unity and the qi are the context distributions of the clusters.
    A minimum of this function can be found using the EM algorithm(Dempster et al., 1977).
    There are often several local minima &#8212; in practice this does not seem to be a major problem.
    Note that with rare words, the KL divergence reduces to the log likelihood of the word's context distribution plus a constant factor.
    However, the observed context distributions of rare words may be insufficient to make a definite deter
