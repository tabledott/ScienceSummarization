our expectations concerning their frequency of use.
    We hypothesize that these five features will exhibit distributional differences in the observed usages of the verbs that can be used for classification.
    In the next section, we describe the actual corpus counts that we develop to approximate the features we have identified.
    (Notice that the counts will be imperfect approximations to the thematic knowledge, beyond the inevitable errors due to automatic extraction from large automatically annotated corpora.
    Even when the counts are precise, they only constitute an approximation to the actual thematic notions, since the features we are using are not logically implied by the knowledge we want to capture, but only statistically correlated.)
    Clearly, some of the features we've proposed are difficult (e.g., the passive use) or impossible (e.g., animate subject use) to automatically extract with high accuracy from a 2 For our sample verbs, the statistical correlation between the transitive and pa
