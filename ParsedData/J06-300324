998) tried a corpus-based approach that explicitly used a measure of relational similarity, but their measure was based on literal matching, which limited its ability to generalize.
    Moldovan et al. (2004) also used a measure of relational similarity based on mapping each noun and modifier into semantic classes in WordNet.
    The noun-modifier pairs were taken from a corpus, and the surrounding context in the corpus was used in a word sense disambiguation algorithm to improve the mapping of the noun and modifier into WordNet.
    Turney and Littman (2005) used the VSM (as a component in a single nearest neighbor learning algorithm) to measure relational similarity.
    We take the same approach here, substituting LRA for the VSM, in Section 7.
    Lauer (1995) used a corpus-based approach (using the BNC) to paraphrase noun&#8211; modifier pairs by inserting the prepositions of, for, in, at, on, from, with, and about.
    For example, reptile haven was paraphrased as haven for reptiles.
