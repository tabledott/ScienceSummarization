 cues.
    All of the facet level assignments are significantly better than a baseline of always choosing the most frequent level (Table 1). and the performance appears even better when one considers that the machines do not actually know what the most frequent level is.
    When one takes a closer look at the performance of the component machines, it is clear that some facet levels are detected better than others.
    Table 2 shows that within the facet GENRE, our systems do a particularly good job on REPORTAGE and FICTION, trend correctly but not necessarily significantly for SCITECH and NONFICTION, but perform less well for EDITORIAL and LEGAL texts.
    We suspect that the indifferent performance in SCITECH and LEGAL texts may simply reflect the fact that these genre levels are fairly infrequent in the Brown corpus and hence in our training set.
    Table 3 sheds some light on the other cases.
    The lower performance on the EDITORIAL and NONFICTION tests stems mostly from misclassifying many NONFICTION
