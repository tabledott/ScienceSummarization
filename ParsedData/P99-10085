 shown in Table 1.
    We assume here that parts and wholes are represented by individual lexical items (more specifically, as head nouns of noun-phrases) as opposed to complete noun phrases, or as a sequence of &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; noun modifiers together with the head.
    This occasionally causes problems, e.g., &amp;quot;conditioner&amp;quot; was marked by our informants as not part of &amp;quot;car&amp;quot;, whereas &amp;quot;air conditioner&amp;quot; probably would have made it into a part list.
    Nevertheless, in most cases head nouns have worked quite well on their own.
    We evaluated these patterns by observing how they performed in an experiment on a single example.
    Table 2 shows the 20 highest ranked part words (with the seed word &amp;quot;car&amp;quot;) for each of the patterns A-E. (We discuss later how the rankings were obtained.)
    Table 2 shows patterns A and B clearly outperform patterns C, D, and E. Although parts occur in all five patterns, the lists for A and B are pre
