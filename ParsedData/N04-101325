s annotated with the argument indicator (-A) as in this example; the -A presumably would be missing in a sentence like John arrived Friday, and Friday would be treated as an ADJUNCT.
    Similarly, NP-As under S are read off as subject.
    In this example, however, this principle of conversion does not lead to a match with the dependency bank: in the DEPBANK grammatical relations that are factored out of conjoined structures are distributed back into those structures, to establish the correct semantic dependencies (in this case, that he is the subject of both reiterate and express and not of the introduced coord).
    We avoided the temptation of building coordinate distribution into the conversion routine because, first, it is not always obvious from the Model 3 output when distribution should take place, and second, that would be a first step towards building into the conversion routine the deep lexical and syntactic knowledge (essentially the functional component of our LFG grammar) that the shallow appro
