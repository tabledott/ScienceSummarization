all &#8211; consequently, the two types of bias are not likely to have significant impact on their system&#8217;s performance.
  
  
    We have presented a new approach to relation extraction that leverages the vast amount of information available on the web.

    Experimental results demonstrate that the new approach can reliably extract relations from web documents.
