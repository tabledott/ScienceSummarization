the correct MR. For GEOQUERY, an output MR is considered correct if and only if the resulting query retrieves the same answer as the correct MR when submitted to the database.
			Performance was measured in terms of precision(the percentage of generated MRs that were cor rect) and recall (the percentage of all sentences for which correct MRs were obtained).
			In our experiments, the threshold ? was fixedto 0.05 and the beam size ? was 20.
			These pa rameters were found through pilot experiments.The maximum number of iterations (MAX ITR) re quired was only 3, beyond this we found that the system only overfits the training corpus.
			We compared our system?s performance with the following existing systems: the string and tree versions of SILT (Kate et al, 2005), a system that learns transformation rules relating NL phrases to MRL expressions; WASP (Wong and Mooney, 2006), a system that learns transformation rules using statistical machine translation techniques; SCISSOR (Ge and Mooney, 2005), a system that le
