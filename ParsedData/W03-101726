    Our work so far has focused on characterizing opinions and facts in a generic manner, without examining who the opinion holder is or what the opinion is about.
    While we have found presenting information organized in separate opinion and fact classes useful, our goal is to introduce further analysis of each sentence so that opinion sentences can be linked to particular perspectives on a specific subject.
    We intend to cluster together sentences from the same perspective and present them in summary form as answers to subjective questions.
