 (ABBREVIATION, ENTITY,DESCRIPTION, HUMAN, LOCATION and NU MERIC VALUE) and 50 fine classes, Table 1 showsthe distribution of these classes in the 500 ques tions of TREC 10.
			Each coarse class contains anon-overlapping set of fine classes.
			The motiva tion behind adding a level of coarse classes is that of compatibility with previous work?s definitions, andcomprehensibility.
			We also hoped that a hierarchi cal classifier would have a performance advantage over a multi-class classifier; this point, however is not fully supported by our experiments.
