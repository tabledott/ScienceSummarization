uce and Wiebe (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994).
    LEXAS achieves a mean accuracy of 87.4% on this data set, which is higher than the accuracy of 78% reported in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994).
    Moreover, to test the scalability of LEXAS, we have acquired a corpus in which 192,800 word occurrences have been manually tagged with senses from WORDNET, which is a public domain lexical database containing about 95,000 word forms and 70,000 lexical concepts (Miller, 1990).
    These sense tagged word occurrences consist of 191 most frequently occurring and most ambiguous nouns and verbs.
    When tested on this large data set, LEXAS performs better than the default strategy of picking the most frequent sense.
    To our knowledge, this is the first time that a WSD program has been tested on such a large scale, and yielding results better than the most frequent heuristic on highly ambiguous words with the refined sense distinctions of WORDNET.
  
  
    The input to a WSD program consists of unrestricted, real-world English sen
