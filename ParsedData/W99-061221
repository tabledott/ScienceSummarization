;quot; (meaning &amp;quot;goes&amp;quot;) and the distribution for &amp;quot;niariana#&amp;quot; has now been identified with the dominant &amp;quot;first name&amp;quot;, then x units from the &amp;quot;questionable&amp;quot; mass can be moved to &amp;quot;first name&amp;quot; mass along the path of &amp;quot;merge#&amp;quot; in the right context trie.
    If semi-dominants are used instead of dominants then we have to account for the fact that the semi-dominants may change over time, so the probability mass must be moved either from &amp;quot;questionable&amp;quot; position or previous semi-dominant position, if a semi-dominant state has been reached before.
    It may be easily observed that stage 2 has a sequential characteristic, because the updating is done after reading each name incrementally.
    When using dominants the order does not affect the process, because of the fact that once a dominant state is reached, it cannot change to another dominant state in the future (probability mass is moved only
