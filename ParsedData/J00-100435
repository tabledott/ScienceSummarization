 from being able to do without artificial intermediate representations of meaning; we do not require the development of semantic mapping rules (or indeed any rules) or the creation of a corpus including semantic annotations.
    Compared with left-to-right transduction, middle-out transduction also aids robustness because, when complete derivations are not available, partial derivations tend to have meaningful headwords.
    At the same time, we believe our method has advantages over the approach developed initially at IBM (Brown et al. 1990; Brown et al.
    1993) for training translation systems automatically.
    One advantage is that our method attempts to model the natural decomposition of sentences into phrases.
    Another is that the compilation of this decomposition into lexically anchored finite-state head transducers produces implementations that are much more efficient than those for the IBM model.
    In particular, our search algorithm finds optimal transductions of test sentences in less than &
