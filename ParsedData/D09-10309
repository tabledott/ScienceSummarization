ankings correlate with expert rankings.
    An upper bound is indicated by the expert-expert bar.
    This was created using a five-fold cross validation where we used 20% of the expert judgments to rank the systems and measured the correlation against the rankings produced by the other 80% of the judgments.
    This gave a &#961; of 0.78.
    All ways of combining the non-expert judgments resulted in nearly identical correlation, and all produced correlation within the range of with what we would experts to.
    The rankings produced using Mechanical Turk had a much stronger correlation with the WMT08 expert rankings than the Blue score did.
    It should be noted that the WMT08 data set does not have multiple reference translations.
    If multiple references were used that Bleu would likely have stronger correlation.
    However, it is clear that the cost of hiring professional translators to create multiple references for the 2000 sentence test set would be much greater than the $10 cost of collecting man
