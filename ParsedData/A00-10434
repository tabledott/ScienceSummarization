also wrote a preprocessor to deal with particular structures that the parser often has problems with, such as appositions.
    The other reason is that parsing errors do not always result in reduction errors.
    For example, given a sentence &amp;quot;The spokesperson of the University said that ...&amp;quot;, although that-clause in the sentence may have a complicated structure and the parser gets it wrong, the reduction system is not necessarily affected since it may decide in this case to keep that-clause as it is, as humans often do, so the parsing errors will not matter in this example.
    4 Discussion and related work The reduction algorithm we present assumes generic summarization; that is, we want to generate a summary that includes the most important information in an article.
    We can tailor the reduction system to queries-based summarization.
    In that case, the task of the reduction is not to remove phrases that are extraneous in terms of the main topic of an article, but phrases that are no
