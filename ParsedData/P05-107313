er vector W, with one weight for each of the s dimensions of the feature vector.
    The probability (or score) of an assignment L according to this re-ranking model is defined as: The score of an assignment L not in the top N is zero.
    We train the model to maximize the sum of log-likelihoods of the best assignments minus a quadratic regularization term.
    In this framework, we can define arbitrary features of labeled trees that capture general properties of predicate-argument structure.
    We will introduce the features of the joint reranking model in the context of the example parse tree shown in Figure 1.
    We model dependencies not only between the label of a node and the labels of other nodes, but also dependencies between the label of a node and input features of other argument nodes.
    The features are specified by instantiation of templates and the value of a feature is the number of times a particular pattern occurs in the labeled tree.
