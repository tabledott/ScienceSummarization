-based parsers) can be outweighed by the disadvantage of a more complex classification problem in pseudo-projective parsing.
    In other words, the larger constant associated with a larger cohort of SVM classifiers for the pseudo-projective parser can be more important than the better asymptotic complexity of the linear-time algorithm in the range of sentence lengths typically found in natural language.
    Looking more closely at the variation in sentence length across languages, we find that the pseudo-projective parsers are faster than the non-projective parser for all data sets with an average sentence length above 18.
    For data sets with shorter sentences, the non-projective parser is more efficient in all except three cases: Bulgarian, Chinese, and Japanese.
    For Chinese this is easily explained by the absence of non-projective dependencies, making the performance of the pseudoprojective parsers identical to their strictly projective counterparts.
    For the other two languages, the low number o
