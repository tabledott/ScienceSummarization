 note that our method of generalizing values of a case slot can be used for purposes other than disambiguation.
  
  
    We proposed a new method of generalizing case frames.
    Our approach of applying MDL to estimate a tree cut model in an existing thesaurus is not limited to just the problem of generalizing values of a case frame slot.
    It is potentially useful in other natural language processing tasks, such as the problem of estimating n-gram models (Brown et al. 1992) or the problem of semantic tagging (Cucchiarelli and Velardi 1997).
    We believe that our method has the following merits: (1) it is theoretically sound; (2) it is computationally efficient; (3) it is robust against noise.
    Our experimental results indicate that the performance of our method is better than, or at least comparable to, existing methods.
    One of the disadvantages of our method is that its performance depends on the structure of the particular thesaurus used.
    This, however, is a problem commonly shared by any
