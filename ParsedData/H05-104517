ngineering, and used the remaining 400 documents for evaluation, performing 10-fold crossvalidation.
			These texts are English language ver sions of articles that come from many countries and cover many topics.5We evaluate performance using 3 measures: over lap match (OL), head match (HM), and exact match(EM).
			OL is a lenient measure that considers an extraction to be correct if it overlaps with any of the an notated words.
			HM is a more conservative measure that considers an extraction to be correct if its head matches the head of the annotated source.
			We reportthese somewhat loose measures because the annota tors vary in where they place the exact boundaries of a source.
			EM is the strictest measure that requires an exact match between the extracted words and the annotated words.
			We use three evaluation metrics:recall, precision, and F-measure with recall and pre cision equally weighted.
			6.1 Baselines.
			We developed three baseline systems to assess the difficulty of our task.
