same-length relations, we have shown that the string relations accepted by parallel two-level automata are in fact regular.
    We have also shown, by the way, that the two-level system is technically a four-level one, since the inner relation defines two intermediate, 0-containing levels of representation.
    Still, only the two outer levels are linguistically significant.
    In typical two-level implementations the Intro relations are implicitly encoded in the interpretation algorithms and do not appear as separate transducers.
    Koskenniemi (1983) offered an informal grammatical notation to help explicate the intended effect of the individual transducers and make the generalizations encoded in their state-transition diagrams easier to understand and reason about.
    However, he proposed no method of interpreting or compiling that notation.
    In later work (e.g.
    Karttunen, Koskennienni, and Kaplan 1987; Karttunen and Beesley 1992) the mathematical techniques we presented above for the analysis of
