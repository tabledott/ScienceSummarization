	A Classifier-Based Approach to Preposition and Determiner Error Correction in L2 English
		In this paper, we present an approach to the automatic identification and correction ofpreposition and determiner errors in non native (L2) English writing.
		We show that models of use for these parts of speech can be learned with an accuracy of 70.06% and 92.15% respectively on L1 text, and present first results in an error detection task for L2 writing.
	
	
			The field of research in natural language processing (NLP) applications for L2 language is constantly growing.
			This is largely driven by the ex panding population of L2 English speakers, whose varying levels of ability may require different types of NLP tools from those designed primarily for native speakers of the language.
			These include applications for use by the individual and within instructional contexts.
			Among the key tools are error-checking applications, focusing particularly on areas which learners find the most challenging.
