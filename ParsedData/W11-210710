  We compare Meteor 1.3 results with those from version 1.2 with results shown in Table 6.
    For both adequacy data sets, Meteor 1.3 significantly outperforms version 1.2 on both tune and test data.
    The version tuned on MT09 data is selected as the official Adequacy version of Meteor 1.3.
    H-TER versions either show no improvement or degradation due to overfitting.
    Examination of the optimal H-TER parameter sets reveals a mismatch between evaluation metric and human judgment type.
    As H-TER evaluation is ultimately limited by the TER aligner, there is no distinction between content and function words, and words sharing stems are considered nonmatches.
    As such, these features do not help Meteor improve correlation, but rather act as a source of additional possibility for overfitting.
  
  
    The 2011 WMT Tunable Metrics task consists of using Z-MERT (Zaidan, 2009) to tune a pre-built Urdu-English Joshua (Li et al., 2009) system to a new evaluation metric on a tuning set with 4 reference t
