l. [1994] address this problem by interpolating between two maximum-likelihood estimates: one of p(cilwi), and one of p(ci).
    The former measures the desired quantity, but is subject to inaccuracy due to sparse data; the latter provides a robust estimate, but of a potentially irrelevant quantity.
    Gale et al. interpolate between the two so as to minimize the overall inaccuracy.
    We have pursued an alternative approach to the problem of estimating the likelihood terms.
    We start with the observation that there is no need to use every word in the +k-word window to discriminate among the words in the confusion set.
    If we do not have enough training data for a given word c to accurately estimate p(clwi) for all w, then we simply disregard c, and base our discrimination on other, more reliable evidence.
    We implement this by introducing a &amp;quot;minimum occurrences&amp;quot; threshold, Trnin.
    It is currently set to 10.
    We then ignore a context word c if: where mi and Mi are defined as
