andability or quality, we have performed evaluation experiments with human subjects.
    In the web-based experiment, we ask human subjects to read a short paragraph from the WSJ.
    We present three or five variants of the last sentence of this paragraph on the same page, and ask the subject to judge them along two dimensions: The 3-5 variants of each of 6 base sentences are constructed by us (most of the variants have not actually been generated by FEFtGUS) to sample multiple values of each intrinsic metric as well as to contrast differences between the intrinsic measures.
    Thus for one sentence &amp;quot;tumble&amp;quot;, two of the five variants have approximately identical values for each of the metrics but with the absolute values being high (0.9) and medium (0.7) respectively.
    For two other sentences we have contrasting intrinsic values for tree and string based measures.
    For the _final sentence we have contrasts between the string measures with tree measures being approximately equal.
