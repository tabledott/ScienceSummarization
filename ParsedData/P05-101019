hod can extract a considerable amount of hidden regularity from parsed corpora.
    However, our result is worse than the lexicalized parsers despite the fact that our model has access to words in the sentences.
    It suggests that certain types of information used in those lexicalized 5Actually, the number of parses contained in the packed forest is more than 1 million for over half of the test sentences when = and , while the number of parses for which the first method can compute the exact probability in a comparable time (around 4 sec) is only about 300. parsers are hard to be learned by our approach.
