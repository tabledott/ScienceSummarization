allows it to calculate a generative probability for each prefix string from the probabilistic grammar, and hence a conditional probability for each word given the previous words and the probabilistic grammar.
    A left-toright parser whose derivations are not rooted, i.e., with derivations that can consist of disconnected tree fragments, such as an LR or shift-reduce parser, cannot incrementally calculate the probability of each prefix string being generated by the probabilistic grammar, because their derivations include probability mass from unrooted structures.
    Only at the point when their derivations become rooted (at the end of the string) can generative string probabilities be calculated from the grammar.
    These parsers can calculate word probabilities based upon the parser state&#8212;as in Chelba and Jelinek (1998a)&#8212;but such a distribution is not generative from the probabilistic grammar.
    A parser that is not left to right, but which has rooted derivations, e.g., a headfirst parser, w
