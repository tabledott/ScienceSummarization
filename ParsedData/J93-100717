    There has been a recent surge of research interest in corpus-based computational linguistics methods; that is, the study and elaboration of techniques using large real text as a basis.
    Such techniques have various applications.
    Speech recognition (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983) and text compression (e.g., Bell, Witten, and Cleary 1989; Guazzo 1980) have been of long-standing interest, and some new applications are currently being investigated, such as machine translation (Brown et al. 1988), spelling correction (Mays, Damerau, and Mercer 1990; Churc
