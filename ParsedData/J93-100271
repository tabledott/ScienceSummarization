and John Carroll Generalized Probabilistic LR Parsing to the right-branching derivation and the product of the probabilities is 4.6 x 10-8, while the product for the left-branching b) derivation is 5.1 x 10-7.
    Since the table was constructed from parse histories with a preponderance of left-branching structures this is the desired result.
    In practice, this technique is able to distinguish and train accurately on 3 of the 5 possible structures for a 4-word noun-noun compound; but it inaccurately prefers a completely left-branching analysis over structures of the form ((n n)(n n)) and ((n (nn)) n).
    Once we move to 5-word noun-noun compounds, performance degrades further.
    However, this level of performance on such structural configurations is likely to be adequate, because correct resolution of most ambiguity in such constructions is likely to be dominated by the actual lexical items that occur in individual texts.
    Nevertheless, if there are systematic structural tendencies evident in corpora
