ived trees.
  Similarly, the base ease need not consider only elementary trees, but the smalleat (in terms of the number of adjoining operations) tree starting with elementary trees which h,m no obligatory constraint annotated with any o( its nodes.
  The base cue can be see?
  easily considering the why the grammar wse built (it can be shown far?ally by induction on the height of the tree) The inductive step is obvious.
  Note that the derived tree we are gong to use for adjoining will have the property P, and so will the tree st which we adjoin; the former because of the way we dreig?ed the grammar and amiped coaatraints, and the latter because of induction hypothesis.
  Thus so will the new derived tree.
  Once we have proved this, all we have to do to show that L(GI) C_ L R is to consider those derived trees which axe soots?tint rees and observe that the roots of these trees obey property P. Now, if n string x E LT f3 Lit, we can show that x E L(G).
  To do that, we make use of the following claim.
  let
