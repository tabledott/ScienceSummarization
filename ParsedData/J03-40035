in accuracy.
    In Model 3 we give a probabilistic treatment of wh-movement that is loosely based on the analysis of wh-movement in generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar et al. 1985).
    The output of the parser is now enhanced to show trace coindexations in wh-movement cases.
    The parameters in this model are interesting in that they correspond directly to the probability of propagating GPSG-style slash features through parse trees, potentially allowing the model to learn island constraints.
    In the three models a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree.
    Independence assumptions then follow naturally, leading to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment.
    All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads.
    For this reason we re
