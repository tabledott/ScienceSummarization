2001), which achieves the best result in the CoNLL-2005 shared task (Carreras and Ma`rquez 2005).
  The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
  Section 2 introduces the task of semantic role labeling in more detail.
  Section 3 describes the four-stage architecture of our SRL system, which includes pruning, argument identification, argument classifi- cation, and inference.
  The features used for building the classifiers and the learning algorithm applied are also explained there.
  Section 4 explains why and where full parsing information contributes to SRL by conducting a series of carefully designed experiments.
  Inspired by the result, we examine the effect of inference in a single system and propose an approach that combines different SRL systems based on joint inference in Section 5.
  Section 6 presents the empirical evaluation of our system in the CoNLL- 2005 shared task competition.
  After that, we discuss the related work in Section 7 and conclude this paper in Section 8.
