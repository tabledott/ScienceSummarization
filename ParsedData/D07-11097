sed.In LDAWN, we replace the multinomial topic dis tributions with a WORDNET-WALK, as described above.
			LDAWN assumes a corpus is generated bythe following process (for an overview of the nota tion used in this paper, see Table 1).
			1.
			For each topic, k ? {1, . . .
			,K}.
			(a) For each synset s, randomly choose transition prob abilities ?k,s ? Dir(S?s).
			2.
			For each document d ? {1, . . .
			, D}.
			(a) Select a topic distribution ?d ? Dir(?)
			(b) For each word n ? {1, . . .
			, Nd} i. Select a topic z ? Mult(1, ?d) ii.
			Create a path ?d,n starting with ?0 as the root node.
			iii.
			From children of ?i: A. Choose the next node in the walk ?i+1 ? Mult(1, ?z,?i)B. If ?i+1 is a leaf node, generate the associ ated word.
			Otherwise, repeat.
			Every element of this process, including thesynsets, is hidden except for the words of the doc uments.
			Thus, given a collection of documents, our goal is to perform posterior inference, which is the task of determining the conditional distribution
