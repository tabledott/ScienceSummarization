of the matrix are determined by using the base lexicon.
    Thus, for each vector in the English matrix a similarity value is computed and the English words are ranked according to these values.
    It is expected that the correct translation is ranked first in the sorted list.
    For vector comparison, different similarity measures can be considered.
    Salton &amp; McGill (1983) proposed a number of measures, such as the Cosine coefficient, the Jaccard coefficient, and the Dice coefficient (see also Jones &amp; Furnas, 1987).
    For the computation of related terms and synonyms, Ruge (1995), Landauer and Dumais (1997), and Fung and McKeown (1997) used the cosine measure, whereas Grefenstette (1994, p. 48) used a weighted Jaccard measure.
    We propose here the city-block metric, which computes the similarity between two vectors X and Y as the sum of the absolute differences of corresponding vector positions: In a number of experiments we compared it to other similarity measures, such as the cosine measu
