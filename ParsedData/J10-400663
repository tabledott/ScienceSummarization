 sometimes useful to measure length or compare vectors by taking only some of their dimensions into account.
    For example, one way to find nouns that are typical objects of the verb to sing is to measure the length of nouns in a W1xLW2 subspace in which only dimensions such as (obj, sing) have non-0 values.
    We project a vector onto a subspace of this kind through multiplication of the vector by a square diagonal matrix with 1s in the diagonal cells corresponding to the dimensions we want to preserve and 0s elsewhere.
    A matrix of this sort performs an orthogonal projection of the vector it multiplies (Meyer 2000, chapter 5).
  
  
    As we saw in Section 3, labeled matricization generates four distinct semantic spaces from the third-order tensor.
    For each space, we have selected a set of semantic experiments that we model by applying some combination of the vector manipulation operations of Section 5.2.
    The experiments correspond to key semantic tasks in computational linguistics and/or cog
