 data sets using an exhaustive parametric sweep.
    The resulting parameters, listed in Table 4, are used in the default Ranking version of Meteor 1.3.
    For each language, the 6 parameter is above 0.5, indicating a preference for content words over function words.
    In addition, the fragmentation penalties are generally less severe across languages.
    The additional features in Meteor 1.3 allow for more balanced parameters that distribute responsibility for penalizing various types of erroneous translations.
  
  
    To compare Meteor 1.3 against previous versions of the metric on the task of evaluating MT system outputs, we tune a version for each language on 2009 WMT data and evaluate on 2010 data.
    This replicates the 2010 WMT shared evaluation task, allowing comparison to Meteor 1.2.
    Table 5 lists correlation of each metric version with ranking judgments on tune and test data.
    Meteor 1.3 shows significantly higher correlation on both tune and test data for English, French, and Spanish
