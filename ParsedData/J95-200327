n the subject position of the (d) utterances.
    This preference holds regardless of syntactic position in the (e) utterances.
    Thus, we can establish a preference for subject position.
    In other circumstances, however, as the examples below illustrate, the Cb may be realized in other grammatical roles.
    In the first clause of both utterances (13d) and (14d), the direct object is pronominalized; the pronoun &amp;quot;it&amp;quot; refers to the green plastic tugboat.
    In (13) taking the boat to be the highest ranked Cf and hence the most likely referent for &amp;quot;the silly thing&amp;quot; in the second clause of utterance (d) yields a coherent and easily comprehensible discourse.'
