n and Hoang, 2007; Birch et al., 2007; Hassan et al., 2007)), and also include systems employing contextfree models trained on parallel text without benefit of any prior linguistic analysis (e.g.
    (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007; Wu, 1997)).
    Over time, however, there has been increasing movement in the direction of systems that are syntactic in both the formal and linguistic senses.
    In any such system, there is a natural tension between taking advantage of the linguistic analysis, versus allowing the model to use linguistically unmotivated mappings learned from parallel training data.
    The tradeoff often involves starting with a system that exploits rich linguistic representations and relaxing some part of it.
    For example, DeNeefe et al. (2007) begin with a tree-to-string model, using treebank-based target language analysis, and find it useful to modify it in order to accommodate useful &#8220;phrasal&#8221; chunks that are present in parallel training data but not licensed by linguistically mot
