se that are external to the maximal projection under precise structural conditions; the subject, in the case of VP, and the subject of support verbs in the case of AP and NP.
    8 Used in NLP, the FrameNet database should make it possible for a system which finds a valence-bearing lexical item in a text to know (for each of its senses) where its individual arguments are likely to be found.
    For example, once a parser has found the verb drive and its direct object NP, the link to the DRIVING frame will suggest some semantics for that NP, e.g. that a person as direct object probably represents the RIDER, while a non-human proper noun is probably the VEHICLE.
    For practical lexicography, the contribution of the FrameNet database will be its presentation of the full range of use possibilities for individual words, documented with corpus data, the model examples for each use, and the statistical information on relative frequency.
