mal result.
    This scheme is an instance of Jelinek-Mercer smoothing.
    Referring to equation (3), recall that Bahl et al. suggest bucketing the A.,-i according .-n+1 to c(w!=n1+1).
    We have found that partitioning the A.,-i according to the average number of counts per non-zero element 1...,(.
    :::+1 ) +,)&gt;O1 yields better results.
    Intuitively, the less sparse the data for estimating PmL(wi I Witn1+1)) the larger A.,-i should be.
    ,-n+1 While larger c(tv:tn1+1) generally correspond to less sparse distributions, this quantity ignores the allocation of counts between words.
    For example, we would consider a distribution with ten counts distributed evenly among ten words to be much more sparse than a distribution with ten counts all on a single word.
    The average number of counts per word seems to more directly express the concept of sparseness.
    In Figure 1, we graph the value of A assigned to each bucket under the original and new bucketing schemes on identical data.
