 method produces the same number of words as the hand-segmentation, recall and precision both become equal to one minus the error rate.
    A perfect segmenter will have an error rate of zero and recall and precision of 100%.
    All these measures can be calculated automatically from a machine-segmented text, along with the hand-segmented gold standard.
    Both texts are identical except for the points where spaces are inserted: thus we record just the start and end positions of each word in both versions.
    For example, &amp;quot;A BC AED F&amp;quot; in the machine-segmented version is mapped to (1,1) (2,3) (4,6) (7,7), and &amp;quot;A BC A ED F&amp;quot; in the hand-segmented version becomes (1,1) (2,3) (4,4) (5,6) (7,7).
    The number of correctly and incorrectly segmented words is counted by comparing these two sets of positions, indicated by matched and mismatched pairs, respectively&#8212;three correct and two incorrect, in this example.
