 describes syntactic structures by means of a set of abstract rewrite rules that are now provided with probabilities that correspond to the application- probabilities of the rules (see e.g.
  [Jeliuek 1990]).
  As long as a probabilistic grammar only assigns probabilities to individual rewrite rules, the grammar cannot account for all statistical properties of a language corpus.
  It is, for instance, not possible to indicate how the probability of syntactic structures or lexical items depends on their syntacticflexical context.
  As a consequence of this, it is not possible to recognize frequent phrases and figures of speech as such - a disappointing property, for one would prefer that such phrases and figures of speech would get a high priority in the ranking of the possible syntactic analyses of a sentence.
  Some improvements can be made by applying the Markov-approach to rewrite rules, as is found in the work of [Salomaa 1969] and [Magerman 1991].
  Nevertheless, any approach which ties probabilities to
