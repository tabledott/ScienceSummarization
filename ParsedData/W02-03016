ach word with context to one of the classes that represent region information and named entity&#8217;s semantic class.
    Several representations to encode region information are proposed and examined (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Uchimoto et al., 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).
    In this paper, we employ the simplest BIO representation, which is also used in (Yamada et al., 2000).
    We modify this representation in Section 5.1 in order to accelerate the SVM training.
    In the BIO representation, the region information is represented as the class prefixes &#8220;B-&#8221; and &#8220;I-&#8221;, and a class &#8220;O&#8221;.
    B- means that the current word is at the beginning of a named entity, I- means that the current word is in a named entity (but not at the beginning), and O means the word is not in a named entity.
    For each named entity class C, class B-C and I-C are produced.
    Therefore, if we have N named entity classes, the BIO representation yields 2N + 1 classes, which will be the targets
