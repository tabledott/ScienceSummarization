  Figure 1 lists several familiar functions.
    The cosine metric and Jaccard's coefficient are commonly used in information retrieval as measures of association (Salton and McGill, 1983).
    Note that Jaccard's coefficient differs from all the other measures we consider in that it is essentially combinatorial, being based only on the sizes of the supports of q, r, and q &#8226; r rather than the actual values of the distributions.
    Previously, we found the Jensen-Shannon divergence (Rao, 1982; J. Lin, 1991) to be a useful measure of the distance between distributions: The function D is the KL divergence, which measures the (always nonnegative) average inefficiency in using one distribution to code for another (Cover and Thomas, 1991): The function avgq denotes the average distribution avgq,r(v) = (q(v) + r(v))/2; observe that its use ensures that the Jensen-Shannon divergence is always defined.
    In contrast, D(q1 Ir) is undefined if q is not absolutely continuous with respect to r (i.e., the support
