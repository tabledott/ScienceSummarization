e first task of modeling) that will aid us in constructing a model of this process (the second task).
    One obvious clue we might glean from the sample is the list of allowed translations.
    For example, we might discover that the expert translator always chooses among the following five French phrases: {dans, en, a, au cours de, pendant}.
    With this information in hand, we can impose our first constraint on our model p: This equation represents our first statistic of the process; we can now proceed to search for a suitable model that obeys this equation.
    Of course, there are an infinite number of models p for which this identity holds.
    One model satisfying the above equation is p(dans) = 1; in other words, the model always predicts dans.
    Another model obeying this constraint predicts pendant with a probability of 1/2, and a with a probability of 1/2.
    But both of these models offend our sensibilities: knowing only that the expert always chose from among these five French phrases, how ca
