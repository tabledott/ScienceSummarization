s the two relation arguments, a sentence from a positive bag may contain other entity mentions.
    Any pair of entities different from the relation pair is very likely to be a negative example for that relation.
    This is similar to the concept of negative neighborhoods introduced by Smith and Eisner (2005), and has the potential of eliminating both Type I and Type II bias.
  
  
    One of the earliest IE methods designed to work with a reduced amount of supervision is that of Hearst (1992), where a small set of seed patterns is used in a bootstrapping fashion to mine pairs of hypernym-hyponym nouns.
    Bootstrapping is actually orthogonal to our method, which could be used as the pattern learner in every bootstrapping iteration.
    A more recent IE system that works by bootstrapping relation extraction patterns from the web is KNOWITALL (Etzioni et al., 2005).
    For a given target relation, supervision in KNOWITALL is provided as a rule template containing words that describe the class of the argumen
