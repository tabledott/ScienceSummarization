ned on 1.7M words annotated with 32 name categories.
    The RRM system alone obtains an Fmeasure of 92.1, and can effectively integrate these information streams with the output of the four classifiers, gazetteers and the two additional classifiers into obtaining 93.9 F-measure, as detailed in Table 4, a 21% reduction in F-measure error.
    In contrast, combination model 2 obtains only a performance of 92.4, showing its limitations in combining diverse sources of information.
    German poses a completely different problem for named entity recognition: the data is considerably sparser.
    Table 3 shows the relative distribution of unknown words in the development and test corpora.
    We note that the numbers are roughly twice as large for the development data in German as they are for English.
    Since the unknown words are classed by most classifiers, this results in few data points to estimate classifier combinations.
    Also, specifically for the German data, traditional approaches which utilize capi
