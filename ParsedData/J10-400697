    Just as the SAT is the relational equivalent of the TOEFL task, the test sets we tackle next are a relational analog to attributional concept clustering, in that they require grouping pairs of words into classes that instantiate the same relations.
    Whereas we cast attributional categorization as an unsupervised clustering problem (following much of the earlier literature), the common approach to classifying word pairs by relation is supervised, and relies on labeled examples for training.
    In this article, we exploit training data in a very simple way, via a nearest centroid method.
    In the SEMEVAL task we are about to introduce, where both positive and negative examples are available for each class, we use the positive examples to construct a centroid that represents a target class, and negative examples to construct a centroid representing items outside the class.
    We then decide if a test pair belongs to the target class by measuring its distance from the positive and negativ
