and the only source, to the authors&#8217; knowledge, of available HTER annotations is on GALE evaluation data for which no Fluency and Adequacy judgments have been made publicly available.
    The edit costs learned for each of these human judgments, along with the alignment edit costs are shown in Table 6.
    While all three types of human judgements differ from the alignment costs used in alignment, the HTER edit costs differ most significantly.
    Unlike Adequacy and Fluency which have a low edit cost for insertions and a very high cost for deletions, HTER has a balanced cost for the two edit types.
    Inserted words are strongly penalized against in HTER, as opposed to in Adequacy and Fluency, where such errors are largely forgiven.
    Stem and synonym edits are also penalized against while these are considered equivalent to a match for both Adequacy and Fluency.
    This penalty against stem matches can be attributed to Fluency requirements in HTER that specifically penalize against incorrect morpho
