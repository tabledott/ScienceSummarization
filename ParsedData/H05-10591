-of speech (POS) tagging, chunking (shallow parsing)and named entity recognition is one of the most im portant tasks in natural language processing.
			Conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al,2001) have recently attracted much attention because they are free from so-called label bias prob lems which reportedly degrade the performance of sequential classification approaches like maximum entropy markov models (MEMMs).
			Although sequential classification approachescould suffer from label bias problems, they have sev eral advantages over CRFs.
			One is the efficiencyof training.
			CRFs need to perform dynamic programming over the whole sentence in order to compute feature expectations in each iteration of numerical optimization.
			Training, for instance, second order CRFs using a rich set of features can require prohibitive computational resources.
			Max-marginmethods for structured data share problems of com putational cost (Altun et al, 2003).Another advantage is that one can employ a variety of
