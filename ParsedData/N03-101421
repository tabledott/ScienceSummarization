space of derivations in between two words we do a best-first search.
    This search is not restricted by a beam width, but a limit is placed on the search&#8217;s branching factor.
    At each point in a partial derivation which is being pursued by the search, only the 10 best alternative decisions are considered for continuing that derivation.
    This was done because we found that the best-first search tended to pursue a large number of alternative labels for a nonterminal before pursuing subsequent derivation steps, even though only the most probable labels ended up being used in the best derivations.
    We found that a branching factor of 10 was large enough that it had virtually no effect on the validation accuracy.
  
  
    We used the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) to perform empirical experiments on this parsing model.
    To sion on the testing set. test the effects of varying vocabulary sizes on performance and tractability, we trained three different models.
    The simplest model (&#8220;
