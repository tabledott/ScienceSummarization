			The relative ranking of the factors is justified both linguistically, as a reflection of the role of the functional hierarchy in determining anaphoric relations (cf.
			(Keenan and Comrie, 1977)), as well as by experimental results--both Lappin and Leass' and our own.
			For all factors except CNTX-S and POSS-S, we adopt the values derived from a series of experiments described in (Lappin and Leass, 1994) which used dif- ferent settings to determine the relative importance of 1T
