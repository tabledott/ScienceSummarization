ent translators, we expect that the similarity between translations varies from one book to another.
    This implies that contextual rules should be specific to a particular pair of translations.
    Therefore, we train the contextual classifier for each pair of translations separately.
    Training of the paraphrasing classifier Context rules extracted in the previous stage are then applied to the corpus to derive a new set of pairs of positive and negative paraphrasing examples.
    Applications of the rule performed by searching sentence pairs for subsequences which match the left and right parts of the contextual rule, and are less than tokens apart.
    For example, applying the first rule from Figure 4 to sentences from Figure 1 yields the paraphrasing pair (&#8220;comfort&#8221;, &#8220;console&#8221;).
    Note that in the original seed set, the left and right contexts were separated by one token.
    This stretch in rule application allows us to extract multi-word paraphrases.
