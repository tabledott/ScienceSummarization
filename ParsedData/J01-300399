founded on in-depth linguistic analysis&#8212;holds promise for building more natural NLP systems which go beyond the simplest assumptions, and tie together statistical computational linguistic results with experimental psycholinguistic data.
  
  
    In this paper, we have presented an in-depth case study, in which we investigate machine learning techniques for automatically classifying a set of verbs into classes determined by their argument structures.
    We focus on the three major classes of optionally intransitive verbs in English, which cannot be discriminated by their subcategorizations, and therefore require distinctive features that are sensitive to the thematic properties of the verbs.
    We develop such features and automatically extract them from very large, syntactically annotated corpora.
    Results show that a small number of linguistically motivated lexical features are sufficient to achieve a 69.8% accuracy rate in a three-way classification task with a baseline (chance) performance of 3
