    They employed a log-linear model to learn the observation probabilities, while using a fixed transition distribution.
    Our CRF model allows both the observation and transition components of the model to be jointly optimised from the corpus.
  
  
    The results presented in this paper were evaluated in terms of AER.
    While a low AER can be expected to improve end-to-end translation quality, this is may not necessarily be the case.
    Therefore, we plan to assess how the recall and precision characteristics of our model affect translation quality.
    The tradeoff between recall and precision may affect the quality and number of phrases extracted for a phrase translation table.
  
  
    We have presented a novel approach for inducing word alignments from sentence aligned data.
    We showed how conditional random fields could be used for word alignment.
    These models allow for the use of arbitrary and overlapping features over the source and target sentences, making the most of small superv
