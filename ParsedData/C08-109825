			The best accuracy of the TnT tagger was 88.2% with a maximal suffix length of 5.

			89.53% for our tagger and 88.88% for the TnT tag ger.
			The difference is significant.
	
	
			Our tagger combines two ideas, the decompositionof the probability of complex POS tags into a prod uct of feature probabilities, and the estimation of the conditional probabilities with decision trees.
			A similar idea was previously presented in Kempe (1994), but apparently never applied again.
			The tagging accuracy reported by Kempe was below that of a traditional trigram tagger.
			Unlike him, we found that our tagging me
