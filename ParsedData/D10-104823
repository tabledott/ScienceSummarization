ugh most of the other models are significantly richer.
    Amongst the comparisons, several are supervised (Bengston and Roth, 2008; Finkel and Manning, 2008; Culotta et al., 2007).
    The system of Haghighi and Klein (2009) +S uses a lexicon of semantically-compatible noun pairs acquired transductively, i.e., with knowledge of the mentions in the test set.
    Our system does not rely on labeled corpora for training (like supervised approaches) nor access to corpora during testing (like Haghighi and Klein (2009)).
    The system that is closest to ours is Haghighi and Klein (2009) &#8722;S.
    Like us, they use a rich set of features and deterministic decisions.
    However, theirs is a single-pass model with a smaller feature set (no cluster-level, acronym, demonym, or animacy information).
    Table 3 shows that on the two corpora where results for this system are available, we outperform it considerably on all metrics.
    To understand if the difference is due to the multi-pass architecture or the rich
