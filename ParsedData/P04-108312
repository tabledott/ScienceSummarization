 CT for the special case where .
    The relationship between the two classes of algorithms is easier to see from their declarative logics than it would be from their procedural pseudocode or equations.
    Like Parser C, Translator CT can Compose items that have no dimensions in common.
    If one of the items is active only in the input dimension(s), and the other only in the output dimension(s), then the inference is, de facto, a translation.
    The possible translations are determined by consulting the grammar.
    Thus, in addition to its usual function of evaluating syntactic structures, the grammar simultaneously functions as a translation model.
    Logic CT can be coupled with any parsing semiring.
    For example, under a boolean semiring, this logic will succeed on an-dimensional input if and only if it can infer a -dimensional multitree whose root is the goal item.
    Such a tree would contain a -dimensional translation of the input.
    Thus, under a boolean semiring, Translator CT can determin
