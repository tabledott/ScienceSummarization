of clustering quality.
    The best result was obtained with 25 rounds of execution and with the entity multiple set to 200 (the default is 30).
    To answer questions, the only difference from TextRunner is that a question string can match any string in its cluster.
    As in TextRunner, we report results for both exact match (RS-EXACT) and substring (RS-SUB).
    DIRT: The DIRT system inputs a path and returns a set of similar paths.
    To use DIRT in question answering, we queried it to obtain similar paths for the relation of the question, and used these paths while matching sentences.
    We first used MINIPAR (Lin, 1998) to parse input text using the same dependencies as DIRT.
    To determine a match, we first check if the sentence contains the question path or one of its DIRT paths.
    If so, and if the available argument slot in the question is contained in the one in the sentence, it is a match, and we return the other argument slot from the sentence if it is present.
    Ideally, a fair comparis
