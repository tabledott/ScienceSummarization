Once again, this is a feature of interpretations that is accommodated in the relational approach to semantics advocated by Barwise and Perry, but it might be accommodated within other as Given that Cb(S), the center of sentence S in a discourse, is the interpretation of a definite noun phrase, how does it become related to S?
    In a typical example, S will contain a full definite noun phrase or pronoun that realizes the center.
    The realization relation is neither nor pragmatic.
    For example, realizes c in cases where a definite description and is interpretation, or an object related to it by a 'speaker's reference.'
    More when is pronoun, the principles that which c are such that realizes c from neither semantics nor pragmatics exclusively.
    They are principles that must be elicited from the study of itself.
    A tentative formulation of some principles is given below. it is typical that, when a center of S, S an that realizes c, is by no means necessary.
    In particular, for sentences conta
