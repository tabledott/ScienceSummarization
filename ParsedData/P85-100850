atic relation between the unprimed and primed predicates as an axiom schema.
    For every n-ary predicate p, (Vi, D (36)Ezisf(c)AptIc, That is, if p is true of xi , xn, then there is a condition e of p's being true of xn, and e exists.
    Conversely, (Ve, , x.

    We can compress these axiom schemas into one formula: A sentence in English asserts the existence of one or more eventualities in the real world, and this may or may not imply the existence of other individuals.
    The logical form of sentence (1) is the logical form of &amp;quot;John wants to fly&amp;quot; is 'One need not adhere to Platonism to accept the Platonic universe.
    It ran be viewrti as a socially constituted, or conventional, construction, which is nevertheless highly constrained by the way the (not directly accessible) material world is.
