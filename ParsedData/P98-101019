her that will improve the results.
    Figure 3 shows the learning curves by amount of training examples and number of words in the training data, for particular parameter settings.
  
  
    Two previous methods for learning local syntactic patterns follow the transformation-based paradigm introduced by Brill (1992).
    Vilain and Day (1996) identify (and classify) name phrases such as company names, locations, etc.
    Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) detect noun phrases, by classifying each word as being inside a phrase, outside or on the boundary between phrases.
    Finite state machines (FSMs) are a natural formalism for learning linear sequences.
    It was used for learning linguistic structures other than shallow syntax.
    Gold (1978) showed that learning regular languages from positive examples is undecidable in the limit.
    Recently, however, several learning methods have been proposed for restricted classes of FSM.
