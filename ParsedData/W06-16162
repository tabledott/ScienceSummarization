nts required to prevent cycles occurring in the dependency graph.
    To model all these constraints explicitly would result in an ILP formulation too large to solve efficiently (Williams, 2002).
    A similar problem also occurs in an ILP formulation for machine translation which treats decoding as the Travelling Salesman Problem (Germann et al., 2001).
    In this paper we present a method which extends the applicability of ILP to a more complex set of problems.
    Instead of adding all the constraints we wish to capture to the formulation, we first solve the program with a fraction of the constraints.
    The solution is then examined and, if required, additional constraints are added.
    This procedure is repeated until all constraints are satisfied.
    We apply this dependency parsing approach to Dutch due to the language&#8217;s non-projective nature, and take the parser of McDonald et al. (2005b) as a starting point for our model.
    In the following section we introduce dependency parsing and revi
