			3.2 Results.
			Table 2 shows the mean overlap score between every pair of the first seven measures in Table 1 calculated over WScomp.
			Table 3 shows the mean overlap score between each of these measures and precision, recall and the harmonic mean inthe AMCRM.
			In both tables, standard devia tions are given in brackets and boldface denotes the highest levels of overlap for each measure.
			For compactness, each measure is denoted by its subscript from Table 1.
			Although overlap between most pairs of measures is greater than expected if sets of 200 neighbours were generated randomly from WScomp (in this case, average overlap would be 0.08 and only the overlap between the pair
