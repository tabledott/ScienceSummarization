us far in this article we have presented boosting as a feature selection approach.
    In this section, we note that there is an alternative view of boosting in which it is described as a method for combining multiple models, for example, as a method for forming a linear combination of decision trees.
    We consider only the simpler, feature selection view of boosting in this article.
    This section is included for completeness and because the more general view of boosting may be relevant to future work on boosting approaches for parse reranking (note, however, that the discussion in this section is not essential to the rest of the article, so the reader may safely skip this section if she or he wishes to do so).
    In feature selection approaches, as described in this article, the set of possible features hk&#240;x&#222; for k = 1, ... , m is taken to be a fixed set of relatively simple functions.
    In particular, we have assumed that m is relatively small (for example, small enough for algorithms that
