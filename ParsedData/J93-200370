t by ignoring the morphological structure of the two languages we dilute the strength of our statistical model, explaining, for example, each of the several tens of forms of each French verb independently.
    We have seen that by ignoring multi-word cepts, we are forced to give a false, or at least an unsatisfactory, account of some features in many translations.
    And finally, we have seen that our models are deficient, either in fact, as with Models 3 and 4, or in spirit, as with Models 1, 2, and 5.
    We have argued in Section 2 that neither spiritual nor actual deficiency poses a serious problem, but this is not entirely true.
    Let w(e) be the sum of Pr(f I e) over well-formed French strings and let i(e) be the sum over ill-formed French strings. lit a deficient model, w(e) + i(e) &lt; 1.
    We say that the remainder of the probability is concentrated on the event failure and we write w(e) + i(e) + Pr(failureje) = 1.
    Clearly, a model is deficient precisely when Pr(failurele) &gt; 0.
    If Pr(
