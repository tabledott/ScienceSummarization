.
			For all words WSD in either of these domains, it would be these wordsfor which automatic ranking should be used.
			Ta ble 4 shows the WSD accuracy using this approach for the words in our lexical sample with a differentautomatically computed first sense in the BNC com pared to the target domain (SPORTS or FINANCE).
			We trained on the appropriate domain for each test corpus, and compared this with using SemCor first sense data.
			The results show clearly that using this approach to decide whether to use automatic sense rankings performs much better than always using SemCor rankings.
	
	
			The method for automatically finding the predominant sense beat SemCor consistently in our experiments.
			So for some words, it pays to obtain auto matic information on frequency distributions from appropriate corpora.
			Our sense annotated corpora exhibit higher entropy for word sense distributions for domain-specific text, even for words which are not specific to that domain.
			They also show that different sen
