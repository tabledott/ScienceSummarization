			An example might be a part-of-speech tagger trained on the entire PennTreebank and not just the subset provided as train ing data, or a parser that has been hand-crafted or trained on a different training set.
	
	
			In this section, we describe the treebanks used in the shared task and give relevant information about the data sets created from them.

			The conversion, done by Otakar Smrz, from the original format to the column-based format described in section 2.1 was therefore relatively straightforward, although not all the information in the original annotation could be transfered to the new format.
			PADT was one of the treebanks used in the 2006 shared task but then only contained about 54,000 tokens.
			Since then, the size of the treebank has more than d
