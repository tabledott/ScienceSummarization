.S. Census Bureau divides these states into four regions: West, Midwest, Northeast, and South.10 Note that while major population centers straddle several state lines, most region boundaries are far from the largest cities, resulting in a clearer analysis.
    As shown in Table 1, the geographic topic model achieves the strongest performance on all metrics.
    All differences in performance between systems are statistically significant (p &lt; .01) using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for regression error and the k2 test for classification accuracy.
    Figure 2 shows how performance changes as the number of topics varies.
    Note that the geographic topic model and the mixture of unigrams use identical code and parametrization &#8211; the only difference is that the geographic topic model accounts for topical variation, while the mixture of unigrams sets K = 1.
    These results validate our basic premise that it is important to model the interaction between topical and geographical variation.
