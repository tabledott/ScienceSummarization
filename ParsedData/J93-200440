related guideline, all coordinate structures are annotated in the Treebank; such coordinate structures are represented by Chomsky-adjunction when the two conjoined constituents bear the same label.
  This means that if an NP contains coordinated adjective phrases, then an ADJP tag will be used to tag that coordination, even though simple ADJPs within NPs will not bear an APJP tag.
  Experience has shown that annotators can delete pairs of brackets extremely quickly using the mouse-based tools, whereas creating brackets is a much slower operation.
  Because the coordination of adjectives i quite common, it is more efficient o leave in ADJP labels, and delete them if they are not part of a coordinate structure, than to reintroduce them if necessary.
  Progress to Date 5.1 Composition and Size of Corpus Table 4 shows the output of the Penn Treebank project at the end of its first phase.
  All the materials listed in Table 4 are available on CD-ROM to members of the Linguistic Data Consortium.
