ctionary of words, or rely on hand-crafted segmentation rules, or use adaptive models that have been specifically created for the purpose of Chinese word segmentation.
    We have developed an alternative based on a general-purpose character-level model of text&#8212;the kind of models used in the very best text compression schemes.
    These models are formed adaptively from training text.
    The advantage of using character-level models is that they do not rely on a dictionary and therefore do not necessarily fail on unusual words.
    In effect, they can fall back on general properties of language statistics to process novel text.
    The advantage of basing models on a corpus of training text is that particular characteristics of the text are automatically taken into account in language statistics&#8212;as exemplified by the significant differences between the models formed for the PH and Rocling corpora.
    Encouraging results have been obtained using the new scheme.
