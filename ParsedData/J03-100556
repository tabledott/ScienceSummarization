rd example) are too far away from the personal pronouns ich and Sie (six and five source sentence positions, respectively) to be reordered properly.
    In the last example, the less restrictive S3 reordering constraint leads to a better translation; the GE translation is still acceptable, though. beam search pruning is demonstrated.
    Translation results on the TEST-331 test set are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the pruning techniques.6 The quality of the search algorithm with respect to the GE and S3 reordering constraints is evaluated using two criteria: 1.
    The number of search errors for a certain combination of pruning thresholds is counted.
    A search error occurs for a test sentence if the final translation probability QF for a candidate translation eI1 as given in equation (4) is smaller than a reference probability for that test sentence.
    We will compute reference probabilities two ways, as explained below.
