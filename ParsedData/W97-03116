sider is statistical machine translation involving a directed translation model and a target language model, of the sort advocated by Brown et al. (1993).
    If only the translation model may be varied, then the objective function for this application should be based on how well the translation model predicts the distribution of words in the target language.
    In information theory, one such objective function is called mutual information.
    Mutual information measures how well one random variable predicts another3: When Pr(s, t) is a text translation model, mutual information indicates how well the model can predict the distribution of words in the target text given the distribution of words in the source text, and vice versa.
    This objective function may also be used for optimizing cross-language information retrieval, where translational distributions must be estimated either for queries or for documents before queries and documents can be compared (Oard &amp; Dorr, 1996).
