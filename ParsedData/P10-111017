e average model score per sentence, higher the better) and speed (average parsing time per sentence), where DP with a beam width of b=16 achieves the same search quality with non-DP at b=64, while being 5 times faster.
    Fig.
    5b shows a similar comparison for dependency accuracy.
    We also test with an edge-factored model (Sec.
    3.5) using feature templates (1)-(3) in Tab.
    1, which is a subset of those in McDonald et al. (2005b).
    As expected, this difference becomes more pronounced (8 times faster in Fig.
    5c), since the less expressive feature set makes more states &#8220;equivalent&#8221; and mergeable in DP.
    Fig.
    5d shows the (almost linear) correlation between dependency accuracy and search quality, confirming that better search yields better parsing.
    DP achieves better search quality because it expores an exponentially large search space rather than only b trees allowed by the beam (see Fig.
    6a).
    As a by-product, DP can output a forest encoding these exponentiall
