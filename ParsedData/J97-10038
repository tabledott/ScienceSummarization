in discourse cues, in a finer-grained pass.
    Research in hypertext and text display has produced hypotheses about how textual information should be displayed to users.
    One study of an on-line documentation system (Girill 1991) compares display of fine-grained portions of text (i.e., sentences), full texts, and intermediate-sized units.
    Girill finds that divisions at the fine-grained level are less efficient to manage and less effective in delivering useful answers than intermediate-sized units of text.
    Girill does not make a commitment about exactly how large the desired text unit should be, but talks about &amp;quot;passages&amp;quot; and describes passages in terms of the communicative goals they accomplish (e.g., a problem statement, an illustrative example, an enumerated list).
    The implication is that the proper unit is the one that groups together the information that performs some communicative function; in most cases, this unit will range from one to several paragraphs.
