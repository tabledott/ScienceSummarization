needs to do over 90% of the work.
    On the other hand, normalized 13 and the trigram estimate both result in substantial savings of work.
    However, while these two models produce Average CPU time for 95% of the probability mass for the 0 estimates. near-equivalent performance for short sentences, for longer sentences, with length greater than about 15 words, the trigram estimate gains a clear advantage.
    In fact, the performance of normalized 13 appears to level off in this range, while the amount of work done using the trigram estimate shows a continuing downward trend.
    Figure 5 shows the average CPU time to get 95% of the probability mass for each estimate and each sentence length.
    Each estimate averaged below 1 second on sentences of fewer than 7 words.
    (The y-axis has been restricted so that the normalized 0 and trigram estimates can be better compared).
    Note that while straight 0 does perform better than the &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; model in CPU time, the two models approach equi
