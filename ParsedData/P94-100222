was found.
    These scores appear in Table 1 (results at 33% are also shown for comparison purposes).
    The algorithms are evaluated according to how many true boundaries they select out of the total selected (precision) and how many true boundaries are found out of the total possible (recall) (Salton 1988).
    The recall measure implicitly signals the number of missed boundaries (false negatives, or deletion errors); the number of false positives, or insertion errors, is indicated explicitly.
    In many cases the algorithms are almost correct but off by one paragraph, especially in the texts that the algorithm performs poorly on.
    When the block similarity algorithm is allowed to be off by one paragraph, there is dramatic improvement in the scores for the texts that lower part of Table 2, yielding an overall precision of 83% and recall of 78%.
    As in Figure 4, it is often the case that where the algorithm is incorrect, e.g., paragraph gap 11, the overall blocking is very close to what the judges i
