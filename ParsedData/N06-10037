rms of two translation model probabilities: p(f|e1), the probability that the original English phrase e1 translates as a particular phrase f in the other language, and p(e2|f), the probability that the candidate paraphrase e2 translates as the foreign language phrase.
    Since e1 can translate as multiple foreign language phrases, we marginalize f out: The translation model probabilities can be computed using any standard formulation from phrasebased machine translation.
    For example, p(e2|f) can be calculated straightforwardly using maximum likelihood estimation by counting how often the phrases e and f were aligned in the parallel corpus: There is nothing that limits us to estimating paraphrases probabilities from a single parallel corpus.
    We can extend the definition of the paraphrase probability to include multiple corpora, as follows: where c is a parallel corpus from a set of parallel corpora C. Thus multiple corpora may be used by summing over all paraphrase probabilities calculated from a sing
