task, we observe that the linguistically impoverished model Coreference&#8722;Syntax&#8722;Salience&#8722; exhibits decreased accuracy when compared against models that operate over more sophisticated representations.
    However, the contribution of individual knowledge sources differs in this task.
    For instance, coreference resolution improved model performance in ordering, but it causes a decrease in accuracy in summary evaluation (compare the models Coreference+Syntax+Salience+ and Coreference&#8722;Syntax+Salience+ in Tables 5 and 8).
    This drop in performance can be attributed to two factors both related to the fact that our summary corpus contains many machine-generated texts.
    First, an automatic coreference resolution tool will be expected to be less accurate on our corpus, because it was trained on well-formed human-authored texts.
    Second, automatic summarization systems do not use anaphoric expressions as often as humans do.
    Therefore, a simple entity clustering method is more sui
