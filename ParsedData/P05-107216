 ii) For the remaining arguments, the more probable ones among overlapping ones were selected.
    In the chunked system, an argument could consist of a sequence of chunks.
    The probability assigned to the begin tag of an argument was used as the probability of the sequence of chunks forming an argument.
    Table 12 shows the performance improvement after the combination.
    Again, numbers in parentheses are respective baseline performances. mance on argument identification and argument identification and classification tasks after combining all three semantic parses.
    The main contribution of combining both the Minipar based and the Charniak-based parsers was significantly improved performance on ARG1 in addition to slight improvements to some other arguments.
    Table 13 shows the effect on selected arguments on sentences that were altered during the the combination of Charniak-based and Chunk-based parses. changed during pair-wise Charniak and Chunk combination.
    A marked increase in number of
