sults into perspective, a model with a first quartile rank of 999 does very significantly better than chance (the binomial probability of 1/4 or more of 26,440 trials being successful with 7r = 0.024 is virtually 0, where the latter quantity is the probability of an observed AN being at rank 999 or lower according to a geometric distribution with 7r=1/40999).
    Our proposed method, alm, emerges as the best approach.
    The difference with the second best model, add (the only other model that does better than the non-trivial baseline of using the component noun vector as a surrogate for AN), is highly statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p &lt; 0.00001).
    If we randomly downsample the AN set to keep an equal number of ANs per adjective (200), the difference is still significant with p below the same threshold, indicating that the general result is not due to a better performance of alm on a few common adjectives.1 Among the alternative models, the fact that the performance of add is deci
