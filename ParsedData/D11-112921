nce O is commutative, this provides us with a distributional version of the type-logical meaning of the sentence: point-wise multiplication of the meaning of the verb to the Kronecker product of its subject and object: &#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8594; &#8722;&#8722;&#8594;sub verb obj = verb O (&#8722;&#8594; sub &#174; obj) This mathematical operation can be informally described as a structured &#8216;mixing&#8217; of the information of the subject and object, followed by it being &#8216;filtered&#8217; through the information of the verb applied to them, in order to produce the information of the sentence.
    In the transitive case, 5 = N &#174; N, hence &#8594;&#8722;s t = &#8594;&#8722;n i &#174; &#8594;&#8722;n j.
    More generally, the vector space corresponding to the abstract sentence space 5 is the concrete tensor space (N &#174; ... &#174; N) for m the dimension of the matrix of the &#8216;verb&#8217;.
    As we have seen above, in practice we do not need to build th
