    The injective property of TBMs implies that whenever two (interpolated) chains overlap in the x or y dimensions, but are not identical in the region of overlap, then one of the chains must be wrong.
    To resolve such conflicts, SIMR employs a postprocessing algorithm to eliminate conflicting chains one at a time, until all remaining chains are pairwise consistent.
    The conflict resolution algorithm is based on the heuristic that chains that conflict with a larger number of other chains are more likely to be wrong.
    The algorithm sorts all chains with respect to how many other chains they conflict with, and eliminates them in this sort order, one at a time, until no conflicts remain.
    Whenever two or more chains are tied in the sort order, the conflict resolution algorithm eliminates all but the chain with the least point dispersal.

    To ensure that SIMR rejects spurious chains, the maximum angle deviation threshold must be set low.
    However, like any
