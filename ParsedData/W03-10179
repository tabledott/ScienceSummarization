by applying Bayes&#8217; rule and assuming conditional independence of the features.
    Although Naive Bayes can be outperformed in text classification tasks by more complex methods such as SVMs, Pang et al. (2002) report similar performance for Naive Bayes and other machine learning techniques for a similar task, that of distinguishing between positive and negative reviews at the document level.
    Further, we achieved such high performance with Naive Bayes (see Section 8) that exploring additional techniques for this task seemed unnecessary.
  
  
    We developed three different approaches to classify opinions from facts at the sentence level.
    To avoid the need for obtaining individual sentence annotations for training and evaluation, we rely instead on the expectation that documents classified as opinion on the whole (e.g., editorials) will tend to have mostly opinion sentences, and conversely documents placed in the factual category will tend to have mostly factual sentences.
