nt template consists of perpetrator, date, location and victim.
    With the extraction patterns based on the PredicateArgument model, only perpetrator and victim can be extracted.
    The location (downtown Jerusalem) is embedded as a modifier of the noun (heart) within the prepositional phrase, which is an adjunct of the main predicate, triggered3.
    Furthermore, it is not clear whether the extracted entities are related to the same event, because of the clausal boundaries.4 Chain model Our previous work, the Chain model (Sudo et al., 2001)5 attempts to remedy the limitations of the Predicate-Argument model.
    The extraction patterns generated by the Chain model are any chain-shaped paths in the dependency tree.6 Thus it successfully avoids the clausal boundary and embedded entity limitation.
    We reported a 5% gain in recall at the same precision level in the MUC-6 management succession task compared to the Predicate-Argument model.
    However, the Chain model also has its own weakness in terms of a
