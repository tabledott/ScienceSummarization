n challenges for the joint segmentation and POS tagging system is the decoding algorithm.
    The speed and accuracy of the decoder is important for the perceptron learning algorithm, but the system faces a very large search space of combined candidates.
    Given the linear model and feature templates, exact inference is very hard even with dynamic programming.
    Experiments with the standard beam-search decoder described in (Zhang and Clark, 2007) resulted in low accuracy.
    This beam search algorithm processes an input sentence incrementally.
    At each stage, the incoming character is combined with existing partial candidates in all possible ways to generate new partial candidates.
    An agenda is used to control the search space, keeping only the B best partial candidates ending with the current character.
    The algorithm is simple and efficient, with a linear time complexity of O(BTn), where n is the size of input sentence, and T is the size of the tag set (T = 1 for pure word segmentation).
