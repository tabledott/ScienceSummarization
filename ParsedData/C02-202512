or the following subsets: sentences (i) for which the annotator rejected all analyses (no active trees), (ii) where annotation resulted in exactly one preferred analysis (one active tree), (iii) those where full disambiguation was not accomplished through the first round of annotation (more than one active tree), and (iv) massively ambiguous sentences that have yet to be annotated.2 3 Early Experimental Results Development of the treebank has just started.
  Nonethe- less, we have performed some preliminary experiments on concrete applications to motivate the utility of the re- source being developed.
  In this section, we describe ex- periments using the Redwoods treebank to build and test systems for parse disambiguation.
  As a component, we build a tagger for the HPSG lexical tags in the treebank, and report results on this application as well.
  Any linguistic system that allows multiple parses of strings must address the problem of selecting from among the admitted parses the preferred one.
