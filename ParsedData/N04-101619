from the BNC.
    These were randomly partitioned into a training (90%) and test corpus (10%).
    The test corpus contained 26,271 adjective pairs.
    Given that submitting 26,271 queries to Altavista would be fairly timeconsuming, a random sample of 1000 sequences was obtained from the test corpus and the web frequencies of these pairs were retrieved.
    The best Altavista model significantly outperformed the best BNC model, as indicated in Table 7.
    We also found that there was no significant difference between the best Altavista model and the best model reported by Malouf, a supervised method using positional probability estimates from the BNC and morphological variants.
  
  
    The first analysis task we consider is the syntactic disambiguation of compound nouns, which has received a fair amount of attention in the NLP literature (Pustejovsky et al., 1993; Resnik, 1993; Lauer, 1995).
    The task can be summarized as follows: given a three word compound n1 n3 n3, determine the correct binary brack
