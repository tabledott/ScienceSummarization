y the constraints.
    (Vx)rel(x, In general, where this works, it will lead to the best interpretation.
    We can also coerce from a whole to a part and from an object to its function.
    Hence, Putting it all together, we find that to solve all the local pragmatics problems posed by sentence (2), we must derive the following expression: A compressor(c) A a f ter(ki , ks) A event(ki) A rel(ki, y) A y E {c, e} A event(k2) A rel(k2,a) A alarm(a) A nn(o, a) A lube-oil(o) But this is just the logical form of the sentence4 together with the constraints that predicates impose on their arguments, allowing for coercions.
    That is, it is the first half of our characterization (1) of what it is to interpret a sentence.
    When parts of this expression cannot be derived, assumptions must be made, and these assumptions are taken to be the new information.
    The likelihood of different atoms in this expression being new information varies according to how the information is presented, linguistically.
    The main
