    In practice this means changing the annotation of all the relevant lexical categories in the markedup file.8 The majority of the categories to which this applies are those creating aux relations.
    A related difference between the two resources is that there are more subject relations in CCGbank than DepBank.
    In the previous example, CCGbank has a subject relation between it and consider, and also it and would, whereas DepBank only has the relation between it and consider.
    In practice this means ignoring a number of the subject dependencies output by the CCG parser, which is implemented by annotating the relevant lexical categories plus argument slot in the markedup file with an &#8220;ignore&#8221; marker.
    Another example where the dependencies differ in the two resources is the treatment of relative pronouns.
    For example, in Sen. Mitchell, who had proposed the streamlining, the subject of proposed is Mitchell in CCGbank but who in DepBank.
    Again, we implemented this change by fixin
