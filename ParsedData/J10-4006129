is the rank of the vector space spanned by its mode-n fibers (obviously, for each mode n of the tensor, Rn &lt; In).
    Tucker decomposition approximates the tensor X having n-ranks R1, ... , Rn with X&#732;, a tensor with n-ranks Qn &lt; Rn for all modes n. Unlike the case of SVD, there is no analytical procedure to find the best lower-rank approximation to a tensor, and Tucker decomposition algorithms search for the reduced rank tensor with the best fit (as measured by least square error) iteratively.
    Specifically, we use the memory-efficient MET(1) algorithm of Kolda and Sun (2008) as implemented in the Matlab Tensor Toolbox.10 Kolda and Bader (2009) provide details on Tucker decomposition, its general properties, as well as applications and alternatives.
    SVD is believed to exploit patterns of higher order co-occurrence between the rows and columns of a matrix (Manning and Sch&#168;utze 1999; Turney and Pantel 2010), making row elements that co-occur with two synonymic columns more similar than in
