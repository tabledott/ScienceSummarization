 For instance, it seems reasonable that the object of a noun should receive greater weight in selecting the noun's sense than the verb for which this noun serves as a complement.

    Therefore, these instances should not be considered for the current example, which includes the preposition 'to.'

    This suggests that we should not use an equivalence class when there is enough statistical data for specific tuples.12 6.3.2 Confusing Senses.
    In another example, the Hebrew adjective qatann modified the noun sikkuy, which means 'prospect' or 'chance.'
    The word qatann has several translations, two
