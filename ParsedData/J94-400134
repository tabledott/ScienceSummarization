o the CS node in the next level analysis) or on a bunsetsu after the CS.
    When a CS contains PBs, the analysis of its pre-conjunct does not stop at the detected SB, but continues to the bunsetsus to the left of the SB as follows: If the bunsetsu depends on a certain bunsetsu apart from the KB in the pre-conjunct, the bunsetsu is regarded as a part of the CS, and the extension operation is continued (Figure 13).
    Otherwise the extension operation is stopped.
    The KB is excluded from the candidates for a head, because the head-dependent relation to the KB is handled as the relation to the CS node in the next level analysis.

    In the sentence in Figure 7, the bunsetsu &amp;quot;SONO(the),&amp;quot; which can depend on &amp;quot;KANOUSEI-WO(possibility),&amp;quot; is regarded as contained in the CS, but the bunsetsu &amp;quot;KAISHOU-SURU-TAME-NI-WA(in order to solve),&amp;quot; which accompanies &amp;quot;WA&amp;quot; and a comma, is not contained in the CS, and the extension
