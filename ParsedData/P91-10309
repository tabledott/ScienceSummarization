e verb, and then recompute the unigrarn frequencies.
    This method leaves the order of t-scores nearly intact, though their magnitude is inflated by about 30%.
    To compensate for this, the 1.65 threshold for significance at the 95% level should be adjusted up to about 2.15.
    Consider how we determine attachment for sentence (2).
    We use a t-score derived from the adjusted frequencies in our corpus to decide whether the prepositional phrase into Afganistan is attached to the verb (root) send/V or to the noun (root) soldier/N.
    In our corpus, soldier/N has an adjusted frequency of 1488.5, and send/V has an adjusted frequency of 1706.5; soldier/N occurred in 32 distinct preposition contexts, and send/V in This figure of -8.81 represents a significant association of the preposition into with the verb send, and on this basis, the procedure would (correctly) decide that into should attach to send rather than to soldier.
    Of the 84 send/V into bigrams, 10 were assigned by steps 2 and 3 ('sure attach
