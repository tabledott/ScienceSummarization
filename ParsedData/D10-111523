in large negative values).
    We tried to alleviate this problem by assigning a 0 to composite dimensions where the two input vectors had different signs.
    The resulting performance was better but still below that of mult in original space.
    Thus, in Section 6 we report mult results from the full co-occurrence matrix; reduced space results for all other methods.
    5 Study 1: ANs in semantic space The actual distribution of ANs in the corpus, as recorded by their co-occurrence vectors, is fundamental to what we are doing.
    Our method relies on the hypothesis that the semantics of AN composition does not depend on the independent distribution of adjectives themselves, but on how adjectives transform the distribution of nouns, as evidenced by observed pairs of noun-AN vectors.
    Moreover, coherently with this view, our evaluation below will be based on how closely the models approximate the observed vectors of unseen ANs.
    That our goal in modeling composition should be to approximate the vector
