tions are needed to represent the same underlying semantic class.
    For example consider the case where we we need to represent the following selectional preferences for our corpus of relations: (person, location), (person, organization), and (person, crime).
    Because JointLDA requires a separate pair of multinomials for each topic, it is forced to use 3 separate multinomials to represent the class person, rather than learning a single distribution representing person and choosing 3 different topics for a2.
    This results in poor generalization because the data for a single class is divided into multiple topics.
    In order to address this problem while maintaining the sharing of influence between a1 and a2, we next present LinkLDA, which represents a compromise between IndependentLDA and JointLDA.
    LinkLDA is more flexible than JointLDA, allowing different topics to be chosen for a1, and a2, however still models the generation of topics from the same distribution for a given relation.
