ences (e.g. topicalization, voice alternations) or more local pragmatic choices (e.g. adverb or prepositional phrase placement).
			These categories do not cover all possible alternations between pairs of paraphrased sentences; moreover, categories often overlap in the same sequence of words.
			It is common, for example, to find instances of clausal Reordering combined with Synonymy.
			Figure 2 shows a hand-aligned paraphrase pair taken from the F2 data.
			This pair displays one Spelling alternation (defence / defense), one Reordering (position of the ?since?
			phrase), and one example of Elaboration (terror attacks occurs in only one sentence).
			To quantify the differences between L12 and F2, we randomly chose 100 sentence pairs from each dataset and counted the number of times each phenomenon was encountered.
			A given sentence pair might exhibit multiple instances of a single phenomenon, such as two phrasal paraphrase changes or two synonym replacements.
			In this case all instances were counted.
