positional phrase attachment (Brill and Resnik, 1994), and a bracketing parser (Brill, 1993b).
    All of these provided performance comparable to or better than previous attempts.
    Transformation-based learning has also been successfully applied to text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), morphological disambiguation (Oflazer and Tur, 1996), and phrase parsing (Vilain and Day, 1996).
    Word segmentation can easily be cast as a transformation-based problem, which requires an initial model, a goal state into which we wish to transform the initial model (the &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot;), and a series of transformations to effect this improvement.
    The transformation-based algorithm involves applying and scoring all the possible rules to training data and determining which rule improves the model the most.
    This rule is then applied to all applicable sentences, and the process is repeated until no rule improves the score of the training data.
    In this manner a sequence of rules is built for
