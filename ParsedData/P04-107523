    We propose a multi-criteria-based approach to select examples based on their informativeness, representativeness and diversity, which are incorporated all together by two strategies (local and global).
    Experiments show that, in both MUC6 and GENIA, both of the two strategies combining the three criteria outperform the single criterion (informativeness).
    The labeling cost can be significantly reduced by at least 80% comparing with the supervised learning.
    To our best knowledge, this is not only the first work to report the empirical results of active learning for NER, but also the first work to incorporate the three criteria all together for selecting examples.
    Although the current experiment results are very promising, some parameters in our experiment, such as the batch size K and the X in the function of strategy 2, are decided by our experience in the domain.
    In practical application, the optimal value of these parameters should be decided automatically based on the training process
