 selection, presumably because in later stages relatively infrequent features are being selected.
    Even so, there are still savings of a factor of almost 50 in the early stages of the method.
  
  
    Charniak (2000) describes a parser which incorporates additional features into a previously developed parser, that of Charniak (1997).
    The method gives substantial improvements over the original parser and results which are very close to the results of the boosting method we have described in this article (see section 5 for experimental results comparing the two methods).
    Our features are in many ways similar to those of Charniak (2000).
    The model in Charniak (2000) is quite different, however.
    The additional features are incorporated using a method inspired by maximum-entropy models (e.g., the model of Ratnaparkhi [1997]).
    Ratnaparkhi (1997) describes the use of maximum-entropy techniques applied to parsing.
    Log-linear models are used to estimate the conditional probabilities P(di I
