			baseline.
			An expla nation might lay in that the gold-standard was based on the coarse-grained OntoNotes senses.
			We also noticed that some words had hundreds of instancesand only a single sense.
			We suspect that the partic ipating systems would have beaten all baselines if a fine-grained sense inventory like WordNet had been used, as was customary in previous WSD evaluation exercises.
			Supervised evaluation seems to be more neutral regarding the number of clusters, as the ranking of systems according to this measure include diverse cluster averages.
			Each of the induced clusters is mapped into a weighted vector of senses, and thus inducing a number of clusters similar to the number of senses is not a requirement for good results.
			With this measure some of the systems3 are able to beat all baselines.
