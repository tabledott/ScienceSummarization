    Some caveats about this measure: correlate with the more established method of ranking translations relative to each other for all the language pairs.5 Please also note that the number of corrected translations per system are very low for some language pairs, as low as 23 corrected sentences per system for the language pair English&#8211;French.
    C? indicates constrained condition, meaning only using the supplied training data and possibly standard monolingual linguistic tools (but no additional corpora).
    &#8226; indicates a win in the category, meaning that no other system is statistically significantly better at p-levelG0.1 in pairwise comparison.
    &#65533; indicates a constrained win, no other constrained system is statistically better.
    For all pairwise comparisons between systems, please check the appendix.
    Given these low numbers, the numbers presented in Figure 6 should not be read as comparisons between systems, but rather viewed as indicating the s
