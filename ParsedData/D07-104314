up of the clusters beyond the majority class is not evaluated by F-Measure.
			Solution B is a better clustering solution than solution A, in terms of both homogeneity (crudely, ?each cluster contains fewer2 classes?)
			and completeness (?each class is containedin fewer clusters?).
			Indeed, the V-Measure of so lution B (0.387) is greater than that of solution A (0.135).
			Solutions C and D represent a case in which not every cluster is considered in the evaluation of F-Measure.
			In this example, the F-Measure of both solutions is 0.5 (the harmonic mean of 35 and 37 ).
			The small ?unmatched?
			clusters are not measured at allin the calculation of F-Measure.
			Solution D is a bet ter clustering than solution C ? there are no incorrect clusterings of different classes in the small clusters.
			V-Measure reflects this, solution C has a V-measure of 0.30 while the V-measure of solution D is 0.41.
			A second class of clustering evaluation techniquesis based on a combinatorial approach which examines the
