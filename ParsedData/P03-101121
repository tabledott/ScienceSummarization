    Results in terms of alignment error rate indicate that the clone operation results in better alignments in both cases.
    On our Korean-English corpus, we found roughly equivalent performance for the unstructured IBM models, and the both the tree-to-string and tree-totree models when using cloning.
    To our knowledge these are the first results in the literature for tree-to-tree statistical alignment.
    While we did not see a benefit in alignment error from using syntactic trees in both languages, there is a significant practical benefit in computational efficiency.
    We remain hopeful that two trees can provide more information than one, and feel that extensions to the &#8220;loosely&#8221; tree-based approach are likely to demonstrate this using larger corpora.
    Another important question we plan to pursue is the degree to which these results will be borne out with larger corpora, and how the models may be refined as more training data is available.
    As one example, our tree repres
