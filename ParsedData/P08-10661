ample, Chiang (2007) showed that the Hiero system achieved about 1 to 3 point improvement in BLEU on the NIST 03/04/05 Chinese-English evaluation sets compared to a start-of-the-art phrasal system.
    Our work extends the hierarchical MT approach.
    We propose a string-to-dependency model for MT, which employs rules that represent the source side as strings and the target side as dependency structures.
    We restrict the target side to the so called wellformed dependency structures, in order to cover a large set of non-constituent transfer rules (Marcu et al., 2006), and enable efficient decoding through dynamic programming.
    We incorporate a dependency language model during decoding, in order to exploit long-distance word relations which are unavailable with a traditional n-gram language model on target strings.
    For comparison purposes, we replicated the Hiero decoder (Chiang, 2005) as our baseline.
    Our stringto-dependency decoder shows 1.48 point improvement in BLEU and 2.53 point improvement
