  Inducing Syntactic Categories By Context Distribution Clustering
  
    This paper addresses the issue of the automatic induction of syntactic categories from unannotated corpora.
    Previous techniques give good results, but fail to cope well with ambiguity or rare words.
    An algorithm, context distribution clustering (CDC), is presented which can be naturally extended to handle these problems.
  
  
    In this paper I present a novel program that induces syntactic categories from comparatively small corpora of unlabelled text, using only distributional information.
    There are various motivations for this task, which affect the algorithms employed.
    Many NLP systems use a set of tags, largely syntactic in motivation, that have been selected according to various criteria.
    In many circumstances it would be desirable for engineering reasons to generate a larger set of tags, or a set of domain-specific tags for a particular corpus.
    Furthermore, the construction of cognitive models of langua
