of the tokens for an ambiguous word are in the category in question), and by 1/8 for p &lt; 0.01, VOLSUNGA uses the RTP value itself as a factor in the equation which defines probability.
    Fourth, VOLSUNGA uses no tag triples and no idioms.
    Because of this, manually constructing specialcase lists is not necessary.
    These methods are useful in certain cases, as the accuracy figures for CLAWS show; but the goal here was to measure the accuracy of a wholly algorithmic tagger on a standard corpus.
    Interestingly, if the introduction of idiom tagging were to make as much difference for VOLSUNGA as for CLAWS, we would have an accuracy of 99%.
    This would be an interesting extension.
    I believe that the reasons for VOLSUNGA's 96% accuracy without idiom tagging are (a) the change in definition of &amp;quot;optimal path&amp;quot;, and (b) the increased precision of RTPs.
    The difference in tag-set size may also be a factor; but most of the difficult cases are major class differences, such as noun
