uning threshold t,.
    There is some computational overhead in expanding a partial hypothesis for the GE constraint because the finite-state control has to be handled.
    No results are obtained for the S3 constraint and the coverage threshold t, = 17.5 because of memory restrictions.
    The number of search errors is reduced as the cardinality pruning threshold is increased.
    Again, it is difficult to verify search errors by looking at the reference translation probabilities alone.
    Both coverage and cardinality pruning are more efficient for the GE reordering constraint than for the S3 reordering constraint.
    For the S3 constraint, no translation results are obtained for a coverage threshold t, &gt; 5.0 without cardinality pruning applied because of memory and computing time restrictions.
    For the GE constraint virtually a full search can be carried out where only observation pruning is applied: Identical target translations and translation probabilities are produced for the hypothesis files
