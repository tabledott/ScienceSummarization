ses from 2.772 to 2.252, while the average number of modifier crossings increases from 0.516 to 0.86.
    We see similar behavior when we look at the percentage of crossings per chance (Tables 6 and 7).
    For the same alignment type, the percentage of head crossings decreases from 18.61% to 15.12%, while the percentage of modifier crossings increases from 8.47% to 10.59%.
    One thing to note, however, is that the total number of crossings of both types detected in the corpus decreases as compared to the baseline, and thus the benefits to head crossings outweigh the detriments to modifier crossings.
    Our intuitions about the cohesion of syntactic structures follow from the notion that translation, as a meaning-preserving operation, preserves the dependencies between words, and that syntactic structures encode these dependencies.
    Therefore, dependency structures should cohere as well as, or better than, their corresponding syntactic structures.
    To examine the validity of this, we extracted depend
