he alignment algorithm we have described produces very satisfactory results, even when applied to relatively free translations.
    There are doubtless many places in which the algorithm itself could be improved.
    For example, it is clear that the present method of building the SAT favors associations between long sentences, and this is not surprising, because there is more information in long sentences.
    But we have not investigated the extent of this bias and we do not therefore know it as appropriate.
    The present algorithm rests on being able to identify one-to-one associations between certain words, notably technical terms and proper names.
    It is clear from a brief inspection of Table 2 that very few correspondences are noticed among everyday words and, when they are, it is usually because those words also have precise technical uses.
    The very few exceptions include &amp;quot;only&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;nur&amp;quot; and 'the&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;die-.&amp;quot; The pair &amp;quot;per&amp;qu
