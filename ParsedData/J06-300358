 recall of 51.1% on the other 184 questions.
    The 184 questions that are not from Claman (2000) seem to be more difficult.
    This indicates that we may be underestimating how well LRA performs, relative to college-bound senior high school students.
    Claman (2000) suggests that the analogy questions may be somewhat harder than other verbal SAT questions, so we may be slightly overestimating the mean human score on the analogy questions.
    Table 15 gives the 95% confidence intervals for LRA, VSM-AV, and VSM-WMTS, calculated by the Binomial Exact Test (Agresti 1990).
    There is no significant difference between LRA and human performance, but VSM-AV and VSM-WMTS are significantly below human-level performance.
    There are several parameters in the LRA algorithm (see Section 5.5).
    The parameter values were determined by trying a small number of possible values on a small set of questions that were set aside.
    Since LRA is intended to be an unsupervised learning algorithm, we did not attempt to
