he discussion of the normalized al,13 model.
    Thus this figure of merit can be written as: We will refer to this as the prefix estimate.
    The results for the figures of merit introduced in the previous section according to the measurements given in Section 2.2 are shown in Table 2. the geometric-mean-based models with sentence length can be seen clearly.
    Second, when we consider only the two conditional-probability models, we can see that the additional information obtained from context in the prefix estimate gives a substantial improvement in this measure as compared to the trigram estimate.
    However, the CPU time needed to compute the aL term exceeds the time saved by processing fewer edges.
    Note that using this estimate, the parser took over 26,000 seconds to get 95% of the probability mass, while the &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; model can exhaustively parse the test data in less than 5,000 seconds.
    Figure 8 shows the average CPU time for each sentence length.
    While chart parsing and
