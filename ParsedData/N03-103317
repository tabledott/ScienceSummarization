t, if one wishes to condition on two neighboring nodes (using two sets of 2-tag features), the symmetric bidirectional model is superior.
    High-performance taggers typically also include joint three-tag counts in some way, either as tag trigrams (Brants, 2000) or tag-triple features (Ratnaparkhi, 1996, Toutanova and Manning, 2000).
    Models LL, RR, and CR use only the vertical features and a single set of tag-triple features: the left tags (t&#8722;2, t&#8722;1 and t0), right tags (t0, t+1, t+2), or centered tags (t&#8722;1, t0, t+1) respectively.
    Again, with roughly equivalent feature sets, the left context is better than the right, and the centered context is better than either unidirectional context. line for this task high, while substantial annotator noise creates an unknown upper bound on the task.
    Lexicalization has been a key factor in the advance of statistical parsing models, but has been less exploited for tagging.
    Words surrounding the current word have been occasionally used in t
