erences between the correlation coefficients for the Web counts and the correlation coefficients for the BNC counts were significant.
    For the adjective-noun bigrams, the AltaVista coefficient was significantly higher than the BNC coefficient (t(87) = 1.76, p &lt; .05), whereas the difference between the Google coefficient and the BNC coefficient failed to reach significance.
    For the noun-noun bigrams, both the AltaVista and the Google coefficients were significantly higher than the BNC coefficient (t(87) = 3.11, p &lt; .01 and t(87) = 2.95, p &lt; .01).
    Also, for the verb-object bigrams, both the AltaVista coefficient and the Google coefficient were significantly higher than the BNC coefficient (t(87) = 2.64, p &lt; .01 and t(87) = 2.32, p &lt; .05).
    A similar picture was observed for the NANTC counts.
    Again, the Web counts outperformed the corpus counts in predicting plausibility.
