inguistically and empirically motivated theory can be worked out, suggesting what kinds of rules should be extracted given an input phrase pair.
    For example, most function words and headwords can be kept in abstract rules as features.
    In addition, word alignment is a hard constraint in our rule extraction.
    We will study direct structure alignments to reduce the impact of word alignment errors.
    We are also interested in comparing our method with the forestto-string model (Liu et al., 2007).
    Finally, we would also like to study unsupervised learningbased bilingual parsing for SMT.
