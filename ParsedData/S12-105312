8221; judgments falls in a length diff range where the distribution of the four classes is more uniform (see Figure 2).
    Similar reasons can justify the fact that &#8220;backward&#8221; entailment results are consistently higher on all datasets.
    Compared with &#8220;forward&#8221; entailment, these judgments are in fact less scattered across the entire length diff range (i.e. less intermingled with the other classes).
  
  
    A rough classification of the approaches adopted by participants can be made along two orthogonal dimensions, namely: Concerning the former dimension, most of the systems (6 out of 10) adopted a pivoting approach, relying on Google Translate (4 systems), Microsoft Bing Translator (1), or a combination of Google, Bing, and other MT systems (1) to produce English T2s.
    Regarding the latter dimension, the compositional approach was preferred to multi-class classification (6 out of 10).
    The best performing system relies on a &#8220;hybrid&#8221; approach (combining monolingua
