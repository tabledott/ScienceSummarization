node is either a major-node or a subnode.
    A major-node shows a pairing of a subtree of and a substring of.
    A subnode shows a selection of a value for the subtree-substring pair (Figure 3).
    Let be a substring of from the word with length.
    Note this notation is different from (Brown et al., 1993).
    A subtree is a subtree of below the node.
    We assume that a subtree is .
    A major-node is a pair of a subtree and a substring.
    The root of the graph is , where is the length of.
    Each majornode connects to several-subnodes .
    A-subnode connects to a finalnode with weight P if is a terminal node , showing which value of is selected.
    The arc between and has weight in .
    If is a non-terminal node, a-subnode connects to several -subnodes , showing a selection of a value.
    The weight of the arc is P .
    A-subnode is then connected to -subnodes .
    The partition variable, , shows a particular way of partitioning.
    A -subnode is then connected to major-nodes which correspo
