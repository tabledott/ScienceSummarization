rs whereas WordNet prediction is a task which requires high recall neighbours.
    Accordingly, it is not clear how a single (unparameterised) similarity measure could give optimum results on both tasks.
    In the future, we intend to extend the work to the characterisation of other tasks and other existing similarity measures.
    As well as their, usually implicit, use of precision and recall, the main difference between existing similarity measures will be the models in which precision and recall are defined.
    We have explored two such models here - a combinatorial model and a MIbased model - and have shown that the MIbased model achieves significantly improved results over the combinatorial model.
    We propose to investigate other models such as the probabilistic one given in Section 2.3.
