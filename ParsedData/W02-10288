become available for consideration.
    To achieve this effect, we increment the value of N by one after each bootstrapping iteration.
    This ensures that there is always at least one new pattern contributing words to the candidate word pool on each successive iteration.
    The next step is to score the candidate words.
    For each word, Basilisk collects every pattern that extracted the word.
    All extraction patterns are used during this step, not just the patterns in the pattern pool.
    Initially, we used a scoring function that computes the average number of category members extracted by the patterns.
    The formula is: where Pi is the number of patterns that extract wordi, and Fj is the number of distinct category members extracted by pattern j.
    A word receives a high score if it is extracted by patterns that also have a tendency to extract known category members.
    As an example, suppose the word &#8220;Peru&#8221; is in the candidate word pool as a possible location.
    Basilisk finds a
