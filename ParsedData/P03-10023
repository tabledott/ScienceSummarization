gm that is based on predicate-argument structures identified automatically by two different methods: (1) the statistical method reported in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002); and (2) a new method based on inductive learning which obtains 17% higher Fscore over the first method when tested on the same data.
    The accuracy enhancement of predicate argument recognition determines up to 14% better IE results.
    These results enforce our claim that predicate argument information for IE needs to be recognized with high accuracy.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 reports on the parser that produces predicate-argument labels and compares it against the parser introduced in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002).
    Section 3 describes the pattern-free IE paradigm and compares it against FSA-based IE methods.
    Section 4 describes the integration of predicate-argument parsers into the IE paradigm and compares the results against a FSA-based IE system.
    Section 5 summarizes the conclusions.
