erify the soundness and completeness of category operations based on one-to-one mapping of the conditions in the definitions of corresponding operations on dependency structures and on categories.
    Suppose we have a dependency tree for a red apple, where both a and red depend on apple.
    There are two ways to compute the category of this string from the bottom up. cat(Da red apple) = LA(cat(Da),LA(cat(Dred),cat(Dapple))) = LA(LC(cat(Da), cat(Dred)), cat(Dapple)) Based on Theorem 2, it follows that combinatory operation of categories has the confluence property, since the result dependency structure is determined.
    Corollary 1 (confluence) The category of a wellformed dependency tree does not depend on the order of category calculation.
    With categories, we can easily track the types of dependency structures and constrain operations in decoding.
    For example, we have a rule with dependency structure find +&#8212; X, where X right adjoins to find.
    Suppose we have two floating structures2, We c
