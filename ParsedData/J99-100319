mentation threshold the Longest Common Subsequence Ratio (LCSR).
    The LCSR of two tokens is the ratio of the length of their longest (not necessarily contiguous) common subsequence (LCS) and the length of the longer token.
    In symbols, For example, gouvernement, which is 12 characters long, has 10 characters that appear in the same order in government.
    So, the LCSR for these two words is 10/12.
    On the other hand, the LCSR for conseil and conservative is only 6/12.
    A simple dynamic programming algorithm (Bellman 1957) can compute the LCS in 0(n2).
    A rather more complicated algorithm can compute it in 0(n log log n) time on average (Hunt and Szymanski 1977).
    When dealing with language pairs that have different alphabets, the matching predicate can employ phonetic cognates.
    When language Ll borrows a word from language L2, the word is usually written in L1 similarly to the way it sounds in L2.
    Thus, French and Russian /p0rtmana/ are cognates, as are English /sIstam/ and Japanese
