of the type targeted by our system.
			For example, the original choice of preposition made in the native text would serve as supervision for the evaluation of the preposition module.
			Human evaluation is performed on non native text, with a human rater assessing each suggestion provided by the system.
			5.1 Individual SP Modules.
			For evaluation, we split the original training data discussed in section 4.1 into training and test sets (70%/30%).
			We then retrained the classifiers on this reduced training set and applied them to the held-out test set.
			Since there are two models, one for preposition/determiner presence and absence (pa), and one for preposition/determiner choice (ch), we report combined accuracy numbers of the two classifiers.
			Votes(a) stands for the counts of votes for class value = absence from pa, votes(p) stands for counts of votes for presence from pa. Acc(pa) is the accuracy of the pa classifier, acc(ch) the accuracy of the choice classifier.
			Combined accuracy is defined as
