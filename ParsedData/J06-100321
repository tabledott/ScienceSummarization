?, which in an IS-A taxonomy can be determined by inspecting the relative position of the most-specific concept that subsumes them both.
  This intuition seems to be indirectly captured by edge-counting methods (such as that of Rada and colleagues; section 2.4 above), in that ?if the minimal path of IS-A links between two nodes is long, that means it is necessary to go high in the taxonomy, to more abstract concepts, in order to find a least upper bound?.
  An example given by Resnik is the difference in the relative positions of the most-specific subsumer of nickel and dime ?
  and that of nickel and credit card ?
  medium of exchange, as seen in Figure 1.
  In mathematical terms, for any concept c in the taxonomy, let p(c) be the probabil- ity of encountering an instance of concept c. Following the standard definition from information theory, the information content of c, IC(c), is then ?
  Thus, we can define the semantic similarity of a pair of concepts c1 and c2, as simR(c1, c2) = ?
  log p(lso(c1, c2)).
