.
    The following preliminary results can be considered for incorporation in such a model.
    First, segment-initial utterances differ from medial and final utterances in both prominence and rhythmic properties.
    Segment-medial and segment-final utterances are distinguished more clearly by rhythmic features, primarily pause.
    Finally, all correlations found for global parameters can also be computed based on relative change in acoustic-prosodic parameters in a window of two phrases.
    Ongoing research is addressing the development of automatic classification algorithms for discourse boundary type; the role of prosody in conveying hierarchical relationships among discourse segments; individual speaker differences; and discourse segmentation methods that can be used by naive subjects.
