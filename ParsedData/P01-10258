s where and (marked by vertical lines).
    The dotted horizontal line represents the percentage of true collocations in the base set.
    This value corresponds to the expected precision value for random selection, and provides a baseline for the interpretation of the precision curves.
    General findings from the precision graphs are: (i) It is only useful to consider the first halves of the SLs, as the measures approximate afterwards.
    (ii) Precision of log-likelihood, , t-test and frequency strongly decreases in the first part of the SLs, whereas precision of remains almost constant (cf.
    Figure 1) or even increases slightly (cf.
    Figure 2).
    (iii) The identification results are instable for the first few percent of the data, with log-likelihood, t-test and frequency stabilizing earlier than and , and the PNV data 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% stabilizing earlier than the AdjN data.
    This instability is caused by &#8220;random fluctuations&#8221;, i.e., whether a particular T
