    When the goal is domain-independent generation, we need to investigate methods for producing reasonable output in the absence of a large part of the information traditionally available to the lexical chooser.
  
  
    Two strategies have been used in lexical choice when knowledge gaps exist: selection of a default,4 and random choice among alternatives.
    Default choices have the advantage that they can be carefully chosen to mask knowledge gaps to some extent.
    For example, PENMAN defaults article selection to the and tense to present, so it will produce The dog chases the cat in the absence of definiteness information.
