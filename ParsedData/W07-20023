			All WSID algorithms need some addition in orderto be evaluated.
			One alternative is to manually de cide the correctness of the clusters assigned to each occurrence of the words.
			This approach has twomain disadvantages.
			First, it is expensive to manually verify each occurrence of the word, and dif ferent runs of the algorithm need to be evaluatedin turn.
			Second, it is not an easy task to manu ally decide if an occurrence of a word effectively corresponds with the use of the word the assignedcluster refers to, especially considering that the person is given a short list of words
