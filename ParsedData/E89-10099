eliefs can be viewed more generally as a technique for providing a semantics for a declarative notion of inference by default (cf.
    Touretzky 1986, p34; Evans 1987).
    We begin with some auxiliary definitions.
    The expression PAQ, where P and Q are paths, denotes the path formed by concatenating components of P and Q.
    A path P2 is an extension of a path P1 iff there is a path Q such that P2 = P1AQ.
    P2 is a strict extension if Q is nonempty.
    We also use the A operator to denote extension of all the paths in a DATR sentence, as in the following examples: Given a sentence S, we define the root of S to be the [node]:[path] expression appearing to the left of the equality (`==' or `=') in S (for example the root of 'N:P =--- V.' is 'N:P)'.
    The root does not correspond to any syntactic category defined above: it is simply a substring of the sentence.
    Given a set of sentences in DATR, T, a node N and a path P. we say N:P is specified in q- if 'T contains a definitional sentence S whose ro
