riance s2 of the individual sentence judgements xi: The extend of the confidence interval [x&#8722;d, x+df can be computed by d = 1.96 &#183;&#65533;n (6) Pairwise Comparison: As for the automatic evaluation metric, we want to be able to rank different systems against each other, for which we need assessments of statistical significance on the differences between a pair of systems.
    Unfortunately, we have much less data to work with than with the automatic scores.
    The way we cant distinction between system performance.
    Automatic scores are computed on a larger tested than manual scores (3064 sentences vs. 300&#8211;400 sentences). collected manual judgements, we do not necessarily have the same sentence judged for both systems (judges evaluate 5 systems out of the 8&#8211;10 participating systems).
    Still, for about good number of sentences, we do have this direct comparison, which allows us to apply the sign test, as described in Section 2.2.
