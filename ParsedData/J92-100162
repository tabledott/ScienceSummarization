    Since most semantic preferences appear at this level (and those that do not, do not depend on syntactic analysis), the results of this tagging are encouraging.
    This example also shows some of the limitations of our system in practice.
    The system is unable to recognize the collocation &amp;quot;hold on to&amp;quot; in the first sentence, because it lacks a pattern for it.
    The system also lacks patterns for the collocations &amp;quot;vote on&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;all-time players&amp;quot; that occur in the second sentence, and as a result, mistakenly tags on as c-temporal-proximity-rel rather than something more appropriate, such as c-purpose-r el.
    These difficulties point out the need for even more knowledge.
    It is encouraging to note that, even if our encoding scheme is not entirely &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; according to human intuition, as long as it is consistent, in theory it should lead to capabilities that are no worse, with zero customization, than word-based methods for inf
