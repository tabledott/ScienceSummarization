asure and weight functions are independent of each other.
    Therefore, we have evaluated the weight functions using the JACCARD measure, and evaluated the measure functions using the TTEST weight because they produced the best results in our previous experiments.
    Table 4 presents the results of evaluating the measure functions.
    The best performance across all measures was shared by JACCARD and DICE&#8224;, which produced identical results for the 70 words.
    DICE&#8224; is easier to compute and is thus the preferred measure function.
    Table 5 presents the results of evaluating the weight functions.
    Here TTEST significantly outperformed the other weight functions, which supports our intuition that good context descriptors are also strong collocates of the term.
    Surprisingly, the other collocation discovery functions did not perform as well, even though TTEST is not the most favoured for collocation discovery because of its behaviour at low frequency counts.
