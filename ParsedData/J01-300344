ost errors.
    Finally, although the general pattern of higher values for the ANIM feature of unergatives and object-drop verbs is preserved in the automatic counts, the feature is underestimated for almost all the verbs, again making the values for that feature closer across the classes than they are in reality.
    We conclude that, although there are inaccuracies in all the counts, the general patterns expected based on our analysis of the verb classes hold in both the manual and automatic counts.
    Errors in the estimating and counting procedures are therefore not likely to be responsible for the pattern of data in Table 6 above, which generally matches our predictions.
    Furthermore, the errors, at least for this random sample of verbs, occur in a direction that makes our task of distinguishing the classes more difficult, and indicates that developing more accurate search patterns may possibly sharpen the class distinctions, and improve the classification performance.
