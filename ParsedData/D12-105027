hieving state-of-the-art results, Table 6 compares our approach against previous work on the same task and dataset.
    Initial research concentrated on individual words rather than sentential representations.
    Several approaches used WordNet in conjunction with distributional similarity in an attempt to detect meaning conveyed by synonymous words (Islam and Inkpen, 2007; Mihalcea et al., 2006; Fernando and Stevenson, 2008).
    More recently, the addition of syntactic features based on dependency parse trees (Wan et al., 2006; Das and Smith, 2009) has been shown to substantially boost performance.
    The model of Das and Smith (2009), for example, uses quasi-synchronous dependency grammar to model the structure of the sentences involved in the comparison and their correspondences.
    Socher et al. (2011a) obtain an accuracy that is higher than previously published results.
    This model is more sophisticated than the one we used in our experiments (see Table 4 and 5).
    Rather than using the output o
