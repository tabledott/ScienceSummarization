ore noisy than counts obtained from a carefully tagged and chunked or parsed corpus, as the examples in this section show.
    It is therefore essential to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the Web counts generated by our method.
    This is the topic of the next section.
  
  
    Since Web counts can be relatively noisy, as discussed in the previous section, it is crucial to determine whether there is a reliable relationship between Web counts and corpus counts.
    Once this is assured, we can explore the usefulness of Web counts for overcoming data sparseness.
    We carried out a correlation analysis to determine whether there is a linear relationship between BNC and NANTC counts and AltaVista and Google counts.
    All correlation coefficients reported in this article refer to Pearson&#8217;s r.6 All results were obtained on log-transformed counts.7 Table 8 shows the results of correlating Web counts with corpus counts from the BNC, the corpus from which our bigrams were sampled (see Section 2.1).
