			Since our interest is in that has been successfully used is edit distance, a measure of similarity between strings.
			The assumption is that strings separated by a small edit distance will tend to be similar in meaning: The leading indicators measure the economy?
			The leading index measures the economy?.
			Lee &amp; Barzilay (2003), for example, use Multi Sequence Alignment (MSA) to build a corpus of paraphrases involving terrorist acts.
			Their goal is to extract sentential templates that can be used in high-precision generation of paraphrase alter nations within a limited domain.
			Our goal here is rather different: our interest lies in constructing a monolingual broad-domain corpus of pairwise aligned sentences.
			Such data would be amenable to conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques (e.g., those discussed in Och &amp; Ney 2003).2 In what follows we compare two strategies for unsupervised construction of such a corpus, one employing string similarity and the other associati
