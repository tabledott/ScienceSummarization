h v = 1V1 U V21 and e = El, the lowest currently known upper bound on the computational complexity of this problem is 0(ve + v2 log v) (Ahuja, Magnati, and Orlin 1993, 500).
    Although this upper bound is polynomial, it is still too expensive for typical bitexts.1&#176; Subsection 5.1.2 describes a greedy approximation to the MAP approximation.
    5.1.1 Step 1: Initialization.
    Almost every translation model estimation algorithm exploits the well-known correlation between translation probabilities and co-occurrence counts.
    Many algorithms also normalize the co-occurrence counts cooc(u, v) by the marginal frequencies of u and v. However, these quantities account for only the three shaded cells in Table 2.
    The statistical interdependence between two word types can be estimated more robustly by considering the whole table.
    For example, Gale and Church (1991, 154) suggest that &amp;quot;02, a x2-like statistic, seems to be a particularly good choice because it makes good use of the off-diagonal
