    For the PER, it is no longer possible to use a linear time algorithm in the general case.
    Instead, a modification of the Hungarian algorithm (Knuth, 1993) can be used.
    The question is now how to define the worddependent substitution costs.
    We have studied two different approaches.
    A pragmatic approach is to compare the spelling of the words to be substituted with each other.
    The more similar the spelling is, the more similar we consider the words to be, and the lower we want the substitution costs between them.
    In English, this works well with similar tenses of the same verb, or with genitives or plurals of the same noun.
    Nevertheless, a similar spelling is no guarantee for a similar meaning, because prefixes such as &#8220;mis-&#8221;, &#8220;in-&#8221;, or &#8220;un-&#8221; can change the meaning of a word significantly.
    An obvious way of comparing the spelling is the Levenshtein distance.
    Here, words are compared on chara
