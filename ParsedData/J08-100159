ative of both domains, it performs almost as well as a model which has been trained exclusively on in-domain texts (see the row EarthAccid in Table 7).
    To put these results into context, we also considered the cross-domain performance of the content models.
    As Table 7 shows, the decrease in performance is more dramatic for the content models.
    In fact, the model trained on the Earthquakes domain plummets below the random baseline when applied to the Accidents domain.
    These results are expected for content models&#8212;the two domains have little overlap in topics and do not share structural constraints.
    Note that the LSA model is not sensitive to cross-domain issues.
    The semantic space is constructed over many different domains without taking into account style or writing conventions.
    The cross-training performance of the entity-based models is somewhat puzzling: these models are not lexicalized, and one would expect that valid entity transitions are preserved across domains.
