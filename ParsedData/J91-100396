    Though clearly this is a small part of the picture, it seems worth establishing an extensive picture of preference violation and metaphor before moving on to other contextual constraints.
    Collation and the met* method have certain similarities with the comparison view of metaphor, especially in the cell matching process.
    The relevant analogies discovered in CS are indeed, to quote Tourangeau and Sternberg, &amp;quot;a comparison in which one term... is asserted to bear a partial resemblance to something else.&amp;quot; The collation process gives quite a clear picture of the ground and tension in a metaphor.
