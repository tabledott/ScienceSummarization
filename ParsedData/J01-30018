 Section 4.
    In Section 5 we explain the strategy used to evaluate this system, and we report the results in Section 6.
  
  
    A comprehensive review of WSD is beyond the scope of this paper but may be found in Ide and Veronis (1998).
    Combining knowledge sources for WSD is not a new idea; in this section we will review some of the systems which have tried to do that.
    Early work on coarse-grained WSD based on combining knowledge sources was undertaken by McRoy (1992).
    Her work was carried out without the use of machinereadable dictionaries (MRD), necessitating the manual creation of the complex set of lexicons this system requires.
    There was a lexicon of 8,775 unique roots, a hierarchy of 1,000 concepts, and a set of 1,400 collocational patterns.
    The collocational patterns are automatically extracted from a corpus of text in the same domain as the text being disambiguated and senses are manually assigned to each.
    If the collocation occurs in the text being disambiguated, then it i
