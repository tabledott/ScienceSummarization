-2 Mandarin audio collection using character bigrams, as done by Meng et al (2000).
    We performed CLIR using the Chinese translations of the English queries, with and without transliteration of proper names, and compared the standard 11-step mean average precision (mAP) on the TDT-2 audio corpus.
    Our results and the corresponding results from Meng et al (2001) are reported in Table 2.
    Without name transliteration, the performance of the two CLIR systems is nearly identical: a paired t-test shows that the difference in the mAPs of 0.514 and 0.501 is significant only at a -value of 0.74.
    A small improvement in mAP is obtained by the Haircut system with name transliteration over the system without name transliteration: the improvement from 0.501 to 0.515 is statistically significant at a -value of 0.084.
    The statistical significance of the improvement from 0.514 to 0.522 by Meng et al (2001) is not known to us.
    In any event, a need for improvement in transliteration is suggested by this re
