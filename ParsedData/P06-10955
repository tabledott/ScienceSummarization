me time interval.
    An event or time INCLUDES another event or time if the latter occupies a proper subinterval of the former.
    These 6 relations and their inverses map one-toone to 12 of Allen&#8217;s 13 basic relations (Allen 1984)2.
    There has been a considerable amount of activity related to this scheme; we focus here on some of the challenges posed by the TLINK annotation, the part that is directly relevant to the temporal ordering and anchoring problems.
    The annotation of TimeML information is on a par with other challenging semantic annotation schemes, like PropBank, RST annotation, etc., where high inter-annotator reliability is crucial but not always achievable without massive preprocessing to reduce the user&#8217;s workload.
    In TimeML, inter-annotator agreement for time expressions and events is 0.83 and 0.78 (average of Precision and Recall) respectively, but on TLINKs it is 0.55 (P&amp;R average), due to the large number of event pairs that can be selected for comparison.
