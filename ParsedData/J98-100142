5) and the extraction of lists of words and collocations for the study of language acquisition or language teaching (Thorndike 1921; Fries and Traver 1940; Thorndike and Lorge 1938,1944; Gougenheim et al. 1956; etc.).
    Corpora have been used in linguistics since the first half of the twentieth century (e.g., Boas 1940; Fries 1952).
    Some of this work concerns word senses, and it is often strikingly modern: for example, Palmer (1933) studied collocations in English; Lorge (1949) computed sense frequency information for the 570 most common English words; Eaton (1940) compared the frequency of senses in four languages; and Thorndike (1948) and Zipf (1945) determined that there is a positive correlation between the frequency and the number of synonyms of a word, the latter of which is an indication of semantic richness (the more polysemous a word, the more synonyms it has).
    A corpus provides a bank of samples that enable the development of numerical language models, and thus the use of corpora goes hand
