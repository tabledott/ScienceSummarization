			Our work solves a seemingly intractable problemand opens up a number of intriguing potential ap plications.
			Both Callison-Burch et al (2005) and Zhang and Vogel (2005) use suffix arrays to relax the length constraints on phrase-based models.
			Ourwork enables this in hierarchical phrase-based models.
			However, we are interested in additional appli cations.
