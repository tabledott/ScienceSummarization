rated previously established subjectivity clues, and added some new discourse features.
    In this section, we describe all the feature sets and present performance results for subjectivity classifiers trained on different combinations of these features.
    The threshold values and feature representations used in this section are the ones that produced the best results on our separate tuning corpus.
    We defined four features to represent the sets of subjective nouns produced by the bootstrapping algorithms.
    BA-Strong: the set of StrongSubjective nouns generated by Basilisk BA-Weak: the set of WeakSubjective nouns generated by Basilisk MB-Strong: the set of StrongSubjective nouns generated by Meta-Bootstrapping MB-Weak: the set of WeakSubjective nouns generated by Meta-Bootstrapping For each set, we created a three-valued feature based on the presence of 0, 1, or &gt; 2 words from that set.
    We used the nouns as feature sets, rather than define a separate feature for each word, so the classifier co
