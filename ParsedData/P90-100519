 is the size of the domains in a constraint network (Mohr and Henderson 1986).
    Since the number of arcs is at most 0((nk)2), filtering can be performed in 0Unk)2(n1)2), which is 0(n4) without grammatical constants.
    Thus, in CDG parsing with arity 2, both the initial formation of a constraint network and filtering are bounded in 0(n4) time.
  
  
    We have proposed a formal grammar that allows efficient structural disambiguation.
    Grammar rules are constraints on word-to-word modifications, and parsing is done by adding the constraints to a data structure called a constraint network.
    The initial formation of a constraint network and the filtering have a polynomial time bound whereas the weak generative capacity of CDG is strictly greater than that of CFG.
    CDG is actually being used for an interactive Japanese parser of a Japanese-to-English machine translation system for a newspaper domain (Maruyama et. al.
    1990).
    A parser for such a wide domain should make use of any kind of infor
