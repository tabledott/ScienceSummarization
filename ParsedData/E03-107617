    While one of our method reached 99.1% accuracy compared against a gold standard of one-to-one correspondences to English, other methods show superior results in the context of statistical machine translation.
    For this application, we could dramatically improve the translation quality by up to 0.039 points as measured by the BLEU score.
    The words resulting from compound splitting could also be marked as such, and not just treated as regular words, as they are now.
    Future machine translation models that are sensitive to such linguistic clues might benefit even more.
