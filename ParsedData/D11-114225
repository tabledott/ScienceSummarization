    Uninformative tion. extractions had a smaller effect on other systems&#8217; precision, accounting for 4% of WOEp&amp;quot;3&#65533;&#8217;s extractions, 5% of WOEpo3&#8217;s, and 7% of TEXTRUNNER&#8217;s, while only appearing in 1% of REVERB&#8217;s extractions.
    REVERB&#8217;s reduction in uninformative extractions resulted in a boost in recall, capturing many LVC relation phrases missed by other systems (like those shown in Table 2).
    To test the systems&#8217; speed, we ran each extractor on a set of 100, 000 sentences using a Pentium 4 machine with 4GB of RAM.
    The processing times were 16 minutes for REVERB, 21 minutes for TEXTRUNNER, 21 minutes for WOEpo3, and 11 hours for WOEp&#65533;&amp;quot;'.
    The times for REVERB, TEXTRUNNER, and WOEpo3 are all approximately the same, since they all use the same POS-tagging and NP-chunking software.
    WOEp&#65533;.3. processes each sentence with a dependency parser, resulting in much longer processing time.
