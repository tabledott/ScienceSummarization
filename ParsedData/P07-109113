ist rather than a full list of reorderings.
    Starting from the leaves of tS, for each node N covering phrase p, we only keep track of the n p's that have the highest reordering probability.
    Thus R(N) G n. There are at most 2n2 reorderings for any node and only the top-scored n reorderings are recorded.
    The n-best reorderings of S, i.e. the n-best reorderings of the yield of the root node of tS, can be obtained by this efficient bottom-up method.
  
  
    In the last two sections reordering knowledge is learned from and applied to binary parse tree nodes only.
    It is not difficult to generalize the theory of reordering knowledge to nodes of other branching factors.
    The case of binary nodes is simple as there are only two possible reorderings.
    The case of 3-ary nodes is a bit more complicated as there are six.5 In general, an n-ary node has n! possible reorderings of its children.
    The maximum entropy model has the same form as in the binary case, except that there are more classes of
