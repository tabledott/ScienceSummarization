took in the output of an enhanced version of the more traditional, hand-coded &amp;quot;Proteus&amp;quot; namedentity tagger which we entered in MUC-6(Grishman, 1995).
    In addition, subsequent to the evaluation, the University of Manitoba (Lin, 1998) and IsoQuest, Inc. (Krupka and Hausman, 1998) shared with us the outputs of their systems on our training corpora as well as on various test corpora.
    The output sent to us was the standard MUC-7 output, so our collaborators didn't have to do any special processing for us.
    These systems were incorporated into MENE as simply three more history views by the following 2 step process: The result of all this is that the &amp;quot;futures&amp;quot; produced by the three external systems become three &amp;quot;external system histories&amp;quot; for MENE.
    Here is an It is important to note that MENE has features which predict a different future than the future predicted by the external system.
    This can be seen as the process by which MENE learns the er
