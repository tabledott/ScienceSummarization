rence between scope = 5 and scope = MAX for Leacock?Chodorow and between 1 and larger scopes for Lin, Resnik, and Jiang?Conrath; there are no significant differences for Hirst?St-Onge, which hence ap- pears flat overall.
  The values of recall range from just under 6% (Hirst?St-Onge, scope = MAX) to more than 72% (Resnik, scope = 1), with a mean of 39.7%, decreasing with scope, as expected.
  All differences in recall are statistically significant, except between scope = 3 and scope = 5 for all measures other than Resnik?s.
  F ranges from 5% (Hirst?
  St-Onge, scope = MAX) to 14% (Jiang?Conrath, scope = 5), with a mean of just under 35 Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1 Table 4 Precision (PS), recall (RS), and F-measure (FS) for malapropism suspicion with five measures of semantic relatedness, varying the scope of the search for related words to 1, 3, or 5 paragraphs or the complete news article (MAX).
