n the proofs of Theorem 1 and Lemma 4, the functions all return their argument unchanged when p(a) = 0.
    For the induction step, we will merely show that each function maintains the unbound variables and vacuous quantifiers, assuming that all the others do.
    The previous proof of termination provides the well-foundedness of this proof. apply(applicable-term(a),a): We must show that if t= &lt;qxr&gt; is an applicable term in a and U(a)=u and V(a) = v then U(apply(t,a)) = u and V(apply(t,a)) = v as well.
    The unbound variables u in a can be divided into two (possibly overlapping) sets u, and u&#8222; where u, consists of those variables in u that occur in r and u, consists of those variables in u that occur outside of t in a.
    Note that u = u, U u,.
    Now assume x occurs in r. Then U(r) = {x} U u&#8222;U uo where 140 is the set of variables bound within a but outside of t and which occur free in r. But t is an applicable term, and by the definition of &amp;quot;applicable term&amp;quot; uo must be
