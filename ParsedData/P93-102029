A, CA) in using more knowledge.
    CA and PA depend only on the ability to identify boundary sites, potential cue words and pause locations while RA relies on 4 features of NPs to make 3 different tests (Figure 5).
    Unsurprisingly, RA performs most like humans.
    For both CA and PA, the recall is relatively high, but the precision is very low, and the fallout and error rate are both very high.
    For RA, recall and precision are not as different, precision is higher than CA and PA, and fallout and error rate are both relatively low.
    A second dimension to consider in comparing ?Human recall is equivalent to percent agreement for boundaries.
    However, the average shown here represents only 10 narratives, while the average from Table 1 represents all 20. performance is that humans and RA assign boundaries based on a global criterion, in contrast to CA and PA.
    Subjects typically use a relatively gross level of speaker intention.
    By default, RA assumes that the current segment continues, and
