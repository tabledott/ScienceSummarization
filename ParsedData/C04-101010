			Previous work on memory-based learning for deterministic parsing includes Veenstra and Daelemans (2000) and Nivre et al (2004).
			For the experiments reported in this paper, we have used the software package TiMBL (TilburgMemory Based Learner), which provides a vari ety of metrics, algorithms, and extra functions on top of the classical k nearest neighbor classification kernel, such as value distance metrics and distance weighted class voting (Daelemans et al, 2003).The function we want to approximate is a map ping f from configurations to parser actions, where each action consists of a transition and (except for Shift and Reduce) a dependency type: f : Config ? {LA,RA,RE,SH} ?
			(R ? {nil}) Here Config is the set of all configurations and R is the set of dependency types.
			In order to make theproblem tractable, we approximate f with a func tion f?
			whose domain is a finite space of parser states, which are abstractions over confi
