r organization.
    The first occurrence of Tanjug provides ample evidence that it is an organization, however, and by enforcing label consistency the system should be able to get it right.
    We show how to incorporate constraints of this form into a CRF model by using Gibbs sampling instead of the Viterbi algorithm as our inference procedure, and demonstrate that this technique yields significant improvements on two established IE tasks.
    In hidden state sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is standard to use the Viterbi algorithm, a dynamic programming algorithm, to infer the most likely hidden state sequence given the input and the model (see, e.g., Rabiner (1989)).
    Although this is the only tractable method for exact computation, there are other methods for computing an approximate solution.
    Monte Carlo methods are a simple and effective class of methods for approximate inference based on sampling.
    Imagine we have a hidden state sequence model which defines a probability distr
