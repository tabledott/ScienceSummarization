large-scale systems as well as the granularity of their analysis.
    In this work we investigate the viability of polarity lexicons that are derived solely from unlabeled web documents.
    We propose a method based on graph propagation algorithms inspired by previous work on constructing polarity lexicons from lexical graphs (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004; Esuli and Sabastiani, 2009; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2008; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009).
    Whereas past efforts have used linguistic resources &#8211; e.g., WordNet &#8211; to construct the lexical graph over which propagation runs, our lexicons are constructed using a graph built from co-occurrence statistics from the entire web.
    Thus, the method we investigate can be seen as a combination of methods for propagating sentiment across lexical graphs and methods for building sentiment lexicons based on distributional characteristics of phrases in raw data (Turney, 2002).
    The advantage of breaking the dependence on WordNet (or related resourc
