ucture (modulo those distinctions that can be handled with lexical singletons).
    For example, the following sentence pair from our corpus cannot be generated: To make transduction grammars truly useful for bilingual tasks, we must escape the rigid parallel ordering constraint of simple transduction grammars.
    At the same time, any relaxation of constraints must be traded off against increases in the computational complexity of parsing, which may easily become exponential.
    The key is to make the relaxation relatively modest but still handle a wide range of ordering variations.
    The inversion transduction grammar (ITG) formalism only minimally extends the generative power of a simple transduction grammar, yet turns out to be surprisingly effective.1 Like simple transduction grammars, ITGs remain a subset of context-free (syntax-directed) transduction grammars (Lewis and Stearns 1968) but this view is too general to be of much help.'
    The productions of an inversion transduction grammar are inter
