best at the skewed mixtures.
    At merge rates between 20% and 30%, still more then half of the mixtures are separated correctly and can be found when averaging CW&#8217;s outcome over several runs.
    As formally, the algorithm does not converge, it is important to define a stop criterion or to set the number of iterations.
    To show that only a few iterations are needed until almost-convergence, we measured the normalized Mutual Information (MI)1 between the clustering in the 50th iteration and the clusterings of earlier iterations.
    This was conducted for two unweighted SW-graphs with 1,000 (1K) and 10,000 (10K) nodes, M=5 and a weighted 7-lingual co-occurrence graph (cf. section 4.1) with 22,805 nodes and 232,875 edges.
    Table 1 indicates that for unweighted graphs, changes are only small after 20-30 iterations.
    In iterations 40-50, the normalized MI-values do not improve any more.
    The weighted graph converges much faster due to fewer ties and reaches a stable plateau after only 6 iterat
