and the modifier (laser).
    The 600 pairs have been manually labeled with 30 classes of semantic relations.
    For example, &#8220;laser printer&#8221; is classified as instrument; the printer uses the laser as an instrument for printing.
    We approach the task of classifying semantic relations in noun-modifier pairs as a supervised learning problem.
    The 600 pairs are divided into training and testing sets and a testing pair is classified according to the label of its single nearest neighbor in the training set.
    LRA is used to measure distance (i.e., similarity, nearness).
    LRA achieves an accuracy of 39.8% on the 30-class problem and 58.0% on the 5-class problem.
    On the same 600 noun-modifier pairs, the VSM had accuracies of 27.8% (30-class) and 45.7% (5-class) (Turney and Littman 2005).
    We discuss the experimental results, limitations of LRA, and future work in Section 8 and we conclude in Section 9.
  
  
    In this section, we explore connections between attributional and relation
