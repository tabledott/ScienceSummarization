e found this to be detrimental in our experiments since most instances generated by reliable patterns are correct.
    In Espresso, we classify a pattern as generic when it generates more than 10 times the instances of previously accepted reliable patterns.
  
  
    In this section, we present an empirical comparison of Espresso with three state of the art systems on the task of extracting various semantic relations.
    We perform our experiments using the following two datasets: Each corpus is pre-processed using the Alembic Workbench POS-tagger (Day et al. 1997).
    Below we describe the systems used in our empirical evaluation of Espresso.
    For ESP+, we experimentally set i from Section 3.3 to i = 0.4 for TREC and i = 0.3 for CHEM by manually inspecting a small set of instances.
    Espresso is designed to extract various semantic relations exemplified by a given small set of seed instances.
    We consider the standard is-a and part-of relations as well as the following more specific relations: ess
