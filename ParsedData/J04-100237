 describes Met*, a system for interpreting nonliteral language that builds on Wilks (1975) and Wilks (1978).
    Met* discriminates among metonymic, metaphorical, literal, and anomalous language.
    It is a component of collative semantics, a semantics for natural language processing that has been implemented in the program meta5 (Fass, 1986, 1987, 1988).
    Met* treats metonymy as a way of referring to one thing by means of another and metaphor as a way of revealing an interesting relationship between two entities.
    In Met*, a verb&#8217;s selectional preferences are represented as a vector of types.
    The verb drink&#8217;s preference for an animal subject and a liquid object are represented as (animal, drink, liquid).
    Metaphorical interpretations are made by finding a sense vector in Met*&#8217;s knowledge base whose elements are hypernyms of both the preferred argument types and the actual arguments.
    For example, the car drinks gasoline maps to the vector (car, drink, gasoline).
    But car
