node [j], where rule (9) is applied.
    For the application of this rule to terminate, it is necessary that at least either the first two or the last argument of the shuffle condition be instantiated.
    The pivot node must obtain the required store instantiation from the goal node being generated.
    This happens automatically in the rule applicability check that identified the pivot, since the table chained_ nodes identifies the store variables for the goal and pivot nodes.
    Given the sentence store, the shuffle predicate nondeterministically generates every the substores for the constituents subcategorized for by the verb.
    The next interesting event occurs at pivot node [I], where rule (10) is used to absorb the store for the object quantified noun phrase.
    The bound variable for the stored quantifier, in this case s, must be the same as the meaning of the noun phrase and determiner.6 This condition was already used to filter out inappropriate shuffle results when node [l] was selected as pivo
