utJ hungrily Since the elementary trees of a LTAG are minimal syntactic and semantic units, distributional analysis of the combination of these elementary trees based on a training corpus will inform us about relevant statistical aspects of the language such as the classes of words appearing as arguments of a predicative lement, the distribution of the adverbs licensed by a specific verb, or the adjectives licensed by a specific noun.
			This kind of statistical analysis as independently sug- gested in (Resnik, 1991) can be made with LTAGs be- cause of their extended omain of locality but also be- cause of their lexiealized property.
