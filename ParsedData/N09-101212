42;H) and record that A depends on H. The schema omits the rules for right arguments since they are symmetric.
    We show a parse of &#8220;The big dog barks&#8221; in Figure 3.2 Much of the extensions to this work have focused on estimation procedures.
    Klein and Manning (2004) use Expectation Maximization to estimate the model parameters.
    Smith and Eisner (2005) and Smith (2006) investigate using Contrastive Estimation to estimate DMV.
    Contrastive Estimation maximizes the conditional probability of the observed sentences given a neighborhood of similar unseen sequences.
    The results of this approach vary widely based on regularization and neighborhood, but often outperforms EM.
    Smith (2006) also investigates two techniques for maximizing likelihood while incorporating the locality bias encoded in the harmonic initializer for DMV.
    One technique, skewed deterministic annealing, ameliorates the local maximum problem by flattening the likelihood and adding a bias towards the Klein and Man
