    Our new features, and especially the composite ones, are shown to outperform traditional techniques such as TF*IDF [Buckley 1985; Salton 1989] for determining similarity over small text units.
  
  
    Similarity is a complex concept which has been widely discussed in the linguistic, philosophical, and information theory communities.
    For example, Frawley [1992] discusses all semantic typing in terms of two mechanisms: the detection of similarity and difference.
