not let the selection of potential terms be an arbitrary process&#8212;which is the case when extracting n-grams&#8212;and better capture the idea of keywords having a certain linguistic property, I decided to experiment with noun phrases.
    In the next set of experiments a partial parserl was used to select all NP-chunks from the documents.
    Experiments with both unstemmed and stemmed terms were performed.
    This way of defining the terms is in this paper called the chunking approach.
  
  
    As about half of the manual keywords present in the training data were lost using the chunking approach, I decided to define another term selection approach.
    This still captures the idea of keywords having a certain syntactic property, but is based on empirical evidence in the training data.
    A set of POS tag patterns&#8212;in total 56&#8212;were defined, and all (part-of-speech tagged) words or sequences of words that matched any of these were extracted.
    The patterns were those tag sequences of the
