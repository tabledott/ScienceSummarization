llel version of minimum error rate training procedure distributed with Moses.
    The standard procedure of Moses for the estimation of the translation and re-ordering models from a bilingual corpus consists in three main steps: Recently, we enhanced Moses decoder to also output the word-to-word alignment between the input sentence and its translation, given that they have been added to the phrase table at training time.
    Notice that the additional information introduces an overhead in disk usage of about 70%, but practically no overhead at decoding time.
    However, when training translation and re-ordering models from synthetic data generated by the decoder, this feature allows to completely skip the time-expensive step 1.2 We tested the efficiency of this solution for training a translation model on a synthesized corpus of about 300K Spanish sentences and 8.8M running words, extracted from the EuroParl corpus.
    With respect to the standard procedure, the total training time was reduced by almost 50%
