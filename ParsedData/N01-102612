    For independent evaluation data, a 120K-word hand-tagged French dataset generously provided by Universite de Montreal was used.
    However, because both this text stream and tagset had no overlap with parallel data used to train the algorithm, a simple mapping table between the tagsets was defined so that output could be compared on a compatible common denominator.
    An abbreviated version is shown in Table 3:4 The large majority of these compatible divergences in bracketing convention are due to the projection algorithm's tendency to bracket possessive compounds as single NP's (e.g.
    [DT N de N]), and its tendency to bracket simple conjunctive compounds (e.g.
    [DT N et ND also as single NPs, following the Ramshaw and Marcus convention which differed from the French and Chinese goldstandard annotator's intuitions.
    Overall, these translingual projection results are quite encouraging.
    For Chinese, they are similar to Wu's 78% precision result, and especially promising given that
