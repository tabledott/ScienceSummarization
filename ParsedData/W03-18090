  A Statistical Approach To The Semantics Of Verb-Particles
  
    This paper describes a distributional approach to the semantics of verb-particle (e.g.
    We report first on a framework for implementing and evaluating such models.
    We then go on to report on the implementation of some techniques for using statistical models acquired from corpus data to infer the meaning of verb-particle constructions.
  
  
    The semantic representation of multiword expressions (MWEs) has recently become the target of renewed attention, notably in the area of hand-written grammar development (Sag et al., 2002; Villavicencio and Copestake, 2002).
    Such items cause considerable problems for any semantically-grounded NLP application (including applications where semantic information is implicit, such as information retrieval) because their meaning is often not simply a function of the meaning of the constituent parts.
    However, corpus-based or empirical NLP has shown limited interest in the problem.
