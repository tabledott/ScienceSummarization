    Others were derived from corpora, including subjective nouns learned from unannotated data using bootstrapping (Riloff et al., 2003).
    The subjectivity clues are divided into those that are strongly subjective and those that are weakly subjective, using a combination of manual review and empirical results on a small training set of manually annotated data.
    As the terms are used here, a strongly subjective clue is one that is seldom used without a subjective meaning, whereas a weakly subjective clue is one that commonly has both subjective and objective uses.
    The high-precision subjective classifier classifies a sentence as subjective if it contains two or more of the strongly subjective clues.
    On a manually annotated test set, this classifier achieves 91.5% precision and 31.9% recall (that i
