 (2006) and pruning rules with probability below a&#8722;10 reduces the grammar size drastically without influencing parsing performance.
    Some of our methods and conclusions are relevant to all state-split grammars, such as Klein and Manning (2003) or Dreyer and Eisner (2006), while others apply most directly to the hierarchical case.
  
  
    When working with large grammars, it is standard to prune the search space in some way.
    In the case of lexicalized grammars, the unpruned chart often will not even fit in memory for long sentences.
    Several proven techniques exist.
    Collins (1999) combines a punctuation rule which eliminates many spans entirely, and then uses span-synchronous beams to prune in a bottom-up fashion.
    Charniak et al. (1998) introduces best-first parsing, in which a figure-ofmerit prioritizes agenda processing.
    Most relevant to our work is Charniak and Johnson (2005) which uses a pre-parse phase to rapidly parse with a very coarse, unlexicalized treebank grammar.
