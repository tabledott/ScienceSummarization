  Linearization of the fusion sentence involves the selection of the best phrasing and placement of auxiliaries as well as the determination of optimal ordering.
    Since we do not have sufficient semantic information to perform such selection, our algorithm is driven by corpus-derived knowledge.
    We generate all possible sentences10 from the valid traversals of the fusion lattice and score their likelihood according to statistics derived from a corpus.
    This approach, originally proposed by Knight and Hatzivassiloglou (1995) and Langkilde and Knight (1998), is a standard method used in statistical generation.
    We trained a trigram model with Good&#8211;Turing smoothing over 60 megabytes of news articles collected by Newsblaster using the second version CMU&#8211;Cambridge Statistical Language Modeling toolkit (Clarkson and Rosenfeld 1997).
    The sentence with the lowest length-normalized entropy (the best score) is selected as the verbalization of the fusion lattice.
    Table 4 shows several ver
