es from MEDLINE abstracts for the categories such as object, background, conclusions (McKnight and Srinivasan, 2003).
    In addition, early work, (Liddy, 1988) built text grammars for empirical research abstracts categorized and assigned structure concerning rhetorical roles of the sentences.
    However, none of this work addresses the speculative vs. definite distinction we are interested in.
    There has also been some work on constructing test sets for knowledge discovery.
    Several researchers have used the discoveries by Swanson and Smalheiser to test their own algorithms.
    The two problems most commonly used in replication studies (e.g., (Weeber et al., 2001)) are their discovery of a link between Raynauds disease and fish oils (Swanson, 1986) and their discovery of several links between migraine and magnesium (Swanson, 1988).
    The most comprehensive replication to date is (Srinivasan, 2004) which employs eight Swanson and Smalheiser discoveries as a test bed.
