thin this framework, any type of feature can be used, enabling the system designer to experiment with interesting feature types, rather than worry about specific feature interactions.
    In contrast, in a rule based system, the system designer would have to consider how, for instance, a WordNet (Miller, 1995) derived information for a particular example interacts with a part-of-speech-based information and chunking information.
    That is not to say, ultimately, that rule-based systems are in some way inferior to statistical models &#8211; they are built using valuable insight which is hard to obtain from a statistical-modelonly approach.
    Instead, we are just suggesting that the output of such a system can be easily integrated into the previously described framework, as one of the input features, most likely leading to improved performance.
    In addition to using rich lexical, syntactic, and semantic features, we leveraged several pre-existing mention taggers.
    These pre-existing taggers were train
