    Overall, these changes affect 8.7% of all sentences.
    Multi-Word Expressions.
    Under the assumption that every constituent has a lexical head that corresponds to an individual orthographic word, multi-word expressions require an analysis where one of the items subcategorizes for a specific syntactic type that can only correspond to the other lexical item.
    We only attempted an analysis for expressions that are either very frequent or where the multi-word expression has a different subcategorization behavior from the head word of the expression.
    This includes some closed-class items (described in the CCGbank manual), including connectives (e.g., as if, as though, because of ), comparatives (so ADJ that, too ADJ to, at least/most/... X), monetary expressions, and dates, affecting 23.8% of all sentences.
    Additionally, there are a number of constructions wh
