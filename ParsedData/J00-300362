he 12 DAs (iNsTRucT).
    Table 14 shows the approximate size of the corpora, the tag set, and tag estimation accuracy rates for various recent models of DA prediction.
    The results summarized in the table also illustrate the differences in inherent difficulty of the tasks.
    For example, the task of Warnke et al. (1997) was to simultaneously segment and tag DAs, whereas the other results rely on a prior manual segmentation.
    Similarly, the task in Wright (1998) and in our study was to determine DA types from speech input, whereas work by others is based on hand-transcribed textual input.
    Dialogue act tag sets used in three other extensively studied corpora.
    VERBMOBIL.
    These 18 high-level DAs used in VERBMOBIL-1 are abstracted over a total of 43 more specific DAs; most experiments on VERBMOBIL DAs use the set of 18 rather than 43.
    Examples are from Jekat et al. (1995).
    ATR.
    The 9 DAs (&amp;quot;illocutionary force types&amp;quot;) used in the ATR Dialogue database task; some la
