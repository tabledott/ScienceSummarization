 of positive predictions returned by the detection classifier over the set of normalisation candidates for a given OOV token: the token is considered to be ill-formed iff td or more candidates are positively classified, i.e. predicted to be correct candidates.
    For OOV words which are predicted to be illformed, we select the most likely candidate from the confusion set as the basis of normalisation.
    The final selection is based on the following features, in line with previous work (Wong et al., 2006; Cook and Stevenson, 2009).
    Lexical edit distance, phonemic edit distance, prefix substring, suffix substring, and the longest common subsequence (LCS) are exploited to capture morphophonemic similarity.
    Both lexical and phonemic edit distance (ED) are normalised by the reciprocal of exp(ED).
    The prefix and suffix features are intended to capture the fact that leading and trailing characters are frequently dropped from words, e.g. in cases such as ish and talkin.
    We calculate the ratio of th
