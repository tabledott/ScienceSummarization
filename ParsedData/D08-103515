952;0.
    When &#952;0 is a symmetric Dirichlet prior, where nj,i is the count of word i in segment j, and Nj = PWi nj,i, the total number of words in the segment.
    The symbol F refers to the Gamma function, an extension of the factorial function to real numbers.
    Using the DCM distribution, we can compute the data likelihood for each segment from the lexical counts over the entire segment.
    The overall observation likelihood is a product across the likelihoods for each segment.
    The optimal segmentation maximizes the joint probability, p(X, z|&#952;0) = p(X|z, &#952;0)p(z).
    We assume that p(z) is a uniform distribution over valid segmentations, and assigns no probability mass to invalid segmentations.
    The data likelihood is defined for point estimate language models in equation 5 and for marginalized language models in equation 7.
    Note that equation 7 is written as a product over segments.
    The point estimates for the language models depend only on the counts within The maximum va
