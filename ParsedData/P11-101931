17; texts have shown the types of texts for which the system&#8217;s scoring capability can be undermined.
    We plan to experiment with better error detection techniques, since the overall error-rate of a script is one of the most discriminant features.
    Briscoe et al. (2010) describe an approach to automatic offprompt detection which does not require retraining for each new question prompt and which we plan to integrate with our system.
    It is clear from the &#8216;outlier&#8217; experiments reported here that our system would benefit from features assessing discourse coherence, and to a lesser extent from features assessing semantic (selectional) coherence over longer bounds than those captured by ngrams.
    The addition of an incoherence metric to the feature set of an AA system has been shown to improve performance significantly (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2000; Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2004).
