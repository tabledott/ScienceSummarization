the morphological analysis of words described in the previous section, suffixes are checked to determine if they are spurious amalgams of independently motivated suffixes: ments is typically, but wrongly, analyzed as a suffix.

    For example, in Tom Sawyer, the suffix ings is split into ing and s, and thus the word beings is split into being plus s; the word being is, of course, already in the lexicon.
