    Irregular polysemy was not a marginal phenomenon: it explains 5 of the 10 singletons in our data.
    These observations confirm that evaluation against a polysemic gold standard is necessary in order to fully explain the results from clustering.
    Finally, to provide feedback for further development of our verb classification approach, we performed a qualitative analysis of errors not resulting from polysemy.
    Consider the following clusters (the IB output for K = 42): B1: place (9), build (26, 45), publish (26, 25), carve (21, 25, 26) B2: sin (003), rain (57), snow (57, 002) B3: agree (36, 22, A42), appear (020, 48, 29), begin (55), continue (55, 47, 51) B4: beg (015, 32) Three main error types were identified: 11Recall our definition of irregular polysemy, section 5.4. poorly.
    In B2, sin (which had 53 occurrences) is classified with rain and snow because it does not occur in our data with the preposition against the &#8216;hallmark&#8217; of its gold standard class (&#8217;C
