 might achieve with a full-packing implementation.
    In Figs.
    5 and 6, the first row shows F-scores for a random selection, the system selection, and the best possible selection from the transfer output against the gold standard.
    The second rows show summarization quality scores for generations from a random selection and the system selection, and for the human-written condensation.
    The third rows report compression ratios.
    As can be seen from these tables, the ranking of system variants produced by the automatic and manual evaluation confirm a close correlation between the automatic evaluation and human judgments.
    A comparison of evaluation results across colums, i.e. across selection variants, shows that a stochastic selection of transferred f-structures is indeed important.
    Even if all f-structures are transferred from the same linguistically rich source, and all generated strings are grammatical, a reduction in error rate of around 50% relative to the upper bound can be achieved
