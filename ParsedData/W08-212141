ystem to correctly parse structures with granularity much larger than a simple dependency, i.e., entire sentences for Exact Match and complete propositions for Perfect Proposition F1 (see Section 2.2.2 for a formal definition of these evaluation measures).
    The table indicates that these values are much smaller than the scores previously reported, e.g., labeled macro F1.
    This is to be expected: the probability of an incorrectly parsed unit (sentence or proposition) is much larger given its granularity.
    However, the main purpose of this analysis is to investigate if systems that focused on joint learning or optimization performed better than others with respect to these global measures.
    This indeed seems to be the case for at least two systems.
    The system of Johansson and Nugues (2008), which jointly optimizes the labeled F1 score (for semantic dependencies) and then the labeled macro F1 score (for the complete task), increases its distance from the next ranked system: its Perfect Propositio
