nstruct the best alignment for trees of given depths, assuming that we know how to find an optimal alignment for trees of shorter depths.
    More specifically, at each point of the traversal we consider two cases, shown in Figure 4.
    In the first case, two top nodes are aligned with each other, and their children are aligned in an optimal way by applying the algorithm to shorter trees.
    In the second case, one tree is aligned with one of the children of the top node of the other tree; again we can apply our algorithm for this computation, since we decrease the height of one of the trees.
    Before giving the precise definition of Sim, we introduce some notation.
    When T is a tree with root node v, we let c(T) denote the set containing all children of v. For a tree T containing a node s, the subtree of T which has s as its root node is denoted by Ts.
    Tree alignment computation.
    In the first case two tops are aligned, while in the second case the top of one tree is aligned with a child of ano
