w measure and weight functions that, as our evaluation has shown, significantly outperform existing similarity functions.
    The list of measure and weight functions we compared against is not complete, and we hope to add other functions to provide a general framework for thesaurus extraction experimentation.
    We would also like to expand our evaluation to include direct methods used by others (Lin, 1998a) and using the extracted thesaurus in NLP tasks.
    We have also investigated the speed/performance trade-off using frequency cutoffs.
    This has lead to the proposal of a new approximate comparison algorithm based on canonical attributes and a process of coarse- and fine-grained comparisons.
    This approximation algorithm is dramatically faster than simple pairwise comparison, with only a small performance penalty, which means that complete thesaurus extraction on large corpora is now feasible.
    Further, the canonical vector parameters allow for control of the speed/performance trade-off.
