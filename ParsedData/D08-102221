    These results confirm that our novel forest-based rule extraction approach is a promising direction for syntaxbased machine translation.
  
  
    In this paper, we have presented a novel approach that extracts translation rules from a packed forest encoding exponentially many trees, rather than from 1-best or k-best parses.
    Experiments on a state-ofthe-art tree-to-string system show that this method improves BLEU score significantly, with reasonable extraction speed.
    When combined with our previous work on forest-based decoding, the final result is even better than the hierarchical system Hiero.
    For future work we would like to apply this approach to other types of syntax-based translation systems, namely the string-to-tree systems (Galley et al., 2006) and tree-to-tree systems.
