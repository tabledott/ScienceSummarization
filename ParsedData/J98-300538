 In addition, we have specified which summarization-specific phrases are to be included in different types of summaries.
    The system identifies a preeminent set of templates from the input to the MUC system.
    This set needs to contain a large number of similar fields.
    If this holds, we can merge the set into a simpler structure, keeping the common features and marking the distinct features as Elhadad (1993) and McKeown, Kukich, and Shaw (1994b) suggest.
