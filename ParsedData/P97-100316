fficult even for human annotators to distinguish from purpose clauses (in this case, the infinitival could be a purpose clause modifying 'called') (Ann Taylor, p.c.) rather than Ps(Li, P, H I I, h, distances), and that there are the additional probabilities of generating the head and the STOP symbols for each constituent.
    However, Model 1 has some advantages which may account for the improved performance.
    The model in (Collins 96) is deficient, that is for most sentences S, ET P(T I S) &lt; 1, because probability mass is lost to dependency structures which violate the hard constraint that no links may cross.
    For reasons we do not have space to describe here, Model 1 has advantages in its treatment of unary rules and the distance measure.
    The generative model can condition on any structure that has been previously generated - we exploit this in models 2 and 3 - whereas (Collins 96) is restricted to conditioning on features of the surface string alone.
