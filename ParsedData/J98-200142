yntactic cues to classify a definite description as discourse-new even when these readers don't know about the particular object referred to already.
    This observation is consistent with Fraurud's hypothesis that interpreting definite descriptions involves two processes&#8212;deciding whether a definite description relates to some entity in the discourse or not, and searching the antecedent&#8212;and that the two processes are fairly independent.
    Our findings also suggest that the classification process may rely on more than just lexical cues, as Fraurud seems to assume (taking up a suggestion in Lobner [1985]; see below).
  
  
    In order to address some of the questions raised by Experiment 1 we set up a second experiment.
    In this second experiment we modified both the classification scheme and what we asked the annotators to do.
    One concern we had in designing this second experiment was to understand better the reasons for the disagreement among annotators observed in the first experiment.
