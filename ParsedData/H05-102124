ully formulated so that they can be implemented as WFSTs, and we show how the models can be incorporated into the Translation Template Model to perform phrasealignment and translation using standard WFST operations.
			Previous approaches to WFST-based re ordering (Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998; Kumarand Byrne, 2003; Tsukada and Nagata, 2004) con structed permutation acceptors whose state spaces grow exponentially with the length of the sentence to be translated.
			As a result, these acceptors have to be pruned heavily for use in translation.
			In contrast, ourmodels of local phrase movement do not grow explosively and do not require any pruning or approx imation in their construction.
			In other related work,Bangalore and Ricardi (2001) have trained WF STs for modeling reordering within translation; their WFST parses word sequences into trees containing reordering information, which are then checked for well-formed brackets.
			Unlike this approach, our model formulation does not use a tree representation a
