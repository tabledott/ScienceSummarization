ein '86).
    The Cb of an utterance is the highest ranked NP (Ranking being: Subject &gt; All other NPs) from the prior finite clause realized anaphorically in the current finite clause.
    Please see Baldwin '95 for a full discussion of the details of the rule.
    1994 correctly resolved 86% of 360 pronouns in computer manuals.
    Lapin and Leass run Hobbs' algorithm on the their data and the Naive Algorithm is correct 82% of the time--4% worse.
    This allows indirect comparison with CogNIAC, with the suggestive conclusion that the resolve all pronouns configuration of CogNIAC, like the Naive Algorithm, is at least in the ballpark of more modern approaches&amp; The breakdown of the individual rules is as follows: Performance of individual rules in Experiment 1.
    Note the high precision of rules 1 - 6).
    Recall = #correct/#actual, Precision = #correct/#guessed Far more interesting to consider is the performance of the high precision rules 1 through 6.
    The first four rules perform quite well at
