, c2) should be proportional to the distance between the functions in the hierarchy.
    A level-dependent correction factor is also proposed so as to leave open the option to make disagreements at higher levels of the hierarchy matter more than disagreements at the deeper level (for example, the distance between information-seeking and ynq might be considered greater than the distance between check and positive-check).
    The results of an agreement test with two annotators run by Geertzen and Bunt show that taking into account partial agreement leads to values of &#954;w that are higher than the values of &#954; for the same categories, particularly for feedback, a class for which Core and Allen (1997) got low agreement.
    Of course, even assuming that the values of &#954;w and &#954; were directly comparable&#8212;we remark on the difficulty of interpreting the values of weighted coefficients of agreement in Section 4.4&#8212;it remains to be seen whether these higher values are a better indication of t
