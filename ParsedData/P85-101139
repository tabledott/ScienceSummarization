 then we ean conclude that L(GI) ~ L T /1 Lm.
  We can use induction to prove this.
  The induction hypothesis that if all derived trees obtained after k &lt;_ n adjeininlg operations have the prepethy P then so will the derived after n + 1 adjoininp where P is defined as, Property P: If any node X in a derived tree -f bus the foot-node of the tree 0 to which X belongs labeDed Y as ?
  descendant sucb that w z Y w= is the fro?tier of the s?btree of ~ rooted at X, then if (ql,q~,q.l,q4) had bee?
  as?oct?ted with X, 6*(qt,wl) m q= and 6"(q3,ws) m q4, and if w is the fro?tier of the subtree under the foot node of 0 i?
  "/is then 6*(q~,w) ~ q8- if X is not the ancestor of the foot ?ode of 0 then the subtree of 0 below is of the form wtw s. Suppme X has aso~inted with it (ql,q,q,q2) the?
  6*(qt,wl) --  q, 5*(q,w,) = q,.
  Actually what we mean by an adjoining operation is not ?eeessarily just one adjoining operation but the minimum number so that no obligatory constraints are am?tinted with any nodes in the der
