    We used all 38,383 sentences of the Kyoto University text corpus Version 3.0.
    The training and test data were generated by a two-fold cross validation.
    The feature sets used in our experiments are shown in Table 1.
    The static features are basically taken from Uchimoto&#8217;s list (Uchimoto et al., 1999).
    Head Word (HW) is the rightmost content word in the segment.
    Functional Word (FW) is set as follows: - FW = the rightmost functional word, if there is a functional word in the segment - FW = the rightmost inflection form, if there is a predicate in the segment - FW = same as the HW, otherwise.
    The static features include the information on existence of brackets, question marks and punctuation marks, etc.
    Besides, there are features that show the relative relation of two segments, such as distance, and existence of brackets, quotation marks and punctuation marks between them.
    For a segment X and its dynamic feature Y (where Y is of type A or B), we set the Functional Re
