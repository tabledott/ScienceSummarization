nchronous grammar from parallel corpora and to build an MT system that performs competitively with the pure statistical MT systems.
    We chose to build the synchronous grammar on the parallel dependency structures of the sentences.
    The synchronous grammar is induced by hierarchical tree partitioning operations.
    The rest of this paper describes the system details as follows: Sections 2 and 3 describe the motivation behind the usage of dependency structures and how a version of synchronous dependency grammar is learned.
    This grammar is used as the primary translation knowledge source for our system.
    Section 4 defines the tree-to-tree transducer and the graphical model for the stochastic tree-to-tree transduction process and introduces a polynomial time decoding algorithm for the transducer.
    We evaluate our system in section 5 with the NIST/Bleu automatic MT evaluation software and the results are discussed in Section 6.
