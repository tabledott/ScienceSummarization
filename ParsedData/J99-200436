    Supertagging before Parsing The output of the supertagger, an almost parse, has been used in a variety of applications including information retrieval (Chandrasekar and Srinivas 1997b, 1997c, 1997d) and information extraction (Doran et al. 1997), text simplification (Chandrasekar, Doran, and Srinivas 1996, Chandrasekar and Srinivas 1997a), and language modeling (Srinivas 1996) to illustrate that supertags provide an appropriate level of lexical description needed for most applications.
    The output of the supertagger has also been used as a front end to a lexicalized grammar parser.
    As mentioned earlier, a lexicalized grammar parser can be conceptualized to consist of two stages (Schabes, Abeille, and Joshi 1988).
    In the first stage, the parser looks up the lexicon and selects all the supertags associated with each word of the sentence to be parsed.
    In the second stage, the parser searches the lattice of selected supertags in an attempt
