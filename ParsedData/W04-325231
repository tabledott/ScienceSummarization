    An analogy can be also drawn with PageRank&#8217;s &#8220;random surfer model&#8221;, where a user surfs the Web by following links from any given Web page.
    In the context of text modeling, TextRank implements what we refer to as &#8220;text surfing&#8221;, which relates to the concept of text cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976): from a certain concept in a text, we are likely to &#8220;follow&#8221; links to connected concepts &#8211; that is, concepts that have a relation with the current concept (be that a lexical or semantic relation).
    This also relates to the &#8220;knitting&#8221; phenomenon (Hobbs, 1974): facts associated with words are shared in different parts of the discourse, and such relationships serve to &#8220;knit the discourse together&#8221;.
    Through its iterative mechanism, TextRank goes beyond simple graph connectivity, and it is able to score text units based also on the &#8220;importance&#8221; of other text units they link to.
