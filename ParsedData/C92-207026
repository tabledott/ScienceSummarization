roaden the range and volume of available examples.
  Unlike dictionaries, however, raw corpora do not indicate which sense of a word occurs at a given instance.
  Several researchers (Kelly and Stone, 1975; Black, 1988) have overcome this through and tagging of training examples, and were able to discover useful discriminatory patterns from the partitioned contexts.
  This also has proved labor intensive.
  Others (Weiss, 1973; Zeroik, 1990; Hearst, 1991) have attempted to partially automate the hand- tagging process through bootstrapping.
  Yet this has still required significant human intervention for each word in the vocabulary.
  (1991), Dagan (1991), and Gale ct at.
  (1992) have looked to parallel bilingual corpora to further automate training set acquisition.
  By identifying word correspondences in a bilingual text such as the Canadian Parliamentary Proceedings (Hansards), the translations found fur each English word may serve as sense tags.
  For example, the senses of sentence may be identified thro
