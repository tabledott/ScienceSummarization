n HITs reproducing the approach described in (Negri and Mehdad, 2010).
    As a result, three new datasets are produced by automatically projecting annotations: the monolingual ITA/ITA1, and the cross-lingual ENG/ITA1 and GER/ITA1.
    Since the solution adopted for sentence translation does not present novelty factors, the remainder of this paper will omit further details on it.
    Instead, the following sections will focus on the more challenging tasks of sentence modification and TE annotation.
    Sentence modification and TE annotation have been decomposed into a pipeline of simpler monolingual English sub-tasks.
    Such pipeline, depicted in Figure 2, involves several types of generation/annotation HITs designed to be easily understandable to nonexperts.
    Each HIT consists of: i) a set of instructions for a specific task (e.g. paraphrasing a text), ii) the data to be manipulated (e.g. an English sentence), and iii) a test to check workers&#8217; reliability.
