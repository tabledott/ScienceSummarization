lexicons reduces the complexity of rule inter- actions.
  It might  turn out that the composit ion of a large lexicon with an even larger rule transducer is bigger than either one of the input structures.
  In reality, the size of the result seems to be somewhere  in the middle.
  The rules constrain the realization of all possible lexical forms.
  In the composition, their scope is restricted to just the forms that actually exist in the language.
  It turns out that this restriction makes the  result smaller ather than larger even though the lexicon itself is a very irregular collection of forms.
  The fact that it is possible to construct a lexical transducer for the whole language raises interesting theoretical issues.
  In lin- guistics it is commonly assumed that lexi- AcrEs BE COLING-92, NANTES, 23.28 AOUT 1992 1 4 6 PROC.

  That assumption is, of course, also the starting point of
