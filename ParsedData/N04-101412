 &#215; XRPATE &#215; To(Q &#215; paths) &#215; IIB+ is a finite set of weighted transformation rules, written (q, pattern) &#8594;w rhs, meaning that an input subtree matching pattern while in state q is transformed into rhs, with Q &#215; paths leaves replaced by their (recursive) transformations.
    The Q&#215;paths leaves of a rhs are called nonterminals (there may also be terminal leaves labeled by the output tree alphabet A).
    XRPATE is the set of finite tree patterns: predicate functions f : TE &#8594; {0, 1} that depend only on the label and rank of a finite number of fixed paths their input. xR is the set of all such transducers.
    R, the set of conventional top-down transducers, is a subset of xR where the rules are restricted to use finite tree patterns that depend only on the root: RPATE &#8801; {p&#963;,r(t)} where p&#963;,r(t) &#8801; (labelt(()) = &#963; &#8743; rankt(()) = r).
    Rules whose rhs are a pure To with no states/paths for further expansion are called terminal rules.
