 by the grammar G. d) The prefix probability P(S 4L x) (of x given G) is the sum of the probabilities of all sentence strings having x as a prefix, In the following, we assume that the probabilities in a SCFG are proper and consistent as defined in Booth and Thompson (1973), and that the grammar contains no useless nonterminals (ones that can never appear in a derivation).
    These restrictions ensure that all nonterminals define probability measures over strings; i.e., P(X x) is a proper distribution over x for all X.
    Formal definitions of these conditions are given in Appendix A.
    In order to define the probabilities associated with parser operation on a SCFG, we need the concept of a path, or partial derivation, executed by the Earley parser.
    Definition 2 a) An (unconstrained) Earley path, or simply path, is a sequence of Earley states linked by prediction, scanning, or completion.
    For the purpose of this definition, we allow scanning to operate in &amp;quot;generation mode,&amp;quot; i.e.,
