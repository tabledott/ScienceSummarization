			To see this, note that in gen erative models an input word can only be aligned toa single state in the search.
			In our current situation, we are interested in aligning unsegmented Ara bic words and typical words have a few affixes toindicate for example pronouns, definiteness, prepositions and conjunctions.
			In English these are sepa rate words, and therefore to maximize performance the unsegmented Arabic words serve as states in the search algorithm and we align English words to these states.
			3.1 Transition Model.
			The transition model tends to keep the alignmentsclose together and penalizes alignments in which ad jacent words in the target language come from very distant words in the source language.
			Also, we would like to penalize many English words coming from the same Arabic state; we call this the state visit penalty and will be described later.
			In this paper, we use a parametric form for the transition model, p(li|li?1) = 1 Z(li?1) [ 1 dist(li, li?1) + 1ns(li) ] (1) 90 where ns(i) re
