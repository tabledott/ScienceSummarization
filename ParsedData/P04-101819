ll entity-mention model has about features, due to less number of conjunction features and training examples.
    Coreference results on the true mentions of the Devtest, Feb02, and Sep02 test sets are tabulated in Table 3.
    These numbers are obtained with a fixed search beam and pruning threshold (widening the search beam or using a smaller pruning threshold did not change results significantly).
    The mention-pair model in most cases performs better than the mention-entity model by both ACE-value and ECM-F measure although none of the differences is statistically significant (pair-wise t-test) at p-value .
    Note that, however, the mention-pair model uses times more features than the entity-pair model.
    We also observed that, because the score between the infocus entity and the active mention is computed by (9) in the mention-pair model, the mention-pair sometimes mistakenly places a male pronoun and female pronoun into the same entity, while the same mistake is avoided in the entity-mention model
