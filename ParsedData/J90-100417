 Second, the left-to-right scheduling of Earley parsing, geared as it is toward the structure of the string rather than that of its meaning, is inherently more appropriate for parsing than generation.3 This manifests itself in an overly high degree of nondeterminism in the generation process.
    For instance, various nondeterministic possibilities for generating a noun phrase (using different cases, say) might be entertained merely because the NP occurs before the verb which would more fully specify, and therefore limit, the options.
    This nondeterminism has been observed in practice.
    We can think of a parsing or generation process as discovering an analysis tree,4 one admitted by the grammar and zag saw Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 1, March 1990 33 Shieber et at.
