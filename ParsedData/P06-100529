n resolution called path coreference, and demonstrated its significant contribution to a state-of-theart pronoun resolution system.
    This feature aids coreference decisions in many situations not handled by traditional coreference systems.
    Also, by bootstrapping with the coreferent paths, we are able to build the most complete and accurate table of probabilistic gender information yet available.
    Preliminary experiments show path coreference bootstrapping can also provide a means of identifying pleonastic pronouns, where pleonastic neutral pronouns are often followed in a dependency path by a terminal noun of different gender, and cataphoric constructions, where the pronouns are often followed by nouns of matching gender.
