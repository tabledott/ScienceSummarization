    A third motivation for this project is that it can serve as an excellent preparatory phase (in other words, a bootstrapping phase) for an unsupervised grammar acquisition system.
    As we will see, a significant proportion of the words in a large corpus can be assigned to categories, though the labels that are assigned by the morphological analysis are corpus internal; nonetheless, the assignment of words into distinct morphologically motivated categories can be of great service to a syntax acquisition device.
    The problem, then, involves both the determination of the correct morphological split for individual words, and the establishment of accurate categories of stems based on the range of suffixes that they accept: inflectional suffixes on a word which contains a stem that is followed by two or more inflectional suffixes, and we would like to identify derivational prefixes and suffixes.
    We want to be told that in this corpus, the most important suffixes are -s, -ing, -ed, and so forth, w
