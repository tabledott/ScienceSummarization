ich it is attaching.
    Subsequent POSs within a constituent are likely to be open-class words, and less dependent on these sorts of attachment preferences.
    Conditioning on parents and siblings of the left-hand side has proven to be very useful.
    To understand why this is the case, one need merely to think of VP expansions.
    If the parent of a VP is another VP (i.e., if an auxiliary or modal verb is used), then the distribution over productions is different than if the parent is an S. Conditioning on head information, both POS of the head and the lexical item itself, has proven useful as well, although given our parser's left-to-right orientation, in many cases the head has not been encountered within the particular constituent.
    In such a case, the head of the last child within the constituent is used as a proxy for the constituent head.
    All of our conditioning functions, with one exception, return either parent or sibling node labels at some specific distance from the left-hand side, or he
