or example, Pang et al. (2003) expand a set of reference translations using syntactic alignment, and generate new reference sentences that could be used in automatic evaluation.
    Our approach differs from traditional work on automatic paraphrasing in goal and methodology.
    Unlike previous approaches, we are not aiming to produce any paraphrase of a given sentence since paraphrases induced from a parallel corpus do not necessarily produce a rewriting that makes a reference closer to the system output.
    Thus, we focus on words that appear in the system output and aim to determine whether they can be used to rewrite a reference sentence.
    Our work also has interesting connections with research on automatic textual entailment (Dagan et al., 2005), where the goal is to determine whether a given sentence can be inferred from text.
    While we are not assessing an inference relation between a reference and a system output, the two tasks face similar challenges.
