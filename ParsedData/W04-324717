17; indicates a policy in which the weight for LexPageRank is and is used as threshold.
    &#8216;degreeXTY&#8217; is similar except that degree of a node in the similarity graph is used instead of its LexPageRank score.
    Finally, &#8216;CX&#8217; shows a policy with Centroid weight .
    We also include two baselines for each data set.
    &#8216;random&#8217; indicates a method where we have picked random sentences from the cluster to produce a summary.
    We have performed five random runs for each data set.
    The results in the tables are for the median runs.
    Second baseline, shown as &#8216;lead-based&#8217; in the tables, is using only the Position feature without any centrality method.
    This is tantamount to producing lead-based summaries, which is a widely used and very challenging baseline in the text summarization community (Brandow et al., 1995).
    The top scores we have got in all data sets come from our new methods.
    The results provide strong evidence that Degree and LexPageRa
