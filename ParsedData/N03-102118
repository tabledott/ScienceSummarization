 on the LHS can be rewritten as the expression on the RHS.
    Following convention, we let be the reflexive and transitive closure of When no more productions can be applied, i.e., when all nonterminals have been rewritten into terminals, the rendering functions are evaluated in inside-out order.
    The N function rearranges the nonempty terminals in each row of a link vector according to that row's permutation.
    For example, [1,2,3] (c ab c abc N [1,3,2,4] wyxcz =wxyz [3,2,1] t Env c vut By reordering the terminals independently in each component, the join operator hides information about which terminals were derived from the same link.
    Thus, the translational equivalence represented by links is not observable in MTG yields, just as it is not observable in raw multitext.
    To avoid spurious ambiguity, we stipulate a normal form for components of P: In each permutation, the first appearance of role x must precede the first appearance of role y for all x &lt; y, except where the arrangement is incom
