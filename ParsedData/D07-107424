cted from Wikipedia is used to dis- ambiguate the entities in the text.
  This stage is discussed formally in Section 5 and evaluated in Section 6.
  Note that the performance of the disam- biguation component is meaningful only when most named entity mentions are accurately identi- fied in text.
  Thus, we first measured the perform- ance of the named entity recognition component on the CoNLL 2003 test set and obtained a competi- tive F-measure of 0.835 (82.2% precision  and 84.8% recall).
  Finally, the implemented system creates hyper- links to the appropriate pages in Wikipedia.
  Figure 3 shows the output of the implemented system on a sample news story, in which the identified and dis- ambiguated surface forms are hyperlinked to Wikipedia articles.
  5 The Disambiguation Component The disambiguation process employs a vector space model, in which a vectorial representation of the processed document is compared with the vec- torial representations of the Wikipedia entities.
  Once the named entity surface
