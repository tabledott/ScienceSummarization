    Recent work has successfully developed dependency parsing models for many languages using supervised learning algorithms (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).
    Semi-supervised learning methods, which make use of unlabeled data in addition to labeled examples, have the potential to give improved performance over purely supervised methods for dependency parsing.
    It is often straightforward to obtain large amounts of unlabeled data, making semi-supervised approaches appealing; previous work on semisupervised methods for dependency parsing includes (Smith and Eisner, 2007; Koo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008).
    In particular, Koo et al. (2008) describe a semi-supervised approach that makes use of cluster features induced from unlabeled data, and gives state-of-the-art results on the widely used dependency parsing test collections: the Penn Treebank (PTB) for English and the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) fo
