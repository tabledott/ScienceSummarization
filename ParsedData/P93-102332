 consequence of point (3) made above, we need to understand the significance of the scores produced by our evaluation methods (for example, the limits of their ranges) before trying to interpret them.
    There are theoretical principles which indicate that the evaluation metrics will produce lower values much more easily than higher ones.
    Because of the multiple models used, perfect scores are not attainable.
    Also, because each pair of adjectives in a cluster is considered an observed association, the relationship between the number of associations produced by a cluster and the number of adjectives in the cluster is not linear (a cluster with k adjectives will produce () k 0(k2) associations).
    This leads to lower values 2/ of recall, since moving a single adjective out of a cluster with k elements in the model will cause the system to miss k-1 associations.
    As an example of this phenomenon, consider the hypothetical (single) model and partition of Figure 4; while the partition differs from th
