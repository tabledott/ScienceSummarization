ably with (Luo, 2003), which reported 94.6% word segmentation F-measure using his full parser without additional lexical features, and about 94.9%2 word segmentation F-measure using only word boundaries information, no POS tags or constituent labels, but with lexical features derived from a 58K-entry word list.
    The average training time taken to train on 90% of the 250K-word CTB was 12 minutes, while testing on 10% of CTB took about 1 minute.
    The running times reported in this paper were all obtained on an Intel Xeon 2.4GHz computer with 2GB RAM.
    Figure 1: CTB 10-fold CV word segmentation Fmeasure for our word segmenter As further evaluation, we tested our word segmenter on all the 4 test corpora (CTB, Academia Sinica (AS), Hong Kong CityU (HK) , and Peking University (PK)) of the closed track of the 2003 ACL-SIGHAN-sponsored First International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff (Sproat and Emerson, 2003).
    For each of the 4 corpora, we trained our word segmenter on only the official released t
