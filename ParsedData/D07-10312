			evaluation, where sev eral hidden states may correspond to the same POStag.
			We explain this by observing that the distribution of hidden states to words proposed by the EM estimated HMMs is relatively uniform, while the empirical distribution of POS tags is heavily skewed towards a few high-frequency tags.
			Based on this,we propose a Bayesian prior that biases the sys tem toward more skewed distributions and show that this raises the 1-to-1 accuracy significantly.
			Finally, we show that a similar increase in accuracy can be achieved by reducing the number of hidden states in the models estimated by EM.
			There is certainly much useful information that bitag HMMs models cannot capture.
