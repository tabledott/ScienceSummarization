n an adequate classifier with a small amount of labeled data.
    Another is to further boost the performance of a supervised classifier that is already trained with a large amount of supervised data.
    The named entity problem in Section 3 and the query classification problem in Section 4 exemplify the two scenarios.
    One nagging issue with K-Means clustering is how to set k. We show that this question may not need to be answered because we can use clusterings with different k&#8217;s at the same time and let the discriminative classifier cherry-pick the clusters at different granularities according to the supervised data.
    This technique has also been used with Brown clustering (Miller et. al.
    2004, Koo, et. al.
    2008).
    However, they require clusters to be strictly hierarchical, whereas we do not.
  
  
    We presented a simple and scalable algorithm to cluster tens of millions of phrases and we used the resulting clusters as features in discriminative classifiers.
    We demonstrated th
