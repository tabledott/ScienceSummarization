 often towards (or at) the top of the state-ofthe-art ranking.
    Where other models outperform TypeDM by a large margin, there are typically obvious reasons for this: The rivals have been trained on much larger corpora, or they rely on special knowledge resources, or on sophisticated machine learning algorithms.
    Importantly, TypeDM is consistently at least as good (or better than) those models we reimplemented to be fully comparable to our DMs (i.e., Win, DV, LRA).
    Moreover, the best DM implementation does not depend on the semantic space: TypeDM outperforms (at least in terms of average performance across tasks) the other two models in all four spaces.
    This is not surprising (better distributional tuples should still be better when seen from different views), but it is good to have an empirical confirmation of the a priori intuition.
    The current results suggest that one could, for example, compare alternative DMs on a few attributional tasks, and expect the best DM in these tasks to also be
