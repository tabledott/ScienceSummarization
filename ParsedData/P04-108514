 and Litman, 1994), and adjectives with positive or negative polarity (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997).
    We incorporated a set of durational features that were described in the literature as good predictors of agreements: utterance length distinguishes agreement from disagreement, the latter tending to be longer since the speaker elaborates more on the reasons and circumstances of her disagreement than for an agreement (Cohen, 2002).
    Duration is also a good predictor of backchannels, since they tend to be quite short.
    Finally, a fair amount of silence and filled pauses is sometimes an indicator of disagreement, since it is a dispreferred response in most social contexts and can be associated with hesitation (Pomerantz, 1984).
    We first performed several empirical analyses in order to determine to what extent contextual information helps in discriminating between agreement and disagreement.
    By integrating the interpretation of the pragmatic function of an utterance into a wider context, w
