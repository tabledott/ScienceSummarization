uating s and z.
    As we explain at the end of this section, without this aspect the generative story closely resembles the classic dependency model with valence (DMV) of Klein and Manning (2004).
    First we draw symbol s from a finite multinomial distribution with parameters &#952;s0z0c.
    As the indices indicate, we have one such set of multinomial parameters for every combination of parent symbol s' and subsymbol z' along with a context c. Here the context of the current node can take one of six values corresponding to every combination of direction (left or right) and valence (first, second, or third or higher child) with respect to its parent.
    The prior (base distribution) for each &#952;s0z0c is a symmetric Dirichlet with hyperparameter &#952;0.
    Next we draw the refined syntactic category subsymbol z from an infinite multinomial with parameters &#960;ss0z0c.
    Here the selection of &#960; is indexed by the current node&#8217;s coarse symbol s, the symbol s' and subsymbol z' of the parent
