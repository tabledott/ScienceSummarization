d PFoiL-DNF, PFOIL-CNF, and PFoiL-DLisT.
    The algorithms are greedy covering (separate-and-conquer) methods that use an information-theoretic heuristic to guide a topdown search for a simple definition consistent with the training data.
    PFOIL-DNF (PFOIL-CNF) learns a separate DNF (CNF) description for each sense using the examples of that sense as positive instances and the examples of all other senses as negative instances.
    Mooney (1995) describes PFOIL-DNF and PFoiL-CNF in more detail and PFoiL-DLIsT is based on the first-order decisionlist learner described by Mooney and Calif (1995).
    Experiments In order to evaluate the performance of these seven algorithms, direct multi-trial comparisons on identical training and test sets were run on the &amp;quot;line&amp;quot; corpus.
    Such head-to-head comparisons of methods are unfortunately relatively rare in the empirical natural-language literature, where papers generally report results of a single method on a single training set with, at best,
