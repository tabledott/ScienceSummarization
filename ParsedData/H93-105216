for-the observed collocation was present in the model.
  See Section 7.3 for a discussion of the "All Above" result.
  The results tated above are based on the average of the different types of sense considered, and have a mean prior probability of .69 and a mean sample size of 3944. conditional on collocation.
  For example, for the collocation type content-word-to-the-right, t evalue of .97 indicates that on average, given a Specific collocation we will expect o see the same sense 97% of the time.
  This mean distribution is also reflected in the entropy column.
  However, these numbers have much more practical interpre- tations.
  If we actually build a disambiguation procedure using exclusively the content word to the right as information, such a system performs with 97% precision on new data where a content word appears to the right and for which there is in- formation in the model .3 This is considerably higher than the 3The correlation between these numbers is not a coincidence.
  Because the probabili
