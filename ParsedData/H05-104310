re are two important differences between OPINE and Hu?s system: a) OPINE?s Feature Assessor uses PMI assessment to evaluate each candidate feature and b) OPINE incorporates Web PMI statistics in addition to review data in its assessment.
			In the following, we quantify the performance gains from a) and b).
			a) In order to quantify the benefits of OPINE?s Feature Assessor, we use it to evaluate the features extracted by Hu?s algorithm on review data (Hu+A/R).
			The Feature Assessor improves Hu?s precision by 6%.
			b) In order to evaluate the impact of using Web PMI statistics, we assess OPINE?s features first on reviews (OP/R) and then on reviews in conjunction with the Web (the corresponding methods are Hu+A/R+W andOPINE).
			Web PMI statistics increase precision by an av erage of 14.5%.
			Overall, 1/3 of OPINE?s precision increase over Hu?s system comes from using PMI assessment on reviews and the other 2/3 from the use of the Web PMI statistics.
			In order to show that OPINE?s performance is robustac
