  We obtain an error rate of 2.67% on the test data.
    With deterministic search, or beam with B = 1, we obtain an error rate of 2.73%.
    Compared to previous best result on the same data set, 2.76% by (Toutanova et al., 2003), our best result shows a relative error reduction of 3.3%.
    This result is very promising, since we have not used any specially designed features in our experiments.
    It is reported in (Toutanova et al., 2003) that a crude company name detector was used to generate features, and it gave rise to significant improvement in performance.
    However, it is difficult for us to duplicate exactly the same feature for the purpose of comparison, although it is convenient to use features like that in our framework.
  
  
    In this paper, we propose guided learning, a new learning framework for bidirectional sequence classification.
    The tasks of learning the order of inference and training the local classifier are dynamically incorporated into a single Perceptron like algorithm.
