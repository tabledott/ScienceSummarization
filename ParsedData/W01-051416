rformed best with an average error rate of 42%.
    This is the baseline for algorithms that find the e most prominent topic boundaries.
    B? serves as the baseline for methods that determines the optimal segmentation, i.e. the number of topic segments in a text.
    The aim is to relate stemming, ranking and the termination procedure in C99 with segmentation accuracy.
    The algorithm used in this experiment is identical to that presented in (Choi, 2000a) except tokens such as -- and - are recognised as punctuation marks and removed during pre-processing.
    Test results show this modification reduces error rate by 1%.
    An analysis of the original algorithm reveals that non-word tokens introduce errors since they are converted into a null string by the stemming algorithm (Porter, 1980).
    This implementation of C99 has three parameters.
    +r implies ranking is applied to the similarity matrix prior to divisive clustering.
    +s shows the stemming algorithm is used in preprocessing.
    +b means t
