  The kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan Jr. 1988) on this task was K = 0.692.
    The precision for a given set of instances is the sum of the judges&#8217; scores divided by the total instances.
    Although knowing the total number of correct instances of a particular relation in any nontrivial corpus is impossible, it is possible to compute the recall of a system relative to another system&#8217;s recall.
    Following (Pantel et al. 2004), we define the relative recall of system A given system B, RA|B, as: where RA is the recall of A, CA is the number of correct instances extracted by A, C is the (unknown) total number of correct instances in the corpus, PA is A&#8217;s precision in our experiments, and |A |is the total number of instances discovered by A.
    Tables 2 &#8211; 8 report the total number of instances, precision, and relative recall of each system on the TREC-9 and CHEM corpora.
    The relative recall is always given in relation to the ESP- system.
    For example, in Table 2, RH02 has
