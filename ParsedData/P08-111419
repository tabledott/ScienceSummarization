e consistency across multiple test sets, in terms of which constraints tend to help most.
    Furthermore, our results provide some insight into why the original approach may have failed to yield a positive outcome.
    For Chinese, we found that when we defined finer-grained versions of the exact-match features, there was value for some constituency types in biasing the model to favor matching the source language parse.
    Moreover, we found that there was significant value in allowing the model to be sensitive to violations (crossing boundaries) of source parses.
    These results confirm that parser quality was not the limitation in the original work (or at least not the only limitation), since in our experiments the parser was held constant.
    Looking at combinations of new features, some &#8220;double-feature&#8221; combinations (VP2, IP2) achieved large gains, although note that more is not necessarily better: combinations of more features did not yield better scores, and some did not yield any gain
