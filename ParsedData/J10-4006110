pair by the length of the longest vector in the harvested concept&#8211;property set that has the same POS pair).
    For example, among the longest W1W2xL vectors with car as first item we find (car, drive), (car, park), and (car, engine).
    The first two pairs are normalized by dividing by the longest (noun, verb) vector in the harvested set, the third by dividing by the longest (noun, noun) vector.
    We test this approach in the ESSLLI 2008 Distributional Semantic Workshop unconstrained property generation challenge (Baroni, Evert, and Lenci 2008).
    The data set contains, for each of 44 concrete concepts, 10 properties that are those that were most frequently produced by subjects in the elicitation experiment of McRae et al. (2005) (the &#8220;gold standard lists&#8221;).
    Algorithms must generate lists of 10 properties per concept, and performance is measured by overlap with the subject-produced properties, that is, by the cross-concept average proportions of properties in the generated lists th
