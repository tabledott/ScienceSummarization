			4.1 BLEU as a function of threshold.
			In tables 5 and 6, the largest BLEU score for each set of runs has been marked in bold font.
			In addition, to highlight that there are many near ties for largest BLEU, all BLEU scores that are within 0.1 of the best are also marked in bold.
			When this is done it becomes clear that pruningat a level of 20 for the WMT06 runs would not re duce BLEU in most cases and in many cases wouldactually increase it.
			A pruning threshold of 20 corresponds to discarding roughly 90% of the phrase table.
			For the Chinese?English large corpus runs, a levelof 16 seems to be about the best with a small in crease in BLEU and a 60% ? 70% reduction in the size of the phrasetable.
			4.2 BLEU as a function of depth of pruning.
			Another view of this can be taken from Tables 5 and 6.
			The fraction of the phrasetable retained is a more or less simple function of pruning thresholdas shown in Tables 3 and 4.
			By including the per centages in Tables 5 and 6, we can see th
