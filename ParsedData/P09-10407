 Gcm E G. S is complete for G iff, for every sentence x and dependency graph G for x in G, there is a transition sequence C0,m for x in S such that Gcm = G. An oracle for a transition system S is a function o : C &#8212;* T. Ideally, o should always return the optimal transition t for a given configuration c, but all we require formally is that it respects the preconditions of transitions in T. That is, if o(c) = t then t is permissible in c. Given an oracle o, deterministic transition-based parsing can be achieved by the following simple algorithm: Starting in the initial configuration cs(x), the parser repeatedly calls the oracle function o for the current configuration c and updates c according to the oracle transition t. The iteration stops when a terminal configuration is reached.
    It is easy to see that, provided that there is at least one transition sequence in S for every sentence, the parser constructs exactly one transition sequence C0,m for a sentence x and returns the parse defined by the termi
