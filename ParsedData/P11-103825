   In addition to comparing our method with competitor methods, we also study the contribution of different feature groups.
    We separately compare dictionary lookup over our Internet slang dictionary, the contextual feature model, and the word similarity feature model, as well as combinations of these three.
    The evaluation of lexical normalisation consists of two stages (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005): (1) illformed word detection, and (2) candidate selection.
    In terms of detection, we want to make sense of how well the system can identify ill-formed words and leave correct OOV words untouched.
    This step is crucial to further normalisation, because if correct OOV words are identified as ill-formed, the candidate selection step can never be correct.
    Conversely, if an ill-formed word is predicted to be correct, the candidate selection will have no chance to normalise it.
    We evaluate detection performance by token-level precision, recall and F-score (Q = 1).
