el, auxiliary indexes (for example, sentence indexes) will have to be created.
    These will be much larger than regular word-based indexes of paragraphs or documents, and will still not be as accurate.
    Information retrieval systems often rank the results of each search, giving preference to documents that are more relevant to the query by placing them nearer the beginning of the list.
    Relevance metrics are based on the observation that infrequent words are more important than common ones and should therefore rate more highly.
    Word segmentation is essential for this purpose, because the relationship between the frequency of a word and the frequency of the characters that appear within it is often very weak.
