to be node [fl) will be defined by the nonchain rule (If there were other forms of the verb, these would be potential candidates, but most would be eliminated by the chained_nodes check, as the semantic head relation requires identity of the verb form of a sentence and its VP head.
    See Section 4.2 for a technique for further reducing the nondeterminism in lexical item selection.)
    Again, we recursively generate for all the nonterminal elements of the right-hand side of this rule, of which there are none.
    We must therefore connect the pivot [f] to the root [b].
    A chain rule whose semantic head matches the pivot must be chosen.
    The only choice is the rule Unifying the pivot in, we find that we must recursively generate the remaining RHS element np(_)/friends, and then connect the left-hand-side node [e] with category vp(finiteAlex /up, np(3-sing)/johnp/call_ up(john,friends) to the same root [b].
    The recursive generation yields a node covering the string &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; follow
