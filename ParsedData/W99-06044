f one-to-many alignments.
    The alignment template approach uses two different alignment levels: a phrase level alignment between phrases and a word level alignment between single words.
    As a result the context of words has a greater influence and the changes in word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly.
    An advantage of both methods is that they learn fully automatically by using a bilingual training corpus and are capable of achieving better translation results on a limited-domain task than other example-based or rule-based translation systems.
