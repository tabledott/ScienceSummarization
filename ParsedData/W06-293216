rformance difference between two-staged dependency parsing (as presented here) and joint parsing plus labeling.
    It is our hypothesis that for languages with fine-grained label sets, joint parsing and labeling will improve performance.
    Second, we plan on integrating any available morphological features in a more principled manner.
    The current system simply includes all morphological bi-gram features.
    It is our hope that a better morphological feature set will help with both unlabeled parsing and labeling for highly inflected languages.
