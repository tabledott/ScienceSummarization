atient(e3,x4) 629 Proper names and definite descriptions are treated as anaphoric, and bound to previously introduceddiscourse referents if possible, otherwise accommodated.
			Some lexical items are specified as presup position triggers.
			An example is the adjective ?new?

			To check whether an entailment holds or not, weuse two kinds of automated reasoning tools: Vam pire, a theorem prover (Riazanov and Voronkov, 2002), and Paradox, a model builder (Claessen and So?rensson, 2003).
			Both tools are developed to deal with inference problems stated in first-order logic.We use the standard translation from DRS to firstorder logic (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) to map our se mantic representation onto the format required by the inference tools.
			3.2 Theorem Proving.
			Given a T/H pair, a theorem prover can be used to find answers to the following conjectures: 1.
