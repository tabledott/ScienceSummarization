    Some of the texts were written on the same day.
    In addition to a description of the May earthquake, these texts contain references to another earthquake that occurred in the same region in February 1998.
  
  
    To divide sentences into event-clauses we use CONTEX (Hermjakob, 1997), a parser that produces a syntactic parse tree augmented with semantic labels.
    CONTEX uses machine learning techniques to induce a grammar from a given treebanks.
    A sample output of CONTEX is given in Appendix 1.
    To divide a sentence into event-clauses the parse tree output by CONTEX is analyzed from left to right (root to leaf).
    The ::CAT field for each node provides the necessary information about whether the node under consideration forms a part of its upper level event or whether it introduces a new event.
    ::CAT features that indicate new events are: S-CLAUSE, S-SNT, SSUB-CLAUSE, S-PART-CLAUSE, S-RELCLAUSE.
    These features mark clauses which contain both subject (one or several NPs) and p
