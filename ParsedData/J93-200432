e to the skeletal analysis used by the Lancaster Treebank, but a limited experiment was performed early in the project o investigate the feasibility of providing greater levels of structural detail.
  While the results were somewhat unclear, there was ev- idence that annotators could maintain a much faster rate of hand correction if the parser output was simplified in various ways, reducing the visual complexity of the tree representations and eliminating a range of minor decisions.
  The key results of this experiment were as follows: ?
  Annotators take substantially longer to learn the bracketing task than the POS tagging task, with substantial increases in speed occurring even after two months of training.
  Annotators can correct he full structure provided by Fidditch at an average speed of approximately 375 words per hour after three weeks and 475 words per hour after six weeks.
  Reducing the output from the full structure shown in Figure 3 to a more skeletal representation similar to that used by the
