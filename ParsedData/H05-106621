 at least one non-projective dependency.
			However, less than2% of total edges are actually non-projective.
			There fore, handling non-projective edges correctly has a relatively small effect on overall accuracy.
			To show the effect more clearly, we created two Czech data sets.
			The first, Czech-A, consists of the entire PDT.The second, Czech-B, includes only the 23% of sen tences with at least one non-projective dependency.This second set will allow us to analyze the effectiveness of the algorithms on non-projective mate rial.
			We compared the following systems: 1.
			COLL1999: The projective lexicalized phrase-structure.
			parser of Collins et al (1999).
			2.
			N&amp;N2005: The pseudo-projective parser of Nivre and Nilsson (2005).
			3.
			McD2005: The projective parser of McDonald et al.
			(2005) that uses the Eisner algorithm for both training and testing.
			This system uses k-best MIRA with k=5.
			4. Single-best MIRA: In this system we use the Chu-Liu-.
			Edmonds algorithm to find the best
