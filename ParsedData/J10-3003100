We identify several such trends in the area of paraphrase generation that are gathering momentum.
    The Influence of the Web.
    The Web is rapidly becoming one of the most important sources of data for natural language processing applications, which should not be surprising given its phenomenal rate of growth.
    The (relatively) freely available Web data, massive in scale, has already had a definite influence over data-intensive techniques such as those employed for paraphrase generation (Pas&#184;ca and Dienes 2005).
    However, the availability of such massive amounts of Web data comes with serious concerns for efficiency and has led to the development of efficient methods that can cope with such large amounts of data.
    Bhagat and Ravichandran (2008) extract phrasal paraphrases by measuring distributional similarity over a 150GB monolingual corpus (25 billion words) via locality sensitive hashing, a randomized algorithm that involves the creation of fingerprints for vectors in space (Broder 1997).
