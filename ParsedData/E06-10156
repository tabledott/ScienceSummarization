 is that the leaves can be associated with non-terminal symbols.
    The SSTs satisfy the constraint that they are generated by applying the same grammatical rule set which generated the original tree.
    For example, [S [N VP]] is a SST of the tree in Figure 1 which has two non-terminal symbols, N and VP, as leaves.
    Given a syntactic tree we can use as feature representation the set of all its STs or SSTs.
    For example, Figure 2 shows the parse tree of the sentence &amp;quot;Mary brought a cat&amp;quot; together with its 6 STs, whereas Figure 3 shows 10 SSTs (out of 17) of the subtree of Figure 2 rooted in VP.
    The high different number of substructures gives an intuitive quantification of the different information level between the two tree-based representations.
    The main idea of tree kernels is to compute the number of the common substructures between two trees T1 and T2 without explicitly considering the whole fragment space.
    For this purpose, we slightly modified the kernel function pr
