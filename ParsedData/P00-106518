occurrence model of (Hofmann and Puzicha, 1998) to a large corpus of observed direct object relationships between verbs and nouns.
    The clustering was computed from an automatically parsed version of the British National Corpus, using the parser of (Carroll and Rooth, 1998).
    The experiment was performed using only frame elements with a noun as head word.
    This allowed a smoothed estimate of P(rIh, nt, t) to be computed as &amp; P(rJc, nt, t)P(cJh), summing over the automatically derived clusters c to which a nominal head word h might belong.
    This allows the use of head word statistics even when the headword h has not been seen in conjunction was the target word t in the training data.
    While the unclustered nominal head word feature is correct for 87.6% of cases where data for P(rlh, nt, t) is available, such data was available for only 43.7% of nominal head words.
    The clustered head word alone correctly classified 79.7% of the cases where the head word was in the vocabulary used for clus
