the center cannot be defined in syntactic terms alone.
    The interaction of semantics and centering is more complex and is discussed in Section 4.
    The following examples, drawn from Reinhart [19821, illustrate the point that the notion of center is not i.e., the syntax of a sentence S not determine which of its NPs (The differ in other respects also.
    Reichman [19811 and Grosz 110811 discuss some of these. attempts to incorporate focusing mechanisms in generation systems are described in [Appelt, 1981 and McKeown, 19821. can obviously affect the interpretation; for of this paper, it may be regarded as part of a for the use of this terminology discussed (la) Who did Max see yesterday?
    (lb) Max saw Rosa.
    (2a) Did anyone see Rosa yesterday?
    (2b) Max saw Rosa.
    (lb) and (2b) are identical, Cb(lb) Max and Cb(2b) is Rosa.
    This can be seen in part by noticing that saw Rosa' seems more natural than (Ib) *Max saw her' than (2b) (a fact consistent with the centering rule introduced in Sectio
