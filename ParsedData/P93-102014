 the total number of subjects assigning a boundary at the jth site, is randomly distributed.
    Where the row totals are ui, the column totals are T, and the average column total is T, the statistic is given by: = Q approximates the X2 distribution with j-1 degrees of freedom (Cochran, 1950).
    Our results indicate that the agreement among subjects is extremely highly significant.
    That is, the number of Os or is in certain columns is much greater than would be expected by chance.
    For the 20 narratives, the probabilities of the observed distributions range from p :7-- .114 x 10-6 top &lt; .6 x 10-9.
    The percent agreement analysis classified all the potential boundary sites into two classes, boundaries versus non-boundaries, depending on how the majority of subjects responded.
    This is justified by further analysis of Q.
    As noted in the preceding section, the proportion of non-boundaries agreed upon by most subjects (i.e., where 0 &lt;Ti &lt; 3) is higher than the proportion of boundaries
