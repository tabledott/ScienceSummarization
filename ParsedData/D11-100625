g language.
    For the multi-source projected system the results are mixed.
    Some languages see basically no change relative the multi-source direct transfer model, while some languages see modest to significant increases.
    But again, there is an overall trend to better models.
    In particular, starting with an English-only direct transfer parser with 57.0% UAS on average, by adding parallel corpora and multiple source languages we finish with parser having 63.8% UAS on average, which is a relative reduction in error of roughly 16% and more than doubles the performance of a DMV model (Table 1).
    Interestingly, the multi-source systems provide, on average, accuracies near that of the single-best source language and significantly better than the average source UAS.
    Thus, even this simple method of multi-source transfer already provides strong performance gains.
    We expect that more principled techniques will lead to further improvements.
