			Relative recall of the pattern-based approach relative to the co-occurrence approach.
			776 systems during the process, these evaluations give an indication of the recall of the knowledge base.
			We measure the performance on the top 1 and the top 5 answers returned by each system.
			Table 9 and Table 10 show the results.
			The corresponding scores for WordNet are 38% accuracy in both the top-1 and top-5 c
