 Aha, 1996) was assembled to facilitate empirical comparisons.
    Experimental comparisons of different methods on various benchmark problems have generally found relatively small differences in predictive accuracy (Mooney, Shavlik, Towell, &amp; Gove, 1989; Fisher 86 McKusick, 1989; Weiss 86 Kapouleas, 1989; Atlas, Cole, Conner, El-Sharkawi, Marks, Muthusamy, &amp; Bernard, 1990; Dietterich, Hild, &amp; Bakiri, 1990; Kulikowski &amp; Weiss, 1991; Shavlik, Mooney, 86 Towell, 1991; Holte, 1993).
    However, on specific problems, certain methods can demonstrate a significant advantage.
    For example, on the problem of detecting promoter sequences in DNA (which indicate the start of a new gene), neural-network and similar methods perform significantly better than symbolic induction methods (Towell, Shaylik, &amp; Noordewier, 1990; Baffes 86 Mooney, 1993).
    On the other hand, as mentioned in the introduction, symbolic induction methods perform significantly better than neural-networks on the problem of lea
