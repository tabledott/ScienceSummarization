eld by increasing the size of the sample-corpus in a qualitative way, as well as precision, using statistical methods such as supervised learning for better anchor set identification and cross-correlation between different pivots.
    We also plan to support noun phrases as input, in addition to verb phrases.
    Finally, we would like to extend the learning task to discover the correct entailment direction between acquired templates, completing the knowledge required by practical applications.
    Like (Lin and Pantel, 2001), learning the context for which entailment relations are valid is beyond the scope of this paper.
    As stated, we learn entailment relations holding for some, but not necessarily all, contexts.
    In future work we also plan to find the valid contexts for entailment relations.
