r translation quality (Chiang, 2005).
    To do bigram-integrated decoding, we need to augment each chart item (X, i, j) with two target-language boundary words u and v to produce a bigram-item like u X v \ , following the dynamic program(i j ming algorithm of Wu (1996).
    Now the two binarizations have very different effects.
    In the first case, we first combine NP with PP: where p and q are the scores of antecedent items.
    This situation is unpleasant because in the targetlanguage NP and PP are not contiguous so we cannot apply language model scoring when we build the VNP-PP item.
    Instead, we have to maintain all four boundary words (rather than two) and postpone the language model scoring till the next step where VNP-PP is combined with C held &#183;&#183;&#183; meeting l /I to form an S item.
  
  
    We call this binarization method monolingual binarization since it works only on the source-language projection of the rule without respecting the constraints from the other side.
