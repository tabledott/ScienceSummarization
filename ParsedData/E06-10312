 words in a sentence is still relevant for the measure.
    In this, the new measure differs significantly from the position independent error rate (PER) by (Tillmann et al., 1997).
    Generally, finding an optimal solution for such a reordering problem is NP hard, as is shown in (Lopresti and Tomkins, 1997).
    In previous work, researchers have tried to reduce the complexity, for example by restricting the possible permutations on the block-level, or by approximation or heuristics during the calculation.
    Nevertheless, most of the resulting algorithms still have high run times and are hardly applied in practice, or give only a rough approximation.
    An overview of some better-known measures can be found in Section 3.1.
    In contrast to this, our new measure can be calculated very efficiently.
    This is achieved by requiring complete and disjoint coverage of the blocks only for the reference sentence, and not for the candidate translation.
    We will present an algorithm which computes the new er
