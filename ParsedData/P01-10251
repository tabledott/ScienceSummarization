strategies employed for evaluating the identification results are far from adequate.
    Another crucial but still unsolved issue in statistical collocation identification is the treatment of lowfrequency data.
    In this paper, we first specify requirements for a qualitative evaluation of lexical association measures (AMs).
    Based on these requirements, we introduce an experimentation procedure, and discuss the evaluation results for a number of widely used AMs.
    Finally, methods and strategies for handling low-frequency data are suggested.
    The measures &#8211; Mutual Information ( ) (Church and Hanks, 1989), the log-likelihood ratio test (Dunning, 1993), two statistical tests: t-test and -test, and co-occurrence frequency &#8211; are applied to two sets of data: adjective-noun (AdjN) pairs and preposition-noun-verb (PNV) triples, where the AMs are applied to (PN,V) pairs.
    See section 3 for a description of the base data.
