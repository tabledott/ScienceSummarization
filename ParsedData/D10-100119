    For any set Y &#8838; {0, 1}k, and for any vector 0 &#8712; Rk, The theorem states that for a linear objective function, maximization over a discrete set Y can be replaced by maximization over the convex hull conv(Y).
    The problem max&#181;Econv(Y) &#181;&#183;0 is a linear programming problem.
    For parsing, this theorem implies that: Similar results apply for the POS tagging case.
    We now describe the LP relaxations that are solved by the example algorithms in section 4.
    We begin with the algorithm in Figure 1.
    The original optimization problem was to find max(y,z)EQ (y &#183; 0cfg + z &#183; 0tag) (see Eq.
    2).
    By theorem 5.2, this is equivalent to solving To formulate our approximation, we first define: Q' = {(&#181;, v) : &#181; &#8712; conv(Y), v &#8712; conv(Z), &#181;(i, t) = v(i, t) for all (i, t) &#8712; Iuni} The definition of Q0 is very similar to the definition of Q (see Eq.
    1), the only difference being that Y and Z are replaced by con
