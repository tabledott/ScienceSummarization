The fact that the precision obtained by the baseline approach is not 100% indicates that the seed training names for each class are not completely unambiguous, and that a certain degree of ambiguity is generally unavoidable (in this case, mainly because of the interference between first names and last names).
    Another significant performance measure is forced classification accuracy, where the entities have been previously identified in the text and the only task is selecting their name class.
    To obtain baseline performance for this measure, we considered a system that uses the original training word labels if there is an exact match, with all other entities labeled with a default &amp;quot;last name&amp;quot; tag, the most common class in all languages studied.
    The baseline accuracy was measured at 61.18% for Romanian.
    System accuracies range from 77.12% to 91.76% on this same data.
    The results shown in Table 3 were obtained for a Romanian text having 12320 words, from which 438 were entit
