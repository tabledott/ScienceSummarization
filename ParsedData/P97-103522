es, a second regression including only significant factors must then be done.
    In this case, a second regression yields the predictive equation: i.e., a is .40 and w2 is .78.
    The results also show rc is significant at p &lt; .0003, #rep significant at p &lt; .0001, and the combination of is and #rep account for 92% of the variance in US, the external validation criterion.
    The factor #utt was not a significant predictor of performance, in part because #utt and #rep are highly redundant.
    (The correlation between #utt and #rep is 0.91).
    Given these predictions about the relative contribution of different factors to performance, it is then possible to return to the problem first introduced in Section 1: given potentially conflicting performance criteria such as robustness and efficiency, how can the performance of Agent A and Agent B be compared?
    Given values for a and wi , performance can be calculated for both agents using the equation above.
    The mean performance of A is -.44 and the
