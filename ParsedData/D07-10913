k on models that back off to representations with richer statistics (Nie?en and Ney, 2001; Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006; Talbot andOsborne, 2006) by keeping a more complex repre sentation throughout the translation process.Rich morphology often poses a challenge to sta tistical machine translation, since a multitude of word forms derived from the same lemma fragmentthe data and lead to sparse data problems.
			If the input language is morphologically richer than the out put language, it helps to stem or segment the input in a pre-processing step, before passing it on to the translation system (Lee, 2004; Sadat and Habash, 2006).
			Structural problems have also been addressed bypre-processing: Collins et al (2005) reorder the in put to a statistical system to closer match the word order of the output language.On the other end of the translation pipeline, addi tional information has been used in post-processing.
