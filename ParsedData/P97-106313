models in the literature, because neither the models nor the programs that induce them are generally available.
    For each kind of evaluation, we have found one case where we can come close.
    We induced a two-class word-to-word model of translational equivalence from 13 million words of the Canadian Hansards, aligned using the method in (Gale &amp; Church, 1991).
    One class represented content-word links and the other represented function-word links4.
    Link types with negative log-likelihood were discarded after each iteration.
    Both classes' parameters converged after six iterations.
    The value of class-based models was demonstrated by the differences between the hidden parameters for the two classes.
    (),)c) converged at (.78,.00016) for content-class links and at (.43,.000094) for function-class links.
    The most direct way to evaluate the link types in a word-level model of translational equivalence is to treat each link type as a candidate translation lexicon entry, and to measure p
