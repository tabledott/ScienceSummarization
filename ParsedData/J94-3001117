    A compound surface coercion rule requires the T surface realization in each of the specified contexts.
    For convenience, surface coercions and context restrictions can be specified in a single rule, by using &lt;=&gt; as the main connective instead of = or .
    A bidirectional rule is merely an abbreviation that can be included in a grammar in place of the two subrules formed by replacing the &lt;#. first by = and then .
    Such rules need no further discussion.
    To model the conditions imposed by context restriction rules, we recall the If-P-then-S and If-S-then-P operators we defined for regular languages L1 and L2: These operators can be extended to apply to string relations as well, and the results will be regular if the operands are in a regular subclass that is closed under complementation.
    For notational convenience, we let the overbar in these extensions and in the other expressions below stand for the complement relative to 7r* as opposed to the more usual E* x E*: The conditions fo
