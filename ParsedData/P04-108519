ite different with more quarrelsome meeting participants.
    Table 5 represents results concerning the fourth pragmatic assumption.
    While none of the results characterize any strong conditioning of by and , we can nevertheless notice some interesting phenomena.
    For example, there is a tendency for agreements to be transitive, i.e. if X agrees with A and B agrees with X within a limited segment of speech, then agreement between B and A is confirmed in 22.5% of the cases, while the probability of the agreement class is only 18.8%.
    The only slightly surprising result appears in the last column of the table, from which we cannot conclude that disagreement with a disagreement is equivalent to agreement.
    This might be explained by the fact that these sequences of agreement and disagreement do not necessarily concern the same propositional content.
    The probability distributions presented here are admittedly dependent on the meeting genre and particularly speaker personalities.
    Nonetheless, w
