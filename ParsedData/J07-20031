from both syntax-based translation and phrase-based translation.
    We describe our system&#8217;s training and decoding methods in detail, and evaluate it for translation speed and translation accuracy.
    Using BLEU as a metric of translation accuracy, we find that our system performs significantly better than the Alignment Template System, a state-of-the-art phrasebased system.
  
  
    The alignment template translation model (Och and Ney 2004) and related phrase-based models advanced the state of the art in machine translation by expanding the basic unit of translation from words to phrases, that is, substrings of potentially unlimited size (but not necessarily phrases in any syntactic theory).
    These phrases allow a model to learn local reorderings, translations of multiword expressions, or insertions and deletions that are sensitive to local context.
    This makes them a simple and powerful mechanism for translation.
    The basic phrase-based model is an instance of the noisy-channel approach (
