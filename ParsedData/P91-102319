% can be obtained by selecting a threshold that would retain approximately 80% of the corpus.
    Less formal tests of the error rate in the Hansards suggest that the overall error rate is about 2%, while the error rate for the easy 80% of the sentences is about 0.4%.
    Apparently the Hansard translations are more literal than the UBS reports.
    It took 20 hours of real time on a sun 4 to align 367 days of Hansards, or 3.3 minutes per Hansard-day.
    The 367 days of Hansards contain about 890,000 sentences or about 37 million &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; (tokens).
    About half of the computer time is spent identifying tokens, sentences, and paragraphs, while the other half of the time is spent in the align program itself.
    It is interesting to consider what happens if we change our definition of length to count words rather than characters.
    It might seem that words are a more natural linguistic unit than characters (Brown, Lai and Mercer, 1991).
    However, we have found that words do not perform
