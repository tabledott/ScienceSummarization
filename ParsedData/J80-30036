    Cooperative behaviour must be accounted for independently of speech acts, for it often occurs without the use of language. tends that the hearer recognize not only that B was performed but also that through cooperative behaviour by the hearer, intended by the speaker, the effects of A should be achieved.
    The speaker must also believe that it is likely that the hearer can recognize this intention.
    The process by which one agent can infer the plans of another is central to our account of speech acts.
    Schmidt et al [1978] and Genesereth [1978] present algorithms by which one agent can infer the goals of another, but assuming no interaction between the two.
    We describe the process in terms of a set of plausible plan inference rules directly related to the rules by which plans can be constructed.
    Let A and S be two agents and ACT an action.
    One example of a simple plan inference rule is: &amp;quot;If S believes that A wants to do ACT
