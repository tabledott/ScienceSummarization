on discourse structure (including Reichman-Adar 1984, Linde 1979, Linde and Goguen 1978, Cohen 1983) fails to distinguish among some (or, in some cases, all) of these components.
    As a result, significant generalizations are lost, and the computational mechanisms proposed are more complex than necessary.
    By carefully distinguishing these components, we are able to account for significant observations in this related work while simplifying both the explanations given and computational mechanisms used.
    In addition to explicating these linguistic phenomena, the theory provides an overall framework within which to answer questions about the relevance of various segments of discourse to one another and to the overall purposes of the discourse participants.
    Various properties of the intentional component have implications for research in natural-language processing in general.
    In particular, the intentions that underlie discourse are so diverse that approaches to discourse coherence based on sele
