, our base model includes a single binary identity feature per-rule, equivalent to the p(e|f) parameters defined on each rule in standard models.
    As previously noted, our model must be able to derive the reference sentence from the source for it to be included in training.
    For both our discriminative and benchmark (Hiero) we extracted our grammar on the 170K sentence corpus using the approach described in Chiang (2007), resulting in 7.8 million rules.
    The discriminative model was then trained on the training partition, however only 130K of the sentences were used as the model could not produce a derivation of the reference for the remaining sentences.
    There were many grammar rules that the discriminative model did not observe in a reference derivation, and thus could not assign their feature a positive weight.
    While the benchmark model has a positive count for every rule (7.8M), the discriminative model only observes 1.7M rules in actual reference derivations.
