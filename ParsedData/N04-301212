    WordNet::Similarity was preceeded by the distance.pl program, which was released in June 2002.
    This was converted into the object oriented WordNet::Similarity package, which was first released in April 2003 as version 0.03.
    The most current version as of this writing is 0.07, which was released in March 2004.
    The distance.pl program and all versions of WordNet::Similarity up to and including 0.06 were designed and implemented by Siddharth Patwardhan as a part of his Master&#8217;s thesis at the University of Minnesota, Duluth.
    Version 0.07 was designed and implemented by Jason Michelizzi as a part of his Master&#8217;s thesis.
    The lesk measure in WordNet::Similarity was originally designed and implemented by Satanjeev Banerjee, who developed this measure as a part of his Master&#8217;s thesis at the University of Minnesota, Duluth.
    Thereafter Siddharth Patwardhan ported this measure to WordNet::Similarity.
