% reduction for the Chinese data.
    Additionally, we evaluated our model with the transducer analog to the consistent phrase error rate (CPER) metric of Ayan and Dorr (2006).
    This evaluation computes precision, recall, and F1 of the rules extracted under a proposed alignment, relative to the rules extracted under the gold-standard sure alignments.
    Table 3 shows improvements in F1 by using petitive thresholding decreases the frequency of interior nodes for each type and the whole corpus. the syntactic HMM model and competitive thresholding together.
    Individually, each of these changes contributes substantially to this increase.

    In light of the need to reconcile word alignments with phrase structure trees for syntactic MT, we have proposed an HMM-like model whose distortion is sensitive to such trees.
    Our model substantially reduces the number of interior nodes in the aligned corpus and improve
