he Pearson chi-square statistic, denoted X2: where oij is the observed value for the cell in row i and column j, and eij is the corresponding expected value.
    An alternative statistic is the log-likelihood chi-square statistic, denoted G2:8 &#65533;G2 = 2 oij i,j oij loge (17) eij The two statistics have similar values when the counts in the contingency table are large (Agresti 1996).
    The statistics behave differently, however, when the table contains low counts, and, since corpus data are likely to lead to some low counts, the question of which statistic to use is an important one.
    Dunning (1993) argues for the use of G2 rather than X2, based on an analysis of the sampling distributions of G2 and X2, and results obtained when using the statistics to acquire highly associated bigrams.
    We consider Dunning&#8217;s analysis at the end of this section, and the question of whether to use G2 or X2 will be discussed further there.
    For now, we continue with the discussion of how the chi-square test
