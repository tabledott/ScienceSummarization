s domain knowledge and/or more powerful joint inference.
  
  
    This paper introduces the first unsupervised coreference resolution system that is as accurate as supervised systems.
    It performs joint inference among mentions, using relations like apposition and predicate nominals.
    It uses Markov logic as a representation language, which allows it to be easily extended to incorporate additional linguistic and world knowledge.
    Future directions include incorporating additional knowledge, conducting joint entity detection and coreference resolution, and combining coreference resolution with other NLP tasks.
