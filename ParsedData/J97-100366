ter settings and a default configuration that seems to cover many different text types was chosen.
    The defaults set w = 20, k = 10, n -= 1, s = 2, for token-sequence size, block size, number of rounds of smoothing, and smoothing width, respectively.
    The evaluation presented here shows the results for different setting types to give a feeling for the space of results.
    Because the evaluation collection is very small, these results can be seen only as a suggestion; different settings may work better in different situations.
    Figure 6 shows a plot of the results of applying the block comparison algorithm to the Stargazer text with k set to 10.
    When the lowermost portion of a valley is not located at a paragraph gap, the judgment is moved to the nearest paragraph gap.12 For the most part, the regions of strong similarity correspond to the regions of strong agreement among the readers.
    (The results for this text are among the stronger ones and appear in the last line of Table 2.)
