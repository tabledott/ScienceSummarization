    Arabic-English sentence alignment after Arabic word segmentation is illustrated in Figure 2, where one Arabic morpheme is aligned to one or zero English word.
    We then apply the proposed technique to the word segmented Arabic corpus to identify prefixes/suffixes to be merged into their stems or deleted to induce a symmetrical morphological structure.
    Arabic-English sentence alignment after Arabic morphological analysis is shown in Figure 3, where the suffix p is merged into their stems mwAjh and mEArd.
    For phrase translation models, we apply additional morphological analysis induced from noun phrase parsing of Arabic to accomplish a syntactic as well as morphological symmetry between the two languages.
  
  
    We pre-suppose segmentation of a word into prefix(es)-stem-suffix(es), as described in (Lee et al. 2003) The category prefix and suffix encompasses function words such as conjunction markers, prepositions, pronouns, determiners and all inflectional morphemes of the language.
