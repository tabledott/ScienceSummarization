			7.1 Disallowing Overlaps.
			The system as described above might label two con stituents NON-NULL even if they overlap in words.
			This is a problem since overlapping arguments are not allowedin PropBank.
			Among the overlapping constituents we retain the one for which the SVM has the highest confidence, and label the others NULL.
			The probabilities ob tained by applying the sigmoid function to the raw SVM scores are used as the measure of confidence.
			Table 2shows the performance of the parser on the task of identifying and labeling semantic arguments using the hand corrected parses.
