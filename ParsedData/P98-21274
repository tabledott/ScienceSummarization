onality between the objects divided by the amount of information in the descriptions of the objects.
    We use a broad-coverage parser (Lin, 1993; Lin, 1994) to extract dependency triples from the text corpus.
    A dependency triple consists of two words and the grammatical relationship between them in the input sentence.
    For example, the triples extracted from the sentence &amp;quot;I have a brown dog&amp;quot; are: We use the notation 11w, r, w' II to denote the frequency count of the dependency triple (w, r, w') in the parsed corpus.
    When w, r, or w' is the wild card (*), the frequency counts of all the dependency triples that matches the rest of the pattern are summed up.
    For example, kook, obj, *11 is the total occurrences of cook&#8212;object relationships in the parsed corpus, and 11*,*,*11 is the total number of dependency triples extracted from the parsed corpus.
    The description of a word w consists of the frequency counts of all the dependency triples that matches the pattern (w, *
