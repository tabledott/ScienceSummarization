has been applied to biomedical named entity recognition (Nobata et al., 1999; Collier et al., 2000; Yamada et al., 2000; Shimpuku, 2002).
    However, no work has achieved sufficient recognition accuracy.
    One reason is the lack of annotated corpora for training as is often the case of a new domain.
    Nobata et al. (1999) and Collier et al.
    (2000) trained their model with only 100 annotated paper abstracts from the MEDLINE database (National Library of Medicine, 1999), and Yamada et al. (2000) used only 77 annotated paper abstracts.
    In addition, it is difficult to compare the techniques used in each study because they used a closed and different corpus.
    To overcome such a situation, the GENIA corpus (Ohta et al., 2002) has been developed, and at this time it is the largest biomedical annotated corpus available to public, containing 670 annotated abstracts of the MEDLINE database.
    Another reason for low accuracies is that biomedical named entities are essentially hard to recognize using st
