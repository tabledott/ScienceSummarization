, as one reviewer points out, this is not an undesirable consequence, since the development of a suitable representation is where the interlingua builder has a choice and should choose the simplest representation format.
  The appropriate question to ask is whether an approach that addresses the divergence problem from a language-to-interlingua perspective is an improvement over an approach that addresses the problem strictly from a language-to-language point of view.
  This paper argues that the language-to-interlingua approach is the correct one given that the alternative would be to handle language-to-language divergences by constructing detailed source-to-target transfer ules for each lexical entry in the source and target language.
  Introducing the notion of language-to-interlingua divergence allows the translation mapping to be defined in terms of a representation that is general enough to carry over to several different language pairs.
