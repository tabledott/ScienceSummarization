ience of a discourse refer- ent (discussed below), and as input to a set of disjoint reference filters.
			Our implementation seeks to perform exactly the same tasks by inferring hierarchical rela- tions from a less rich base.
			The modifications and assumptions required to accomplish this goal will be highlighted in the following discussion.
			2.2 Anaphora resolution.
			Once the representation f the text has been recast as a set of discourse referents (ordered by offset value), it is sent to the anaphora resolution algorithm proper.
			The basic logic of the algorithm parallels that of the Lap- pin/Leass algorithm.
			The interpretation procedure in- volves moving through the text sentence by sentence and interpreting the discourse referents in each sen- tence from left to right.
			There are two possible in- terpretations of a discourse referent: either it is taken to introduce a new participant in the discourse, or it is taken to refer to a previously interpreted iscourse referent.
