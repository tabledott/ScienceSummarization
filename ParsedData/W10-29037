actic variations of the meaning representation.
  
  
    The goal of semantic parsing is to produce a function F : X &#8594; Z that maps from the space natural language input sentences, X, to the space of meaning representations, Z.
    This type of task is usually cast as a structured output prediction problem, where the goal is to obtain a model that assigns the highest score to the correct meaning representation given an input sentence.
    However, in the task of semantic parsing, this decision relies on identifying a hidden intermediate representation (or an alignment) that captures the way in which fragments of the text correspond to the meaning representation.
    Therefore, we formulate the prediction function as follows: Where b is a feature function that describes the relationships between an input sentence x, alignment y and meaning representation z. w is the weight vector which contains the parameters of the model.
    We refer to the arg max above as the inference problem.
