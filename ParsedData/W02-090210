e of this, both Rapp and Fung focus on expanding an existing large lexicon to add a few novel terms.
    Clearly, a seed lexicon to bootstrap these methods is needed.
    Fortunately, we have outlined in Section 2.1 how such a seed lexicon can be obtained: by finding words spelled identically in both languages.
    We can then construct context vectors that contain information about how a new unmapped word co-occurs with the seed words.
    This vector can be translated into the other language, since we already know the translations of the seed words.
    Finally, we can look for the best matching context vector in the target language, and decide upon the corresponding word to construct a word mapping.
    Again, as in Section 2.2, we have to compute all possible word &#8211; or context vector &#8211; matches.
    We collect then the best word matches in a greedy fashion.
    Table 3 displays the top 15 generated word pairs by this algorithm.
    The context vectors are constructed in the way proposed by Rapp
