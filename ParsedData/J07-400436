tropy model, following the supertagger described in Clark (2002).
    The probabilities of the dependencies are estimated using relative frequencies, following Collins (1996).
    The model was designed to include some long-range predicate&#8211;argument dependencies, as well as local dependencies.
    However, there are a number of problems with the model, as the authors acknowledge.
    First, the model is deficient, losing probability mass to dependency structures not generated by the grammar.
    Second, the relative frequency estimation of the dependency probabilities is ad hoc, and cannot be seen as maximum likelihood estimation, or some other principled method.
    Despite these flaws, the parser based on this model was able to recover CCG predicate&#8211;argument dependencies at around 82% overall F-score on unseen WSJ text.
    Hockenmaier (2003a) and Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002b) present a generative model of normal-form derivations, based on various techniques from the statistical parsing litera
