8212;* (4, 4).
    Then we consider productions whose RHS contains non-terminals, i.e. predicates with arguments.
    In this case, an extracted pattern consists of the words to which the production is linked, as well as non-terminals showing where the arguments are realized.
    For example, for the bowner predicate, the extracted rule would be CONDITION &#8212;* (TEAM 1 player UNUM 2 has (1) ball, (bowner TEAM 1 {UNUM 2 })), where (1) denotes a word gap of size 1, due to the unaligned word the that comes between has and ball.
    A word gap, (g), can be seen as a non-terminal that expands to at most g words in the NL stream, which allows for some flexibility in pattern matching.
    Rule extraction thus proceeds backward from the end of a linearized MR parse (so that a predicate is processed only after its arguments have all been processed), until rules are extracted for all productions.
    There are two cases where the above algorithm would not extract any rules for a production r. First is when no descen
