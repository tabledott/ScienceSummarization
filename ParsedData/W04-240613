 that hierarchical agglomerative clustering using average link (via McQuitty&#8217;s method) fares well.
    Thus, we have chosen to use average link/UPGMA as our criteria function for the agglomerative experiments.
    In similarity space, each instance can be viewed as a node in a weighted graph.
    The weights on edges joining two nodes indicate their pairwise similarity as measured by the cosine between the context vectors that represent the pair of instances.
    When agglomerative clustering starts, each node is in its own cluster and is considered to be the centroid of that cluster.
    At each iteration, average link selects the pair of clusters whose centroids are most similar and merges them into a single cluster.
    For example, suppose the clusters I and J are to be merged into a single cluster IJ.
    The weights on all other edges that connect existing nodes to the new node IJ must now be revised.
    Suppose that Q is such a node.
    The new weight in the graph is computed by averaging the w
