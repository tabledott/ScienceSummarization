cy to accuracy.
    In particular, it is not the case that more frequent classes or verbs are more accurately classified.
    One factor possibly contributing to the poorer performance on unaccusatives and object-drops is the greater degree of error in the automatic counting procedures for these verbs, which we discussed in Section 3.2.
    In addition to exploration of other linguistic features, another area of future work is to develop better search patterns, for transitivity and passive in particular.
    Unfortunately, one limiting factor in automatic counting is that we inherit the inevitable errors in POS tags in an automatically tagged corpus.
    For example, while the unergative verbs are classified highly accurately, we note that two of the three errors in misclassifying unergatives (galloped and paraded) are due to a high degree of error in tagging.'
    The verb galloped is incorrectly tagged VBN instead of VBD in all 12 of its uses in the corpus, and the verb paraded is incorrectly tagged VBN ins
