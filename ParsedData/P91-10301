cs and discourse models, there is little hope in the near term of building computational models for unrestricted text to resolve the ambiguity.
    There have been several structure-based proposals about ambiguity resolution in the literature; they are particularly attractive because they are simple and don't demand calculations in the semantic or discourse domains.
    The two main ones are: syntactic nodes (Frazier 1978).
    For the particular case we are concerned with, attachment of a prepositional phrase in a verb -Iobject context as in sentence (1), these two principles &#8212; at least in the version of syntax that Frazier assumes &#8212; make opposite predictions: Right Association predicts noun attachment, while Minimal Attachment predicts verb attachment.
    Psycholinguistic work on structure-based strategies is primarily concerned with modeling the time course of parsing and disambiguation, and proponents of this approach explicitly acknowledge that other information enters into determining a fin
