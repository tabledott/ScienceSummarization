runing the event space into discrete sets).
    Learning these prototypical schematic sequences of events is important for rich understanding of text.
    Scripts were central to natural language understanding research in the 1970s and 1980s for proposed tasks such as summarization, coreference resolution and question answering.
    For example, Schank and Abelson (1977) proposed that understanding text about restaurants required knowledge about the Restaurant Script, including the participants (Customer, Waiter, Cook, Tables, etc.

    Narrative chains are partially ordered sets of events centered around a common protagonist.
    They are related to str
