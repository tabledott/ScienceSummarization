;9&#8221; and &#8220;0&#8221; respectively).
    During testing, the probability of a boundary tag sequence assignment t1... tn given a character sequence c1 ...cn is determined by using the maximum entropy classifier to compute the probability that a boundary tag ti is assigned to each individual character ci.
    If we were to just assign each character the boundary tag with the highest probability, it is possible that the classifier produces a sequence of invalid tags (e.g., &#8220;m&#8221; followed by &#8220;s&#8221;).
    To eliminate such possibilities, we implemented a dynamic programming algorithm which considers only valid boundary tag sequences given an input character sequence.
    At each character position i, the algorithm considers each last word candidate ending at position i and consisting of K characters in length (K = 1, ..., 20 in our experiments).
    To determine the boundary tag assignment to the last word W with K characters, the first character of W is assigned boundary tag &#8220;b&#8
