 from adjuncts, and our subcategorization feature could be sabotaged by cases such as The door closed yesterday.
    In the Penn Treebank style, yesterday is considered an NP with tree structure equivalent to that of a direct object.
    Our subcategorization feature is fairly specific: for example, the addition of an ADVP to a verb phrase will result in a different value.
    We tested variations of the feature that counted the number of NPs in a VP or the total number of children of the VP, with no significant change in results.
    The subcategorization feature was used in conjunction with the path feature, which represents the sequence of nonterminals along the path through the parse tree from the target word to the constituent representing a frame element.
    Making use of the new subcategorization (subcat) feature by adding the distribution P(r  |subcat, path, t) to the lattice of distributions in the baseline system resulted in a slight improvement to 80.8% performance from 80.4%.
