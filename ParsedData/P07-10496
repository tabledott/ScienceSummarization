 links by linear transitivity.
    For each representative subset R C_ this defines a unique shortest common cover link set (see figure 1(c)).
    Given a shortest common cover link set the bracketing which it represents can be calculated by first using linear transitivity to deduce missing links and then applying the bracket reconstruction algorithm outlined above for R.U.
    Having defined a link-based representation of syntactic structure, it is natural to wonder what the relation is between this representation and standard dependency structures.
    The main differences between the two representations can all be seen in figure 2.
    The first difference is in the linking of the NP the boy.
    While the shortest common cover link set has an exocentric construction for this NP (that is, links going back and forth between the two words), the dependency structure forces us to decide which of the two words in the NP is its head.
    Considering that linguists have not been able to agree whether it is the de
