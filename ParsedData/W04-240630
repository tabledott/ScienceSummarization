    We will draw our large corpora from a variety of sources, including the British National Corpus, the English GigaWord Corpus, and the Web.
    Our motivation is that the larger corpora will provide more generic co&#8211;occurrence information about words without regard to a particular target word.
    However, the data specific to a given target word will capture the word usages in the immediate context of the target word.
    Thus, we will test the hypothesis that a smaller sample of data where each instance includes the target word is more effective for sense discrimination than a more general corpus of training data.
    We are also planning to automatically attach descriptive labels to the discovered clusters that capture the underlying word sense.
    These labels will be created from the most c
