ting the NP might be incorrect, because the correct analysis may be a noun-noun conjunction of &amp;quot;worms&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;frogs&amp;quot;, (with the reading that birds eat worms and frogs, both of which are small).
    Of course, there is a second problem here for a tree-building parser, namely that (13.2) has a second reading which is an &amp;quot;NP and NP&amp;quot; conjunction.
    As we have seen above, there is no corresponding problem for a D-theory parser, because if it merely posits an NP dominating &amp;quot;frogs&amp;quot;, the structure which will result for (13.2) is appropriately vague between both the NP reading and the noun reading of &amp;quot;frogs&amp;quot; (i.e. between the readings where the frogs are just plain frogs and where the frogs are small.)
    But the solution to the second problem for a D-theory parser is also a solution to the first!
    After seeing &amp;quot;and&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;frogs&amp;quot; in its buffer, a D-theory parser can simply posit an NP node d
