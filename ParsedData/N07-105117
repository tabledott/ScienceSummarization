rojected) trees with unsplit evaluation symbols, where P(T&#8242;|G) = ET:T&#8242;=,(T) P(T |G).
    We now have several choices of how to select a tree given these posterior distributions over trees.
    In this section, we present experiments with the various options and explicitly relate them to parse risk minimization (Titov and Henderson, 2006). archically split PCFGs with and without hierarchical coarse-tofine parsing on our development set (1578 sentences with 40 or less words from section 22 of the Penn Treebank).
    For comparison the parser of Charniak and Johnson (2005) has an accuracy of F1=90.7 and runs in 19 min on this set.
    The decision-theoretic approach to parsing would be to select the parse tree which minimizes our expected loss according to our beliefs: where TT and TP are &#8220;true&#8221; and predicted parse trees.
    Here, our loss is described by the function L whose first argument is the predicted parse tree and the second is the gold parse tree.
    Reasonable candidates for L
