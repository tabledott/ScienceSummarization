rd algorithm as well as the Viterbi algorithm, so users can opt for tag thresholding rather than forced-choice tagging (giving &gt;99% tag recall on DepBank, at some cost to overall system speed).
    Recent experiments suggest that this can lead to a small gain in parse accuracy as well as coverage (Watson, 2006).

    The tagger has been augmented with an unknown word model which performs well under most circumstances.
    However, known but rare words often caused problems as tags for all realisations were rarely present.
    A series of manually developed rules has be
