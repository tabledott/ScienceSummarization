dating q(B), the expectation function of the constraint remains constant during this update.
    As shown by Grac&#184;a et al. (2007), the update in (3) is a constrained optimization problem and can be solved by performing gradient search on its dual: For a fixed value of A the optimal q(z) &#8733; q'(z) exp(&#8722;ATf(z)).
    By updating q(B) and q(z) as in (2) and (3) we are effectively maximizing the lower bound F. 2Constraints of the form E9[f(z)] &gt; b are easily imposed by negating f(z) and b.
    We now derive the specific variational updates for our dependency induction model.
    First we assume the following mean-field factorization of our variational distribution: The only factor affected by the expectation constraints is q(z).
    Recall from the previous section that the update for q(z) is performed via gradient search on the dual of a constrained minimization problem of the form: where s0 varies over the set of unique symbols in the observed tags, z0 denotes subsymbols for each symbol, c vari
