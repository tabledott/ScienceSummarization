 the entities from those annotated in GENIA, both according to their numbers of occurrences.
    We evaluated USP by the number of answers it provided and the accuracy as determined by manual labeling.10 Since USP is the first unsupervised semantic parser, conducting a meaningful comparison of it with other systems is not straightforward.
    Standard question-answering (QA) benchmarks do not provide the most appropriate comparison, because they tend to simultaneously emphasize other aspects not directly related to semantic parsing.
    Moreover, most state-of-the-art QA systems use supervised learning in their key components and/or require domain-specific engineering efforts.
    The closest available system to USP in aims and capabilities is TextRunner (Banko et al., 2007), and we compare with it.
    TextRunner is the state-of-the-art system for open-domain information extraction; its goal is to extract knowledge from text without using supervised labels.
    Given that a central challenge to semantic pars
