forest.
    In this case, loops do not change values, and we use the same algorithm as for the Viterbi semiring.
    In an implementation of the Viterbi-n-best semiring, in practice, loops can change values, but at most n times, so the same algorithm used for the Viterbi semiring still works.
    Elsewhere (Goodman 1998), we describe theoretically correct implementations for both the Viterbi-derivation and Viterbin-best semirings that keep all values in the event of ties, preserving addition's associativity.
    The last semiring we consider is the inside semiring.
    This semiring is the most difficult.
    There are two cases of interest, one of which we can solve exactly, and the other of which requires approximations.
    In many cases involving looping buckets, all deduction rules will be of the form cf7x, where al and b are items in the looping bucket, and x is either a rule, or an item in a previously computed bucket.
    This case corresponds to the items used for deducing singleton productions, such
