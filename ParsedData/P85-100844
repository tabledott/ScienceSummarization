uess as to how to represent a simple sentence like A boy builds a boat. is as follows: This simple approach seems to break down when we encounter the more difficult phenomena of natural language, like tense, intensional contexts, and adverbials, as in the sentence A boy wanted to build a boat quickly.
    These phenomena have led students of language to introduce significant complications in their logical notations for representing sentences.
    My approach will be to maintain the syntactic simplicity of the logical notation and expand the theory of the world implicit in the semantics to accommodate this simplicity.
    The representation of the above sentence, as is justified below, is That is, el occurred in the past, where el is X'S wanting es, which is the quickness of es, which is z's building of y, where x is a boy and y is a boat.
    In brief, the logical form of natural language sentences will be a conjunction of atomic predications in which all variables are existentially quantified with the widest
