s number of correct TIME fills for correctly recognized verbs over total number of correctly recognized verbs.
    Our total correctness scores on a small sample of 8505 words of text is 394 correct event times out of 663 correct verb tags, giving a correctness score of 59.4%.
    Over half the errors were due to propagation of spreading of an incorrect event time to neighboring events; about 15% of the errors were due to event times preceding the initial TIMEX expression (here the initial reference time should have been used); and at least 10% of the errors were due to explicitly marked tense switches.
    This is a very small sample, so the results are meant to be illustrative of the scope and limitations of this baseline eventaligning technique rather than present a definitive result.
  
  
    The most relevant prior work is (Wiebe et al. 98), who dealt with meeting scheduling dialogs (see also (Alexandersson et al.
    97), (Busemann et al. 97)), where the goal is to schedule a time for the meeting.
