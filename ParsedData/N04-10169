idate translations.
    He observes that this approach suffers from an acute data sparseness problem and goes on to obtain counts for candidate compounds through web searches, thus achieving a translation accuracy of 86&#8211;87%.
    Prescher et al. (2000) concentrate on verbs and their objects.
    Assuming that the target language translation of the verb is known, they select from the candidate translations the noun that is semantically most compatible with the verb.
    The semantic fit between a verb and its argument is modeled using a class-based lexicon that is derived from unlabeled data using the expectation maximization algorithm (verb-argument model).
    Prescher et al. also propose a refined version of this approach that only models the fit between a verb and its object (verb-object model), disregarding other arguments of the verb.
    The two models are trained on the BNC and evaluated against two corpora of 1,340 and 814 bilingual sentence pairs, with an average of 8.63 and 2.83 translations fo
