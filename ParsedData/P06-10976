tion 2 from a set of hypotheses if we hold all weights constant, except for the weight An (which is set to x).
    The discriminative reranking algorithm is initialized with the parameters of the sub-models 0, an initial choice of the A vector, gold standard word alignments (labels) for the alignment discriminative training set, the constant N specifying the N-best list size used', and an empty master set of hypothesized alignments.
    The algorithm is a three step loop: We define new sub-models to model factors not captured by Model 4.
    These are lines 6 to 16 of Table 3, where we use the &#8220;E to F&#8221; alignment direction as an example.
    We use word-level translation tables informed by both the &#8220;E to F&#8221; and the &#8220;F to E&#8221; translation directions derived using the three symmetrization heuristics, the &#8220;E to F&#8221; translation table from the final iteration of the HMM model and an &#8220;E to F&#8221; translation table derived using approximative stemming.
