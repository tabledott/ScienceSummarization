 parse of the sentence, C&amp;C derive several approximations, in each case starting from the well known equation for p(Nlk I tom) in terms of the inside and outside probabilities, /3(1V.1,k) and where fi(Mjkj ) and a(N'k ) are defined as follows: (4) Informally, this can be obtained by approximating the outside probability a(N.;,k) in Equation 1 with a bitag estimate.
    Of the five terms in Equation 4, two can be directly estimated from training data: the &amp;quot;boundary statistics&amp;quot; p(N.:,k I tj) (the probability of a constituent of type NIAstarting just after the tag tj) and p(tk I NIA) (the probability of tk appearing just after the end of a constituent of type N.4).
    The tag sequence probabilitiy in the denominator is approximated using a bi-tag approximation: The basic algorithm then is quite simple.
    One uses the standard chart-parsing algorithm, except at each iteration one takes from the agenda the constituent that maximizes the FOM described in Equation 4.
    There are, however,
