e pairs of test data use the parameter values set to their optimal values for the trial data.
    We report results for four principal versions of Model 1, trained using English as the source language and French as the target language: We also performed ablation experiments in which we ommitted each applicable modification in turn from each principal version of Model 1, to observe the effect on alignment error.
    All non-EM-trained parameters were re-optimized on the trial data for each version of Model 1 tested, with the exception that the value of the LLR exponent and initial nullword weight in the combined model were carried over from the heuristic model.
  
  
    We report the performance of our different versions of Model 1 in terms of precision, recall, and alignment error rate (AER) as defined by Och and Ney (2003).
    These three performance statistics are defined as where S denotes the annotated set of sure alignments, P denotes the annotated set of possible alignments, and A denotes the set of a
