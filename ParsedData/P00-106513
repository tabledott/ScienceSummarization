st data for which the conditioning event had been seen in training data.
    Accuracy is the proportion of covered test data for which the correct role is predicted, and Performance, simply the product of coverage and accuracy, is the overall percentage of test data for which the correct role is predicted.
    Accuracy is somewhat similar to the familiar metric of precision in that it is calculated over cases for which a decision is made, and performance is similar to recall in that it is calculated over all true frame elements.
    However, unlike a traditional precision/recall trade-off, these results have no threshold to adjust, and the task is a multi-way classification rather than a binary decision.
    The distributions calculated were simply the empirical distributions from the training data.
    That is, occurrences of each role and each set of conditioning events were counted in a table, and probabilities calculated by dividing the counts for each role by the total number of observations for each con
