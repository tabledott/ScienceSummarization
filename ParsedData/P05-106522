s intended for grades 3-8.
    We found that our SVM classifier, trained on the Weekly Reader corpus, classified four of these articles as grade 4 and seven articles as grade 5 (with one overlap with grade 4).
    These results indicate that our classifier can generalize to other data sets.
    Since there was no training data corresponding to higher reading levels, the best performance we can expect for adult-level newspaper articles is for our classifiers to mark them as the highest grade level, which is indeed what happened for 10 randomly chosen articles from standard edition of The Washington Post.
  
  
    Statistical LMs were used to classify texts based on reading level, with trigram models being noticeably more accurate than bigrams and unigrams.
    Combining information from statistical LMs with other features using support vector machines provided the best results.
    Future work includes testing additional classifier features, e.g. parser likelihood scores and features obtained using a syntax-b
