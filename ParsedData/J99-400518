straint, however, which do not hold in word ordering.)
    So far, statistical translation research has either opted for heuristic beam-search algorithms or different channel models.
    For example, some researchers avoid bag generation by preprocessing bilingual texts to remove word-order differences, while others adopt channels that eliminate syntactically unlikely alignments.
    Finally, expensive decoding also suggests expensive training from unannotated (monolingual) texts, which presents a challenging bottleneck for extending statistical machine translation to language pairs and domains where large bilingual corpora do not exist.
