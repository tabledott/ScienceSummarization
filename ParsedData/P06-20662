 for the analysis of natural language are very nearly projective, differing only minimally from the best projective approximation (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and Nov&#225;k, 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
    This raises the question of whether it is possible to characterize a class of mildly non-projective dependency structures that is rich enough to account for naturally occurring syntactic constructions, yet restricted enough to enable efficient parsing.
    In this paper, we review a number of proposals for classes of dependency structures that lie between strictly projective and completely unrestricted non-projective structures.
    These classes have in common that they can be characterized in terms of properties of the dependency structures themselves, rather than in terms of grammar formalisms that generate the structures.
    We compare the proposals from a theoretical point of view, and evaluate a subset of them empirically by testing their representational adequacy with respect to two depend
