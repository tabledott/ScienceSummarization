ppropriately extended version of the search algorithm described in Section 5.
    Using an n-best approximation, we might face the problem that the parameters trained with the GIS algorithm yield worse translation results even on the training corpus.
    This can happen because with the modified model scaling factors, the n-best list can change significantly and can include sentences that have not been taken into account in training.
    Using these sentences, the new model parameters might perform worse than the old model parameters.
    To avoid this problem, we proceed as follows.
    In a first step, we perform a search, compute an n-best list, and use this n-best list to train the model parameters.
    Second, we use the new model parameters in a new search and compute a new n-best list, which is combined with the existing n-best list.
    Third, using this extended n-best list, new model parameters are computed.
    This process is iterated until the resulting n-best list does not change.
