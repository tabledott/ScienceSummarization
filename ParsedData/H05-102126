			We believe that this estimation of model parameters directly from phrase alignments obtainedunder the phrase translation model is a novel contri bution; prior approaches derived the parameters of the reordering models from word aligned bitext, e.g. within the phrase pair extraction procedure.We have shown that these models yield improve ments in alignment and translation performance on Arabic-English and Chinese-English tasks, and that the reordering model can be integrated into largeevaluation systems.
			Our experiments show that discriminative training procedures such Minimum Er ror Training also yield additive improvements by tuning TTM systems which incorporate ML-trained reordering models.
			This is essential for integrating our reordering model inside an evaluation system,where a variety of techniques are applied simultane ously.The MJ-1 and MJ-2 models are extremely simple models of phrase reordering.
			Despite their sim plicity, these models provide large improvements in BLEU score when incor
