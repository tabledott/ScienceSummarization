ent types (Zarcone and Lenci 2008), and so forth.
    Finally, some DSMs capture a sort of &#8220;topical&#8221; relatedness between words: They might find, for example, a relation between dog and fidelity.
    Topical relatedness, addressed by DSMs based on document distributions such as LSA (Landauer and Dumais 1997) and Topic Models (Griffiths, Steyvers, and Tenenbaum 2007), is not further discussed in this article.
    DSMs have found wide applications in computational lexicography, especially for automatic thesaurus construction (Grefenstette 1994; Lin 1998a; Curran and Moens 2002; Kilgarriff et al. 2004; Rapp 2004).
    Corpus-based semantic models have also attracted the attention of lexical semanticists as a way to provide the notion of synonymy with a more robust empirical foundation (Geeraerts 2010; Heylen et al. 2008).
    Moreover, DSMs for attributional and relational similarity are widely used for the semi-automatic bootstrapping or extension of terminological repositories, computational lexicon
