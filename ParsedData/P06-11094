    Although it is now known that DOP1's relative frequency estimator is statistically inconsistent (Johnson 2002), the model yields excellent empirical results and has been used in state-of-the-art systems.
    Let's illustrate DOP1 with a simple example.
    Assume a corpus consisting of only two trees, as given in figure 1.
    DOP1 computes the probability of a subtree t as the probability of selecting t among all corpus subtrees that can be substituted on the same node as t. This probability is computed as the number of occurrences of t in the corpus,  |t |, divided by the total number of occurrences of all subtrees t' with the same root label as t.1 Let r(t) return the root label of t. Then we may write: New sentences may be derived by combining fragments, i.e. subtrees, from this corpus, by means of a node-substitution operation indicated as o. Node-substitution identifies the leftmost nonterminal frontier node of one subtree with the root node of a second subtree (i.e., the second subtree is substit
