ut agreement-based joint inference.
    Our experimental results further confirm the strength of the Good Grief model.
    Our model significantly outperforms individual ranking models as well as a stateof-the-art joint ranking model.
  
  
    Sentiment Classification Traditionally, categorization of opinion texts has been cast as a binary classification task (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Dave et al., 2003).
    More recent work (Pang and Lee, 2005; Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) has expanded this analysis to the ranking framework where the goal is to assess review polarity on a multi-point scale.
    While this approach provides a richer representation of a single opinion, it still operates on the assumption of one opinion per text.
    Our work generalizes this setting to the problem of analyzing multiple opinions &#8211; or multiple aspects of an opinion.
    Since multiple opinions in a single text are related, it is insufficient to treat them as separate single-aspect ranking
