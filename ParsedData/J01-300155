 two or three LDOCE senses when WordNet does not distinguish between them.
    The mapping also contained significant gaps, chiefly words and senses not in the translation scheme.
    SEMCOR contains 91,808 words tagged with WordNet synsets, 6,071 of which are proper names, which we ignored, leaving 85,737 words which could potentially be translated.
    The translation contains only 36,869 words tagged with LDOCE senses; however, this is a reasonable size for an evaluation corpus for the task, and it is several orders of magnitude larger than those used by other researchers working in large vocabulary WSD, for example Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthrie (1992), Harley and Glennon (1997), and Mahesh et al. (1997).
    This corpus was also constructed without the excessive cost of additional hand-tagging and does not introduce any of the inconsistencies that can occur with a poorly controlled tagging strategy.
    Resnik and Yarowsky (1997) proposed to evaluate large vocabulary WSD systems by choosing a set of test wo
