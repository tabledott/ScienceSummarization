structure of the source tree.
    The probability P(Tb|Ta) of transforming the source tree Ta into target tree Tb is modeled in a sequence of steps proceeding from the root of the target tree down.
    At each level of the tree: In the final step of the process, as in the tree-tostring model, lexical items at the leaves of the tree are translated into the target language according to a distribution Pt(f|e).
    Allowing non-1-to-1 correspondences between nodes in the two trees is necessary to handle the fact that the depth of corresponding words in the two trees often differs.
    A further consequence of allowing elementary trees of size one or two is that some reorderings not allowed when reordering the children of each individual node separately are now possible.
    For example, with our simple tree if nodes A and B are considered as one elementary tree, with probability Pelem(ta|A &#8658; BZ), their collective children will be reordered with probability giving the desired word ordering XZY.
    However,
