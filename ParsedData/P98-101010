shown for the candidate in Figure 1.
    The set of matching tiles 2, 4, and 5 covers the candidate, as does the set of tiles 1 and 5.
    Also note that tile 1 constitutes a cover on its own.
    To make this precise, we first say that a tile T1 connects to a tile 7'2 if (i) 2'2 starts after T1 starts, (ii) there is no gap between the end of T1 and the start of 7'2 (there may be some overlap), and (iii) T2 ends after T1 (neither tile includes the other).
    For example, tiles 2 and 4 in the figure connect, while tiles 2 and 5 do not, and neither do tiles 1 and 4 (since tile 1 includes tile 4 as a subsequence).
    A cover for a situated candidate c is a sequence of matching tiles which collectively cover the entire candidate, including the boundary brackets, and possibly some context, such that each tile connects to the following one.
    A cover thus provides positive evidence for the entire sequence of tags in the candidate.
    The set of all the covers for a candidate summarizes all of the evidence for
