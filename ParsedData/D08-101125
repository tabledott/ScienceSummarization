istance-based distortion model by varying the controlling factor K in (6).
    For example, setting K=1.0 gives a lineardecay distortion model, and setting K=2.0 gives a quadratic smoothed distance-based distortion model.
    As shown in Table 5, the optimal result can be achieved using a properly smoothed distancebased distortion model.
  
  
    Synonym matching and word ordering are two central issues for hypothesis alignment in confusion-network-based MT system combination.
    In this paper, an IHMM-based method is proposed for hypothesis alignment.
    It uses a similarity model for synonym matching and a distortion model for word ordering.
    In contrast to previous methods, the similarity model explicitly incorporates both semantic and surface word similarity, which is critical to monolingual word alignment, and a smoothed distance-based distortion model is used to model the first-order dependency of word ordering, which is shown to be better than simpler approaches.
