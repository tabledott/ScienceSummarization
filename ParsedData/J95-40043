stical measures of lexical association (Hindle and Rooth 1993).
    Word-sense disambiguation, a problem that once seemed out of reach for systems without a great deal of handcrafted linguistic and world knowledge, can now in some cases be done with high accuracy when all information is derived automatically from corpora (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Yarowsky 1992; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Bruce and Wiebe 1994).
    An effort has recently been undertaken to create automated machine translation systems in which the linguistic information needed for translation is extracted automatically from aligned corpora (Brown et al. 1990).
    These are just a few of the many recent applications of corpus-based techniques in natural language processing.
    Along with great research advances, the infrastructure is in place for this line of research to grow even stronger, with on-line corpora, the grist of the corpus-based natural language processing grindstone, getting bigger and better and becoming more readily a
