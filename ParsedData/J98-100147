iately applied to written language analysis (e.g., in the work of Bahl and Mercer [1976], Debili [1977], etc.).
    For a discussion, see Ide and Walker (1992).
    In the area of word sense disambiguation, Black (1988) developed a model based on decision trees using a corpus of 22 million tokens, after manually sense-tagging approximately 2,000 concordance lines for five test words.
    Since then, supervised learning from sense-tagged corpora has since been used by several researchers: Zernik (1990, 1991), Hearst (1991), Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993), Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992d, 1993), Bruce and Wiebe (1994), Miller et al. (1994), Niwa and Nitta (1994), Lehman (1994), among others.
    However, despite the availability of increasingly large corpora, two major obstacles impede the acquisition of lexical knowledge from corpora: the difficulties of manually sense-tagging a training corpus, and data sparseness. distributes a corpus of approximately 200,000 sentences from the Brown Corpus and the W
