    Accuracy was measured by looking at the Penn tag for every word that the system judged to be a verb.

    My program was right in 8 of these cases and wrong in 20, for a 0.24% error-rate beyond the rate using hand-verified tags.
    Typical disagreements in which my system was right involved verbs that are ambiguous with much more frequent nouns, like mold in &amp;quot;The Soviet Communist Party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it .&amp;quot; There were several systematic constructions in which the Penn tags were right and my system was wrong, including constructions like &amp;quot;We consumers are...&amp;quot; and pseudo-clefts like &amp;quot;what you then do is you make them think....
