ginal source or the target (&amp;quot;one entity&amp;quot;) and a term (&amp;quot;another that is related to it&amp;quot;) that refers to one of them.
    Like Stallard (1987), who noted that &amp;quot;in any usage of the metonomy (sic) operation there is a choice about which of two clashing elements to extend&amp;quot; (ibid., p. 182), the met* method allows for metonymies that develop in different &amp;quot;directions.&amp;quot; A successful inference is sometimes directed &amp;quot;forward&amp;quot; from the preference or &amp;quot;backward&amp;quot; from the target, depending on the metonymic concept (more on this shortly).
    It is this direction of inferencing that determines whether the source or target is substituted in a successful metonymy.
    The substitute source or target is used to discover another semantic relation that can be literal, metonymic again, metaphorical, or anomalous.
    In Figure 1, the presence of a relevant analogy (diamond 3) discriminates metaphorical relations from anomalou
