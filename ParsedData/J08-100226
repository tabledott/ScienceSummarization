ion 3 to the probabilistic modeling of HPSG parsing.
    Section 4.1 briefly introduces HPSG.
    Section 4.2 and 4.3 describe how to represent HPSG parse trees and predicate&#8211;argument structures by feature forests.
    Together with the parameter estimation algorithm in Section 3, these methods constitute a complete method for probabilistic disambiguation.
    We also address a method for accelerating the construction of feature forests for all treebank sentences in Section 4.4.
    The design of feature functions will be given in Section 4.5.
    HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994; Sag, Wasow, and Bender 2003) is a syntactic theory that follows the lexicalist framework.
    In HPSG, linguistic entities, such as words and phrases, are denoted by signs, which are represented by typed feature structures (Carpenter 1992).
    Signs are a formal representation of combinations of phonological forms and syntactic/semantic structures, and express which phonological form signifies which syntactic/semantic structure.
