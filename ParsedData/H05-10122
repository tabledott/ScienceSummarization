rk on word alignments has been done on parallel corpora where the alignment at the sentence level is also done automatically.
			The IBMmodels 1-5 (Brown et al, 1993) produce word align ments with increasing algorithmic complexity and performance.
			These IBM models and more recent refinements (Moore, 2004) as well as algorithms thatbootstrap from these models like the HMM algorithm described in (Vogel et al, 1996) are unsuper vised algorithms.
			The relative success of these automatic techniques together with the human annotation cost has delayed the collection of supervised word-aligned corpora for more than a decade.(Cherry and Lin, 2003) recently proposed a di rect alignment formulation and state that it would be straightforward to estimate the parameters givena supervised alignment corpus.
			In this paper, we ex tend their work and show that with a small amountof annotated data, together with a modeling strat egy and search algorithm yield significant gains in alignment F-measure.
