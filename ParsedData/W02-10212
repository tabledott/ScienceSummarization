ccessfully applied in speech recognition, for the search process (Ortmanns et al., 1997) and as an interface to other systems (Oerder and Ney, 1993).
    (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995) and (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) propose the use of word graphs for natural language generation.
    In this paper, we are going to present a concept for the generation of word graphs in a machine translation system.
    During search, we keep a bookkeeping tree.
    It is not necessary to keep all the information that we need for the expansion of hypotheses during search in this structure, thus we store only the following: After the search has finished, i.e. when all source sentence positions have been translated, we trace back the best sentence in the bookkeeping tree.
    To generate the N best hypotheses after search, it is not sufficient to simply trace back the complete hypotheses with the highest probabilities in the bookkeeping, because those hypotheses have been recombined.
    Thus, many hypotheses with a high pr
