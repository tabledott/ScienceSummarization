anguage model derived from a large text collection.
    We first motivate the need for reordering and rephrasing, then discuss our implementation.
    For the word-ordering task, we do not have to consider all the possible traversals, since the number of valid traversals is limited by ordering constraints encoded in the fusion lattice.
    However, the basis lattice does not uniquely determine the ordering: The placement of trees inserted in the basis lattice from other theme sentences is not restricted by the original basis tree.
    While the ordering of many sentence constituents is determined by their syntactic roles, some constituents, such as time, location and manner circumstantials, are free to move (Elhadad et al. 2001).
    Therefore, the algorithm still has to select an appropriate order from among different orders of the inserted trees.
    The process so far produces a sentence that can be quite different from the extracted sentence; although the basis sentences provides guidance for the generati
