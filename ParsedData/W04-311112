nd-written) to match all the relevant configurations and fill in template slots based on the resulting pattern matches.
    As discussed in the introduction, dealing with such complications in patterns can take much time and effort.
    Our approach instead is to build an annotated corpus in which the predicate-argument information is annotated on top of the parsing annotations in the Treebank, the resulting corpus being called a &#8220;proposition bank&#8221; or Propbank.
    This newly annotated corpus is then used for training processors that will automatically extract such structures from new examples.
    In a Propbank for biomedical text, the types of inhibit examples listed above would consistently have their compounds labeled as Arg0 and their enzymes labeled as Arg1, for nominalized forms such as A is an inhibitor of B, A caused inhibition of B, inhibition of B by A, as well the standard A inhibits B.
    We would also be able to label adjuncts consistently, such as the with prepositional phrase in C
