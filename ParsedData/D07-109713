eflecting its popularity among the m parsers.
			The output of the ensemble system for x is the maximum spanning tree of this graph (rooted at the node 0), which can be extracted using the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm, as shown by McDonald et al (2005).
			Following Sagae and Lavie (2006), we let s(a) = ?m i=1 w c iai, where wci is the average labeled attachment score of parser i for the word class c8 of the dependent of a, and ai is 1 if a ? Gi and 0 otherwise.
			The Blended parser uses six component parsers, with three different parsing algorithms, each of which is used to construct one left-to-right parser and one right-to-left parser.
			The parsing algorithmsused are the arc-eager baseline algorithm, the arc standard variant of the baseline algorithm, and the incremental, non-projective parsing algorithm first described by Covington (2001) and recently used for deterministic classifier-based parsing by Nivre (2007), all of which are available in MaltParser.
			Thus, the six component parsers for each langu
