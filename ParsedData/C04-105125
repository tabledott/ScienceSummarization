			String edit distance extraction techniques involve assumptions about the data that are inadequate, but achieve high precision.
			Techniques like our F2 extraction strategies appear to extract a more diverse variety of data, but yield more noise.
			We believe that an approach with the strengths of both methods would lead to significant improvement in paraphrase identification and generation.
			In the near term, however, the relatively similar performances of F2 and L12-trained models on the F2 test data suggest that with further refinements, this more complex type of data can achieve good results.
			More data will surely help.
			One focus of future work is to build a classifier to predict whether two sentences are related through paraphrase.
			Features might include edit distance, temporal/topical clustering information, information about cross-document discourse structure, relative sentence length, and synonymy information.
			We believe that this work has potential impact on the fields of summa
