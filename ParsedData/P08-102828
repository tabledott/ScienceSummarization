ltiplicative model does not have any free parameters and hence does not require optimization for this particular task.
  
  
    In this paper we presented a general framework for vector-based semantic composition.
    We formulated composition as a function of two vectors and introduced several models based on addition and multiplication.
    Despite the popularity of additive models, our experimental results showed the superiority of models utilizing multiplicative combinations, at least for the sentence similarity task attempted here.
    We conjecture that the additive models are not sensitive to the fine-grained meaning distinctions involved in our materials.
    Previous applications of vector addition to document indexing (Deerwester et al., 1990) or essay grading (Landauer et al., 1997) were more concerned with modeling the gist of a document rather than the meaning of its sentences.
    Importantly, additive models capture composition by considering all vector components representing the meaning of t
