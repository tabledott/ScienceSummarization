 on meaning Ms, given that parse T is known.
    This assumption is justified because the word tags in our parse representation specify both semantic and syntactic class information.
    Under this assumption: Finally, we assume that most of the probability mass for each discourse-dependent meaning is focused on a single parse tree and on a single pre-discourse meaning.
    Under this (Viterbi) assumption, the summation operator can be replaced by the maximization operator, yielding: This expression corresponds to the computation actually performed by our system which is shown in Figure 1.
    Processing proceeds in three stages: These parses, together with their probability scores, are passed to the semantic interpretation model.
    2.
    The constrained space of candidate parses T (received from the parsing model), combined with the full space of possible pre-discourse meanings Ms, is searched for n-best candidates according to the measure P(Ms,T) P(W IT).
    These pre-discourse meanings, together with t
