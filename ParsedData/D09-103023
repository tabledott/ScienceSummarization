 too costly and timeconsuming.
    We have shown that Mechanical Turk can be used creatively to produce quite interesting things.
    We showed how a reading comprehension test could be created, administered, and graded, with only very minimal intervention.
    We believe that it is feasible to use Mechanical Turk for a wide variety of other machine translated tasks like creating word alignments for sentence pairs, verifying the accuracy of document- and sentence-alignments, performing non-simulated active learning experiments for statistical machine translation, even collecting training data for low resource languages like Urdu.
    The cost of using Mechanical Turk is low enough that we might consider attempting quixotic things like human-in-the-loop minimum error rate training (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2009), or doubling the amount of training data available for Urdu.
