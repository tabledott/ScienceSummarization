evel of processing could relate two or more NEs, or perhaps even give semantics to that relationship using a verb.
    In this way, further processing could discover the &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; of a sentence or body of text.
    While NER is relatively simple and it is fairly easy to build a system with reasonable performance, there are still a large number of ambiguous cases that make it difficult to attain human performance.
    There has been a considerable amount of work on NER problem, which aims to address many of these ambiguity, robustness and portability issues.
    During last decade, NER has drawn more and more attention from the NE tasks [Chinchor95a] [Chinchor98a] in MUCs [MUC6] [MUC7], where person names, location names, organization names, dates, times, percentages and money amounts are to be delimited in text using SGML mark-ups.
    Previous approaches have typically used manually constructed finite state patterns, which attempt to match against a sequence of word
