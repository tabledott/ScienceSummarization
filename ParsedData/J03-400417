 among all nouns in the nc', as in equation (15).
    One problem with doing this is that in cases in which the TCM is quite high in the hierarchy, for example, at the entity class, the probability of any ns&#8217;s occurring under this nc' on the TCM will be the same and does not allow us to discriminate among senses beneath this level.
    For the WSD task, we compare the probability estimates at each nc E Cn, so if a noun belongs to several synsets, we compare the probability estimates, given the context, of these synsets.
    We obtain estimates for each nc by using the probability of the hypernym nc' on r. Rather than assume that all synsets under a given nc' on r have the same likelihood of occurrence, we multiply the probability estimate for the hypernym nc' by the ratio of the prior frequency of the nc, that is, p(nc|gr), for which we seek the estimate divided by the prior frequency of the hypernym nc' (p(nc'|gr)): These prior estimates are taken from populating the noun hyponym hierarchy with the pri
