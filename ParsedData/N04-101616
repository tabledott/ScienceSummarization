    An advantage of our method is that it can be used for a large number of confusion sets without relying on the availability of training data.
  
  
    The ordering of prenominal modifiers is important for natural language generation systems where the text must be both fluent and grammatical.
    For example, the sequence big fat Greek wedding is perfectly acceptable, whereas fat Greek big wedding sounds odd.
    The ordering of prenominal adjectives has sparked a great deal of theoretical debate (see Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou 1999 for an overview) and efforts have concentrated on defining rules based on semantic criteria that account for different orders (e.g., age &#65533; color, value &#65533; dimension).
    Data intensive approaches to the ordering problem rely on corpora for gathering evidence for the likelihood of different orders.
    They rest on the hypothesis that the relative order of premodifiers is fixed, and independent of context and the noun being modified.
