tion 1 is the first iteration for Model 2, and iterations 6, 7, and 12 are the final iterations for Models 2, 3, and 5, respectively.
    In each example, we show the French sentence with a subscript affixed to each word to ease the reader's task in interpreting the list of numbers after each English word.
    In the first example, al me semble faire signe que oui I It seems to me that he is nodding), two interesting changes evolve over the course of the iterations.
    In the alignment for Model 1, II is correctly connected to he, but in all later alignments Il is incorrectly connected to It.
    Models 2, 3, and 5 discount a connection of he to Il because it is quite far away.
    We do not yet have a model with sufficient linguistic sophistication to make this connection properly.
    On the other hand, we see that nodding, which in Models 1, 2, and 3 is connected only to signe and oui, is correctly connected to the entire phrase faire signe que oui in Model 5.
    In the second example, (Voyez les profits
