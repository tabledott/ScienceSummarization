sists of the training data from both the 2002 evaluation and the 2003 evaluation, while for Arabic and Chinese, new additions to the ACE task in 2003, consists of 80% of the provided training data.
    Table 2 shows the sizes of the training, development and evaluation test data for the 3 languages.
    The data is annotated with five types of entities: person, organization, geo-political entity, location, facility; each mention can be either named, nominal or pronominal, and can be either generic (not referring to a clearly described entity) or specific.
    The models for all three languages are built as joint models, simultaneously predicting the type, level and genericity of a mention &#8211; basically each mention is labeled with a 3-pronged tag.
    To transform the problem into a classification task, we use the IOB2 classification scheme (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999).
    A gauge of the performance of an EDT system is the ACE value, a measure developed especially for this purpose.
