 to prevent matches of closed-class words.
    The translation lexicon and stop lists had been previously developed independently of the training and test bitexts.
    The French/English part of the evaluation was performed on bitexts from the publicly available corpus de bi-texte anglais-frangais (BAF) (Simard and Plamondon 1996).
    SIMR's error distribution on the &amp;quot;parliamentary debates&amp;quot; bitext in this collection is given in Table 4.
    This distribution can be compared to the error distributions reported for the same test set by Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993), who reported parts of their error distribution in words, rather than in characters: &amp;quot;In 55% of the cases, there is no error in word_align's output (distance of 0), in 73% the distance from the correct alignment is at most 1, and in 84% the distance is at most 3&amp;quot; (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993, 7).
    These distances were measured horizontally from the bitext map rather than perpendicularly to the main diagonal.
