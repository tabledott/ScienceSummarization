es are considered when searching for associations between debate topics and their aspects.
    Once we have the probabilities collected from the web, we can build our classifier to classify the debate posts.
    Here again, we use the process described in Section 3.1 to extract polarity-target pairs for each opinion expressed in the post.
    Let N be the number of instances of polarity-target pairs in the post.
    For each instance Ij (j = {1...N}), we look up the learned probabilities of Section 3.2 to create two scores, wj and uj: where target&#65533; &#65533; is the polarity-target type of which Ij is an instance.
    Score wj corresponds to side1 and uj corresponds to side2.
    A point to note is that, if a target word is repeated, and it occurs in different polarity-target instances, it is counted as a separate instance each time &#8212; that is, here we account for tokens, not types.
    Via Equations 2 and 3, we interpret the observed polarity-target instance Ij in terms of debate sides.
    We form
