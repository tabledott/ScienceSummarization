k of America&#8221;), (2) relative pronouns, and (3) gerunds, but allows (4) nested nouns (e.g.
    &#8220;union&#8221; in &#8220;union members&#8221;).
    The ACE definition, on the other hand, includes relative pronouns and gerunds, excludes all nested nouns that are not themselves NPs, and allows premodifier NE mentions of geo-political entities and locations, such as &#8220;Russian&#8221; in &#8220;Russian politicians&#8221;.
    Semantic Types.
    ACE restricts CEs to entities that belong to one of seven semantic classes: person, organization, geo-political entity, location, facility, vehicle, and weapon.
    MUC has no semantic restrictions.
    Singletons.
    The MUC data sets include annotations only for CEs that are coreferent with at least one other CE.
    ACE, on the other hand, permits &#8220;singleton&#8221; CEs, which are not coreferent with any other CE in the document.
    These substantial differences in the task definitions (summarized in Table 1) make it extremely difficult to compare p
