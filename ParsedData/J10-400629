nd take the entries corresponding to the full range of values of the other index j, we obtain a row vector (that we denote ai&#8727;).
    Similarly, by fixing the second index to j, we obtain the column vector a&#8727;j.
    Generalizing, a fiber is equivalent to rows and columns in higher order tensors, and it is obtained by fixing the values of all indices but one.
    A mode-n fiber is a fiber where only the n-th index has not been fixed.
    For example, in the tensor X of Table 2, x&#8727;11 = (40.0,16.7, 5.2) is a mode-1 fiber, x2&#8727;3 = (8.0, 10.1) is a mode-2 fiber, and x32&#8727; = (7.0, 4.7, 53.6) is a mode-3 fiber.
    A weighted tuple structure can be represented as a third-order tensor whose entries contain the tuple scores.
    As for the two-way matrices of classic DSMs, in order to make tensors linguistically meaningful we need to assign linguistic labels to the elements of the tensor indices.
    We define a labeled tensor X&#955; as a tensor such that for each of its indices there is a o
