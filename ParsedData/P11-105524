es of learning a model that is primarily driven by sentence-level features.
    Although previous approaches have used more sophisticated features for aggregating the evidence from individual sentences, we demonstrate that aggregating strong sentence-level evidence with a simple deterministic OR that models overlapping relations is more effective, and also enables training of a sentence extractor that runs with no aggregate information.
    While the Riedel et al. approach does include a model of which sentences express relations, it makes significant use of aggregate features that are primarily designed to do entity-level relation predictions and has a less detailed model of extractions at the individual sentence level.
    Perhaps surprisingly, our model is able to do better at both the sentential and aggregate levels.
  
  
    Supervised-learning approaches to IE were introduced in (Soderland et al., 1995) and are too numerous to summarize here.
    While they offer high precision and recall, these method
