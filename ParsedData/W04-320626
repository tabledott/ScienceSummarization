    This minimal level of input is much simpler than required by earlier web-based approaches, while succeeding to maintain good performance.
    This result shows that it is possible to identify useful anchor sets in a fully unsupervised manner.
    The acquired templates demonstrate a broad range of semantic relations varying from synonymy to more complicated entailment.
    These templates go beyond trivial paraphrases, demonstrating the generality and viability of the presented approach.
    From our current experiments we can expect to learn about 5 relations per lexicon entry, at least for the more frequent entries.
    Moreover, looking at the extended test, we can extrapolate a notably larger yield by broadening the search space.
    Together with the fact that we expect to find entailment relations for about 85% of a lexicon, it is a significant step towards scalability, indicating that we will be able to extract a large scale KB for a large scale lexicon.
    In future work we aim to improve the yi
