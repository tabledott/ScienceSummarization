hat tree structures with fewer nodes and/or richer node labels reduce bias, but possibly at the expense of an increase in variance.
    A tree transformation/detransformation methodology for empirically evaluating the effect of different tree representations on parsing systems was developed in this paper.
    The results presented earlier show that the tree representations that incorporated weaker independence assumptions performed signficantly better in the empirical studies than the more linguistically motivated Chomsky adjunction structures.
    Of course, there is nothing particularly special about the particular tree transformations studied in this paper: other transforms could&#8212;and should&#8212;be studied in exactly the same manner.
    For example, I am currently using this methodology to study the interaction between tree structure and a &amp;quot;slash category&amp;quot; node labeling in tree representations with empty categories (Gazdar et al. 1985).
