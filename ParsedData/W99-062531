s fully implemented, is further motivated by the need for determining similarity between small pieces of text across documents that potentially span different topics during multi-document summarization.
    It serves as the first component of a domain-independent multidocument summarization system [McKeown et al. 1999] which generates a summary through text reformulation [Barzilay et al.
    1999] by combining information from these similar text passages.
    We address concerns of sparse data and the narrower than topical definition of similarity by exploring several linguistic features, in addition to shared words or collocations, as indicators of text similarity.
    Our primitive features include linked noun phrases, WordNet synonyms, and semantically similar verbs.
    We also define composite features over pairs of primitive features.
    We then provide an effective method for aggregating the feature values into a similarity measure using machine learning, and present results on a manually annotated co
