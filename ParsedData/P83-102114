dvantages: (i) unification, gaps and unbounded dependencies are automatically handled; (ii) parsing strategies become possible that cannot be formulated in chart parsing.
    The chart represents completed nonterminals (passive edges) and partially applied rules (active edges).
    From the standpoint of Earley Deduction, both represent derived clauses that have been proved in the course of an attempt to deduce a goal statement whose meaning is that a string belongs to the language generated by the grammar.
    An active edge corresponds to a noaunit clause, a passive edge to a unit clause.
    Nowhere in this definition is there mention of k.he &amp;quot;endpoints&amp;quot; of the edges.
    The endpoints correspond to certain literal arguments, and are of no concern to the (abstract) proof procedure.
    Endpoints are just a convenient way .of indexing derived clauses in an implementation to reduce the number of nonproductive (nonunifying) attempts at applying the reduction rule.
    We shall give now an ex
