nes sentence length by the number of characters in the sentences, while the IBM group (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991) defines sentence length by the number of words in the sentence.
    Both approaches achieve similar results and have been influential in much of the research on statistical natural language processing, including ours.
    It has been noted in more recent work that length-based alignment programs such as these are problematic for many cases of real world parallel data, such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) input, in which periods may not be noticeable (Church 1993), or languages where insertions or deletions are common (Shemtov 1993; Fung and McKeown 1994).
    These algorithms were adequate for our purposes, but could be replaced by algorithms more appropriate for noisy input corpora, if necessary Sentence alignment techniques are generally used as a preprocessing stage, before the main processing component that proposes actual translations, whether of words, phrases, or full text, and the
