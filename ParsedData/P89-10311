sition of evaluating different theoretical approaches to the analysis of natural language (NL).
    They might want to (a) evaluate and improve on a current system, (b) add a capability to a system that it didn't previously have, (c) combine modules from different systems.
    Consider the goal of adding a discourse component to a system, or evaluating and improving one that is already in place.
    A discourse module might combine theories on, e.g., centering or local focusing [GJW83, Sid79], global focus [Gro77], coherence relations[Hob85], event' reference [Web86], intonational structure [PH87], system vs. user beliefs [Po186], plan or intent recognition or production [Coh78, AP86, SI81], control[WS88], or complex syntactic structures [Pri85].
    How might one evaluate the relative contributions of each of these factors or compare two approaches to the same problem?
    In order to take steps towards establishing a methodology for doing this type of comparison, we conducted a case study.
    We attempt to
