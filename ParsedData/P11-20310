  Better Hypothesis Testing for Statistical Machine Translation: Controlling for Optimizer Instability
  
    In statistical machine translation, a researcher seeks to determine whether some innovation (e.g., a new feature, model, or inference algorithm) improves translation quality in comparison to a baseline system.
    To answer this question, he runs an experiment to evaluate the behavior of the two systems on held-out data.
    In this paper, we consider how to make such experiments more statistically reliable.
    We provide a systematic analysis of the effects of optimizer instability&#8212;an extraneous variable that is seldom controlled for&#8212;on experimental outcomes, and make recommendations for reporting results more accurately.
  
  
    The need for statistical hypothesis testing for machine translation (MT) has been acknowledged since at least Och (2003).
    In that work, the proposed method was based on bootstrap resampling and was designed to improve the statistical reliability of result
