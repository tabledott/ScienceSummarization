ilinguality.
    While many of the techniques discussed in this paper were originally developed for English, they have been applied to learn coreference models for other languages, such as Chinese (e.g., Converse (2006)), Japanese (e.g., Iida (2007)), Arabic (e.g., Luo and Zitouni (2005)), Dutch (e.g., Hoste (2005)), German (e.g., Wunsch (2010)), Swedish (e.g., Nilsson (2010)), and Czech (e.g., Ngu.y et al. (2009)).
    In addition, researchers have developed approaches that are targeted at handling certain kinds of anaphora present in non-English languages, such as zero anaphora (e.g., Iida et al. (2007a), Zhao and Ng (2007)).
    As Mitkov (2001) puts it, coreference resolution is a &#8220;difficult, but not intractable problem,&#8221; and we have been making &#8220;slow, but steady progress&#8221; on improving machine learning approaches to the problem in the past fifteen years.
    To ensure further progress, researchers should compare their results against a baseline that is stronger than the commonly-us
