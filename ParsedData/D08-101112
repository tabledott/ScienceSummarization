ackbone word that is aligned to no hypothesis word, a null is inserted on the hypothesis side, right after the hypothesis word which is aligned to the immediately preceding backbone word.
    An example is shown in Fig.

    The two main hypothesis alignment methods for system combination in the previous literature are GIZA++ and TER-based methods.
    Matusov et al. (2006) proposed using GIZA++ to align words between different MT hypotheses, where all hypotheses of the test corpus are collected to create hypothesis pairs for GIZA++ training.
    This approach uses the conventional HMM model bootstrapped from IBM Model-1 as implemented in GIZA++, and heuristically combines results from aligning in both directions.
    System combination based on this approach gives an improvement over the best single system.
    However, the number of hypothesis pairs for training is limited by the size of the test corpus.
    Also, MT hypotheses from the same source sentence are correlated with each other and
