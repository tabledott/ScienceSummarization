			The p denotes a preposition, so N-p-N denotes a syntactic context where the preposition is preceded and followed by a noun phrase.
			We use the preceding noun phrase (PN) and following head (FH) from the original feature set for the N-p-N feature.

			For the N-p-N feature, the corresponding Combo:word instantiation is ?place line?
			since ?place?
			is the PN and ?line?
			is theFH.
			We also experimented with using combinations of POS tags (Combo:tag) and word+tag com binations (Combo:word+tag).
			So for the example, the Combo:tag N-p-N feature would be ?NN-NN?, and the Combo:word+tag N-p-N feature would beplace NN+line NN (see the fourth column of Ta ble 1).
			The intuition with the Combo:tag features is that the Combo:word features have the potentialto be sparse, and these capture more general pat terns of usage.
			We also experimented with other features such as augmenting the model with verb-preposi
