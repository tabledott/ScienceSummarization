nite number of such feature structures, the prediction step may never terminate.
    This extended Earley's algorithm is presented in Section 4.3.
    We compromise by having the prediction step determine which restricted dags can start at a given point.
    If the restrictor is chosen appropriately, this can be as constraining as predicting on the basis of the whole feature structure, yet prediction is guaranteed to terminate because the domain of restricted feature structures is finite.
    This final extension of Earley's algorithm is presented in Section 4.4.
    We start with the Earley algorithm for context-free-based PATR-II on which the other algorithms are based.
    The algorithm is described in a chart-parsing incarnation, vertices numbered from 0 to n for an n-word sentence wi &#8226; &#8226; w&#8222;.
    An item of the form [h, i, A &#8212; ct./3, DI designates an edge in the chart from vertex h to i with dotted rule .4 &#8212; a-3 and dag D. The chart is initialized with an edge [0,0, X0 &#8212
