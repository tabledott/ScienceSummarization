 conforms to our linguistic predictions, leading us to conclude that the features we counted worked largely for the reasons we had hypothesized.
    We expected CAUS and ANIM to be particularly helpful in identifying unaccusatives, and these predictions are confirmed.
    Compare the second to the first panel of Table 14 (the errors without the CAUS feature compared to the errors with the CAUS feature added to the set).
    We see that, without the CAUS feature, the confusability between unaccusatives and unergatives, and between unaccusatives and object-drops, is 9 and 7 errors, respectively; but when CAUS is added to the set of features, the confusability between these pairs of classes drops substantially, to 5 and 6 errors, respectively.
    On the other hand, the confusability between unergatives and object-drops becomes slightly worse (errors increasing from 6 to 7).
    The latter indicates that the improvement in unaccusatives is not simply due to an across-the-board improvement in accuracy as a result
