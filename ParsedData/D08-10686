e same cluster.
    However, Gibbs sampling can only move one mention at a time from one cluster to another, and this is unlikely to happen, because it would require breaking the apposition rule.
    Blocked sampling can alleviate this problem by sampling multiple mentions together, but it requires that the block size be predetermined to a small fixed number.
    When we incorporate apposition and other regularities the blocks can become arbitrarily large, making this infeasible.
    For example, suppose we also want to leverage predicate nominals (i.e., the subject and the predicating noun of a copular verb are likely coreferent).
    Then a sentence like &#8220;He is Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft&#8221; requires a block of four mentions: &#8220;He&#8221;, &#8220;Bill Gates&#8221;, &#8220;the chairman of Microsoft&#8221;, and &#8220;Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft&#8221;.
    Similar difficulties occur with other inference methods.
    Thus, extending Haghighi and Klein&#8217;s model to include
