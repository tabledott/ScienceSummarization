    We have reduced the problem of binarizing an SCFG rule into the problem of binarizing its permutation.
    This problem can be cast as an instance of synchronous ITG parsing (Wu, 1997).
    Here the parallel string pair that we are parsing is the integer sequence (1...n) and its permutation (7r(1)...7r(n)).
    The goal of the ITG parsing is to find a synchronous tree that agrees with the alignment indicated by the permutation.
    In fact, as demonstrated previously, some permutations may have more than one binarization patterns among which we only need one.
    Wu (1997, Sec.
    7) introduces a non-ambiguous ITG that prefers left-heavy binary trees so that for each permutation there is a unique synchronous derivation (binarization pattern).
    However, this problem has more efficient solutions.
    Shapiro and Stephens (1991, p. 277) informally present an iterative procedure where in each pass it scans the permuted sequence from left to right and
