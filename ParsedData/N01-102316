    Empty elements are not scored.
    We used EVALB (written by Satoshi Sekine and Michael Collins) which scores based on PARSEVAL (Black et al., 1991); with the standard parameter file (as per standard practice, part of speech brackets were not part of the evaluation).
    Also, we used Adwait Ratnaparkhi&#8217;s part-of-speech tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) to tag unknown words in the test data.
    We obtained 80.02% and 79.64% labeled bracketing precision and recall respectively (as defined in (Black et al., 1991)).
    The baseline model which was only trained on the 9695 sentences of labeled data performed at 72.23% and 69.12% precision and recall.
    These results show that training a statistical parser using our Cotraining method to combine labeled and unlabeled data strongly outperforms training only on the labeled data.
    It is important to note that unlike previous studies, our method of moving towards unsupervised p
