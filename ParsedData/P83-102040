 making n 1, n2 and n3 a perfect coordinate structure, and leaving no barrier to npl, np2 and np3 being co-referent.
    But this means that the D-theory analysis of (11.1) has as standard referents both it and (11.2)!
    (This modifies our statement earlier in this paper about the uniqueness of the standard referent: we now must say that for each possible &amp;quot;stacking&amp;quot; of nodes, there is one standard referent.)
    For if npl, np2 and np3 corefer, then the analysis above shows that the structure described is exactly that of (11.2).
    There is also the possibility that just npl and np2 corefer, given the above analysis, which yields a reading where np2 is an appositive to npl, with npl and np3 coordinate structures (the structure of appositives is similar to that of coordinate structures, we assume); and the possibility that just np2 and np3 corefer, yielding a reading with npl and np2 coordinate structures, and np3 in apposition to np2.
    (The fact that we use a simplified phrase structur
