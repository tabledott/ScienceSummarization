 y|i, and r1 ... rq to be the set of right modifiers (e.g., consider the case where n = 5, i = 3, and we have y(3,1) = y(3, 5) = 0, and y(3, 2) = y(3, 4) = 1: in this case p = 1, l1 = 2, and q = 1, r1 = 4).
    In bigram sibling models, we have where l0 = r0 = START is the initial state, and lp+1 = rq+1 = END is the end state.
    The functions gL and gR assign scores to bigram dependencies to the left and right of the head.
    Under this model calculating argmaxy|i&#8712;Zi (fi (y|i) &#8722; Ej u(i,j)y(i, j)) takes O(n2) time using dynamic programming, hence the model satisfies Assumption 1.
    Example 2: Head Automata Head-automata models constitute a second important model type that satisfy the sibling-decomposition assumption (bigram sibling models are a special case of head automata).
    These models make use of functions gR(i, s, s0, r) where s E S, s0 E S are variables in a set of possible states S, and r is an index of a word in the sentence such that i &lt; r &lt; n. The function gR returns a cost
