subject predicate complement, or object predicate complement.
  An adjective is pre- nominal adjectival modifier, predicate complement, subject, object, or indirect object (the last three func- tions refer to occurrences of adjectives as nomi- nalized heads), etc.
  Often morphosyntactic mappings may be consid- erably constrained by imposing context conditions : ("N NOM" ((1 N)) @NN&gt;) ("N NOM" ((-1 PREP)) @&lt;P) ("INF" ((-2 N) (-1 TO)) @&lt;NOM-FMAINV) These state that a noun in the nominative case premodifies (@NN&gt;) a subsequently following noun (in compounds, cf.
  computer screen), that a noun in the nominative case after a preposition is @&lt;P, and that an infinitive preceded by a noun + to post- modifies that noun.
  In this way, the task of syntactic analysis is simpli- fied as much as possible, as early as possible.
  Superfluous alternatives are not even introduced into the parsing of a particular clause if it is clear at the outset, i.e.
  either in the lexicon or at the stage of morphosyntac
