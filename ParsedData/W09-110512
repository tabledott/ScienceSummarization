 HMMs and other learning approaches.
    The memory-based learning algorithm was parameterised by using overlap as the similarity metric, gain ratio for feature weighting, using 7 knearest neighbors, and weighting the class vote of neighbors as a function of their inverse linear distance.
    The SVM was parameterised in the learning phase for classification, cost factor of 1 and biased hyperplane, and it used a linear kernel function.
    The CRFs classifier used regularization algorithm L2 for training, the hyper-parameter and the cut-off threshold of features were set to 1.
    An instance represents a pair of a negation signal and a token from the sentence.
    This means that all tokens in a sentence are paired with all negation signals that occur in the sentence.
    Negation signals are those that have been classified as such in the previous phase.
    Only sentences that have negation signals are selected for this phase.
    We started with a larger, extensive pool of 131 features which encoded inform
