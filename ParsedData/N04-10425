of people&#8217;s first names.
    Large positive values for Ak indicate a preference for such an event, while large negative values make the event unlikely.
    Given such a model as defined in Equ.
    (1), the most probable labeling sequence for an input x, can be efficiently calculated by dynamic programming using the Viterbi algorithm.
    Calculating the marginal probability of states or transitions at each position in the sequence by a dynamic-programming-based inference procedure very similar to forward-backward for hidden Markov models.
    The parameters may be estimated by maximum likelihood&#8212;maximizing the conditional probability of a set of label sequences, each given their corresponding input sequences.
    The log-likelihood of training set Maximizing (2) corresponds to satisfying the following equality, wherein the the empirical count of each feature matches its expected count according to the model P&#923;(y|x).
    CRFs share many of the advantageous properties of standard maximum entro
