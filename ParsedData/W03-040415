acy is not high for a fully automatic process, Basilisk depends on a human to review the words so 53% accuracy means that the human is accepting every other word, on average.
    Thus, the reviewer&#8217;s time was still being spent productively even after 1000 words had been hypothesized.
    Table 6 shows the size of the final lexicons created by the bootstrapping algorithms.
    The first two columns show the number of subjective terms learned by Basilisk and Meta-Bootstrapping.
    Basilisk was more prolific, generating 825 subjective terms compared to 522 for MetaBootstrapping.
    The third column shows the intersection between their word lists.
    There was substantial overlap, but both algorithms produced many words that the other did not.
    The last column shows the results of merging their lists.
    In total, the bootstrapping algorithms produced 1052 subjective nouns.
  
  
    To evaluate the subjective nouns, we trained a Naive Bayes classifier using the nouns as features.
    We also incorpo
