ices of words at the n preceding positions.
    The contextsensitive constraints introduced by the n-gram model are reflected in re-entrancies in the structure of statistical dependencies, as in Figure 1.
    Statistical dependencies under the model of Mark et al. (1992).
    In this diagram, the choice of label on a node z with parent x and preceding word y is dependent on the label of x and y, but conditionally independent of the label on any other node.
    Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1995, henceforth, DD&amp;L) also apply random fields to natural language processing.
    The application they consider is the induction of English orthographic constraints&#8212;inducing a grammar of possible English words.
    DD&amp;L describe an algorithm called Improved Iterative Scaling (IIS) for selecting informative features of words to construct a random field, and for setting the parameters of the field optimally for a given set of features, to model an empirical word distribution.
