  Cb: TAROO Cf: [TAROO, ZIROO] 3 Cb: ZIROO Cf: [ZIROO, TAROO] 8 In example 30, Taroo is introduced by ga.
  In this case, it appears that there is a ten- dency due to lexical semantics to instantiate Ziroo as the Cb in the second utterance.
  22 By the centering definitions, taking either Taroo or Ziroo to be the Cb can result in a CONTINUE interpretation.
  However, assuming that the Cf ordering at example 30a is correct, constraint 3 is violated by the preferred interpretation of 30b.
  Since both of the entities in Cf(30a) are realized, the Cb in example 30b should be the most highly ranked one.
  There are two possible conclusions here: (1) In discourse-initial utterances, when 21 These xamples were tested by asking survey participants toindicate preference rankings.
  The numbers given here are only for those subjects who expressed strong preferences; some subjects expressed no preference.
