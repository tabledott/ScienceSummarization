    We define the mapping &#181; as: ng of senses c(w) of a word w as: senses for which no mapping can be provided according to the definition of &#181;.
    For example, an ideal mapping between entries in Table 1 would be as follows: resulting in the following clustering: As a first approach, we adopted a purely lexical matching function based on the notion of lexical overlap (Lesk, 1986).
    The function counts the number of lemmas that two sense descriptions of a word have in common (we neglect parts of speech), and is normalized by the minimum of the two descri Notice that unrelated senses can get a positive score because of an overlap of the sense descriptions.
    In the example, group#n, the hypernym of race#n#2, is also present in the definition of race#n#1.1.
    Unfortunately, the very same concept can be defined with entirely different words.
    To match definitions in a semantic manner we adopted a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm, Structural Semantic Interc
