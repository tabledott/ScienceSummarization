our implementation, for example, we store the rules in a decision tree, which permits base NP identification in time linear in the length of the tagged input text when using the longest match heuristic.
    Unfortunately, there is an obvious problem with the algorithm described above.
    There will be many unhelpful rules in the rule set extracted from the training corpus.
    These &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; rules arise from four sources: bracketing errors in the corpus; tagging errors; unusual or irregular linguistic constructs (such as parenthetical expressions); and inherent ambiguities in the base NPs &#8212; in spite of their simplicity.
    For example, the rule (VBG NNS), which was extracted from manufacturing/VBG titans/NNS in the example text, is ambiguous, and will cause erroneous bracketing in sentences such as The execs squeezed in a few meetings before [boarding/VBG buses/NNS] again.
    In order to have a viable mechanism for identifying base NPs using this algorithm, the grammar must be improved
