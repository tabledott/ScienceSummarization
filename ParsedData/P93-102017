gmentation used in Figure 1.
    In the next section we evaluate how well statistically validated boundaries correlate with the distribution of linguistic cues.
  
  
    In this section we present and evaluate three discourse segmentation algorithms, each based on the use of a single linguistic cue: referential noun phrases (NPs), cue words, and pauses.4 While the discourse effects of these and other linguistic phenomena have been discussed in the literature, there has been little work on examining the use of such effects for recognizing or generating segment boundaries,' or on evaluating the comparative utility of different phenomena for these tasks.
    The algorithms reported here were developed based on ideas in the literature, then evaluated on a representative set of 10 narratives.
    Our results allow us to directly compare the performance of the three algorithms, to understand the utility of the individual knowledge sources.
    We have not yet attempted to create comprehensive algorithms that would
