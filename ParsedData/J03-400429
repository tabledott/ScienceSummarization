nant sense varies depending on the domain and text type.
    To quantify this, we carried out an analysis of the polysemous nouns, verbs, and adjectives in SemCor occurring in more than one SemCor file and found that a large proportion of words have a different first sense in different files and also in different genres (see Table 4).
    For adjectives there seems to be a lot less ambiguity (this has also been noted by Krovetz [1998]; the data in SENSEVAL-2 bear this out, with many adjectives occurring only in their first sense.
    For nouns and verbs, for which the predominant sense is more likely to vary among texts, it would be worthwhile to try to detect words for which using the predominant sense is not a reliable strategy, for example, because the word shows &#8220;bursty&#8221; topic-related behavior.
    We therefore examined our disambiguation results to see if there was any pattern in the predicates or arguments that were easily disambiguated themselves or were good disambiguators of the co-occurr
