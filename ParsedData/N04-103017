n the argument identifi cation and classification tasks when added to the baseline system.
			We tried two other ways of generalizing the head word:i) adding the head word cluster as a feature, and ii) replac ing the head word with a named entity if it belonged toany of the seven named entities mentioned earlier.
			Neither method showed any improvement.
			We also tried gen eralizing the path feature by i) compressing sequences of identical labels, and ii) removing the direction in the path, but none showed any improvement on the baseline.
			8.1 Argument Sequence Information.
			In order to improve the performance of their statistical ar gument tagger, G&amp;J used the fact that a predicate is likely to instantiate a certain set of arguments.
			We use a similar strategy, with some additional constraints: i) argument ordering information is retained, and ii) the predicate is considered as an argument and is part of the sequence.
			We achieve this by training a trigram language model onthe argument sequence
