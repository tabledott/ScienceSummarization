e exists some e for which P(ef) P(ef), this is called a search error.
    As Wang and Waibel (1997) remark, it is hard to know whether a search error has occurred&#8212;the only way to show that a decoding is sub-optimal is to actually produce a higherscoring one.
    Thus, while decoding is a clear-cut optimization task in which every problem instance has a right answer, it is hard to come up with good answers quickly.
    This paper reports on measurements of speed, search errors, and translation quality in the context of a traditional stack decoder (Jelinek, 1969; Brown et al., 1995) and two new decoders.
    The first is a fast greedy decoder, and the second is a slow optimal decoder based on generic mathematical programming techniques.
  
  
    In this paper, we work with IBM Model 4, which revolves around the notion of a word alignment over a pair of sentences (see Figure 1).
    A word alignment assigns a single home (English string position) to each French word.
    If two French words align to the s
