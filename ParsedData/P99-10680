  Mining The Web For Bilingual Text
  
    STRAND (Resnik, 1998) is a languageindependent system for automatic discovery of text in parallel translation on the World Wide Web.
    This paper extends the preliminary STRAND results by adding automatic language identification, scaling up by orders of magnitude, and formally evaluating performance.
    The most recent end-product is an automatically acquired parallel corpus comprising 2491 English-French document pairs, approximately 1.5 million words per language.
  
  
    Text in parallel translation is a valuable resource in natural language processing.
    Statistical methods in machine translation (e.g.
    (Brown et al., 1990)) typically rely on large quantities of bilingual text aligned at the document or sentence level, and a number of approaches in the burgeoning field of crosslanguage information retrieval exploit parallel corpora either in place of or in addition to mappings between languages based on information from bilingual dictionaries (Davis an
