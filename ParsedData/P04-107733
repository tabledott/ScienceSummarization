lly that adequacy and fluency focused on different aspects of machine translations.
    Adequacy placed more emphasis on terms co-occurred in candidate and reference translations as shown in the higher correlations in Stem set than Case set in Table 1; while the reverse was true in the terms of fluency.
    The evaluation results of ROUGE-L, ROUGEW, and ROUGE-S in machine translation evaluation are very encouraging.
    However, these measures in their current forms are still only applying string-to-string matching.
    We have shown that better correlation with adequacy can be reached by applying stemmer.
    In the next step, we plan to extend them to accommodate synonyms and paraphrases.
    For example, we can use an existing thesaurus such as WordNet (Miller 1990) or creating a customized one by applying automated synonym set discovery methods (Pantel and Lin 2002) to identify potential synonyms.
    Paraphrases can also be automatically acquired using statistical methods as shown by Barzilay and Lee (20
