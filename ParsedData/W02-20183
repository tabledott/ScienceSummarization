    Suppose we are given a probability distribution p over a set of events X which are characterized by a d dimensional feature vector function f : X &#8594; Rd.
    In addition, we have also a set of contexts W and a function Y which partitions the members of X.
    In the case of a stochastic context-free grammar, for example, X might be the set of possible trees, the feature vectors might represent the number of times each rule applied in the derivation of each tree, W might be the set of possible strings of words, and Y(w) the set of trees whose yield is w &#8712; W. A conditional maximum entropy model q&#952;(x|w) for p has the parametric form (Berger et al., 1996; Chi, 1998; where &#952; is a d-dimensional parameter vector and &#952;T f (x) is the inner product of the parameter vector and a feature vector.
    Given the parametric form of an ME model in (1), fitting an ME model to a collection of training data entails finding values for the parameter vector &#952; which minimize the Kullbac
