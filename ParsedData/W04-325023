test set.
    While the 95% statistical significance level is the most commonly used for historical reasons, we want to validate as well the accuracy of the bootstrap resampling method at different statistical significance levels.
    Table 4 displays our findings.
    For each conclusion, we check into what statistical significance range it falls, e.g., 90-94.9%).
    Then, we check for all conclusions with an interval, how many are correct, i.e., consistent with the conclusion drawn from the much larger 30,000 sentence test set.
    The numbers suggest, that the method is fairly accurate and errs on the side of caution.
    For instance, when we conclude a statistical significance level of 90%-94.9%, we are actually drawing the right conclusion 95% of the time.
  
  
    Having a trusted experimental framework is essential for drawing conclusions on the effects of system changes.
    For instance: do not test on train, do not use the same test set repeatedly, etc.
