    When the input to the algorithm included a grouping of discourse referents into focus spaces derived from discourse segments, performance improved by 50%.
    In addition, if our results were fully automated, they could also be used to enhance the ability of understanding systems to recognize discourse structure, which in turn improves tasks such as information retrieval (Hearst 1994) and plan recognition (Litman and Allen 1990).
    Recent results suggest that many of our manually coded features have the promise of being automatically coded.
    Given features largely output by a speech recognition system, Wightman and Ostendorf (1994) automatically recognize prosodic phrasing with 85-86% accuracy; this accuracy is only slightly less than human-human accuracy.
    Similarly, although our spoken corpus was manually transcribed, this could have been automated using speech recognition (although this would introduce further sources of error).
