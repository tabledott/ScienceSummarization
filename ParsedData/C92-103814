  Human speakers prefer to use adjectives that com- municate size, shape, or colour in referring expres?
  In tile above examples, for instance, a hu- man speaker would probably prefer the black dog and the small dog over the female dog.
  Human hearers ometimes have trouble determin- ing if an object belongs to a specialized class.
  In the above example, for instance, the chihuahua should only be used if the speaker is certain the hearer is capable of distinguishing chihuahuas from other types of dogs.
  If there is any doubt about the heaters ability to do this, adding an explicit modifier (e.g., the small dog) is a better strategy than using a specialized head noun.
  Human speakers eem to prefer to use relative ad- jectives, and human hearers eem to have less trou- ble understanding them.
  However, human-written instructional texts sometimes use absolute adjec- tives instead of relative ones; this may be a con- sequence of the fact that writers cannot predict the context heir text
