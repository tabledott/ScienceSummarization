are calculated for all possible Chinese-English document pairs, and bilingual documents with similarities above a certain threshold are considered to be comparable.
    For very-non-parallel corpora, this document-matching step also serves as topic alignment.
    Again based on the &#8220;find-topic-extract-sentence&#8221; principle, we extract parallel sentences from the matched English and Chinese documents.
    Each sentence is again represented as word vectors.
    For each extracted document pair, pair-wise cosine similarities are calculated for all possible Chinese-English sentence pairs.
    Sentence pairs above a set threshold are considered parallel and extracted from the documents.
    Sentence similarity is based on the number of words in the two sentences that are translations of each other.
    The better our bilingual lexicon is, the more accurate the sentence similarity will be.
    In the following section, we discuss how to find new word translations.
