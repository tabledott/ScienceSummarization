 an analysis of texts from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), we found that the average number of parts of speech per word was approximately two.
    Determining the part of speech of an unknown word can help the system to know how the word functions in the sentence; for instance, that it is a verb stating an action or state of affairs, that it is a common noun stating a class of persons, places, or things, that it is a proper noun naming a particular person, place, or thing, etc.
    If it can do that well, then more precise classification and understanding is feasible.
    The most critical feature to us is to have local criteria for ranking the alternative parts of speech, rather than relying solely on a globally correct parse.
    The probability model we selected offers these features.
    The name of our component for part of speech is POST (part-of-speech tagger).
    In our work, we have used well-known probability models known as Hidden Markov Models; therefore, none of the background in Section 2.1 is n
