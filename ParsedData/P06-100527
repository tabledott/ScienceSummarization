er data.
    Finally, we can add ourselves to the camp of people claiming semantic compatibility is useful for pronoun resolution.
    Both the MI from the pronoun in the antecedent&#8217;s context and vice-versa result in improvement.
    Building a model from enough text may be the key.
    The primary goal of our evaluation was to assess the benefit of path coreference within a competitive pronoun resolution system.
    Our system does, however, outperform previously published results on these datasets.
    Direct comparison of our scoring system to other current top approaches is made difficult by differences in preprocessing.
    Ideally we would assess the benefit of our probabilistic features using the same state-of-the-art preprocessing modules employed by others such as (Yang et al., 2005) (who additionally use a search engine for compatibility scoring).
    Clearly, promoting competitive evaluation of pronoun resolution scoring systems by giving competitors equivalent real-world preprocessing output
