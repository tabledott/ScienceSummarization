    In some cases, the transformations were able to recover some of the word, but were rarely able to produce the full desired output.
    For example, in one case the greedy algorithm segmented &amp;quot;humanactivity&amp;quot; as &amp;quot;humana c ti vi ty&amp;quot;.
    The rule sequence was able to transform this into &amp;quot;humana ctivity&amp;quot;, but was not able to produce the desired &amp;quot;human activity&amp;quot;.
    This suggests that both the greedy algorithm and the transformation learning algorithm need to have a more global word model, with the ability to recognize the impact of placing a boundary on the longer sequences of characters surrounding that point.
  
  
    The results of these experiments demonstrate that a transformation-based rule sequence, supplementing a rudimentary initial approximation, can produce accurate segmentation.
    In addition, they are able to improve the performance of a wide range of segmentation algorithms, without requiring expensive knowled
