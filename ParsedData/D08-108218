    Updating of parameters can be incorporated into the computation of outside probabilities efficiently.
  
  
    In the decoding phase, we want to find the optimal MR structure m&#8727; given a new NL sentence w: where T is a possible hybrid tree associated with the m-w pair.
    However, it is expensive to compute the summation over all possible hybrid trees.
    We therefore find the most likely hybrid tree instead: P(m, T|w)=arg max max We have implemented an exact top-k decoding algorithm for this task.
    Dynamic programming techniques similar to those discussed in Section 6 can also be applied when retrieving the top candidates.
    We also find the Viterbi hybrid tree given a NLMR pair, which can be done in an analogous way.
    This tree will be useful for reranking.
    8 Reranking and Filtering of Predictions Due to the various independence assumptions we have made, the model lacks the ability to express some long range dependencies.
    We therefore postprocess the best candidate predictions
