			V I depends on the relative sizes of the partitions of C and K , not on the number of points in these partitions.
			However, V I is bounded by themaximum number of clusters in C or K , k?.
			With out manual modification however, k?
			= n, where each cluster contains only a single data point.
			Thus, while technically n-invariant, the possible values of V I are heavily dependent on the number of datapoints being clustered.
			Thus, it is difficult to compare V I values across data sets and clustering algorithms without fixing k?, as V I will vary over differ ent ranges.
			It is a trivial modification to modify V I such that it varies over [0,1].
			Normalizing, V I by log n or 1/2 log k?
			guarantee this range.
			However, Meila (2007) raises two potential problems with thismodification.
			The normalization should not be applied if data sets of different sizes are to be com pared ? it negates the n-invariance of the measure.Additionally, if two authors apply the latter normal ization and do not
