surface semantic structure corresponding to three pounds of carrots grammar.
  In EPICURE, the grammar consists of phrase structure rules annotated with path equa- tions which determine the relationships between semantic units and syntactic units: the path equa- tions specify arbitrary constituents (either com- plex or atomic) of feature structures.
  There is insufficient space here to show the en- tire NP grammar, but we provide some representa- tive rules in figure 9 (although these rules are ex- pressed here in a PATR-Iike formalism, within EPI- CURE they are encoded as PROLOG definite clause grammar (DCG) rules (Clocksin and Mellish 1981)).
  Applying these rules to the surface semantic struc- tures described above results in the generation of the appropriate surface linguistic strings.
  CONCLUSION In this paper, we have described the processes used in EPICURE to produce noun phrase referring ex- pressions.
  EPICURE is implemented in C-PROLOG running under UNIX.
