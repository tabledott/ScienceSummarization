nd each time it refers to a different date, then the resulting summary can be misleading.
    Time references such as &amp;quot;today&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Monday&amp;quot; are clear in the context of a source article, but can be ambiguous when extracted from the article.
    This ambiguity can be corrected by substitution of this temporal reference with the full time/date reference, such as &amp;quot;10/21&amp;quot;.
    By corpus analysis, we collected a set of patterns for identification of ambiguous dates.
    However, we currently don't handle temporal references requiring inference to resolve (e.g., &amp;quot;the day before the plane crashed,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;around Christmas&amp;quot;).
