e target language.
    However, parallel texts are not always available for a given language pair.
    Therefore, in this paper we explore a different approach where, instead of relying on manually translated parallel corpora, we use machine translation to produce a corpus in the new language.
  
  
    We explore the possibility of using machine translation to generate the resources required to build subjectivity annotation tools in a given target language.
    We focus on two main scenarios.
    First, assuming a corpus manually annotated for subjectivity exists in the source language, we can use machine translation to create a corpus annotated for subjectivity in the target language.
    Second, assuming a tool for automatic subjectivity analysis exists in the source language, we can use this tool together with machine translation to create a corpus annotated for subjectivity in the target language.
    In order to perform a comprehensive investigation, we propose three experiments as described below.
