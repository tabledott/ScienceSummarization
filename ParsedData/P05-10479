nd, consequently, W is a symmetric matrix.
    Pairs with different pattern elements (i.e. grammatical roles) are automatically given a similarity score of 0.
    Diagonal elements of W represent the self-similarity between pairs and have the greatest values.
    Figure 1 shows an example using three patterns, chairman+resign, ceo+quit and chairman+comment.
    This shows how these patterns are represented as vectors and gives a sample semantic similarity matrix.
    It can be seen that the first pair of patterns are the most similar using the proposed measure.
    The measure in Equation 1 is similar to the cosine metric, commonly used to determine the similarity of documents in the vector space model approach to Information Retrieval.
    However, the cosine metric will not perform well for our application since it does not take into account the similarity between elements of a vector and would assign equal similarity to each pair of patterns in the example shown in Figure 1.1 The semantic similarity matrix
