ge, acquisition, buy).
    The phrases are clustered based on these two types of evidence and sets of paraphrases are created.
    Basically, we used the paraphrases found by the approach mentioned above.
    For example, the expressions in Figure 2 are identified as paraphrases by this method; so these three patterns will be placed in the same pattern set.
    Note that there is an alternative method of paraphrase discovery, using a hand crafted synonym dictionary like WordNet (WordNet Home page).
    However, we found that the coverage of WordNet for a particular topic is not sufficient.
    For example, no synset covers any combinations of the main words in Figure 2, namely &#8220;buy&#8221;, &#8220;acquire&#8221; and &#8220;merger&#8221;.
    Furthermore, even if these words are found as synonyms, there is the additional task of linking expressions.
    For example, if one of the expressions is &#8220;reject the merger&#8221;, it shouldn&#8217;t be a paraphrase of &#8220;acquire&#8221;.
