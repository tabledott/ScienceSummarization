bability information that is encoded in the rules.
    This allows the system to assign the most-likely structure to each input.
    The output of these systems consists of constituent analysis, the degree of detail of which is dependent on the detail of annotation present in the treebank that is used to train the system.
    There are also parsers that use probabilistic (weighting) information in conjunction with hand-crafted grammars, for example, Black et al. (1993), Nagao (1994), Alshawi and Carter (1994), and Srinivas, Doran, and Kulick (1995).
    In these cases the probabilistic information is primarily used to rank the parses produced by the parser and not so much for the purpose of robustness of the system.
  
  
    Lexicalized grammars are particularly well-suited for the specification of natural language grammars.
    The lexicon plays a central role in linguistic formalisms such as LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan 1983), GPSG (Gazdar et al. 1985), HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987), CCG (Steedman 1987), Lexicon
