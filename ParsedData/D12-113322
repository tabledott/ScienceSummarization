 the results for the Penn Treebank converted with the head-finding rules of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) and the labeling rules of Nivre (2006).
    We use k = 3 and &#945; = 0.4, which gave the best results on the development set.
    The UAS improves by 0.24 when we do joint tagging and parsing.
    The POS accuracy improves slightly by 0.12 but to a lower degree than for the English CoNLL data where we observed an improvement of 0.20.
    Nonetheless, the improvement in the joint TLAS score is statistically significant at p &lt; 0.01 (paired t-test).
    Our joint tagger and dependency parser with graph features gives very competitive unlabeled dependency scores for English with 93.38 UAS.
    To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest score reported for a (transition-based) dependency parser that does not use additional information sources.
    By adding cluster features and widening the beam to bi = 80, we achieve 93.67 UAS.
    We also obtain a POS accuracy of 97.42, which is on a par with the bes
