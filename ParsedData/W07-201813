r frame and (2) each label span is interpreted as the boundaries of a syntactic phrase, so that when a larger label span subsumes a smaller one, the larger span can be interpreted as a the highernode in a hierarchical tree.
			There are a fair num ber of complications, largely involving identifyingmismatches between syntactic and semantic headedness.
			Some of these (support verbs, copulas, modifiers, transparent nouns, relative clauses) are annotated in the data with their own labels, while others (syntactic markers, e.g. prepositions, and auxil iary verbs) must be identified using simple syntactic heuristics and part-of-speech tags.
			For this evaluation, a non-frame node counts as matching provided that it includes the head of the gold standard, whether or not non-head children ofthat node are included.
			For frame nodes, the partici pants got full credit if the frame of the node matched the gold standard.
