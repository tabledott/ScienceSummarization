aining values of the table can be computed accordingly.
    Using the values from Table 3, we can also compute precision, recall, and F-Score.
    Precision is defined to be C/(C+/), recall is C/(C+D), and F-Score is the product of precision and recall divided by the average of the two.
    For the first algorithm, the precision, recall, and F-Score would have respectively been 1/3, 1, and 1/2.
    In the second algorithm, these numbers would have been 5/7, 5/6, and 10/13.
    Table 4 uses the above scoring mechanism to compare between Linguistica and our system (at various probability thresholds).
    Note that since Linguistica removes capitalization, it will have a different total word count than our system.
  
  
    These results suggest that semantics and LSA can play a key part in knowledge-free morphology induction.
    Semantics alone worked at least as well as Goldsmith's frequency-based approach.
    Yet we believe that semantics-based and frequency-based approaches play complementary roles.
