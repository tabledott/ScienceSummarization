general formalism we are proposing, where corpus-extracted weighted tuple structures are represented as labeled tensors, does not strictly require these assumptions.
    For example, W2 could be a larger set of &#8220;relata&#8221; including not only words, but also documents, morphological features, or even visual features (with appropriate links, such as, for word-document relations, occurs-at-the-beginning-of).
    The inverse link constraint might not be appropriate, for example, if we use an asymmetric association measure, or if we are only interested in one direction of certain grammatical relations.
    We leave the investigation of all these possibilities to further studies.
