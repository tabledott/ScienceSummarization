nd F(aS) is the frequency of suffix nS.
  If the information gain at some leaf of the suffix tree is below a given threshoht ~, it is removed.
  The tag frequencies of all deleted subnodes of a parent node are collected at the defi, ult node of the parent node.
  If the default node is the only renlaining subnodc, it is deleted too.
  In this case, the parent node becomes a leaf and is also checked, whether it is deletable.
  To illustrate this process consider the following ex- ample, where ess is the suffix of the parent node, less is tim suffix of one child node and hess is the suffix of the other child node.
  The tag frequencies of these nodes are given in table 1.
  Tim information measure for the parent node is: 86 86 10 10 S(ess) .
  l o ,a~- -  ... ~ 1.32 (9) 143 143 143 143 ].lie corresponding values for the chihl nodes are 0.39 for hess and 0.56 for less.
  Now, we can determine the welghted information gain at each of the ehihl nodes.
  We get: G(ness) = 48(1.32 - 0.39) = 44.64 (10) 5Opell class p
