airwise decomposition restricts the feature set to evidence about pairs of noun phrases only.
    This restriction can be detrimental if there exist features of sets of noun phrases that cannot be captured by a combination of pairwise features.
    As a simple example, consider prohibiting coreferent sets that consist only of pronouns.
    That is, we would like to require that there be at least one antecedent for a set of pronouns.
    The pairwise decomposition does not make it possible to capture this constraint.
    In general, we would like to construct arbitrary features over a cluster of noun phrases using the full expressivity of first-order logic.
    Enabling this sort of flexible representation within a statistical model has been the subject of a long line of research on first-order probabilistic models (Gaifman, 1964; Halpern, 1990; Paskin, 2002; Poole, 2003; Richardson and Domingos, 2006).
    Conceptually, a first-order probabilistic model can be described quite compactly.
