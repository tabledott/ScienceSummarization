new paradigms have emerged.
    These systems employ more than just the surface-level information used by the state-of-the-art phrase-based translation systems.
    For example, hierarchical (Chiang, 2005) and syntax-based (Galley et al., 2006) systems have recently improved in both accuracy and scalability.
    Combined with the latest advances in phrase-based translation systems, it has become more attractive to take advantage of the various outputs in forming consensus translations (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994; Bangalore et al., 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al., 2006).
    System combination has been successfully applied in state-of-the-art speech recognition evaluation systems for several years (Fiscus, 1997).
    Even though the underlying modeling techniques are similar, many systems produce very different outputs with approximately the same accuracy.
    One of the most successful approaches is consensus network decoding (Mangu et al., 2000) which assumes that the confidence of a word
