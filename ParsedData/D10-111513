ntations are not directly harvested from corpora, we can still meaningfully compare adjectives to each other or other words by using their estimated matrix, or an average vector for the ANs that contain them: both options are tested in Section 7 below.
  
  
    We built a large corpus by concatenating the Web-derived ukWaC corpus (http://wacky. sslmit.unibo.it/), a mid-2009 dump of the English Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia. org) and the British National Corpus (http: //www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/).
    This concatenated corpus, tokenized, POS-tagged and lemmatized with the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995), contains about 2.83 billion tokens (excluding punctuation, digits, etc.).
    The ukWaC and Wikipedia sections can be freely downloaded, with full annotation, from the ukWaC site.
    We performed some of the list extraction and checking operations we are about to describe on a more manageable data-set obtained by selecting the first 100M tokens of ukWaC; we refer to this subset as the sample corpus below.
