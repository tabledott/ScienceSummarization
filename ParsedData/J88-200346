trast, the nonmodal future does not really seem to occur in the past at all, except of course in reported or indirect speech; it just becomes indistinguishable from the simple past.
    It follows that (55) can be answered with (a) or (b).
    But (56) can only be answered with (a), not with (b).
    These similarities suggest the symmetry depicted informally in Figure 7 between the perfect, the simple past, the futurate progressive, and the nonmodal future.
    The hatching again informally indicates the extent of the consequent state and the preparatory process associated with the perfect and the futurate progressive, respectively.
    That is not to imply that the two are the same sort of entity: they are both states, but of a different kind.
    The perfect is a consequent state; the futurate progressive is a state derived from a preparatory process.
    This difference is indicated by the presence of a defined upper bound on the latter.
    The Reichenbach diagram in Figure 7 for the nonmodal future is o
