    A CCG lexicon specifies the lexical categories of words, and therefore contains the entire language-specific grammar.
    Here, we examine the size and coverage of the lexicon that consists of the word&#8211;category pairs that occur in CCGbank.
    This lexicon could be used by any CCG parser, although morphological generalization (which is beyond the scope of the present paper) and ways to treat unknown words are likely to be necessary to obtain a more complete lexicon.
    Number of Entries.
    The lexicon extracted from sections 02&#8211;21 has 74,669 entries for 44,210 word types (or 929,552 word tokens).
    Many words have only a small number of categories, but because a number of frequent closed-class items have a large number of categories (see Table 1), the expected number of lexical categories per token is 19.2.
    Number and Growth of Lexical Category Types.
    How likely is it that we have observed the complete inventory of category types in the English language?
