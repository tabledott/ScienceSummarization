igure 5: they prepare they have built to build the bridge The drawing up of the plans is then, for reasons to do with knowledge of the world, situated in the preparatory phase.
    In Example b, in contrast, people tend to see the building of the bridge as decomposed into a quite different preparatory process of building, a quite different culmination of completing the bridge and some consequences that we take to be also subtly distinct from those in the previous case as was argued in Section 3.2.
    The resulting nucleus is given in Figure 6.
    The use of the best materials is then, as in (a), situated in the preparatory process&#8212;but it is a different one this time.
    Thus a main clause event can potentially be situated anywhere along this nucleus, subject to support from knowledge about the precise events involved.
    But Example 2, repeated here, is still strange, because it is so hard to think of any relation that is supported in this way: 49.
