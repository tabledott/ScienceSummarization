re two additional benefits of this technique: We must also note that requiring syntactic constraints for pivot-based paraphrase extraction restricts the approach to those languages where a reasonably good parser is available.
    An obvious extension of the Callison-Burch style approach is to use the collection of pivoted English-to-English phrase pairs to generate sentential paraphrases for new sentences.
    Madnani et al. (2008a) combine the pivot-based approach to paraphrase acquisition with a well-defined English-to-English translation model that is then used in an (unmodified) SMT system, yielding sentential paraphrases by means of &#8220;translating&#8221; input English sentences.
    However, instead of fully lexicalized phrasal correspondences as in (Bannard and Callison-Burch 2005), the fundamental units of translation (and paraphrasing) are hierarchical phrase pairs.
    The latter can be extracted from the former by replacing aligned sub-phrases with non-terminal symbols.
    For example, given th
