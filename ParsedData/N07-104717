s from the classifier.
    Instead, it selects the best phoneme sequence from a set of possible local predictions by taking advantage of the phoneme language model, which is trained on the phoneme sequences in the training data.
  
  
    We evaluated our approaches on CMUDict, Brulex, and German, Dutch and English Celex corpora (Baayen et al., 1996).
    The corpora (except English Celex) are available as part of the Letterto-Phoneme Conversion PRONALSYL Challenge1.
    For the English Celex data, we removed duplicate words as well as words shorter than four letters.
    Table 2 shows the number of words and the language of each corpus.
    For all of our experiments, our local classifier for predicting phonemes is the instance-based learning IB1 algorithm (Aha et al., 1991) implemented in the TiMBL package (Daelemans et al., 2004).
    The HMM technique is applied as post processing to the instance-based learning to provide a sequence prediction.
    In addition to comparing one-toone and many-to-many align
