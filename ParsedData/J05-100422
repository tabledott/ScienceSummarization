  3.2 Secondary Predications There are two other functional tags which, unlike those listed above, can also be associated with numbered arguments in the frames files.
  The first one, EXT (extent), indicates that a constituent is a numerical argument on its verb, as in climbed 15% or walked 3 miles.
  The second, PRD (secondary predication), marks a more subtle relationship.
  If one thinks of the arguments of a verb as existing in a dependency tree, all arguments depend directly on the verb.
  Each argument is basically independent of the others.
  There are those verbs, however, which predict that there is a predicative relationship between their arguments.
  A canonical example of this is call in the sense of ?
  ?attach a label to,??
  as in Mary called John an idiot.
  In this case there is a relationship between John and an idiot (at least in Mary?s mind).
  The PRD tag is associated with the Arg2 label in the frames file for this frameset, since it is predictable that the Arg2 predicates on the Arg1 Jo
