tive correspondence between alignments and derivations.
    There are two ways in which ITG derivations double count alignments.
    First, n-ary productions are not binarized to remove ambiguity; this results in an exponential number of derivations for diagonal alignments.
    This source of overcounting is considered and fixed by Wu (1997) and Zens and Ney (2003), which we briefly review here.
    The resulting grammar, which does not handle null alignments, consists of a symbol N to represent a bitext cell produced by a normal rule and I for a cell formed by an inverted rule; alignment terminals can be either N or I.
    In order to ensure unique derivations, we stipulate that a N cell can be constructed only from a sequence of smaller inverted cells I. Binarizing the rule N &#8594; I2+ introduces the intermediary symbol N (see Figure 2(a)).
    Similarly for inverse cells, we insist an I cell only be built by an inverted combination of N cells; binarization of I --* N2+ requires the introduction of the in
