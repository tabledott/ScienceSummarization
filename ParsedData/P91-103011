    To derive this standard, we together judged the attachment for the 1000 triples a second time, this time using the full sentence context.
    It turned out to be a surprisingly difficult task to assign attachment preferences for the test sample.
    Of course, many decisions were straightforward; sometimes it is clear that a prepositional phrase is and argument of a noun or verb.
    But more than 10% of the sentences seemed problematic to at least one author.
    There are several kinds of constructions where the attachment decision is not clear theoretically.
    These include idioms (3-4), light verb constructions (5), small clauses (6).
    We chose always to assign light verb constructions to noun attachment and small clauses to verb attachment.
    Another source of difficulty arose from cases where there seemed to be a systematic ambiguity in attachment.
    Sentence (7) shows a systematic locative ambiguity: if you frequent a bar and the bar is in a place, the frequenting event is arguably in t
