that in those sentences e,is tile translate of f !
  ), then re-compute all the quantities over the shortened texts, determine the new maximizing pair e~,f ~ and continue the process until some arbitrary stopping rule is invoked?
  Before the next section introduces a better approach that yields probabilities, we present in Figure 2 a list of high mutual 72 information English words for some selected French words.
  The reader will agree that even tire flawed technique isquite powerful.
  A SIMPLE GI,OSSARY BASED ON A MODE[, O1" TIlE TRANSI,ATION PROCESS We will now revert to our original ambition of deriving probabilities of translation, P(e,[f).
  Let us start by observing that tlm algorithm of the previous ection has the following flaw: Shonld it be "decided" that the qth word, e,, , of the English sentence is Ihc translate of the rth word, ~r, of the French sentence, that process makes no provision for removing e,.
