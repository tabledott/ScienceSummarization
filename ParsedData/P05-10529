Machine decide which clue is crucial.
    Some of the kernels are extended to generate high order features.
    We think a discriminative classifier trained with all the available syntactic features should do better on the sparse data.
  
  
    ACE (Automatic Content Extraction)2 is a research and development program in information extraction sponsored by the U.S. Government.
    The 2004 evaluation defined seven major types of relations between seven types of entities.
    The entity types are PER (Person), ORG (Organization), FAC (Facility), GPE (Geo-Political Entity: countries, cities, etc.
    ), LOC (Location), WEA (Weapon) and VEH (Vehicle).
    Each mention of an entity has a mention type: NAM (proper name), NOM (nominal) or 1 Kambhatla also evaluated his system on the ACE relation detection task, but the results are reported for the 2003 task, which used different relations and different training and test data, and did not use hand-annotated entities, so they cannot be readily compared to our results
