reordering is preserved and even strengthened in our approach.
    Experiments show that, for the NIST MT05 task of Chinese-to-English translation, the proposal leads to BLEU improvement of 1.56%.
    Despite the encouraging experiment results, it is still not very clear how the syntax-based and distance-based models complement each other in improving word reordering.
    In future we need to investigate their interaction and identify the contribution of each component.
    Moreover, it is observed that the parse trees returned by a full parser like the Stanford parser contain too many nodes which seem not be involved in desired reorderings.
    Shallow parsers should be tried to see if they improve the quality of reordering knowledge.
