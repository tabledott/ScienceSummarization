    Two particular ways in which such situations may hold have been noticed in previous research.
    Each leads to a different type of inference load on the hearer, both of which we believe relate to Rule 1; however, neither constitutes a violation of Rule 1.
    The resulting discourses are coherent, but the determination of local
