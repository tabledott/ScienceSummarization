s provide a 3.63 BLEU point increase over minimal rules.
	
	
			While syntactic approaches seek to remedy word ordering problems common to statistical machine translation (SMT) systems, many of the earlier models?particularly child re-ordering models?
			fail to account for human translation behavior.Galley et al (2004) alleviate this modeling prob lem and present a method for acquiring millions of syntactic transfer rules from bilingual corpora,which we review below.
			Here, we make the fol lowing new contributions: (1) we show how to acquire larger rules that crucially condition onmore syntactic context, and show how to compute multiple derivations for each training exam ple, capturing both large and small rules, as well as multiple interpretations for unaligned words;(2) we develop probability models for these multi level transfer rules, and give estimation methods for assigning probabilities to very large rule sets.
			We contrast our work with (Galley et al, 2004), highlight some severe limitations of p
