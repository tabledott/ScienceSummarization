 other, optimal total PPs were observed at target coverages 4,0008,000.
    Adding ambiguous words results in a worse performance on lexicon words, yet improves overall performance, especially for high thresholds.
    For all further experiments we fixed the threshold in a way that partitioning 1 consisted of 5,000 words, so only half of the top 10,000 words are considered unambiguous.
    At this Fig 2.
    Influence of threshold s on tagger performance: cluster-conditional tag perplexity PP as a function of target word coverage. oov% is the fraction of non-lexicon words.
    Overall results are presented in table 3.
    The combined strategy TMA reaches the lowest PP for all languages.
    The morphology extension (M) always improves the OOV scores.
    Adding ambiguous words (A) hurts the lexicon performance, but largely reduces the OOV rate, which in turn leads to better overall performance.
    Combining both partitionings (T) does not always decrease the total PP a lot, but lowers the number of tags sig
