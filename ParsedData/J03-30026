    Finally we present our thoughts on future work and conclusions.
  
  
    STRAND (Resnik 1998, 1999) is an architecture for structural translation recognition, acquiring natural data.
    Its goal is to identify pairs of Web pages that are mutual translations.
    In order to do this, it exploits an observation about the way that Web page authors disseminate information in multiple languages: When presenting the same content in two different languages, authors exhibit a very strong tendency to use the same document structure (e.g., Figure 1).
    STRAND therefore locates pages that might be translations of each other, via a number of different strategies, and filters out page pairs whose page structures diverge by too much.
    In this section we describe how STRAND works, and we also discuss several related Web-mining methods, focusing on the overall architecture these systems have in common and the important system-specific variations.
    We then show how tuning STR
