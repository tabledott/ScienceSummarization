ould otherwise result in incorrect CCG derivations.
    We will begin by ignoring null elements, and assume that Penn Treebank trees are entirely consistent with CCG analyses.
    The basic algorithm then consists of four steps: Similar algorithms for phrase-structure trees without traces or other null elements have been suggested by Buszkowski and Penn (1990) and Osborne and Briscoe (1998).
    We illustrate this basic algorithm using the previous example (9).
    Then we will extend this algorithm to deal with coordination, and introduce a modification to cope with the fact that certain word classes, such as participials, can act as modifiers of a large number of constituent types.
    Section 5 summarizes the most important preprocessing steps that were necessary to obtain the desired CCG analyses from the Treebank trees.
    Section 6 extends this basic algorithm to deal with the null elements in the Treebank.
    First, the constituent type of each node (head (h), complement (c), or adjunct (a)) is deter
