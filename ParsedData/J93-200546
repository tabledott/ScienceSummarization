r this reason, we will call such verbs discourse polarity items.
    For our purposes, the significance of such data is twofold: first, experiments on corpora can test and confirm linguistic intuitions concerning a subtle semantic judgment; second, if such knowledge is in fact so systematic, then it must be at least partially represented in the lexical semantics of the verb.
    To test whether the intuitions supported by the above data could be confirmed in corpora, Bergler (1991) derived the statistical co-occurrence of insist with discourse polarity markers in the 7 million-word corpus of Wall Street Journal articles.
    She derived the statistics reported in Figure 7.
    Let us assume, on the basis of this preliminary date presented in Bergler (1992) that these verbs in fact do behave as discourse polarity items.
    The question then
  
  
    insist 586 occurrences throughout the corpus insist on 109 these have been cleaned by hand and are actually occurrences of the idiom insist on rather than accide
