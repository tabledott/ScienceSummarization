n column totals (T1) across the matrix, with each row total u, (or total number of boundaries assigned by subject i) assumed to be fixed.
    Where the average column total is T, the statistic is given by: Our results indicate that the agreement among subjects is extremely significant.
    For the 20 narratives, the probabilities that the observed distributions could have arisen by chance range from p = .1 x 10-6 to p = .6 x 10-9.
    We now turn to the second question addressed in the segmentation study, how to abstract a set of empirically justified boundaries from the data.
    We do this by selecting the statistically significant response data.
    Recall the large amounts of white space in Figure 3, contrasting with the few sharp peaks where many subjects identify the same boundary, which suggests that the significance of Q owes most to the cases where columns have many l's.
    The question is, how many l's is significant?
    We address this question by partitioning Q into distinct components for each
