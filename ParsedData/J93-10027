k the large number of syntactic analyses produced by NL grammars according to the frequency of occurrence of the individual rules deployed in each analysis.
    We discuss a fully automatic procedure for constructing an LR parse table from a unification-based grammar formalism, and consider the suitability of alternative LALR(1) parse table construction methods for large grammars.
    The parse table is used as the basis for two parsers; a user-driven interactive system that provides a computationally tractable and labor-efficient method of supervised training of the statistical information required to drive the probabilistic parser.
    The latter is constructed by associating probabilities with the LR parse table directly.
    This technique is superior to parsers based on probabilistic lexical tagging or probabilistic context-free grammar because it allows for a more context-dependent probabilistic language model, as well as use of a more linguistically adequate grammar formalism.
    We compare the perfor
