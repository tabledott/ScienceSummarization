tions to the algorithm's decision procedure.
    Interestingly, this enhancement only marginally improves the algorithm's performance (by 2%).
    The algorithm is compared with other approaches to anaphora resolution that have been proposed in the literature.
    In particular, the search procedure of Hobbs' algorithm was implemented in the Slot Grammar framework and applied to the sentences in the blind test set.
    The authors' algorithm achieves a higher rate of success (4%) than Hobbs' algorithm.
    The relation of the algorithm to the centering approach is discussed, as well as to models of anaphora resolution that invoke a variety of informational factors in ranking antecedent candidates.
  
  
    This paper presents an algorithm for identifying the noun phrase antecedents of third person pronouns and lexical anaphors (reflexives and reciprocals).
    The algorithm applies to the syntactic representations generated by McCord's Slot Grammar parser and relies on salience measures derived from syntacti
