so, the title of this paper is a tautology.
  However, the studies in this paper are focused on the sense distinctions atthe top of the tree.
  A good working definition of the distinctions considered are those meanings which are not typically translated to the same word in a foreign language.
  Therefore, one natural type of sense distinction to consider are those words in English which indeed have multiple trans- lations in a language such as French.
  As is now standard in the field, we use the Canadian Hansards, a parallel bilingual corpus, to provide sense tags in the form of French transla- tions.
  Unfortunately, the Hansards are highly skewed in their sense distributions, and it is difficult to find words for which there are adequate numbers of a second sense.
  More diverse large bilingual corpora re not yet readily available.
  We also use data sets which have been hand-tagged bynative English speakers.
  To make the selection of sense distinc- tions more objective, we use words such as bass where t
