 shifters reverse polarity (e.g., little truth, lit tle threat).
			Negative polarity shifters typically make the polarity of an expression negative (e.g., lack of understanding).
			Positive polarity shifters typically make the polarity of an expression positive (e.g., abate the damage).
			The polarity classification results for this second step in the contextual disambiguation process are given in Table 5.
			Also listed in the table are resultsfor the two simple classifiers that provide our base lines.
			The first line in Table 5 lists the results forthe classifier that uses just one feature, the word token.
			The second line shows the results for the clas sifier that uses both the word token and the word?s prior polarity as features.
			The last line shows theresults for the polarity classifier that uses all 10 fea tures from Table 6.
			Mirroring the results from step one, the more complex classifier performs significantly better than the simpler classifiers, as measured by accuracyand all of the F-me
