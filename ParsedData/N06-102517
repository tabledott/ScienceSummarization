gorithm performs a hill-climbing search along the feature space.
    We start with a model based on all available features.
    Then we train models obtained by removing one feature at a time.
    We choose the worst performing feature, namely the one whose removal gives the largest improvement based on the MUC score F-measure, and remove it from the model.
    We then train classifiers removing each of the remaining features separately from the enhanced model.
    The process is iteratively run as long as significant improvement is observed.
    Table 2 compares the results between our duplicated Soon baseline and the original system.
    We assume that the slight improvements of our system are due to the use of current pre-processing components and another classifier.
    Tables 3 and 4 show a comparison of the performance between our baseline system and the ones incremented with semantic features.
    Performance improvements are highlighted in bold7.
    The tables show that semantic features improve syst
