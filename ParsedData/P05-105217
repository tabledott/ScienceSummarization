cases where two paths do not match exactly, this kernel can still tell us how similar they are.
    In our experiments we placed an upper bound on the length of dependency paths for which we computed a non-zero kernel. where This kernel matches the local dependency context around the relation arguments.
    This can be helpful especially when the dependency path between arguments does not exist.
    We also hope the dependencies on each argument may provide some useful clues about the entity or connection of the entity to the context outside of the relation example.
    Having defined all the kernels representing shallow and deep processing results, we can define composite kernels to combine and extend the individual kern d &#936;3 covers the most important clues for this task: information about the two arguments and the word link between them.
    The polynomial extension is equivalent to adding pairs of features as new features.
    Intuitively this introduces new features like: the subtype of the first arg
