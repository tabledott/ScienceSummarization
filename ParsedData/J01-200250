is a degradation only for the WSJ data, and of a much less pronounced nature.
    With the other data sets there is an improvement, significantly so for LOB.
    For Decision Trees, there is also a limited degradation for WSJ and WotanLite, and a slight improvement for LOB.
    The other two systems appear to be able to use the context more effectively.
    WPDV shows a relatively constant significant improvement over all data sets.
    Maccent shows more variation, with a comparable improvement on LOB and WotanLite, a very slight degradation on WSJ, and a spectacular improvement on Wotan, where it even yields an accuracy higher than the &amp;quot;All ties correct&amp;quot; level.'
    Addition of the word is still generally counterproductive.
    Only WPDV sometimes manages to translate the extra information into an improvement in accuracy, and even then a very small one.
    It would seem that vastly larger amounts of training data are necessary if the word information is to become useful.
