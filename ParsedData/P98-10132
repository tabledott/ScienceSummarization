 STAGES, SOCIAL CONTEXT, EMOTION and COGNITION.
    The results of the project are (a) a lexical resource, called the FrameNet database3, and (b) associated software tools.
    The database has three major components (described in more detail below: PLE SENTENCES which illustrate each of the potential realization patterns identified in the formula;4 and (d) links to the FRAME DATABASE and to other machine-readable resources such as WordNet and COMLEX. marked up to exemplify the semantic and morphosyntactic properties of the lexical items.
    (Several of these are schematized in Fig.
    2).
    These sentences provide empirical support for the lexicographic analysis provided in the frame database and lexicon entries.
    These three components form a highly relational and tightly integrated whole: elements in each may point to elements in the other two.
    The database will also contain estimates of the relative frequency of senses and complementation patterns calculated by matching the senses and patterns
