    These tables are expected to show information about the salient relations for the topic.
    Figure 1 describes the components and how this system works.
    There are six major components in the system.
    We will briefly describe each component and how the data is processed; then, in the next section, four important components will be described in more detail.

    The paraphrase discovery was conducted offline and created a paraphrase knowledge base.
  
  
    In this section, four important components will be described in detail.
    Prior work related to each component is explained and the techniques used in our system are presented.
