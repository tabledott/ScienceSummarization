imum Connective-Cost Method [7] for Japanese morphologi- cal analysis, Extended Viterbi Algorithm for charac- ter recognition [6], and "l~ee-Trellis N-Best Search for speech recognition [15].
  We also propose a novel method for handling un- known words uniformly within the statistical pproach.
  Using character trigrams ms tim word model, it gener- ates the N-best word hypotheses that match the left- most substrings starting at a given position in the input senten  ce.
  Moreover, we propose a novel method for evaluat- ing the performance of morphological analyzers.
  Un- like English, Japanese does not place spaces between words.
  It is difficult, even for native Japanese, to place word boundaries consistently because of the aggluti- native nature of the language.
  Thus, there were no standard performance metrics.
  We applied bracketing accuracy measures [1], which is originally used for En- glish parsers, to Japanese morphological nalyzers.
  We also slightly extended the original definition to describe
