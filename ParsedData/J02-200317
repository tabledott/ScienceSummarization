that the probabilities are sufficiently unlikely to be the same, then the null hypothesis is rejected, and the conclusion is that p(run  |(canine), subj) is not a good approximation of p(run  |(dog),subj).
    An example contingency table, based on counts obtained from a subset of the BNC using the system of Briscoe and Carroll, is given in Table 1.
    (Recall that the frequencies are estimated by distributing the count for a noun equally among the noun&#8217;s senses; this explains the fractional counts.)
    One column contains estimates of counts arising from concepts in ci appearing in the subject position of the verb run: f&#710; (ci, run, subj).
    A second column presents estimates of counts arising from concepts in ci appearing in the subject position of a verb other than run.
    The figures in brackets are the expected values if the null hypothesis is true.
    There is a choice of which statistic to use in conjunction with the chi-square test.
    The usual statistic encountered in textbooks is t
