gs of each word with an estimated probability of less than 1 percent were removed, because they were in most eases the result of tagging errors in the original corpus.
  Figure 3: A sample suffix tree of length 3 i es Oils ous scd old ble lie nee ive ing ion SOIl ton man ity The second part of the lexicon, the suflix lexicon, forms a tree.
  Each node of tile tree (excepted tile root node) is labeled with a character.
  At tile leaves, tag probability vectors are attached.
  During a lookup, tile suffix tree is searched from the root.
  In each step, tile branch which is labeled with the next character from tile end of the word suffix, is followed.
  Assume e.g., wc want to look for tile word taggiu 9 in the suflqx lexicon which is shown in fig.
  We start at the root (labeled #) and follow the branch which leads to the node labeled g. From there, we move to the node labeled n, and finally we end up in tile node 174 Table 1: Sample frequencies at a tree node and its two child nodes.
