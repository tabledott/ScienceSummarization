 In particular, the polynomial-time, polynomialspace CCG chart parser of (Vijay-Shanker &amp; Weir, 1993) can be trivially adapted to respect the constraints by tagging chart entries.
  
  
    It is interesting to note a rough resemblance between the tagged version of CCG in (10) and the tagged Lambek calculus L*, which (Hendriks, 1993) developed to eliminate spurious ambiguity from the Lambek calculus L. Although differences between CCG and L mean that the details are quite different, each system works by marking the output of certain rules, to prevent such output from serving as input to certain other rules.
    We wish to establish that each semantic equivalence class contains exactly one NF parse.
    But what does &amp;quot;semantically equivalent&amp;quot; mean?
    Let us adopt a standard model-theoretic view.
    For each leaf (i.e., lexeme) of a given syntax tree, the lexicon specifies a lexical interpretation from the model.
    CCG then provides a derived interpretation in the model for the comple
