ords and were asked to rank them using the following scale: (1) the words definitely share a significant part of their meaning; (2) the words have a shared meaning but only in some context; (3) the words have a shared meaning only under a very unusual context/situation; (4) the words do not share any meaning; (5) I am not familiar enough with some/all of the words.
    The 40 triplets were obtained as follows.
    20 of our categories were selected at random from the non-overlapping categories we have discovered, and three words were selected from each of these at random.
    10 triplets were selected in the same manner from the categories produced by k-means, and 10 triplets were generated by random selection of content words from the same window in the corpus.
    In Part II, subjects were given the full categories of the triplets that were graded as 1 or 2 in Part I (that is, the full &#8216;good&#8217; categories in terms of sharing of meaning.)
    They were asked to grade the categories from 1 (worst) t
