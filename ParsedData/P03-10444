ifferent domains.
    This yields an improvement in precision, and most crucially, it provides a natural indication to the learner when to stop learning&#8212;namely, once it attempts to wander into territory already claimed by other learners.
    We review the main features of the underlying unsupervised pattern learner and related work in Section 2.
    In Section 3 we describe the algorithm; 3.2 gives the details of the basic learner, and 3.3 introduces the counter-training framework which is super-imposed on it.
    We present the results with and without counter-training on several domains, Section 4, followed by discussion in Section 5.
  
  
    We outline those aspects of the prior work that are relevant to the algorithm developed in our presentation.
    We are given an IE scenario , e.g., &#8220;Management Succession&#8221; (as in MUC-6).
    We have a raw general news corpus for training, i.e., an unclassified and un-tagged set of documents .
    The problem is to find a good set of patterns in , w
