l N assignments, while the recall is measured as the correct subjective senses out of all the subjective senses in the gold standard data set.
    By varying the value of N from 1 to the total number of senses in the corpus, we can derive precision and recall curves. included in this evaluation (excluding 82 senses), since in this case a subjectivity score cannot be calculated.
    The evaluation is therefore performed on a total of 272 word senses.
    As a baseline, we use an &#8220;informed&#8221; random assignment of subjectivity labels, which randomly assigns S labels to word senses in the data set, such that the maximum number of S assignments equals the number of correct S labels in the gold standard data set.
    This baseline guarantees a maximum recall of 1 (which under true random conditions might not be achievable).
    Correspondingly, given the controlled distribution of S labels across the data set in the baseline setting, the precision is equal for all eleven recall points, and is determined a
