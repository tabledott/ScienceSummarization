ner product H(T1) &#183; H(T2) counts the number of matching pairs of subtrees of T1 and T2.
    Collins and Duffy (2001) describe a method for efficiently computing this dot product without explicitly computing the vectors H, which have dimensionality exponential in the size of the original tree.
    In order to derive a similarity measure ranging from zero to one, we use the cosine of the vectors H: we can compute the cosine similarity using the kernel method, without ever computing the entire of vector of counts H. Our kernel-based subtree metric TKM is then defined as the maximum of the cosine measure over the references: The advantage of using the tree kernel is that it can capture the similarity of subtrees of different shapes; the weak point is that it can only use the reference trees one by one, while STM can use them simultaneously.
    The dot product also weights individual features differently than our other measures, which compute overlap in the same way as does BLEU.
    For example, if the same
