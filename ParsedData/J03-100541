h S = {($, $, {0}, 0)}, where $ denotes the sentence start symbol for the immediate two predecessor words and {0} denotes the empty coverage set, in which no source position is covered yet.
    For the initial search state, the position last covered is set to 0.
    A set S of active hypotheses is expanded for each cardinality c using lexicon model, language model, and distortion model probabilities.
    The newly generated hypotheses are added to the hypothesis set Snew; for hypotheses that are not distinguished according to our DP approach, only the best partial hypothesis is retained for further consideration.
    This so-called recombination is implemented as a set of simple lookup and update operations on the set Snew of partial hypotheses.
    During the partial hypothesis extensions, an anticipated pruning is carried out: Hypotheses are discarded before they are considered for recombination and are never added to Snew.
    (The anticipated pruning is not shown in Table 4.
    It is based on the pruning
