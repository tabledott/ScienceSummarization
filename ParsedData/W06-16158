sformed and original features from the source domain.
    During supervised task testing, we use the both the transformed and original features from the target domain.
    If we learned a good mapping 0, then the classifier we learn on the source domain will also be effective on the target domain.
    The SCL algorithm is given in Figure 3, and the remainder of this section describes it in detail.
    Pivot features should occur frequently in the unlabeled data of both domains, since we must estimate their covariance with non-pivot features accurately, but they must also be diverse enough to adequately characterize the nuances of the supervised task.
    A good example of this tradeoff are determiners in PoS tagging.
    Determiners are good pivot features, since they occur frequently in any domain of written English, but choosing only determiners will not help us to discriminate between nouns and adjectives.
    Pivot features correspond to the auxiliary problems of Ando and Zhang (2005a).
