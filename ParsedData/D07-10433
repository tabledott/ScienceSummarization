 5, we present two applications of V-measure, ondocument clustering and on pitch accent type clus tering.
	
	
			V-measure is an entropy-based measure which explicitly measures how successfully the criteria of homogeneity and completeness have been satisfied.
			Vmeasure is computed as the harmonic mean of dis tinct homogeneity and completeness scores, just as1The ?V? stands for ?validity?, a common term used to de scribe the goodness of a clustering solution.
			410 precision and recall are commonly combined into F-measure (Van Rijsbergen, 1979).
			As F-measure scores can be weighted, V-measure can be weightedto favor the contributions of homogeneity or com pleteness.For the purposes of the following discussion, as sume a data set comprising N data points, and two partitions of these: a set of classes, C = {ci|i = 1, . . .
			, n} and a set of clusters, K = {ki|1, . . .
			,m}.Let A be the contingency table produced by the clus tering algorithm representing the clustering solution, such that A = {aij} where
