 where in the evolving E/S structure to integrate the event or situation description in the next clause.
    In this framework, a tensed clause Cb provides two pieces of semantic information: (a) a description of an event or situation, and (b) a particular configuration of ET, RT, and point of speech (abbreviated ST).
    (Here I may be departing from Reichenbach in treating ET, RT, and ST explicitly as elements of linguistic semantics, quite distinct from entities of type &amp;quot;event&amp;quot; in the events in the model follows (in part) from Cb's particular configuration of ET, RT, and ST.
    Both the characteristics of Eb (i.e., its ontology) and the configuration of ET, RT, and ST are critical to my account of tense as discourse anaphor.
    The event ontology I assume follows that of Moens and Steedman (this volume) and of Passonneau (this volume).
    Both propose that people interpret events as having a tripartite structure (a &amp;quot;nucleus&amp;quot; in Moens and Steedman's terminology) consis
