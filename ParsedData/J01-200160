ting characteristic (unlike the heuristics discussed in the text) that it is possible to impose restrictions that improve its precision while at the same time worsening its recall to unacceptably low levels.
    In work in progress, we are exploring the consequences of using such an initial heuristic with significantly higher precision, while depending on MDL considerations to extend the recall of the entire morphology.
    Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language splits which (from our external vantage point) are splits between prefix and stem: words beginning with de (defense, demand, delete, etc.) will at this point all be split after the initial de.
    So there is work to be done, and for this we return to the central notion of the signature.
  
  
    Each word now has been assigned an optimal split into stem and suffix by the initial heuristic chosen, and we consider henceforth only the best parse for that word, and we retain only those stems and suffixes that were optima
