ets for both and to compare their difficulties and state-of-the-art solutions for them.
    The uncertainty detection problem consists of two stages.
    First, keywords/cues indicating uncertainty should be recognized then either a sentence-level decision is made or the linguistic scope of the cue words has to be identified.
    The latter task falls within the scope of semantic analysis of sentences exploiting syntactic patterns, as hedge spans can usually be determined on the basis of syntactic patterns dependent on the keyword.
  
  
    The term hedging was originally introduced by Lakoff (1972).
    However, hedge detection has received considerable interest just recently in the NLP community.
    Light et al. (2004) used a handcrafted list of hedge cues to identify speculative sentences in MEDLINE abstracts and several biomedical NLP applications incorporate rules for identifying the certainty of extracted information (Friedman et al., 1994; Chapman et al., 2007; Aramaki et al., 2009; Conway et al., 20
