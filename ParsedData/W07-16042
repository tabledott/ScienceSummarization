    Our work targets errors involving prepositions, specifically those of incorrect preposition selection, such as arrive to the town, and those of extraneous prepositions, as in most ofpeople.
    We present an approach that combines machine learning with rule-based filters to detect preposition errors in a corpus of ESL essays.
    Even though this is work in progress, we achieve precision of 0.8 with a recall of 0.3.
    The paper is structured as follows: in the next section, we describe the difficulty in learning English preposition usage; in Section 3, we discuss related work; in Sections 4-7 we discuss our methodology and evaluation.
