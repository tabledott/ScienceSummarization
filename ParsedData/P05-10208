lem have been promising, our choices will be guided by previous learning-based coreference systems, as described below.
    Training instance creation methods.
    A training instance represents two NPs, NP and NP&#9985; , having a class value of COREFERENT or NOT COREFERENT depending on whether the NPs co-refer in the associated text.
    We consider three previously-proposed methods of creating training instances.
    In McCarthy and Lehnert&#8217;s method, a positive instance is created for each anaphoric NP paired with each of its antecedents, and a negative instance is created by pairing each NP with each of its preceding non-coreferent noun phrases.
    Hence, the number of instances created by this method is quadratic in the number of NPs in the associated text.
    The large number of instances can potentially make the training process inefficient.
    In an attempt to reduce the training time, Soon et al.&#8217;s method creates a smaller number of training instances than McCarthy and Lehnert&#8217;s.
