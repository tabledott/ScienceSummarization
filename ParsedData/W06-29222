features that hopefully might apply also when using other learning techniques.
    I extended the Yamada-Matsumoto parser to handle labeled dependencies: I tried two approaches: using a single classifier to predict pairs of actions and labels and using two separate classifiers, one for actions and one for labels.
    Finally, I extended the repertoire of actions used by the parser, in order to handle non-projective relations.
    Tests on the PDT (B&#246;hmov&#224; et al., 2003) show that the added actions are sufficient to handle all cases of non-projectivity.
    However, since the cases of non-projectivity are quite rare in the corpus, the general learner is not supplied enough of them to learn how to classify them accurately, hence it may be worthwhile to exploit a second classifier trained specifically in handling nonprojective situations.
    The overall parsing algorithm is an inductive statistical parser, which extends the approach by Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), by adding six new reduce actions for h
