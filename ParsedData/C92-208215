  This system is simi- lar to the work described here in that it recognizes some features of the context in which the proper noun occurs in order to identify some relevant semantic attributes.
  Coates-Stephens mentions that "known as" can explicitly introduce meanings for terms, as can appositives.
  We also have consid- ered these markers, hut the tbrmer often does not cleanly indicate "another name for" and the latter is difficult to recognize accurately.
  FUNES differs quite strongly from our approach in that, because it is able to fill in many kinds of frame roles, it requires a parser that produces a detailed structure, and it requires a domain-dependent k owlege base/lexicon.
  (Velardi &amp; Pazienza 1989) makes use of hand-coded selection restriction and conceptual relation rules in order to assign case roles to lexical items, and (Ja- cobs &amp; Zernik 1988) uses extensive domain knowledge to fill in missing category information for unknown words.
