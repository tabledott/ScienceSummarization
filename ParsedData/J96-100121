    The ability to automatically acquire collocation translations is thus a definite advantage for sublanguage translation.
    When moving to a new domain and sublanguage, translations that are appropriate can be acquired by running Champollion on a new corpus from that domain.
    Since in some instances parts of a sentence can be translated on a word-by-word basis, a translator must know when a full phrase or pair of words must be considered for translation and when a word-by-word technique will suffice.
    Two tasks must therefore be considered: For both tasks, general knowledge of the two languages is not sufficient.
