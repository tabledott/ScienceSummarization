(S[dcl]/NP) assigned to the relative pronoun.
    For local dependencies l is assigned a null value.
    A dependency structure is a multiset of these dependencies.
  
  
    Log-linear models (also known as Maximum Entropy models) are popular in NLP because of the ease with which discriminating features can be included in the model.
    Log-linear models have been applied to the parsing problem across a range of grammar formalisms, e.g.
    Riezler et al. (2002) and Toutanova et al.
    (2002).
    One motivation for using a log-linear model is that long-range dependencies which CCG was designed to handle can easily be encoded as features.
    A conditional log-linear model of a parse &#57746; E SZ, given a sentence S, is defined as follows: where A.f(&#57746;) = &#57739;i &#57747;ifi(&#57746;).
    The function fi is a feature of the parse which can be any real-valued function over the space of parses SZ.
    Each feature fi has an associated weight &#57747;i which is a parameter of the model to be estimate
