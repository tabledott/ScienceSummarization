nce-based model during decoding, and syntax-based reordering should focus on global reordering only.
    The result shows that this hypothesis does not hold.
    In practice syntax-based reordering also helps local reordering.
    Consider the translation example of test (a) shown in table 6.
    Both the baseline model and our model translate in the same way up to the word &#8220;Qq,&#8221; (which is incorrectly translated as &#8220;and&#8221;).
    From this point, the proposed preprocessing model correctly jump to the last phrase &#8220;Ili T &#255;X/discussed&#8221;, while the baseline model fail to do so for the best translation.
    It should be noted, however, that there are only four words between &#8220;Qq,&#8221; and the last phrase, and the desired order of decoding is within the capability of the baseline system.
    With the feature of syntax-based global reordering, a phrase-based decoder performs better even with respect to local reordering.
    It is because syntaxbased reordering adds more we
