ffering grammars of writing and speech, the investi- gation of prosodic phenomena in speech, and the evaluation and comparison of the adequacy of parsing models.
  In this paper, we review our experience with constructing one such large annotated corpus--the Penn Treebank, a corpus 1consisting of over 4.5 million words of American English.
  During the first three-year phase of the Penn Treebank Project (1989-1992), this corpus has been annotated for part-of-speech (POS) information.
  In addition, over half of it has been annotated for skeletal syntactic structure.
  These materials are available to members of the Linguistic Data Consortium; for details, see Section 5.1.
  The paper is organized as follows.
  Section 2 discusses the POS tagging task.
  After outlining the considerations that informed the design of our POS tagset and pre- senting the tagset itself, we describe our two-stage tagging process, in which text is first assigned POS tags automatically and then corrected by human annotators.
