.To utilize the ACE dataset for evaluating entail ment rule applications, we manually represented each ACE event predicate by unary seed templates.
			For example, the seed templates for Injure are ?A injure?, ?injure V ? and ?injure in T ?.
			We mapped each event role annotation to the corresponding seed template variable, e.g. ?Agent?
			to A and ?Victim?
			to V in the above example.
			Templatesare matched using a syntactic matcher that han dles simple morpho-syntactic phenomena, as in (Szpektor and Dagan, 2007).
			A rule application is considered correct if the matched argument is annotated by the corresponding ACE role.
			For testing binary rule-bases, we automatically generated binary seed templates from any twounary seeds that share the same predicate.
			For ex ample, for Injure the binary seeds ?A injure V ?, ?A injure in T ? and ?injure V in T ? were automatically generated from the above unary seeds.
			We performed two adaptations to the ACE dataset to fit it better to our evaluation needs.
