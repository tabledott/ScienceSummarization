SPs provide the basic structural relationships for the discourse; embeddings in the linguistic structure are derived from these relationships.
    The global coherence of a discourse depends on relationships among its DP and DSPs.
    Grosz and Sidner model the global-level component of the attentional state with a stack; pushes and pops of focus spaces on the stack depend on intentional relationships.
    This paper is concerned with local coherence and its relationship to attentional state at the local level.
    Centering is proposed as a model of the local-level component of attentional state.
    We examine the interactions between local coherence and choices of referring expressions, and argue that differences in coherence correspond in part to the different demands for inference made by different types of referring expressions, given a particular attentional state.
    We describe how the attentional state properties modeled by centering can account for these differences.
