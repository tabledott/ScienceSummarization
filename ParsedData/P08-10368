v.
    A word can be sampled using any window covering its sentence s, where the window is chosen according to a categorical distribution Od,s.
    Importantly, the fact that windows overlap permits the model to exploit a larger co-occurrence domain.
    These simple techniques are capable of modeling local topics without more expensive modeling of topic transitions used in (Griffiths et al., 2004; Wang and McCallum, 2005; Wallach, 2006; Gruber et al., 2007).
    Introduction of a symmetrical Dirichlet prior Dir(&#947;) for the distribution Od,s can control the smoothness of transitions.
    4Our particular implementation is over sentences, but sliding windows in theory can be over any sized fragment of text.
    The formal definition of the model with Kgl global and Kloc local topics is as follows: First, draw Kgl word distributions for global topics cogl z from a Dirichlet prior Dir(0gl) and Kloc word distributions for local topics coloc z&#8242; - from Dir(0loc).
    Then, for each document d: &#8211; if r
