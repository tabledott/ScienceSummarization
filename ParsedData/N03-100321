laces words with one of their randomly-chosen WordNet synonyms (using the most frequent sense of the word that WordNet listed synonyms for).
    The number of substitutions was set proportional to the number of words our method replaced in the same sentence.
    The point of this comparison is to check whether simple synonym substitution yields results comparable to those of our algorithm.
    10 For this experiment, we randomly selected 20 AFP articles about violence in the Middle East published later than the articles in our training corpus.
    Out of 484 sentences in this set, our system was able to paraphrase 59 (12.2%).
    (We chose parameters that optimized precision rather than recall on our small held-out set.)
    We found that after proper name substitution, only seven sentences in the test set appeared in the training set,11 which implies that lattices boost the generalization power of our method significantly: from seven to 59 sentences.
    Interestingly, the coverage of the system varied signi
