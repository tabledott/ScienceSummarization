ment structure&#8212;are more informative for classification than their definitional properties (e.g., the fact that a verb describes a manner of motion or a way of cooking).
    Their arguments rest on linguistic and psycholinguistic results on classification and language acquisition (in particular, Pinker, [1989]; Rosch [1978]).
    Our results confirm the primary role of argument structure in verb classification.
    Our experimental focus is particularly clear in this regard because we deal with verbs that are &amp;quot;minimal pairs&amp;quot; with respect to argument structure.
    By classifying verbs that show the same subcategorizations (transitive and intransitive) into different classes, we are able to eliminate one of the confounds in classification work created by the fact that subcategorization and argument structure are often co-variant.
    We can infer that the accuracy in our classification is due to argument structure information, as subcategorization is the same for all verbs.
    Thus, we
