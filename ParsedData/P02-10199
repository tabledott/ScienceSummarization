ne level but it is much bigger and is the dictionary we used for learning our final letter-to-phone model.
    The NETtalk dictionary has been designed so that each letter correspond to at most one phone, so a word is always longer, or of the same length as, its pronunciation.
    The alignment algorithm has to decide which of the letters correspond to phones and which ones correspond to nothing (i.e., are silent).
    For example, the entry in NETtalk (when we remove the empties, which contain information for phone level alignment) for the word able is ABLE e b L. The correct alignment is A/e B/b L/L E/&#8211;, where &#8211; denotes the empty phone.
    In the Microsoft Speech dictionary, on the other hand, each letter can naturally correspond to 0, 1, or 2 phones.
    For example, the entry in that dictionary for able is ABLE ey b ax l. The correct alignment is A/ey B/b L/ax&amp;l E/&#8211;.
    If we also allowed two letters as a group to correspond to two phones as a group, the correct alignment might be
