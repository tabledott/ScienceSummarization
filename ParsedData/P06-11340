  Word Sense And Subjectivity
  
    Subjectivity and meaning are both important properties of language.
    This paper explores their interaction, and brings empirical evidence in support of the hypotheses that (1) subjectivity is a property that can be associated with word senses, and (2) word sense disambiguation can directly benefit from subjectivity annotations.
  
  
    There is growing interest in the automatic extraction of opinions, emotions, and sentiments in text (subjectivity), to provide tools and support for various NLP applications.
    Similarly, there is continuous interest in the task of word sense disambiguation, with sense-annotated resources being developed for many languages, and a growing number of research groups participating in large-scale evaluations such as SENSEVAL.
    Though both of these areas are concerned with the semantics of a text, over time there has been little interaction, if any, between them.
    In this paper, we address this gap, and explore possible interactions
