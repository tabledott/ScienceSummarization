ct that performance improved with the number of features coded, and by combining algorithms in a simple additive way, suggested directions for improvement.
    We applied two training methods, error analysis and machine learning, to the previous test set of 10 narratives.
    Richer linguistic input and more sophisticated methods of combining linguistic data led to significant improvements in performance when the new algorithms were evaluated on a test set of 5 new narratives.
    The best-performing algorithm resulted from the machine learning experiment in which certain default options were overridden (&amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot; in Table 9).
    For the T = 4 boundary set, &amp;quot;Learning 2&amp;quot; recall was 53% as good as humans, precision was 95% as good, fallout was better than humans, and error (11%) was almost as low as that of humans (10%).
    Thus the main need for improvement is in recall.
    A comparison of results on two sets of boundaries, those identified by at least three, versus th
