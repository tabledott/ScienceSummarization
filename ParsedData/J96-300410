nerally regarded as trivial since words are delimited in English text by whitespace or marks of punctuation.
    Thus in an English sentence such as I'm going to show up at the ACL one would reasonably conjecture that there are eight words separated by seven spaces.
    A moment's reflection will reveal that things are not quite that simple.
    There are clearly eight orthographic words in the example given, but if one were doing syntactic analysis one would probably want to consider I'm to consist of two syntactic words, namely I and am.
    If one is interested in translation, one would probably want to consider show up as a single dictionary word since its semantic interpretation is not trivially derivable from the meanings of show and up.
    And if one is interested in US, one would probably consider the single orthographic word ACL to consist of three phonological words&#8212;/e) s'i El/&#8212;corresponding to the pronunciation of each of the letters in the acronym.
