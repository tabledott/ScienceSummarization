ly mixed, magnifying the difficulty of writing an adequate grammar/parser system.
    Instead, we would like a parsing algorithm that placed no restraints on the grammars it could handle as long as they could be expressed within the intended formalism.
    Still, the algorithm should take advantage of that part of the arbitrarily large amount of information in the complex-feature structures that is significant for guiding parsing with the particular grammar.
    One of the aforementioned solutions is to require the grammar writer to put all such significant information in a special atomic symbol&#8212;i.e., mandate a context-free backbone.
    Another is to use all of the feature structure information&#8212;but this method, as we shall see, inevitably leads to nonterminating algorithms.
    A compromise is to parameterize the parsing algorithm by a small amount of grammar-dependent information that tells the algorithm which of the information in the feature structures is significant for guiding the parse.
