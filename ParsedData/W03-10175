 (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999; Wiebe et al., 1999; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe et al., 2002), who proposed methods for discriminating between subjective and objective text at the document, sentence, and phrase levels.
    Bruce and Wiebe (1999) annotated 1,001 sentences as subjective or objective, and Wiebe et al. (1999) described a sentence-level Naive Bayes classifier using as features the presence or absence of particular syntactic classes (pronouns, adjectives, cardinal numbers, modal verbs, adverbs), punctuation, and sentence position.
    Subsequently, Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe (2000) showed that automatically detected gradable adjectives are a useful feature for subjectivity classification, while Wiebe (2000) introduced lexical features in addition to the presence/absence of syntactic categories.
    More recently, Wiebe et al. (2002) report on document-level subjectivity classification, using a k-nearest neighbor algorithm based on the total count of subjective words and phrases wi
