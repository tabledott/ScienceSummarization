in speaker style, granularity of segmentation, and richness of the linguistic input.
    Finally, while our results are quite promising, how generally applicable are they, and do results such as ours have any practical import?
    As discussed in Section 2, the ability both to segment discourse and to correlate segmentation with linguistic devices has been demonstrated in dialogues and monologues, using both spoken and written corpora, across a wide variety of genres (e.g., task-oriented, advice-giving, informationquery, expository, directions, and newspapers).
    Studies such as these suggest that our methodologies and/or results have the potential of being applicable to more than spontaneous narrative monologues.
    As for the utility of our work, even though the algorithms in this paper were produced using some features that were manually coded, once developed, they could be used in reverse to enhance the comprehensibility of text generation systems or the naturalness of text-to-speech systems that alrea
