n we can use to assign higher likelihood to potential cognates.
    In particular we define the prior f) to be the probabilistic string-edit distance (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998) between and the known phonetic correspondences to parameterize the string-edit model.
    In particular, insertion and deletion probabilities are held constant for all characters, and substitution probabilities are determined based on the known sound correspondences.
    We report results for both the simple geometric prior as well as the string-edit prior.
    Phrase Generation To generate a bilingual parallel phrase, we first draw m, n, and k independently from a Poisson distribution.
    These three integers represent the number and type of the morphemes d the number of coupled bilingual morpheme pairs, respectively. controlled by the prior Nevertheless, some nonzero probability is reserved for every possible string.
    We note that these single-language morpheme distributions also serve as monolingual segmentation models, and sim
