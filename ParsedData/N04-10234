within a template were used to handle phrase to phrase translation.
    However, phrase level alignment cannot handle long distance reordering effectively.
    Parse trees have also been used in alignment models.
    Wu (1997) introduced constraints on alignments using a probabilistic synchronous context-free grammar restricted to Chomskynormal form.
    (Wu, 1997) was an implicit or selforganizing syntax model as it did not use a Treebank.
    Yamada and Knight (2001) used a statistical parser trained using a Treebank in the source language to produce parse trees and proposed a tree to string model for alignment.
    Gildea (2003) proposed a tree to tree alignment model using output from a statistical parser in both source and target languages.
    The translation model involved tree alignments in which subtree cloning was used to handle cases of reordering that were not possible in earlier tree-based alignment models.
    Och and Ney (2002) proposed a framework for MT based on direct translation, using the
