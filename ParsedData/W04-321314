koff probability model.
    All that remains is to specify the parameters that guide the iterative use of the probability model to assign roles.
    The evidence count for each of the conditional probabilities refers to the number of times we have observed the conjunction of its conditioning events.
    For example, for , this is the number of times the particular combination of verb, slot, and noun have been observed.
    For a probability to be used, its evidence count must reach a given threshold, .
    The &#8220;goodness&#8221; of a role assignment is determined by taking the log of the ratio between the probabilities of the top two candidates for a slot (when the evidence of both meet ) (e.g., Hindle and Rooth, 1993).
    A role is only assigned if the log likelihood ratio is defined and meets a threshold; in this case, the candidate role with highest probability is assigned to the slot.
    (Note that in the current implementation, we do not allow re-labelling: an assigned label is fixed.)
