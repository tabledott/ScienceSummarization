en the performances of the two approaches.
    Although Connolly et al.&#8217;s approach also adopts the twin-candidate model, it achieves a poor performance for both pronoun resolution and nonpronoun resolution.
    The main reason is the absence of candidate filtering strategy in their approach (this is why the recall equals to the precision in the tables).
    Without candidate filtering, the recall may rise as the correct antecedents would not be eliminated wrongly.
    Nevertheless, the precision drops largely due to the numerous invalid NPs in the candidate set.
    As a result, a significantly low Fmeasure is obtained in their approach.
    Table 4 summarizes the overall performance of different approaches to coreference resolution.
    Different from Table 2 and 3, here we focus on whether a coreferential chain could be correctly identified.
    For this purpose, we obtain the recall, the precision and the F-measure using the standard MUC scoring program (Vilain et al. 1995) for the coreference resolu
