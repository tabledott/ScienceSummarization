n indication or clue that a new segment has begun.
    If an old chain is referred to again (a chain return), it is a strong indication that a previous segment is being returned to.
    We will demonstrate this in Section 4.
    The theory of coherence relations (H obbs 1978; Hirst 1981; McKeown 1985) will now be considered in relation to cohesion.
    There has been some confusion as to the differences between the phenomena of cohesion and coherence, e.g., Reichman (1985).
    There is a danger of lumping the two together and losing the distinct contributions of each to the understanding of the unity of text.
    Ultimately, the difference between cohesion and coherence is this: cohesion is a term for sticking together; it means that the text all hangs together.
    Coherence is a term for making sense; it means that there is sense in the text.
    Hence the term coherence relations refers to the relations between sentences that contribute to their making sense.
    Cohesion and coherence relations may be di
