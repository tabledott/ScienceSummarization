ich wouldgive 61.5% precision and recall1).
			Furthermore, sys tems that did outperform the first sense heuristic did so only by a small margin (the top score being 65% precision and recall).
			Over a decade ago, Gale et al (1992) observed the tendency for one sense of a word to prevail in a given discourse.
			To take advantage of this, a method for automatically determining the ?one sense?
			given a discourse or document is required.
			Magnini et al(2002) have shown that information about the do main of a document is very useful for WSD.
			This isbecause many concepts are specific to particular domains, and for many words their most likely mean ing in context is strongly correlated to the domain of the document they appear in.
			Thus, since word sense distributions are skewed and depend on the domain at hand we would like to know for each domain of application the most likely sense of a word.
			However, there are no extant domain-specificsense tagged corpora to derive such sense distribution informat
