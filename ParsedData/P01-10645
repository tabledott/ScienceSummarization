he possibility of segmentation .
    For example, we might know the average length of the segments and want to incorporate it into .
    .
    Equations (5) and (6) are used in Section 3 to describe the algorithm for finding the maximumprobability segmentation. where when and are the same word and otherwise.
    For example, Our assumption, however, is that we do not have such prior information.
    Thus, we have to use some uninformative prior probability.
    We define as where bits.2 This description length is derived as follows: Suppose that there are two people, a sender and a receiver, both of whom know the text to be segmented.
    Only the sender knows the exact segmentation, and he/she should send a message so that the receiver can segment the text correctly.
    To this end, it is sufficient for the sender to send integers, i.e., , because these integers represent the lengths of segments and thus uniquely determine the segmentation once the text is known.
    A segment length can be encoded using bi
