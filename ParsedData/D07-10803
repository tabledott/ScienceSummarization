tanabe et al, 2006a) thatscales the loss of a sentence BLEU to a document wise loss.
			The parameters are trained using the 764Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) (Cram mer et al, 2006).
			MIRA is successfully employed in dependency parsing (McDonald et al, 2005) or the joint-labeling/chunking task (Shimizu and Haas,2006).
			Experiments were carried out on an Arabicto-English translation task, and we achieved significant improvements over conventional minimum er ror training with a small number of features.This paper is organized as follows: First, Section 2 introduces the framework of statistical ma chine translation.
			As a baseline SMT system, we use the hierarchical phrase-based translation with an efficient left-to-right generation (Watanabe et al, 2006b) originally proposed by Chiang (2005).
			In Section 3, a set of binary sparse features are defined including numeric features for our baseline system.
			Section 4 introduces an online large-margin training algorithm using MIRA with our key comp
