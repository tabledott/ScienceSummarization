lity that a pre-modifying adjective in English translates into a post-modifier in French.
    We require a source language dependency parser that produces unlabeled, ordered dependency trees and annotates each source word with a partof-speech (POS).
    An example dependency tree is shown in Figure 1.
    The arrows indicate the head annotation, and the POS for each candidate is listed underneath.
    For the target language we only require word segmentation.
    To obtain word alignments we currently use GIZA++ (Och &amp; Ney, 03).
    We follow the common practice of deriving many-to-many alignments by running the IBM models in both directions and combining the results heuristically.
    Our heuristics differ in that they constrain manyto-one alignments to be contiguous in the source dependency tree.
    A detailed description of these heuristics can be found in Quirk et al. (04).
    Given a word aligned sentence pair and a source dependency tree, we use the alignment to project the source structure onto t
