s found in a large corpus reflect a huge amount of semantic knowledge, which was traditionally constructed by hand.
    Moreover, frequency data for such co-occurrences reflect both linguistic and domain-specific preferences, thus indicating not only what is possible, but also what is probable.
    It is important to notice that frequency information on lexical co-occurrence was found to be much more predictive than single word frequency.
    In the three experiments we reported, there were 61 cases in which the two types of information contradicted each other, favoring different target words.
    In 56 of these cases (92%), it was the most frequent lexical co-occurrence, and not the most frequent word, that predicted the correct translation.
    This result may raise relevant hypotheses for psycholinguistic research, which has indicated the relevance of word frequencies to human sense disambiguation (e.g., Simpson and Burgess 1988).
    We suggest that the high precision achieved in the experiments relies on
