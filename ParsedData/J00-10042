    We will define a dependency transduction model in terms of a collection of weighted head transducers.
    Each head transducer is a finite-state machine that differs from &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; finite-state transducers in that, instead of consuming the input string left to right, it consumes it &amp;quot;middle out&amp;quot; from a symbol in the string.
    Similarly, the output of a head transducer is built up middle out at positions relative to a symbol in the output string.
    The resulting finite-state machines are more expressive than standard left-to-right transducers.
    In particular, they allow long-distance movement with fewer states than a traditional finite-state transducer, a useful property for the translation task to which we apply them in this paper.
    (In fact, finite-state head transducers are capable of unbounded movement with a finite number of states.)
    In Section 2, we introduce head transducers and explain how input-outpu
