ained directly on an 80% subset of the hand-tagged evaluation set (using 5-fold cross-validation).
  Thus robust training on 500K words of very noisy but automatically-derived tag projections can approach the performance obtained by fully supervised learning on 80K words of hand-tagged training data.
  NOUN PHRASE BRACKETER INDUCTION Our empirical studies show that there is a very strong tendency for noun phrases to cohere as a unit when translated between lan- guages, even when undergoing significant internal re-ordering.
  This strong noun-phrase cohesion even tends to hold for relatively free word order languages such as Czech, where both native speakers and parallel corpus data indicate that nominal modifiers tend to re- main in the same contiguous chunk as the nouns they modify.
  This property allows collective word alignments to serve as a reliable basis for bracket projection as well.
