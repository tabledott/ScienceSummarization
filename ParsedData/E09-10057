aditional PageRank to refer to the case when a uniform v vector is used in Eq.
    (1); and whenever a modified v is used, we will call it Personalized PageRank.
    The next section shows how we define a modified v. PageRank is actually calculated by applying an iterative algorithm which computes Eq.
    (1) successively until convergence below a given threshold is achieved, or, more typically, until a fixed number of iterations are executed.
    Regarding PageRank implementation details, we chose a damping value of 0.85 and finish the calculation after 30 iterations.
    We did not try other damping factors.
    Some preliminary experiments with higher iteration counts showed that although sometimes the node ranks varied, the relative order among particular word synsets remained stable after the initial iterations (cf.
    Section 7 for further details).
    Note that, in order to discard the effect of dangling nodes (i.e. nodes without outlinks) we slightly modified Eq.
    (1).
    For the sake of brevity
