ding one (simplexscore) based on the observation that compositional collocations tend to be similar inmeaning to their constituent parts.
			They ex tract co-occurrence data for 111 phrasal verbs (e.g. rip off ) and their simplex constituents(e.g. rip) from the BNC using RASP and cal culate the value of simlin between each phrasal verb and its simplex constituent.
			The test simplexscore is used to rank the phrasal verbs according to their similarity with their simplexconstituent.
			This ranking is correlated with hu man judgements of the compositionality of the phrasal verbs using Spearman?s rank correlationcoefficient.
			The value obtained (0.0525) is dis appointing since it is not statistically significant(the probability of this value under the null hy pothesis of ?no correlation?
			is 0.3).2 However, Haspelmath (2002) notes that a compositional collocation is not just similar to one of its constituents ? it can be considered tobe a hyponym of its head constituent.
