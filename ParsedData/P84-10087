amp;quot;either feminine singular or plural.&amp;quot; Among the theories mentioned above, only Kay's UG allows disjunctive feature specifications in its formalism.
    (In LFG, disjunctions are allowed in control equations but not in the specification of values.)
    Of the three limitations, the first one may be theoretically justified since it has not been shown that there are phenomena in natural languages that involve circular structures (cf.
    [Kaplan and Bresnan, 831, p. 281).
    PATR-II at SRI and its expanded version at the University of Texas allow such structures for practical reasons because they tend to arise, mostly inadvertently, in the course of grammar construction and testing.
    An implementation that does not handle unification correctly in such cases is too fragile to use.
    The other two restrictions are linguistically unmotivated.
    There are many cases, especially in morphology, in which the most natural feature specifications are negative or disjunctive.
    In fact, the examp
