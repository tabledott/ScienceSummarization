k (we describe in Section 4.2 how such training instances are obtained).
    Without loss of generality, we assume j &gt; k. The goal of the training procedure is to find a parameter vector w that yields a &#8220;ranking score&#8221; function which minimizes the number of violations of pairwise rankings provided in the training set where (xij,xik) E r* if xij is ranked higher than xik for the optimal ranking r* (in the training data), and (D(xij) and (D(xik) are a mapping onto features representing the coherence properties of renderings xij and xik.
    In our case the features correspond to the entity transition probabilities introduced in Section 3.2.
    Thus, the ideal ranking function, represented by the weight vector w would satisfy the condition The problem is typically treated as a Support Vector Machine constraint optimization problem, and can be solved using the search technique described in Joachims (2002).
    This approach has been shown to be highly effective in various tasks ranging from collab
