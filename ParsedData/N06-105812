nd thus the system produces the following synthetic reference: For someone born here but has been sentimentally attached to a foreign country far from home, it is hard to believe this kind of changes.
    The synthetic reference keeps the meaning of the original reference, but has a higher word overlap with the system output.
    One of the implications of this design is the need to develop a large number of classifiers to test contextual substitutions.
    For each word to be inserted into a reference sentence, we need to train a separate classifier.
    In practice, this requirement is not a significant burden.
    The training is done off-line and only once, and testing for contextual substitution is instantaneous.
    Moreover, the first filtering step effectively reduces the number of potential candidates.
    For example, to apply this approach to the 71,520 sentence pairs from the MT evaluation set (described in Section 4.1.2), we had to train 2,380 classifiers.
    We also discovered that the key to t
