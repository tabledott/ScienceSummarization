le 3 shows several things.
    First, it shows relative performance for unmodified, no punct, and C&amp;J corpora with the full set of conditioning information.
    We can see that removing the punctuation causes (unsurprisingly) a dramatic drop in the accuracy and efficiency of the parser.
    Interestingly, it also causes coverage to become nearly total, with failure on just two sentences per thousand on average.
    We see the familiar pattern, in the C&amp;J corpus results, of improving performance as the amount of conditioning information grows.
    In this case we have perplexity results as well, and Figure 7 shows the reduction in parser error, rule expansions, and perplexity as the amount of conditioning information grows.
    While all three seem to be similarly improved by the addition of structural context (e.g., parents and siblings), the addition of c-commanding heads has only a moderate effect on the parser accuracy, but a very large effect on the perplexity.
    The fact that the efficiency was
