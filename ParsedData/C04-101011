			For this purpose we define a number of features that can be used to define different models of parser state.
			Figure 2 illustrates the features that are used to define parser states in the present study.
			The two central elements in any configuration are the token on top of the stack (T) and the next input token(N), the tokens which may be connected by a de pendency arc in the next configuration.
			For these tokens, we consider both the word form (T.LEX, N.LEX) and the part-of-speech (T.POS, N.POS), as assigned by an automatic part-of-speech tagger ina preprocessing phase.
			Next, we consider a selection of dependencies that may be present in the cur rent arc relation, namely those linking T to its head (TH) and its leftmost and rightmost dependent (TL, TR), and that linking N to its leftmost dependent (NL),3 considering both the dependency type (arclabel) and the part-of-speech of the head or depen dent.
			Finally, we use a lookahead of three tokens, considering only their parts-of-speec
