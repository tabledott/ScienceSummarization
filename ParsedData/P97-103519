s A and B To illustrate the method for estimating.a performance function, we will use a subset of the data from Tables 3 and 4, shown in Table 5.
    Table 5 represents the results &amp;quot; We assume an additive performance (utility) function because it appears that K and the various cost factors ci are utility independent and additive independent (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976).
    It is possible however that user satisfaction data collected in future experiments (or other data such as willingness to pay or use) would indicate otherwise.
    If so, continuing use of an additive function might require a transformation of the data, a reworking of the model shown in Figure 1, or the inclusion of interaction terms in the model (Cohen, 1995). from a hypothetical experiment in which eight users were randomly assigned to communicate with Agent A and eight users were randomly assigned to communicate with Agent B.
    Table 5 shows user satisfaction (US) ratings (discussed below), is, number of utterances (#utt) and num
