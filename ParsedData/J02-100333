actors.
    During Phase 2, one property after another is rejected.
    For example, the property BUD is rejected because it does not remove any distractors.
    The first property that is true of all elements of S while also removing distractors is P U W. This property removes all distractors at once, causing the algorithm to end with L = {POODLE U WHITE} as the complete description.
    If we modify the example by letting [[BLACK]] = {a, c} (rather than {a, b, c}) and S = {b, c, d, e} (rather than S = {a, b, d, e}), then the description L = {BLACK U POODLE} is found.
    D&amp;RBoolean is incremental not only within a phase, but also from one phase to the next, which causes shorter disjunctions to be favored over longer ones.
    Once a property has been selected, it will not be abandoned even if properties selected during later phases make it logically superfluous.
    As a result, one may generate descriptions like X n (Y U Z) (e.g., white (cats and dogs)) in a situation where Y U Z (e.g., cats and dogs)
