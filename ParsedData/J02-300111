h explaining generalizations across verbs in the syntactic realization of their arguments, whereas the more specific roles have more often been proposed by computer scientists, who are more concerned with the details of the realization of the arguments of specific verbs.
    The FrameNet project (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998) proposes roles that are neither as general as the 10 abstract thematic roles, nor as specific as the thousands of potential verb-specific roles.
    FrameNet roles are defined for each semantic frame.
    A frame is a schematic representation of situations involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles (Fillmore 1976).
    For example, the frame CONVERSATION, shown in Figure 1, is invoked by the semantically related verbs argue, banter, debate, converse, and gossip, as well as the nouns dispute, discussion, and tiff, and is defined as follows: The roles defined for this frame, and shared by all its lexical entries, include PROTAGONIST-1 and PROTAGONIST-2 or simply PR
