    Thus, there are ai = (bk + 1)(ci + 1) possible subtrees headed by A@j.
    In our example tree of Figure 1, both noun phrases have exactly one subtree: npt = np2 = 1; the verb phrase has 2 subtrees: vp3 = 2; and the sentence has 6: si = 6.
    These numbers correspond to the number of subtrees in Figure 2.
    We will call a PCFG subderivation isomorphic to a STSG tree if the subderivation begins with an external non-terminal, uses internal nonterminals for intermediate steps, and ends with external non-terminals.
    For instance, consider the tree taken from Figure 2.
    The following PCFG subderivation is isomorphic: S = NPA1 VP&#169;2 PN PN VP@2 PN PN V NP.
    We say that a PCFG derivation is isomorphic to a STSG derivation if there is a corresponding PCFG subderivation for every step in the STSG derivation.
    We will give a simple small PCFG with the following surprising property: for every subtree in the training corpus headed by A, the grammar will generate an isomorphic subderivation with prob
