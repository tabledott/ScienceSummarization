 one of the tags positive, negative, both or neutral.
			By far, the majority of clues, 92.8%, aremarked as having either positive (33.1%) or nega tive (59.7%) prior polarity.
			Only a small number of clues (0.3%) are marked as having both positive and negative polarity.
			6.9% of the clues in the lexicon are marked as neutral.
			Examples of these are verbs such as feel, look, and think, and intensifiers such asdeeply, entirely, and practically.
			These words are included because, although their prior polarity is neu tral, they are good clues that a sentiment is beingexpressed (e.g., feels slighted, look forward to).
			In cluding them increases the coverage of the system.
