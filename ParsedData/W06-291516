models are capturing these things rather than &#8220;perspectives.&#8221; To test if the statistical models truly are learning perspectives, we conduct experiments in which the training and testing data are mismatched, i.e., from different subsets of the corpus.
    If what the SVM and naive Bayes models learn are writing styles or editing artifacts, the classification performance under the mismatched conditions will be considerably degraded.
    The results on the mismatched training and testing experiments are shown in Table 3.
    Both SVM and the two variants of naive Bayes perform well on the different combinations of training and testing data.
    As in Table 2, the naive Bayes models perform better than SVM with larger error reductions, and NB-B slightly outperforms NB-M.
    The high accuracy on the mismatched experiments suggests that statistical models are not learning writing styles or editing artifacts.
    This reaffirms that document perspective is reflected in the words that are chosen by the w
