a within the binding theory part of the theory of Government and Binding (Chomsky 1981), or for intersentential anaphora within the context of the Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle 1993).
    Unfortunately, these frameworks fail to uniquely determine anaphoric antecedents in a variety of cases.
    As a consequence, referentially ambiguous interpretations have to be dealt with in those cases in which several alternatives fulfill all the required syntactic and semantic constraints.
    It seems that syntactic and semantic criteria constitute only necessary but by no means sufficient conditions for identifying the valid antecedent among several possible candidates.
    Hence, one is left with a preferential choice problem that falls outside of the scope of those strict grammaticality constraints relating to the level of syntax or semantics only.
    Its solution requires considering patterns of language use and, thus, introduces the level of discourse context and further pragmatic factors as a com
