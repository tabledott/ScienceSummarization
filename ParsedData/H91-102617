ration, remove pairs of words from the training corpus that have already been selected so that other alternatives can be identified.
  We have completed four passes of this algorithm, and selected more than a thousand pairs on each iteration.
  Iteration Sample Size Number  of Pairs Selected 0 10,000 1223 1 30,000 1537 2 50,000 1692 3 220,000 1967 A few of the selected pairs are shown below.
  The first column indicates the iteration that the pair was selected on.
  The second column indicates the number of sentences (aligned regions) that the pair appears in.
  Note that the most frequent pairs are usually selected first, leaving less important pairs to be picked up on subsequent iterations.
  Thus, for example, accept/ accepter is selected before accept/accepte.
  Based on a sample of 1000 pairs, about 98% of the selected pairs of words are translations.
  Here, as elsewhere, we act to keep our errors of commission low.
