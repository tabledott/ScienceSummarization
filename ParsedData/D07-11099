opic will have similar meanings and thus share paths within WORDNET.
			For example, WORDNET has two senses for the word ?colt;?
			one referring to a young male horse and the other to a type of handgun (see Figure 1).Although we have no a priori way of know ing which of the two paths to favor for a document, we assume that similar concepts will also appear in the document.
			Documents with unambiguous nouns such as ?six-shooter?
			and ?smoothbore?
			would make paths that pass through the synset [firearm, piece,small-arm] more likely than those go ing through [animal, animate being, beast, brute, creature, fauna].
			In practice, we hope to see a WORDNET-WALK that looks like Figure 2, which points to the right sense of cancer for a medical context.LDAWN is a Bayesian framework, as each vari able has a prior distribution.
			In particular, the Dirichlet prior for ?s, specified by a scaling factor S and a normalized vector ?s fulfills two functions.
			First, as the overall strength of S increases, we place
