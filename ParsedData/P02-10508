roach, and the resulting linguistically informed projection improved significantly the ability to obtain accurate Chinese parses.
    This experimental framework for the first question is designed with art eye toward the second, concerning the usefulness of making the direct correspondence assumption.
    If the DCA holds true more often than not, then one might speculate that the projected syntactic structures could be useful as a treebank (albeit a noisy one) for training Chinese parsers, and could help more generally in overcoming the syntactic annotation bottleneck for languages other than English.
    The DCA translates fairly directly into art algorithm for projecting English dependency analyses across to Chinese using word alignments as the bridge.
    More formally, given sentence pair (F, F), the English syntactic relations are projected for the following situations: tvi,, tvn,, then create a new empty word mF E F such that mF is the parent of tvi,, tvn, and set WE to align to m F instead.
