rops on 5 pairs.
    This was achieved without any need for manual tuning for each language pair.
    The baseline model cost feature helps the algorithm effectively back off to the MAP translation in language pairs where MBR features alone would not have helped.
    MERT and MBR decoding are popular techniques for incorporating the final evaluation metric into the development of SMT systems.
    We believe that our efficient algorithms will make them more widely applicable in both SCFG-based and phrase-based MT systems.
