 the corresponding Wikipedia page, if any, for each mention.
    For example, given the input sentence &#8220;I am visiting friends in &lt;Chicago&gt;,&#8221; we output http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago &#8211; the Wikipedia page for the city of Chicago, Illinois, and not (for example) the page for the 2002 film of the same name.
    Local D2W approaches disambiguate each mention in a document separately, utilizing clues such as the textual similarity between the document and each candidate disambiguation&#8217;s Wikipedia page.
    Recent work on D2W has tended to focus on more sophisticated global approaches to the problem, in which all mentions in a document are disambiguated simultaneously to arrive at a coherent set of disambiguations (Cucerzan, 2007; Milne and Witten, 2008b; Han and Zhao, 2009).
    For example, if a mention of &#8220;Michael Jordan&#8221; refers to the computer scientist rather than the basketball player, then we would expect a mention of &#8220;Monte Carlo&#8221; in the same docume
