			TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al, 2003b; Boguraev et al., forthcoming) was originally conceived of as aproof of concept that illustrates the TimeML lan guage, but has since gone through several rounds of revisions and can now be considered a gold standard for temporal information.
			TimeML and TimeBank have already been used as the basis for automatic time, event and temporal relation annotation tasks in a number of research projects in recent years (Mani et al, 2006; Boguraev et al, forthcoming).An open evaluation challenge in the area of temporal annotation should serve to drive research forward, as it has in other areas of NLP.
			The automatic identification of all temporal referring expres sions, events and temporal relations within a text is the ultimate aim of research in this area.
