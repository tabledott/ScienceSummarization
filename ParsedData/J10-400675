those models from the Wiki that resort to other knowledge sources, such as WordNet or a thesaurus).
    The claims to follow about the relative performance of the models must be interpreted cautiously, in light of the spread of the confidence intervals: It suffices to note that, according to a Fisher test, the difference between the second-best model, GLSA, and the twelfth model, PMI-IR-01, is not significant at the &#945; = .05 level (p = 0.07).
    The difference between the bottom model, LSA-97, and random guessing is, on the other hand, highly significant (p &lt; .00001).
    The best DM model is again TypeDM, which also outperforms Turney&#8217;s unified PairClass approach (supervised, and relying on a much larger corpus), as well as his Web-statistics based PMI-IR-01 model.
    TypeDM does better than the best Pad&#180;o and Lapata model (DV-07), and comparably to our DV implementation.
    Its accuracy is more than 10% higher than the average human test taker and the classic LSA model (LSA-97).
