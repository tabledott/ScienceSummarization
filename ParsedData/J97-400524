 problem arises: 02 is not a probability distribution.
    Unlike in the context-free case, the four dags in Figure 7 constitute the entirety of L(G2).
    This time, there are no missing dags to account for the missing probability mass.
    There is an obvious &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot; for this problem: we can simply normalize (b2.
    We might define the distribution q for an AV grammar with weight function 0 as: In particular, for 02, we have Z = 2/9 + 1/18 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 7/9.
    Dividing 02 by 7/9 yields the ERF distribution: On the face of it, then, we can transplant the methods we used in the context-free case to the AV case and nothing goes wrong.
    The only problem that arises (.15 not summing to one) has an obvious fix (normalization).
    However, something has actually gone very wrong.
    The ERF method yields the best weights only under certain conditions that we inadvertently violated by changing L(G) and re-apportioning probability via normalization.
    In point of fact, we can easily see that
