    Figure 1).
    I do not assume any difference between the elements of each set with respect to their information status.
    E.g., evoked and unused discourse entities have the same information status because both belong to OLD.
    For an operationalization of Prince's terms, I stipulate that evoked discourse entitites are co-referring expressions (pronominal and nominal anaphora, previously mentioned proper names, relative pronouns, appositives).

    Anchored brand-new discourse entities require
