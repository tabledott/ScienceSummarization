 offset at which its extensions begin.
    Reading the following record&#8217;s offset indicates where the block ends.
    This technique was introduced by Clarkson and Rosenfeld (1997) and is also implemented by IRSTLM and BerkeleyLM&#8217;s compressed option.
    SRILM inefficiently stores 64-bit pointers.
    Unigram records store probability, backoff, and an index in the bigram table.
    Entries for 2 &lt; n &lt; N store a vocabulary identifier, probability, backoff, and an index into the n + 1-gram table.
    The highestorder N-gram array omits backoff and the index, since these are not applicable.
    Values in the trie are minimally sized at the bit level, improving memory consumption over trie implementations in SRILM, IRSTLM, and BerkeleyLM.
    Given n-gram counts {cn}Nn=1, we use Flog2 c1] bits per vocabulary identifier and Flog2 cn] per index into the table of ngrams.
    When SRILM estimates a model, it sometimes removes n-grams but not n + 1-grams that extend it to the left.
    In a model we b
