 data is an important issue for many bootstrapping learning methods (e.g.
    Yarowsky (1995), Riloff and Jones (1999)), suggesting that the rewards of understanding and dealing with this issue may be significant.
  
  
    Base noun phrases (base NPs) are traditionally defined as nonrecursive noun phrases, i.e.
    NPs that do not contain NPs.
    (Figure 2a illustrates base NPs with a short example.)
    Base noun phrase identification is the task of locating the base NPs in a sentence from the words of the sentence and their part-of-speech tags.
    Base noun phrase identification is a crucial component of systems that employ partial syntactic analysis, including information retrieval (e.g.
    Mitra et al. (1997)) and question answering (e.g.
    Cardie et al. (2000)) systems.
    Many corpus-based methods have been applied to the task, including statistical methods (e.g.
    Church (1988)), transformation-based learning (e.g.
    Ramshaw and Marcus (1998)), rote sequence learning (e.g.
    Cardie and Pie
