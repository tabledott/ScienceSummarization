 parallel sentence pairs can be automatically extracted from comparable corpora, and used to improve the performance of machine translation (MT) systems.
    This work addresses a major bottleneck in the development of Statistical MT (SMT) systems: the lack of sufficiently large parallel corpora for most language pairs.
    Since comparable corpora exist in large quantities and for many languages &#8211; tens of thousands of words of news describing the same events are produced daily &#8211; the ability to exploit them for parallel data acquisition is highly beneficial for the SMT field.
    Comparable corpora exhibit various degrees of parallelism.
    Fung and Cheung (2004a) describe corpora ranging from noisy parallel, to comparable, and finally to very non-parallel.
    Corpora from the last category contain &#8220;... disparate, very nonparallel bilingual documents that could either be on the same topic (on-topic) or not&#8221;.
    This is the kind of corpora that we are interested to exploit in the con
