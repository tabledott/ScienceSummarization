ges from 2 to 20.
    The results are shown in Table 2.
    As shown from the table, adding some labeled target instances can greatly improve the performance for all tasks.
    And in almost all cases, weighting the target instances more than the source instances performed better than weighting them equally.
    We also tested another setting where we first removed the &#8220;misleading&#8221; source examples as we showed in Section 4.2, and then added the labeled target instances.
    The results are shown in the last row of Table 2.
    However, although both removing &#8220;misleading&#8221; source instances and adding labeled target instances work well individually, when combined, the performance in most cases is not as good as when no source instances are removed.
    We hypothesize that this is because after we added some labeled target instances with large weights, we already gained a good balance between the source data and the target data.
    Further removing source instances would push the emphasis
