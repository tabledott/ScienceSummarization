re the only features that a joint model used, we would expect its performance to be roughly the same as the performance of a local model.
    This is because the two models will in fact be in the same parametric family but will only differ slightly in the way the parameters are estimated.
    In particular, the likelihood of an assignment according to the joint model with local features will differ from the likelihood of the same assignment according to the local model only in the denominator (the partition function).
    The joint model sums over a few likely assignments in the denominator, whereas the local model sums over all assignments; also, the joint model does not treat the decomposition into identification and classification models in exactly the same way as the local model.
    Whole Label Sequence Features.
    As observed in previous work (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Pradhan et al. 2004), including information about the set or sequence of labels assigned to argument nodes should be very helpful for
