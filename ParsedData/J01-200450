ability range of the best analysis, the more time will be spent working on these competitors; and the farther along in the sentence, the more chance for ambiguities that can lead to such a situation.
    While our observed times are not linear, and are clearly slower than his times (even with a faster machine), they are quite respectably fast.
    The differences between a k-best and a beam-search parser (not to mention the use of dynamic programming) make a running time difference unsurprising.
    What is perhaps surprising is that the difference is not greater.
    Furthermore, this is quite a large beam (see discussion below), so that very large improvements in efficiency can be had at the expense of the number of analyses that are retained.
    The next set of results will highlight what recommends this approach most: the ease with which one can estimate string probabilities in a single pass from left to right across the string.
    By definition, a PCFG's estimate of a string's probability is the sum of
