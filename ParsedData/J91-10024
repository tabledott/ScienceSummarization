is example is from Ventola (1987), who analyzed the patterns of lexical cohesion specific to the context of service encounters.)
    Another example of this type is {car, lights, turning}, taken from example 14 in Section 4.2.
    These words are related in the situation of driving a car, but taken out of that situation, they are not related in a systematic way.
    Also contained in the class of collocation are word associations.
    Examples from Postman and Keppel (1970) are {priest, church}, {citizen, U.S.A.}, and {whistle, stop}.
    Again, the exact relationship between these words can be hard to classify, but there does exist a recognizable relationship.
    Often, lexical cohesion occurs not simply between pairs of words but over a succession of a number of nearby related words spanning a topical unit of the text.
    These sequences of related words will be called lexical chains.
    There is a distance relation between each word in the chain, and the words co-occur within a given span.
