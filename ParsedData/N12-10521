    The ability to predict the linguistic structure of sentences or documents is central to the field of natural language processing (NLP).
    Structures such as named-entity tag sequences (Bikel et al., 1999) or sentiment relations (Pang and Lee, 2008) are inherently useful in data mining, information retrieval and other user-facing technologies.
    More fundamental structures such as part-of-speech tag sequences (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) or syntactic parse trees (Collins, 1997; K&#168;ubler et al., 2009), on the other hand, comprise the core linguistic analysis for many important downstream tasks such as machine translation (Chiang, * The majority of this work was performed while the author was an intern at Google, New York, NY.
    2005; Collins et al., 2005).
    Currently, supervised data-driven methods dominate the literature on linguistic structure prediction (Smith, 2011).
    Regrettably, the majority of studies on these methods have focused on evaluat
