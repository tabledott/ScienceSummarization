various syntactic consequences of metonymy and coercion involving experiencer verbs, while those in 35 show the different metonymic extensions possible from the causing event in a killing.
    The generalization here is that when a verb selects an event as one of its arguments, type coercion to an event will permit a limited range of logical metonymies.
    For example, in sentences 34(a,b,c,d,f,h), the entire event is directly referred to, while in 34(e,g) only a participant from the coerced event reading is directly expressed.
    Other examples of coercion include &amp;quot;concealed questions&amp;quot; 36 and &amp;quot;concealed exclamations&amp;quot; 37 (cf.
    Grimshaw 1979; Elliott 1974).
    That is, although the italicized phrases syntactically appear as NPs, their semantics is the same as if the verbs had selected an overt question or exclamation.
    In explaining the behavior of the systematic ambiguity above, I made reference to properties of the noun phrase that are not typical semantic propert
