TCM for the object slot of start in the transitive frame is displayed in figure 1.
    WordNet classes are displayed in boxes with a label which best reflects the sense of the class.
    The probability estimates are shown for the classes along the TCM.
    Examples of the argument head data are displayed below the WordNet classes with dotted lines indicating membership at a hyponym class beneath these classes.
    We assume that verbs which participate will show a higher degree of similarity between the preferences at the target slots compared with non-participating verbs.
    To compare the preferences we compare the probability distributions across WordNet using a measure of distributional similarity.
    Since the probability distributions may be at different levels of WordNet, we map the Tcms at the target slots to a common tree cut, a &amp;quot;base cut&amp;quot;.
    We experiment with two different types of base cut.
    The first is simply a base cut at the eleven root classes of WordNet.
    We refe
