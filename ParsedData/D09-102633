ause Labeled LDA is a graphical model in the LDA family, it enables a range of natural extensions for future investigation.
    For example, the current model does not capture correlations between labels, but such correlations might be introduced by composing Labeled LDA with newer state of the art topic models like the Correlated Topic Model (Blei and Lafferty, 2006) or the Pachinko Allocation Model (Li and McCallum, 2006).
    And with improved inference for unsupervised &#923;, Labeled LDA lends itself naturally to modeling semi-supervised corpora where labels are observed for only some documents.
