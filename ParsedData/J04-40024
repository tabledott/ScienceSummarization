ng better and better.
    An important factor in these improvements is definitely the availability of large amounts of data for training statistical models.
    Yet the modeling, training, and search methods have also improved since the field of statistical machine translation was pioneered by IBM in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Brown et al. 1990; Brown et al.
    1993; Berger et al. 1994).
    This article focuses on an important improvement, namely, the use of (generalized) phrases instead of just single words as the core elements of the statistical translation model.
    We describe in Section 2 the basics of our statistical translation model.
    We suggest the use of a log-linear model to incorporate the various knowledge sources into an overall translation system and to perform discriminative training of the free model parameters.
    This approach can be seen as a generalization of the originally suggested source&#8211;channel modeling framework for statistical machine translation.
    In Section 3,
