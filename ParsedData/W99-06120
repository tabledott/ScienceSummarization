  Language Independent Named Entity Recognition Combining Morphological And Contextual Evidence
  
    Identifying and classifying personal, geographic, institutional or other names in a text is an important task for numerous applications.
    This paper describes and evaluates a language-independent bootstrapping algorithm based on iterative learning and re-estimation of contextual and morphological patterns captured in hierarchically smoothed trie models.
    The algorithm learns from unannotated text and achieves competitive performance when trained on a very short labelled name list with no other required language-specific information, tokenizers or tools.
  
  
    The ability to determine the named entities in a text has been established as an important task for several natural language processing areas, including information retrieval, machine translation, information extraction and language understanding.
    For the 1995 Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6), a separate named entity recognition t
