erent runs, therefore the algorithm outputs different results after each run, even if the evaluation set is fixed, as is the case for the Senseval evaluation.
    The variance in the results on the SE3 data was measured in this way.
    The first sense baseline is the supersense of the most frequent synset for a word, according to Wordnet&#8217;s sense ranking.
    This baseline is very competitive in WSD tasks, and it is extremely hard to improve upon even slightly.
    In fact, the baseline has been proposed as a good alternative to WSD altogether (cf.
    (McCarthy et al., 2004)).
    For this reason we include the first sense prediction as one of the features of our tagging model.
    We apply the heuristic as follows.
    First, in each sentence, we identify the longest sequence which has an entry in Wordnet as either noun or verb.
    We carry out this step using the Wordnet&#8217;s library functions, which perform also morphological simplification.
    Hence, in Example 1 the entry &#8220;stand up&#822
