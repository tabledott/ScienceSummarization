 how words can co-occur in the same sentence.
    Often, the use of one word in a particular context of meaning will require the use of one or more other words in the same sentence.
    While phrasal lexicons, in which lexical associations are pre-encoded (e.g., [Kukich 83], [Jacobs 85], [Danlos 87]), allow for the treatment of certain types of collocations, they also have problems.
    Phrasal entries must be compiled by hand which is both expensive and incomplete.
    Furthermore, phrasal entries tend to capture rather rigid, idiomatic expressions.
    In contrast, collocations vary tremendously in the number of words involved, in the syntactic categories of the words, in the syntactic relations between the words, and in how rigidly the individual words are used together.
    For example, in some cases, the words of a collocation must be adjacent, while in others they can be separated by a varying number of other words.
    In this paper, we identify a range of collocations that are necessary for language g
