an ambiguous sentence.
    This approach is computationally feasible, however, only if condensation can be carried all the way through without unpacking.
    Our technology is not yet able to do this (in particular, as mentioned earlier, we have not yet implemented a method for stochastic disambiguation on packed f-structures).
    However, we conducted a preliminary assessment of this possibility by unpacking and enumerating the transferred fstructures.
    For many sentences this resulted in more candidates than we could operate on in the available time and space, and in those cases we arbitrarily set a cut-off on the number of transferred f-structures we considered.
    Since transferred f-structures are produced according to the number of rules applied to transfer them, in this setup the transfer system produces smaller f-structures first, and cuts off less condensed output.
    The result of this experiment, shown in Fig.
    6, thus provides a conservative estimate on the quality of the condensations we
