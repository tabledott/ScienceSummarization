increases nonlinearly with the length of a document.
    Unfortunately, some of the documents &#8211; especially ones in the broadcast conversation, weblogs, and telephone conversation genre &#8211; are very long which prohibited us from efficiently annotating them in entirety.
    These had to be split into smaller parts.
    We conducted a few passes to join some adjacent parts, but since some documents had as many as 17 parts, there are still multi-part documents in the corpus.
    Since the coreference chains are coherent only within each of these document parts, for this task, each such part is treated as a separate document.
    Another thing to note is that there were some cases of sub-token annotation in the corpus owing to the fact that tokens were not split at hyphens.
    Cases such as proWalMart had the sub-span WalMart linked with another instance of the same.
    The recent Treebank revision which split tokens at most hyphens, made a majority of these sub-token annotations go away.
