large number of sentences.
    However, the two approaches are also different in that Pang, Knight, and Marcu use the parse trees of all sentences in a cluster to compute the alignment (and build the lattice), whereas Barzilay and Lee use only surface level information.
    Furthermore, Barzilay and Lee can use their slotted lattice pairs to generate paraphrases for novel and unseen sentences, whereas Pang, Knight, and Marcu cannot paraphrase new sentences at all.
    Shen et al. (2006) attempt to improve Barzilay and Lee&#8217;s technique by trying to include syntactic constraints in the cluster alignment algorithm.
    In that way, it is doing something similar to what Pang, Knight, and Marcu do but with a comparable corpus instead of a parallel one.
    More precisely, whereas Barzilay and Lee use a relatively simple alignment scoring function based on purely lexical features, Shen et al. try to bring syntactic features into the mix.
    The motivation is to constrain the relatively free nature of the alig
