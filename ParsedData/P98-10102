complete parse tree for a sentence is difficult in many cases, and may not be necessary at all for identifying most instances of local syntactic patterns.
    An alternative approach is to avoid the complexity of full parsing and instead to rely only on local information.
    A variety of methods have been developed within this framework, known as shallow parsing, chunking, local parsing etc.
    (e.g., (Abney, 1991; Greffenstette, 1993)).
    These works have shown that it is possible to identify most instances of local syntactic patterns by rules that examine only the pattern itself and its nearby context.
    Often, the rules are applied to sentences that were tagged by partof-speech (POS) and are phrased by some form of regular expressions or finite state automata.
    Manual writing of local syntactic rules has become a common practice for many applications.
    However, writing rules is often tedious and time consuming.
    Furthermore, extending the rules to different languages or sub-language domains
