of events, or if the frames available for &amp;quot;i&amp;quot; are not the same as those for &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;.
    We are, in fact, making the latter assumption, on the grounds that the vowel &amp;quot;i&amp;quot; occurs only in the final position of Arabic verb stems.
    Consider, now, the forms in rows II and V of table I.
    In each of these, the middle consonant of the root is geminate in the surface.
    This is not a result of spreading as we have described it, because spreading only occurs with the last consonant of a root.
    If the prosodic template for row II is &amp;quot;CVCCVC&amp;quot;, how is that we do not get forms like &amp;quot;katbab&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;kutbib&amp;quot; beside the ones shown?
    This is a problem that is overcome in McCarthy's autosegmental account only at considerable cost.
    Indeed, is is a deficiency of that formalism that the only mechanisms available in it to account for gemination are as complex as they are, given how common the phenomenon is.
