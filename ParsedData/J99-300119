S, LJ), the preferred center Cp(DS, Lli), will most likely be the Cb(DS, U,+1).
    The most highly ranked element of Cf(DS, LJ) that is finally realized in Ui+i (i.e., is associated with an expression that has a valid interpretation in the underlying semantic representation) is the actual Cb(DS, U,&#177;1).
    Since in this paper we will not discuss the topics of global coherence and discourse macro segmentation (for recent treatments of these issues, see Hahn and Strube [1997] and Walker [1998]), we assume a priori that any centering data structure is assigned an utterance in a given discourse segment and simplify the notation of centers to Cb(U1) and Cf(L/i).
    Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) state that the items in the Cf list have to be ranked according to a number of factors including grammatical role, text position, and lexical semantics.
    As far as their discussion of concrete English discourse phenomena is concerned, they nevertheless restrict their ranking criteria to those solely based on
