    But automatic sense prediction for implicit relations is an outstanding challenge in discourse processing.
    Discourse relations, such as causal and contrast relations, are often marked by explicit discourse connectives (also called cue words) such as &#8220;because&#8221; or &#8220;but&#8221;.
    It is not uncommon, though, for a discourse relation to hold between two text spans without an explicit discourse connective, as the example below demonstrates: (1) The 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before.
    [because] It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics.
    In this paper we address the problem of automatic sense prediction for discourse relations in newspaper text.
    For our experiments, we use the Penn Discourse Treebank, the largest existing corpus of discourse annotations for both implicit and explicit relations.
    Our work is also informed by the long tradition of data intensive methods that rely on
