val scaled data version of K (Krippendorf, 1980).
    Another possibility is to simply substitute a domain-specific task-based success measure in the performance model for K. The evaluation model presented here has many applications in apoken dialogue processing.
    We believe that the framework is also applicable to other dialogue modalities, and to human-human task-oriented dialogues.
    In addition, while there are many proposals in the literature for algorithms for dialogue strategies that are cooperative, collaborative or helpful to the user (Webber and Joshi, 1982; Pollack, Hirschberg, and Webber, 1982; Joshi, Webber, and Weischedel, 1984; Chu-Carrol and Carberry, 1995), very few of these strategies have been evaluated as to whether they improve any measurable aspect of a dialogue interaction.
    As we have demonstrated here, any dialogue strategy can be evaluated, so it should be possible to show that a cooperative response, or other cooperative strategy, actually improves task performance by reduci
