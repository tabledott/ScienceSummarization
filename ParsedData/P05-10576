 from Model 6 proposed by Och and Ney (2003), which defines the alignment problem as finding the alignment a that maximizes Pr(f, a  |e) given e.
  
  
    In this paper, we use IBM translation Model 3 as the base feature of our log-linear models.
    In addition, we also make use of syntactic information such as part-of-speech tags and bilingual dictionaries.
    Brown et al. (1993) proposed a series of statistical models of the translation process.
    IBM translation models try to model the translation probability Pr(fJ1 |eI 1), which describes the relationship between a source language sentence eI1 and a target language sentence fJ1 .
    In statistical alignment models Pr(fJ1 , aJ1 |eI1), a &#8217;hidden&#8217; alignment a = aJ1 is introduced, which describes a mapping from a target position j to a source position i = aj.
    The relationship between the translation model and the alignment model is given by: Although IBM models are considered more coherent than heuristic models, they have two drawbacks.
