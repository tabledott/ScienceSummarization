ndwritten compositional inference rules, however, we hypothesize that an ideal solution to the expressionlevel polarity classification task will be a method that can exploit ideas from compositional semantics while providing the flexibility needed to handle the complexities of real-world natural language &#8212; exceptions, unknown words, missing semantic features, and inaccurate or missing rules.
    The learningbased approach proposed in this paper takes a first step in this direction.
    In addition to the novel learning approach, this paper presents new insights for content-word negators, which we define as content words that can negate the polarity of neighboring words or constituents.
    (e.g., words such as &#8220;eliminated&#8221; in the example sentences).
    Unlike function-word negators, such as &#8220;not&#8221; or &#8220;never&#8221;, content-word negators have been recognized and utilized less actively in previous work.
    (Notable exceptions include e.g., Niu et al. (2005), Wilson et al.
