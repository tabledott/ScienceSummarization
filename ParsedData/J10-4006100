ure), Location-At (pain&#8211;chest), Location-From (visitor&#8211;country), Frequency (superstition&#8211;occasional), Time-At (snack&#8211;midnight), and so on.
    The modifiers can be nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.
    Because the data set is not split into training and test data we follow Turney (2006b) and perform leave-one-out cross-validation.
    The data set also comes with a coarser five-way classification.
    Our unreported results on it are comparable, in terms of relative performance, to the ones for the 30-way classification.
    The last data set (OC) contains 1,443 noun&#8211;noun compounds classified by O&#180; S&#180;eaghdha and Copestake (2009) into 6 relations: Be (celebrity&#8211;winner), Have (door&#8211;latch), In (air&#8211;disaster), Actor (university&#8211;scholarship), Instrument (freight&#8211;train), and About (bank&#8211;panic); see O&#180; S&#180;eaghdha and Copestake (2009) and references there.
    We use the same five-way cross-validation splits as the data set proponents.
