ent described in the last section to obtain the training examples from the English side of the parallel texts.
    Due to the memory size limitation of our machine, we were not able to align all six parallel corpora of 280MB in one alignment run of GIZA++.
    For two of the corpora, Hong Kong Hansards and Xinhua News, we gathered all English sentences containing the 29 SENSEVAL-2 noun occurrences (and their sentence-aligned Chinese sentence counterparts).
    This subset, together with the complete corpora of Hong Kong News, Hong Kong Laws, English translation of Chinese Treebank, and Sinorama, is then given to GIZA++ to perform one word alignment run.
    It took about 40 hours on our 2.4 GHz machine with 2 GB memory to perform this alignment.
    After word alignment, each 3-sentence context in English containing an occurrence of the noun w that is aligned to a selected Chinese translation then forms a training example.
    For each SENSEVAL-2 noun w, we then collected training examples from the English si
