    Table 1 compares our system with previous approaches on the MUC-6 dataset, in MUC scores.
    Our approach greatly outperformed Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), the state-of-the-art unsupervised system.
    Our system, trained on individual documents, achieved an F1 score more than 7% higher than theirs trained on 60 documents, and still outperformed it trained on 381 documents.
    Training on the 30 test documents together resulted in a significant gain.
    (We also ran experiments using more documents, and the results were similar.)
    Better head identification (MLN-H) led to a large improvement in accuracy, which is expected since for mentions with a right modifier, the rightmost tokens confuse rather than help coreference (e.g., &#8220;the chairman of Microsoft&#8221;).
    Notice that with this improvement our system already outperforms a state-of-theart supervised system (McCallum &amp; Wellner, 2005).
