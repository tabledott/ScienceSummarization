arcs it can produce.
    Such constraints pose an explicit upper bound on parser accuracy.10 Our parsing model does not pose such restrictions.
    Shorter edges are arguably easier to predict, and our parses builds them early in time.
    However, it is also capable of producing long dependencies at later stages in the parsing process.
    Indeed, the distribution of arc lengths produced by our parser is similar to those produced by the MALT and MST parsers.
  
  
    We presented a non-directional deterministic dependency parsing algorithm, which is not restricted by the left-to-right parsing order of other deterministic parsers.
    Instead, it works in an easy-first order.
    This strategy allows using more context at each decision.
    The parser learns both what and when to connect.
    We show that this parsing algorithm significantly outperforms a left-to-right deterministic algorithm.
    While it still lags behind globally optimized parsing algorithms in terms of accuracy and root prediction, it is
