			3.3.1 Word SubstitutionWord substitution only happens on the termi nal nodes of the parse tree.
			In our model, the conditioning features include the original word and the substitution.
			The substitution for a word can be another word or a multi-word expression(see Tab.
			8).
			The probability of a word substitu tion operation can be calculated as P (sub|w) = SubFT (Substitution|Origin).
