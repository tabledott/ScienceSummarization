he rest of this section, we discuss two benefits of on-line parsing, quicker response time and early error detection.
    One obvious benefit of on-line parsing is that it reduces the parser's response time significantly.
    When the user finishes typing a whole sentence, most of the input sentence has been already processed by the parser.
    Although this does not affect CPU time, it could reduce response time from the user's point of view significantly.
    On-line parsing is therefore useful in interactive systems in which input sentences are typed in by the user on-line; it is not particularly useful in batch systems in which input sentences are provided in a file.
    Another benefit of on-line parsing is that it can detect an error almost as soon as the error occurs, and it can warn the user immediately.
    In this way, on-line parsing could provide better man-machine communication.
    Further studies on human factors are necessary.
