orthographical rules are applied.
    The MiMo2 system incorporates such a mechanism into the previous generation algorithm quite successfully.
    Experiments with particular grammars of Dutch, Spanish, and English have shown that the delay mechanism results in a generator that is faster by a factor of two or three on short sentences.
    Of course, the same mechanism could be added to any of the other generation techniques discussed in this paper; it is independent of the traversal order.
    The particular approach to delaying lexical choice found in the MiMo2 system relies on the structure of the system's morphological component as presented in Figure 6.
    The figure shows how inflectional rules, orthographical rules, morphology and syntax are related: orthographical rules are applied to the results of inflectional rules.
    These infectional rules are applied to the results of the morphological rules.
    The result of the orthographical part are then input for the syntax.
