consonantal We first translate this compact feature notation, well suited for expressing linguistic generalizations, into an equivalent but verbose notation that is mathematically more tractable.
    The first step is to represent explicitly the convention that features not mentioned in the input or output matrices are left unchanged in the segment that the rule applies to.
    We expand the input and output matrices with as many variables and features as necessary so that the value of every output feature is completely specified in the rule.
    The center-expanded version of this example is The input and output feature matrices are now fully specified, and in the contexts the value of any unmentioned feature can be freely chosen.
    A feature matrix in a regular expression is quite simple to interpret when it does not contain any feature variables.
    Such a matrix merely abbreviates the union of all segment symbols that share the specified features, and the matrix can be replaced by that set of unanalyza
