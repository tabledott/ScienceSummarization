, but from the fact that we have used 1,778,620 pairs of sentences covering virtually the complete vocabulary of the Hansard data for training, while they used only 40,000 pairs of sentences and restricted their attention to the 9,000 most common words in each of the two vocabularies.
    Figures 16, 17, and 18 show automatically derived alignments for three translations.
    In the terminology of Section 4.6, each alignment is b&amp;quot;(v(fle; 2)).
    We stress that these alignments have been found by an algorithm that involves no explicit knowledge of either French or English.
    Every fact adduced to support them has been discovered algorithmically from the 1, 778, 620 translations that constitute our training data.
    This data, in turn, is the product of an algorithm the sole linguistic input of which is a set of rules explaining how to find sentence boundaries in the two languages.
    We may justifiably claim, therefore, that these alignments are inherent in the Canadian Hansard data itself.
