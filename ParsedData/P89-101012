t;Doctor&amp;quot; Asymmetry in 1988 AP Corpus (N = 36 million) f(x,y) f(y, x) doctors nurses 81 10 man woman 209 42 doctors lawyers 25 16 bread butter 14 0 save life 106 8 save money 155 8 save from 144 16 supposed to 982 21 Secondly, one might expect f(x,y) _f(x) and f(x,y) f(Y), but the way we have been counting, this needn't be the case if x and y happen to appear several times in the window.
    For example, given the sentence, &amp;quot;Library workers were prohibited from saving books from this heap of ruins,&amp;quot; which appeared in an AP story on April 1, 1988, f(prohibited) = 1 and f(prohibited, front) = 2.
    This problem can be fixed by dividing f(x,y) by w &#8212; 1 (which has the consequence of subtracting log2(W &#8212; I) 2 from our association ratio scores).
    This adjustment has the additional benefit of assuring that f(x,y) = f(x) = f(y) = N. When 1(x ,y) is large, the association ratio produces very credible results not unlike those reported in [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)], as illust
