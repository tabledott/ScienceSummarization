formed much better than the baseline system in identifying topic and holder for both sets of sentences with verb target words and those with adjectives.
    Especially in recognizing topics of target opinion-bearing words, our system improved F-score from 30.4% to 66.5% for verb target words and from 38.2% to 70.3% for adjectives.
    It was interesting to see that the intuition that &#8220;A subject of opinionbearing verb is a holder and an object is a topic&#8221; which we applied for the baseline achieved relatively good F-score (56.9%).
    However, our system obtained much higher F-score (78.7%).
    Holder identification task achieved higher Fscore than topic identification which implies that identifying topics of opinion is a harder task.
    We believe that there are many complicated semantic relations between opinion-bearing words and their holders and topics that simple relations such as subject and object relations are not able to capture.
    For example, in a sentence &#8220;Her letter upset me&#
