  The senses in CIDE are grouped by guidewords, similar to homographs in LDOCE.
    It was produced using a large corpus of English created by the Cambridge Language Survey (CLS).
    The CLS also produced a semantic tagger (Harley and Glennon 1997), a commercial product that tags words in text with senses from their MRD.
    The tagger consists of four sub-taggers running in parallel, with their results being combined after all have run.
    The first tagger uses collocations derived from the CIDE example sentences.
    The second examines the subject codes for all words in a particular sentence and the number of matches with other words is calculated.
    A part-of-speech tagger produced in-house by CUP is run over the text and high scores are assigned to senses that agree with the syntactic tag assigned.
    Finally, the selectional restrictions of verbs and adjectives are examined.
    The results of these processes are combined using a simple weighting scheme (similar to McRoy's; see Section 2.1).
