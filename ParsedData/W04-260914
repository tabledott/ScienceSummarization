 time, one instance was tagged with one semantic relation, but there were also situations in which an example could belong to more than one relation in the same context.
    For example, the genitive &#8220;city of USA&#8221; was tagged as a PART-WHOLE/PLACE-AREA relation and as a LOCATION relation.
    Overall, there were 608 such cases in the training corpora.
    Moreover, the annotators were asked to indicate if the instance was lexicalized or not.
    Also, the judges tagged the NP nouns in the training corpus with their corresponding WordNet senses.
    The annotators&#8217; agreement was measured using the Kappa statistics, one of the most frequently used measure of inter-annotator agreement for classification tasks: , where is the proportion of times the raters agree and is the probability of agreement by chance.
    The K coefficient is 1 if there is a total agreement among the annotators, and 0 if there is no agreement other than that expected to occur by chance.
