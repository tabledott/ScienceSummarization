surrounding words decide which concept associated to Wi has more relevance.
    Contrary to the other two approaches, Ppr w2w does not disambiguate all target words of the context in a single run, which makes it less efficient (cf.
    Section 7).
  
  
    In this paper we will use two datasets for comparing graph-based WSD methods, namely, the Senseval-2 (S2AW) and Senseval-3 (S3AW) all words datasets (Snyder and Palmer, 2004; Palmer et al., 2001), which are both labeled with WordNet 1.7 tags.
    We did not use the Semeval dataset, for the sake of comparing our results to related work, none of which used Semeval data.
    Table 1 shows the results as recall of the graph-based WSD system over these datasets on the different LKBs.
    We detail overall results, as well as results per PoS, and the confidence interval for the overall results.
    The interval was computed using bootstrap resampling with 95% confidence.
    The table shows that Ppr w2w is consistently the best method in both datasets and for al
