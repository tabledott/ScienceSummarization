the case that a noun phrase followed the particle candidate, we performed attachment disambiguation to determine the transitivity of the particle candidate.
    These three methods produced three distinct sets of verb-particle tokens, which we carried out weighted voting over to determine the final set of verb-particle tokens.
    A total of 461 verb-particles attested in WordNet were extracted (160,765 tokens).
    For both the NN compound and verb-particle data, we replaced each token occurrence with a single-word POS-tagged token to feed into the LSA model.
  
  
    In order to evaluate our approach, we employed the lexical relations as defined in the WordNet lexical hierarchy (Miller et al., 1990).
    WordNet groups words into sets with similar meaning (known as &#8220;synsets&#8221;), e.g.
    {car, auto, automobile, machine, motorcar } .
    These are organised into a hierarchy employing multiple inheritance.
    The hierarchy is structured according to different principles for each of nouns, verbs, a
