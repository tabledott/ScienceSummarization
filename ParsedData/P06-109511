n infer relation(A, C) = BEFORE Once the TLINKs in each document in the corpus are closed using SputLink, the same vector generation procedure and feature representation described in Section 3.1 are used.
    The effect of closing the TLINKs on the corpus has a dramatic impact on learning.
    Table 2, in the CLOSED (ME-C) column shows that accuracies for this method (called ME-C, for Maximum Entropy learning with closure) are now in the high 80&#8217;s and low 90&#8217;s, and still outperform the closed majority class (shown in parentheses).
    What is the reason for the improvement?5 One reason is the dramatic increase in the amount of training data.
    The more connected the initial un5Interestingly, performance does not improve for SIMULTANEOUS.
    The reason for this might be due to the relatively modest increase in SIMULTANEOUS relations from applying closure (roughly factor of 2). closed graph for a document is in TLINKs, the greater the impact in terms of closure.
    When the OTC is closed, the nu
