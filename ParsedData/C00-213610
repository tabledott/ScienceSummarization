  The parser is used ibr reducing each clause or noun phrase to a tuple, consisting of the central ar- guments, ms described in detail in (Yangarber et al., 2000).
  We used a corlms of 9,224 articles from the Wall Street; Journal.
  The parsed arti- cles yielded a total of 440,000 clausal tuples, of which 215,000 were distinct.
  3.2 Normal izat ion We applied a name recognition module prior to parsing, and replaced each name with a token describing its (:lass, e.g.
  C-Person, C-Company, etc.
  We collapsed together all numeric expres- sions, currency wflues, dates, etc., using a single token to designate ach of these classes.
  Lastly, the parser performed syntactic normalization to transtbrm such variants ms the various passive and relative clauses into a common tbrm.
  3.3 General izat ion and Concept Classes Because tuples may not repeat with sufficient frequency to obtain reliable stati
