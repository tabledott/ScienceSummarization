allows tentative conclusions when 0.67 &lt; K &lt; 0.8 and definite conclusions when K &#8805; 0.8.
    Krippendorff&#8217;s scale has been adopted without question, even though Krippendorff himself considers it only a plausible standard that has emerged from his and his colleagues&#8217; work.
    In fact, Carletta et al. (1997) use words of caution against adopting Krippendorff&#8217;s suggestion as a standard; the first author has also raised the issue of how to assess K values in Di Eugenio (2000).
    If Krippendorff&#8217;s scale is supposed to be our standard, the example just worked out shows that the different computations of P(E) do affect the assessment of intercoder agreement.
    If less-strict scales are adopted, the discrepancies between the two K computations play a larger role, as they have a larger effect on smaller values of K. For example, Rietveld and van Hout (1993) consider 0.20 &lt; K &lt; 0.40 as indicating fair agreement, and 0.40 &lt; K &lt; 0.60 as indicating moderate agreement.
