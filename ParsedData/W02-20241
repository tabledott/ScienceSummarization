    The organizers of the shared task were especially interested in approaches that make use of additional nonannotated data for improving their performance.
  
  
    The CoNLL-2002 named entity data consists of six files covering two languages: Spanish and Dutch'.
    Each of the languages has a training file, a development file and a test file.
    The learning methods will be trained with the training data.
    The development data can be used for tuning the parameters of the learning methods.
    When the best parameters are found, the method can be trained on the training data and tested on the test data.
    The results of the different learning methods on the test sets will be compared in the evaluation of the shared task.
    The split between development data and test data has been chosen to avoid that systems are being tuned to the test data.
    All data files contain one word per line with empty lines representing sentence boundaries.
    Additionally each line contains a tag which
