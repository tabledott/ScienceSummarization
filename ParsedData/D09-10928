 of direct translations.
    In this case, we can be confident that the topic distribution is genuinely shared across all languages.
    Although direct translations in multiple languages are relatively rare (in contrast with comparable documents), we use direct translations to explore the characteristics of the model.
    The EuroParl corpus consists of parallel texts in eleven western European languages: Danish, German, Greek, English, Spanish, Finnish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese and Swedish.
    These texts consist of roughly a decade of proceedings of the European parliament.
    For our purposes we use alignments at the speech level rather than the sentence level, as in many translation tasks using this corpus.
    We also remove the twenty-five most frequent word types for efficiency reasons.
    The remaining collection consists of over 121 million words.
    Details by language are shown in Table 1.
