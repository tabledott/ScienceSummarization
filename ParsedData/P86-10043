    The PROTEUS/PUNDIT system will map Navy CASREP's (equipment casualty reports) into a database, which is accessed by an expert system to determine overall fleet readiness.
    PUNDIT has also been applied to the domain of computer maintenance reports, which is discussed here.
    The paper focuses on the interaction between the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic modules that is required for the task of making implicit information explicit.
    We have isolated two types of implicit entities: syntactic entities which are missing syntactic constituents, and semantic entities which are unfilled semantic roles.
    Some missing entities are optional, and can be ignored.
    Syntax and semantics have to recognize the OBLIGATORY missing entities and then mark them so that reference resolution knows to find specific referents for those entities, thus making the implicit information explicit.
    Reference resolution uses two different methods for filling th
