evaluated.
    The phrase extraction heuristic used to compute NP and NM from the respective alignments is the same as that employed by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) and illustrated in Figure 8.
    Although using alignments as the basis for computing precision and recall is a clever trick, it does require that the paraphrase generation method be capable of producing alignments between sentence pairs.
    For example, the methods proposed by Pang, Knight, and Marcu (2003) and Quirk, Brockett, and Dolan (2004) for generating sentential paraphrases from monolingual parallel corpora and described in Section 3.3 do produce alignments as part of their respective algorithms.
    Indeed, Callison-Burch et al. provide a comparison of their pivot-based approach&#8212;operating on bilingual parallel corpora&#8212;with the two monolingual approaches just mentioned in terms of ParaMetric, since all three methods are capable of producing alignments.
    However, for other approaches that do not necessarily operate at
