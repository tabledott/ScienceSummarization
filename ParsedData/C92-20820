  Automatic Acquisition of Hyponyms ~om Large Text Corpora Mart i  A. Hearst Computer  Science Division, 571 Evans Hall Un ivers i ty  of Cal i fornia,  Berkeley Berkeley,  CA 94720 and Xerox Palo A l to  Research Center mart i~cs ,  berkeley, edu Abst rac t We describe a method for the automatic acquisition of the hyponymy lexical relation from unrestricted text.
  Two goals motivate the approach: (i) avoid- ance of the need for pre-encoded knowledge and (ii) applicability across a wide range of text.
  We identify a set of lexico-syntactic patterns that are easily rec- ognizable, that occur iYequently and across text genre boundaries, and that indisputably indicate the lexical relation of interest.
  We describe a method for discov- ering these patterns and suggest hat other lexical relations will also be acquirable in this way.
  A subset of the acquisition algorithm is implemented and the results are used to attgment and critique the struc- ture of a large hand-built hesaurus.
