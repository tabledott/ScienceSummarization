 and sentential now emerged when we examined the surface position of now within its intermediate phrase.
    As Table 2 illustrates, 62 of the 63 discourse nows (98.4%) were first-in-phrase, absolutely first or followed only another cue phrase in their intermediate phrase; of these, 59 (95.2%) were also absolutely first in their intonational phrase; that is, first in major prosodic phrase and not preceded by any other cue phrases.
    Only five (13.5%) sentential tokens were first-in-phrase.

    Finally, discourse and sentential occurrences were distinguishable in terms of presence or absence of pitch accent&#8212;and by type of pitch accent, where accented.
    Because of the large number of possible accent types, and since there are competing reasons to acc
