th the null parser transition and thus prepared for scanning a new word.
    The conditional perplexity calculated by assigning to a whole sentence the probability: where T* = argmaxTP(W,T), is not valid because it is not causal: when predicting wk+i we use T* which was determined by looking at the entire sentence.
    To be able to compare the perplexity of our model with that resulting from the standard trigram approach, we need to factor in the entropy of guessing the correct parse I': before predicting wk+i, based solely on the word prefix Wk.
    The probability assignment for the word at position k + 1 in the input sentence is made using: which ensures a proper probability over strings W*, where Sk is the set of all parses present in our stacks at the current stage k. Another possibility for evaluating the word level perplexity of our model is to approximate the probability of a whole sentence: where T(k) is one of the &amp;quot;N-best&amp;quot; &#8212; in the sense defined by our search &#8212; parses
