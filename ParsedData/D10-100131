    We now give an example of a point (&#181;, v) E 20\conv(2) that demonstrates that the relaxation 20 is strictly larger than conv(2).
    Fractional points such as this one can arise as solutions of the LP relaxation for worst case instances, preventing us from finding an exact solution.
    Recall that the constraints for 20 specify that &#181; E conv(Y), v E conv(i), and &#181;(i, t) = v(i, t) for all (i, t) E Zuni.
    Since &#181; E conv(Y), &#181; must be a convex combination of 1 or more members of Y; a similar property holds for v. The example is as follows.
    There are two possible parts of speech, A and B, and an additional non-terminal symbol X.
    The sentence is of length 3, w1 w2 w3.
    Let v be the convex combination of the following two tag sequences, each with probability 0.5: w1/A w2/A w3/A and w1/A w2/B w3/B.
    Let &#181; be the convex combination of the following two parses, each with probability 0.5: (X(A w1)(X(A w2)(B w3))) and (X(A w1)(X(B w2)(A w3))
