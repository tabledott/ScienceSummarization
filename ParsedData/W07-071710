    The weight dc is defined as the distance to component c. For all experiments described below, we used a probability difference threshold of 0.001 as the EM convergence criterion.
    Our focus in this paper is on adaptation via mixture weights.
    However, we note that the usual loglinear parameter tuning described in section 2 can also be considered adaptation in the cross-domain setting, because learned preferences for word penalty, relative LM/TM weighting, etc, will reflect the target domain.
    This is not the case for dynamic adaptation, where, in the absence of an in-domain development corpus, the only information we can hope to glean are the weights on adapted models compared to other features of the system.
    The method used for adapting mixture weights depends on both the combining framework (loglinear versus linear), and the adaptive setting (crossdomain versus dynamic), as described below.
    When using a loglinear combining framework as described in section 3.3, mixture weights are se
