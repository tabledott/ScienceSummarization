    There are two obvious ways to optimise a pair of numbers such as precision and recall.
    The first is to use an arithmetic mean, which optimises the sum of the numbers, and the second is to use a harmonic mean2, which optimises the product of the numbers.
    In an attempt to retain generality, we can allow both alternatives by computing an arithmetic mean of the harmonic mean and the arithmetic mean, noting that the relative importance of each term in an arithmetic mean is controlled by weights (which sum to 1): where both and -y lie in the range [0,1].
    The resulting similarity sim(A,B) will also lie in the range [0,1] where 0 represents complete lack of similarity and 1 represents equivalence.
    This formula can be used in combination with any of the models for precision and recall outlined above.
    Further, the generality allows us to investigate empirically the relative significance of the different terms and thus whether one (or more) might be omitted in future work.
