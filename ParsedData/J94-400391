available language pairs in several commercial machine translation systems).
    If a parser for the target language corpus is not available, it is possible to approximate the statistics using word co-occurrence in a window, as was demonstrated by a variant of our method (Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993) (see Section 5.1).
    In both cases, the statistical model was shown to handle successfully the noise produced in automatic acquisition of the data.
    Substantial effort may be required for collecting a sufficiently large target language corpus.
    We have not studied the relation between the corpus size and the performance of the algorithm, but it is our impression that a corpus of several hundred thousand words will prove useful for translation in a well-defined domain.
    With current availability of texts in electronic form,' a corpus of this size is feasible in many domains.
    The effort of assembling this corpus should be compared with the effort of manually coding sense disambiguation informa
