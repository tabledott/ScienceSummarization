s information is manually annotated (i.e. the LLL challenge).
  
  
    The problem considered here is that of identifying interactions between genes and proteins from biomedical literature.
    More specifically, we performed experiments on two slightly different benchmark data sets (see Section 4 for a detailed description).
    In the former (AImed) gene/protein interactions are annotated without distinguishing the type and roles of the two interacting entities.
    The latter (LLL challenge) is more realistic (and complex) because it also aims at identifying the roles played by the interacting entities (agent and target).
    For example, in Figure 1 three entities are mentioned and two of the six ordered pairs of GENIA/topics/Corpus/GTB.html entities actually interact: (sigma(K), cwlH) and (gerE, cwlH).
    In our approach we cast relation extraction as a classification problem, in which examples are generated from sentences as follows.
    First of all, we describe the complex case, namely the protein/g
