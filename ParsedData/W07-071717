   We speculate that this disappointing result is due to compromises made in order to run Downhill Simplex efficiently, including holding global weights fixed, using only a single starting point, and running with monotone decoding. tion on the NIST04-nw development set. formance of cross domain adaptation (reproduced from table 5 on the second line) is slightly better for the in-domain test set (NIST05), but worse than dynamic adaptation on the two mixed-domain sets.
    Table 5 shows results for cross-domain adaptation, using the source-side EM metric for linear weighting.
    Both LM and TM adaptation are effective, with test-set improvements of approximately 1 BLEU point over the baseline for LM adaptation and somewhat less for TM adaptation.
    Performance also improves on the NIST06 out-of-domain test set (although this set includes a newswire portion as well).
    However, combined LM and TM adaptation is not better than LM adaptation on its own, indicating that the individual adapted models may be cap
