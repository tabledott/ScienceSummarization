enerally more costly than grouping them.
    In (2a), we want to split the two morphemes since the correct analysis is that we have the adverb 4- cai2 'just,' the modal verb it neng2 'be able' and the main verb A III ke4-fu2 'overcome'; the competing analysis is, of course, that we have the noun Tit cai2-neng2 'talent,' followed by AAR ke4-fu2 'overcome.'
    Clearly it is possible to write a rule that states that if an analysis Modal + Verb is available, then that is to be preferred over Noun + Verb: such a rule could be stated in terms of (finite-state) local grammars in the sense of Mohri (1993).
    Turning now to (1), we have the similar problem that splitting )5Wil into X% ma3 'horse' and 1u4 'way' is more costly than retaining this as one word )5M ma3-1u4 'road.'
    However, there is again local grammatical information that should favor the split in the case of (la): both )5 ma3 'horse' and AM ma3for horses.'
    By a similar argument, the preference for not splitting ,Egm could be strengthened in (1b
