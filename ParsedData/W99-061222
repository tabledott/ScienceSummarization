from &amp;quot;questionable&amp;quot;).
    In the case of semi-dominants, the data ordering in the training file does influence the learning procedure.
    The more conservative strategy of using dominants rather then semi-dominants has, on the other hand, the disadvantage of cancelling or postponing the utilisation of many words.
    For example, if both &amp;quot;questionable&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;first name&amp;quot; have 49% of the mass then subsequent reestimation iterations are not initiated for this data, even though the alternative name classes are very unlikely.
    Considering those advantages and disadvantages, we used the less conservative semi-dominant approach as the default model.
    In this stage the text is re-analysed sequentially, and for each token (given a start-end point pair) a decision is made.
    Here the bipartite structure of the two pairs of tries has a central role: during stage 2, the left context and prefix tries interact with each other and so do the right context and suff
