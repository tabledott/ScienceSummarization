n our case, objective sentences).
    A set of syntactic templates represents the space of possible extraction patterns.
    The learning process has two steps.
    First, the syntactic templates are applied to the training corpus in an exhaustive fashion, so that extraction patterns are generated for (literally) every possible instantiation of the templates that appears in the corpus.
    The left column of Figure 2 shows the syntactic templates used by AutoSlog-TS.
    The right column shows a specific extraction pattern that was learned during our subjectivity experiments as an instantiation of the syntactic form on the left.
    For example, the pattern &lt;subj&gt; was satisfied' will match any sentence where the verb satisfied appears in the passive voice.
    The pattern &lt;subj&gt; dealt blow represents a more complex expression that will match any sentence that contains a verb phrase with head=dealt followed by a direct object with head=blow.
    This would match sentences such as &#8220;The experie
