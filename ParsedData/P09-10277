slingual sentiment classification of Chinese product reviews by developing novel approaches.
    Cross-domain text classification can be considered as a more general task than cross-lingual sentiment classification.
    In the problem of crossdomain text classification, the labeled and unlabeled data come from different domains, and their underlying distributions are often different from each other, which violates the basic assumption of traditional classification learning.
    To date, many semi-supervised learning algorithms have been developed for addressing the cross-domain text classification problem by transferring knowledge across domains, including Transductive SVM (Joachims, 1999), EM(Nigam et al., 2000), EM-based Na&#239;ve Bayes classifier (Dai et al., 2007a), Topic-bridged PLSA (Xue et al., 2008), Co-Clustering based classification (Dai et al., 2007b), two-stage approach (Jiang and Zhai, 2007).
    Daum&#233;III and Marcu (2006) introduce a statistical formulation of this problem in terms of a sim
