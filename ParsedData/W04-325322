lations aspect of the present research only scratches the surface of what should be possible.
    There is still considerable room for improvement in performance.
    The present models may also be further expanded with features representing other information sources, which may include other types of semantic annotation (Wiebe, 2002), or features based on more sophisticated grammatical or dependency relations or on zone information.
    In any case, it is hoped that the present work may help to indicate how various information sources pertinent to the task may be brought together.
  
  
    The method introduced in this paper allows several methods of assigning semantic values to phrases and words within a text to be exploited in a more useful way than was previously possible, by incorporating them as features for SVM modeling, and for explicit topic information to be utilized, when available, by features incorporating such values.
    Combinations of SVMs using these features in conjunction with SVMs based o
