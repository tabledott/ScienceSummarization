istance, or Kendall&#8217;s &#964; (see Lebanon and Lafferty 2002 for details).
    Kendall&#8217;s &#964; is based on the number of inversions in the rankings and is defined in (6): where N is the number of objects (i.e., sentences) being ranked and inversions are the number of interchanges of consecutive elements necessary to arrange them in their natural order.
    If we think in terms of permutations, then i can be interpreted as the minimum number of adjacent transpositions needed to bring one order to the other.
    In Table 2 the number of inversions can be calculated by counting the number of intersections of the lines.
    The metric ranges from &#8722;1 (inverse ranks) to 1 (identical ranks).
    The i for Model 1 and Model 2 in Table 2 is .822.
    Kendall&#8217;s i seems particularly appropriate for the tasks considered in this paper.
    The metric is sensitive to the fact that some sentences may be always ordered next to each other even though their absolute orders might differ.
