 highly.
    We now go on to describe a new algorithm which implements this approach.
  
  
    For these experiments extraction patterns consist of predicate-argument structures, as proposed by Yangarber (2003).
    Under this scheme patterns consist of triples representing the subject, verb and object (SVO) of a clause.
    The first element is the &#8220;semantic&#8221; subject (or agent), for example &#8220;John&#8221; is a clausal subject in each of these sentences &#8220;John hit Bill&#8221;, &#8220;Bill was hit by John&#8221;, &#8220;Mary saw John hit Bill&#8221;, and &#8220;John is a bully&#8221;.
    The second element is the verb in the clause and the third the object (patient) or predicate.
    &#8220;Bill&#8221; is a clausal object in the first three example sentences and &#8220;bully&#8221; in the final one.
    When a verb is being used intransitively, the pattern for that clause is restricted to only the first pair of elements.
    The filler of each pattern element can be either a lexical item
