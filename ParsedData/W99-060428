bmobil project other translation modules based on rule-based, examplebased and dialogue-act-based translation are used.
    We are not able to present results with these methods using our test corpus.
    But in the current Verbmobil prototype the preliminary evaluations show that the statistical methods produce comparable or better results than the other systems.
    An advantage of the system is that it is robust and always produces a translation result even if the input of the speech recognizer is quite incorrect.
  
  
    We have described two approaches to perform statistical machine translation which extend the baseline alignment models.
    The single-word based approach allows for the the possibility of one-to-many alignments.
    The alignment template approach uses two different alignment levels: a phrase level alignment between phrases and a word level alignment between single words.
    As a result the context of words has a greater influence and the changes in word order from source to target la
