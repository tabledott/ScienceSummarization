th of a particular cue depends on its type and on the degree to which the expectations underlying it are satisfied.
    For cues that are polar &#8212; for example, a sense is either low or high frequency &#8212; a value must be chosen experimentally, depending on the strength of the cue compared with others.
    For example, the system assigns frequency information (the primary-secondary distinction) a score close to zero because this information tends to be significant only when other preferences are inconclusive.
    For cues that have an inherent extent -- for example, the conceptual category specified by a role preference subsumes a set of elements that can be counted &#8212; the cue strength is a function of the magnitude of the extent, that is, its specificity.
    TRUMP's specificity function maps the number of elements subsumed by the concept onto the range 0 to +10.
    The function assigns concepts with few members a high value and concepts with many members a low value.
    For example, the concep
