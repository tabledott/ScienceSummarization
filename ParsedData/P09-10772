huge amounts of unannotated text rather than on manually tagged corpora (Marcu and Echihabi, 2001; Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2007).
    In our analysis, we focus only on implicit discourse relations and clearly separate these from explicits.
    Explicit relations are easy to identify.
    The most general senses (comparison, contingency, temporal and expansion) can be disambiguated in explicit relations with 93% accuracy based solely on the discourse connective used to signal the relation (Pitler et al., 2008).
    So reporting results on explicit and implicit relations separately will allow for clearer tracking of progress.
    In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of various features designed to capture lexical and semantic regularities for identifying the sense of implicit relations.
    Given two text spans, previous work has used the cross-product of the words in the spans as features.
    We examine the most informative word pair features and find that they are not the semantically-related pair
