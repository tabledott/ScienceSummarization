 bit between the trigram model and Shannon's bound, but thus far, parsing has had little impact.
    Lan i and Young (1991; p. 255), for example, conducted a number of experiments with stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), and concluded that &amp;quot;Mlle experiments on word recognition showed that although SCFGs are effective, their complex training routine prohibits them from directly replacing the simpler HMM-based recognizers.&amp;quot; They then proceeded to argue, quite sensibly, that parsers are probably more appropriate for tasks where phrase structure is more directly relevant than in word recognition.
    In general, phrase structure is probably more important for understanding who did what to whom, than recognizing what was said.'
    Some tasks are probably more appropriate for Chomsky's rational approach to language and other tasks are probably more appropriate for Shannon's empirical approach to language.
    Table 6 summarizes some of the differences between the two approaches.
