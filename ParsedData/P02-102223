 example of text in various languages displayed by GATE.
    The ability to handle Unicode data, along with the separation between data and implementation, allows LE systems based on GATE to be ported to new languages with no additional overhead apart from the development of the resources needed for the specific language.
    These facilities have been developed as part of the EMILLE project (McEnery et al., 2000), which focuses on the construction a 63 million word electronic corpus of South Asian languages.
  
  
    One of GATE's strengths is that it is flexible and robust enough to enable the development of a wide range of applications within its framework.
    In this section, we describe briefly some of the NLP applications we have developed using the GATE architecture.
    The MUSE system (Maynard et al., 2001) is a multi-purpose Named Entity recognition system which is capable of processing texts from widely different domains and genres, thereby aiming to reduce the need for costly and time-consuming
