,fJ1) = Pr(&#65533;5K1|T&#65533;1K) because ei is actually generated by the derivation of &#65533;5K1 .
    Note that we omit an explicit dependence on the detachment D to avoid notational overhead.
    3The notational convention will be as follows.
    We use the symbol Pr(&#183;) to denote general probability distribution with no specific assumptions.
    In contrast, for model-based probability distributions, we use generic symbol p(&#183;).
    To further decompose Pr(&#732;S |T&#732;), the tree-tostring alignment template, denoted by the variable z, is introduced as a hidden variable.
    &#8658; X3 X4 of China &#8658; economic X4 of China &#8658; economic development of China Following Och and Ney (2002), we base our model on log-linear framework.
    Hence, all knowledge sources are described as feature functions that include the given source string fJ1 , the target string eI1, and hidden variables.
    The hidden variable T(fJ1 ) is omitted because we usually make use of only single best output of a p
