largest number of cases not classified are bridging descriptions.
    By contrast, the largest number of cases not classified by the system in Corpus 2 are discourse-new.
    Summary of the results for test data.
    As discussed in Section 5.4, the results of the heuristics for bridging descriptions presented in Section 4.3 were not very good.
    We nevertheless included these heuristics in Version 2 of the system, which, as discussed above, applied them to those descriptions that failed to be recognized as direct anaphora or discourse-new.
    The heuristics were applied in the following order:
  
  
    Training Data.
    The manual evaluation of the results of Version 2 on the training data is presented in Table 20.
    The table lists the number of acceptable anchors and the number of false positives found by each heuristic.
    Note that the system sometimes finds anchors that are not those identified manually, but are nevertheless acceptable.
    We found fewer bridging relations than the number we ob
