t later grade levels.
    Earlier researchers (e.g.
    Chall, 1983, p. 63) have also observed that concrete words like &#8216;red&#8217; become less likely in higher grades.
    Similarly, higher grade levels use more abstract words with increased frequency.
    We observed both types of behavior in our Web corpus.
    Figure 1 shows four words drawn from our corpus.
    Data from each of the 12 grades in the corpus are shown, ordered by ascending grade level.
    The solid line is a smoothed version of the word frequency data.
    The word &#8216;red&#8217; does indeed show a steady decline in usage with grade level, while the probability of the word &#8216;determine&#8217; increases.
    Other words like &#8216;perimeter&#8217; attain maximum probability in a specific grade range, perhaps corresponding to the period in which these concepts are emphasized in the curriculum.
    The word &#8216;the&#8217; is very common and varies less in frequency across grade levels.
    Our main hypothesis in this work is
