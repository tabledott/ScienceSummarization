  The way in which Chinese characters are used in names differs greatly from the way they are used in ordinary text, and some researchers, notably Sproat et al. (1996), have established special-purpose recognizers for Chinese names (and translated foreign names), designed to improve the accuracy of automatic segmenters by treating names specially.'
    Chinese names always take the form family name followed by given name.

    Sproat et al. (1996) implement special recognizers not only for Chinese names and transliterated foreign names, but for components of morphologically obtained words as well.
    The approach we present is not specially tailored for name recognition, but because it is fully adaptive i
