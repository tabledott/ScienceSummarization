nfinitival phrase: &amp;quot;John began reading the book,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;John began to read the book.&amp;quot; In Pustejovsky (1991) it was argued that in such cases, the verb need not have multiple subcategorizations, but only one deep semantic type, in this case, an event.
    Thus, the verb coerces its complement (e.g.
    &amp;quot;the book&amp;quot;) into an event related to that object.
    Such information can be represented by means of a representational schema called qualia structure, which, among other things, specifies the relations associated with objects.
    Counts for objects of begin/V.
    In related work being carried out with Mats Rooth of the University of Stuttgart, we are exploring what the range of coercion types is, and what environments they may appear in, as discovered in corpora.
    Some of our initial data suggest that the hypothesis of deep semantic selection may in fact be correct, as well as indicating what the nature of the coercion rules may be.
