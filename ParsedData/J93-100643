n the text in which they occur as such, the value of the function is kP(p)S(s).
    The quantity k is introduced to enable us to prefer certain kinds of breaks over others.
    For the English and German texts used in our experiments, k = length(p) so as to favor long prefixes on the grounds that both languages are primarily suffixing.
    If the function has the same value for more than one potential break point, the one farthest to the right is preferred, also for the reason that we prefer to maximize the lengths of prefixes.
    Once it has been decided to divide a word, and at what place, one of the two parts is selected as the putative canonical form of the word, namely, whichever is longer, and the prefix if both are of equal length.
    Finally, any other words in the same text that share the chosen prefix (suffix) are split at the corresponding place, and so assigned to the same canonical form.
    The morphological algorithm treats words that appear hyphenated in the text specially.
    The hyphenate
