of &#8220;chance agreement&#8221;: &#960;-style coefficients calculate the chance of agreement among arbitrary coders, whereas &#954;-style coefficients calculate the chance of agreement among the coders who produced the reliability data.
    Therefore, the choice of coefficient should not depend on the magnitude of the divergence between the coders, but rather on the desired interpretation of chance agreement.
    Another common claim is that individual-distribution coefficients like &#954; &#8220;reward&#8221; annotators for disagreeing on the marginal distributions.
    For example, Di Eugenio and Glass (2004, page 99) say that &#954; suffers from what they call the bias problem, described as &#8220;the paradox that &#954;Co [our &#954;] increases as the coders become less similar.&#8221; Similar reservations about the use of &#954; have been noted by Brennan and Prediger (1981) and Zwick (1988).
    However, the bias problem is less paradoxical than it sounds.
    Although it is true that for a fixed obse
