  Automatic Labeling Of Semantic Roles
  
    present a system for identifying the semantic relationships, or filled by constituents of a sentence within a semantic frame.
    Given an input sentence and a target word frame, the system labels constituents with either abstract semantic roles, such as or more domain-specific semantic roles, such as and The system is based on statistical classifiers trained on roughly 50,000 sentences that were hand-annotated with semantic roles by the FrameNet semantic labeling project.
    We then parsed each training sentence into a syntactic tree and extracted various lexical and syntactic features, including the phrase type of each constituent, its grammatical function, and its position in the sentence.
    These features were combined with knowledge of the predicate verb, noun, or adjective, as well as information such as the prior probabilities of various combinations of semantic roles.
    We used various lexical clustering algorithms to generalize across possible fille
