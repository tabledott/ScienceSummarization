ror model.
    Two seminal papers first posed a noisy channel model solution to the spelling correction problem.
    In (Mayes, Damerau et al. 1991), word bigrams are used for the source model.
    For the error model, they first define the confusion set of a string s to include s, along with all words w in the dictionary D such that s can be derived from w by a single application of one of the four edit operations: Let C be the number of words in the confusion set of d. Then they define the error model, for all s in the confusion set of d, as: This is a very simple error model, where is the prior on a typed word being correct, and the remaining probability mass is distributed evenly among all other words in the confusion set.
    Church and Gale (1991) propose a more sophisticated error model.
    Like Mayes, Damerau, et al. (1991), they consider as candidate source words only those words that are a single basic edit away from s, using the same edit set as above.
    However, two improvements are made.
