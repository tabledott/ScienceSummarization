, and lacked the formalization of a structural disambiguation process, that is, they did not specify what kind of knowledge can be used in what way for structural disambiguation.
    In CDG parsing, any knowledge is applicable to a constraint network as long as it can be expressed as a constraint between two modifications, and an efficient filtering algorithm effectively uses it to reduce structural ambiguities.
  
  
    Consider the language Lww = {wwlw E (o.+ b)*}, the language of strings that are obtained by concatenating the same arbitrary string over an alphabet { a,b}.
    Lww is known to be non-context-free (Hoperoft and Ullman 1979), and is frequently mentioned when discussing the non-context-freeness of the &amp;quot;respectively&amp;quot; construct (e.g.
    &amp;quot;A, B, and C do D, E, and F, respectively&amp;quot;) of various natural languages (e.g., Savitch et al. 1987).
    Although there is no context-free grammar that generates Lww, the grammar Gww =&lt; E, L, R, C &gt; shown in Figure 9 ge
