valuation, we have found ways to gainfully filter a large but noisy training corpus to augment the training data for our models and improve transliteration accuracy considerably beyond our starting point, e.g., to reduce Pin-yin error rates from 51.1% to 42.5%.
    We expect to further refine the translation models in the future and apply them in other tasks such as text translation.
