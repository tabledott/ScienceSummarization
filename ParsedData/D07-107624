			This paper uses the ACE RDC 2003 and 2004 cor pora provided by LDC in all our experiments.
			4.1 Experimental Setting.
			The ACE RDC corpora are gathered from various newspapers, newswire and broadcasts.
			In the 2003 corpus , the training set consists of 674 documents and 9683 positive relation instances w hile the test set consists of 97 documents and 1386 positive relation in stances.
			The 2003 corpus defines 5 entity types, 5 major relation types and 24 relation subtypes.
			All the reported performances in this paper on the ACE RDC 2003 corpus are evaluated on the test data.
			The 2004 corpus contains 451 documents and 5702 positive relation instances.
			It redefines 7 entity types, 7 major relation types and 23 relation subtypes.
			For compari son, we use the same setting as Zhang et al(2006) by applying a 5-fold cross-validation on a subset of the 2004 data, containing 348 documents
