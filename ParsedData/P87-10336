ite: a SET of disjunctions, where each disjunction is a SET of feature-descriptions.
    It is possible to convert any FDL formula into a featuredescription structure by a simple automatic procedure, as described in [51.
    This conversion does not add or subtract any information from a formula, nor increase its size in any significant way.
    It simply identifies components of the formula which may be converted into a more efficient representation as DG structures.
    A feature-description is conceptually equivalent to a special kind of AND/OR graph, in which the terminal nodes are represented by DG structures.
    For example, an AND/OR graph equivalent to the formula, is shown in Figure 2.
    In the AND/OR graph representation, each AND-node represents a feature-description.
    The first outgoing arc from an AND-node represents the definite component of a feature-description, and the remaining outgoing arcs represent the indefinite component.
    Each OR-node represents a disjunction.
