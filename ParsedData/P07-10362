 specific structured information can result in substantial improvements (Toutanova et al., 2005; Roth and Yih, 2005).
    This paper proposes a novel constraints-based learning protocol for guiding semi-supervised learning.
    We develop a formalism for constraints-based learning that unifies several kinds of constraints: unary, dictionary based and n-ary constraints, which encode structural information and interdependencies among possible labels.
    One advantage of our formalism is that it allows capturing different levels of constraint violation.
    Our protocol can be used in the presence of any learning model, including those that acquire additional statistical constraints from observed data while learning (see Section 5.
    In the experimental part of this paper we use HMMs as the underlying model, and exhibit significant reduction in the number of training examples required in two information extraction problems.
    As is often the case in semi-supervised learning, the algorithm can be viewed as a
