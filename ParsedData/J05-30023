put a grammatical sentence.
    However, extraction is only a coarse approximation of fusion.
    An extracted sentence may include not only common information, but additional information specific to the article from which it came, leading to source bias and aggravating fluency problems in the extracted summary.
    Attempting to solve this problem by including more sentences to restore the original context might lead to a verbose and repetitive summary.
    Instead, we want a fine-grained approach that can identify only those pieces of sentences that are common.
    Language generation offers an appealing approach to the problem, but the use of generation in this context raises significant research challenges.
    In particular, generation for sentence fusion must be able to operate in a domainindependent fashion, scalable to handle a large variety of input documents with various degrees of overlap.
    In the past, generation systems were developed for limited domains and required a rich semantic representa
