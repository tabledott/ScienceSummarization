to pick the most probable one at the end of the sentence 7For diversity in parser ensembles, right-to-left parsers are also used.
			924 (Duan et al, 2007; Johansson and Nugues, 2007b; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007; Titov and Henderson, 2007).
			One system uses as part of their parsing pipeline a ?neighbor-parser?
			that attaches adjacent words and a ?root-parser?
			that identifies the root word(s) of asentence (Wu et al, 2007).
			In the case of grammar based parsers, a classifier is used to disambiguate in cases where the grammar leaves some ambiguity (Schneider et al, 2007; Watson and Briscoe, 2007) 5.2.3 Learning Transition-based parsers either maintain a classifierthat predicts the next transition or a global proba bilistic model that scores a complete parse.
			To train these classifiers and probabilitistic models several approaches were used: SVMs (Duan et al, 2007; Hall et al, 2007a; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007), modified finite Newton SVMs (Wu et al, 2007), maximum entropy models (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007), mul
