s by tf-idf scoring might also be inappropriate because such rare words would get extremely high scores,which is an undesirable trait in similarity search.
			(Haveliwala et al, 2002) and others have shown that a ?non monotonic document frequency?
			(NMDF) weighting can be more effective in such a setting.
			Because the frequency of words in the glosses is distributed by a power-law, we weight each word by its distance from the mean word count in log space.
			Formally, the weight wi for a word appearing ri times is wi = exp ( ?
			(log(ri)?
			?)2 2?2 ) where ? and ? are the mean and standard deviation ofthe logs of all word counts.
			This is a smooth approximation to the high and low frequency stop lists used effectively by other measures such as (Patwardhan and Ped ersen, 2006).
			We believe that because non-monotonic frequency scaling has no parameters and is data-driven,it could stand to be more widely adopted among gloss based lexical similarity measures.
			We also add bi-directional edges between
