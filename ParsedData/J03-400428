h that of other unsupervised systems on the English all-words task, it would be worthwhile to compare other selectional preference models on the same data.
    Although the accuracy of our system is encouraging given that it does not use hand-tagged data, the results are below the level of state-of-the-art supervised systems.
    Indeed, a system just assigning to each word its most frequent sense as listed in WordNet (the &#8220;first-sense heuristic&#8221;) would do better than our preference models (and in fact better than the majority of the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words supervised systems).
    The first-sense heuristic, however, assumes the existence of sense-tagged data that are able to give a definitive first sense.
    We do not use any first-sense information.
    Although a modest amount of sense-tagged data is available for English (Miller et al. 1993, Ng and Lee 1996), for other languages with minimal sense-tagged resources, the heuristic is not applicable.
    Moreover, for some words the predomi
