al, 2001), MC (Miller and Charles, 1991) and RG (Rubenstein and Goodenough, 1965), have beenwidely used to evaluate vector-space models.
			Moti vated to evaluate composition models, Mitchell andLapata (2008) introduced a dataset where an intransitive verb, presented with a subject noun, is com pared to another verb chosen to be either similar or dissimilar to the intransitive verb in context.
			The context is short, with only one word, and only verbs are compared.

			(2008), Thater et al (2011) and Dinu and Lapata (2010) evaluated wordsimilarity in context with a modified task where systems are to rerank gold-standard paraphrase candi dates given the SemEval 2007 Lexical SubstitutionTask dataset.
			This task only indirectly evaluates sim ilarity as only reranking of already similar words are evaluated.
	
	
			We presented a new neural network architecture thatlearns more semantic word representations by us ing both local and global context in learning.
			These learned word embeddings can
