ately only full scopings are desired, an additional argument to pull and apply-terms controls whether partial scopings are to be returned.
    When this flag, complete?, is true, apply-terms, and hence pull, will return only expressions in which no more complex terms remain to be applied, for example, only the last two of the five readings above.
    Finally, the restrictions of the complex terms may themselves contain complex terms and must be scoped themselves.
    The apply function therefore recursively generates the scopings for the restriction by calling pull on that restriction, and a quantified wff is generated for each possible partial or complete scoping of the restriction.
    Schematically, in the simplest case, for the A subsequent application of the remaining complex term will yield the &amp;quot;wide scope&amp;quot; reading q2(y, r2(y), qi(x, ri(xty), p(x)) The disallowed readings produced by the &amp;quot;all permutations&amp;quot; algorithm are never produced by this algorithm, because it is
