nstraints and preferences to impose a partitioning on the noun phrases in a text into coreference equivalence classes.
    Nevertheless, the approach can be improved in a number of ways.
    Additional analysis and evaluation on new corpora are required to determine the generality of the approach.
    Our current distance metric and noun phrase instance representation are only first, and admittedly very coarse, approximations to those ultimately required for handling the wide variety of anaphoric expressions that comprise noun phrase coreference.
    We would also like to make use of cues from centering theory and plan to explore the possibility of learning the weights associated with each term in the distance metric.
    Our methods for producing the noun phrase feature vector are also overly simplistic.
    Nevertheless, the relatively strong performance of the technique indicates that clustering constitutes a powerful and natural approach to noun phrase coreference resolution.
