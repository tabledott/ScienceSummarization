We describe a statistical classifier that combines topical context with local cues to identify a word sense.
    The classifier is used to disambiguate a noun, a verb, and an adjective.
    A knowledge base in the form of WordNet's lexical relations is used to automatically locate training examples in a general text corpus.
    Test results are compared with those from manually tagged training examples.
  
  
    An impressive array of statistical methods have been developed for word sense identification.
    They range from dictionary-based approaches that rely on definitions (Vdronis and Ide 1990; Wilks et al. 1993) to corpus-based approaches that use only word cooccurrence frequencies extracted from large textual corpora (Schtitze 1995; Dagan and Itai 1994).
    We have drawn on these two traditions, using corpus-based co-occurrence and the lexical knowledge base that is embodied in the WordNet lexicon.
    The two traditions complement each other.
    Corpus-based approaches have the advantage of being ge
