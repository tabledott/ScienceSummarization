and Wall 1991; K&#168;onig 1994; Eisner 1996), which use composition and type-raising only when syntactically necessary.
    For coordination, we will use a binarized version of the following ternary rule schema:5 For further explanation and linguistics and computational motivation for this theory of grammar, the reader is directed to Steedman (1996, 2000).
    The syntactic derivations in CCGbank are accompanied with bilexical head-dependency structures, which are defined in terms of the lexical heads of functor categories and their arguments.
    The derivation in (6) corresponds to the following dependency structure, which includes the long-range dependency between give and money: The dependency structures in CCGbank are intended to include all non-anaphoric local and long-range dependencies relevant to determining semantic predicate&#8211;argument relations, and hence approximate more fine-grained semantic representations.
    In this, they differ crucially from the bilexical surface dependencies used by
