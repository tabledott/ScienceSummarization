tion 8.1 and Section 8.2 are based on the exact-matching criterion (i.e., a transliteration is considered correct only if it exactly matches the one in the gold-standard).
    We also show the accuracy based on human-subjective evaluation in Section 8.3.
    We wanted to know how well human translators do in this task.
    So, we asked a bilingual speaker (a native speaker of Arabic) to transliterate the names in both data sets given the context they appear within in the Arabic document.
    Then, the transliterations provided by the human subject are compared with those in the gold-standard.
    The accuracy of the transliterations provided by the human translator is shown in Table 5.
    Examples of the transliteration errors made by the human subject are shown in Table 6.
    We first show in Section 8.2.1 the overall accuracy of the phonetic-based model, the spelling-based model, and the linear combination of them.
    Then, in Section 8.2.2 we show how the presence of names in the pronunciation dictionar
