remental parsing.
  
  
    In this paper, we have analyzed the potential for incremental processing in deterministic dependency parsing.
    Our first result is negative, since we have shown that strict incrementality is not achievable within the restrictive parsing framework considered here.
    However, we have also shown that the arc-eager parsing algorithm is optimal for incremental dependency parsing, given the constraints imposed by the overall framework.
    Moreover, we have shown that in practical parsing, the algorithm performs incremental processing for the majority of input structures.
    If we consider all sentences in the test data, the share is roughly two thirds, but if we limit our attention to well-formed output, it is almost 90%.
    Since deterministic dependency parsing has previously been shown to be competitive in terms of parsing accuracy (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004), we believe that this is a promising approach for situations that require parsing to be robust, ef
