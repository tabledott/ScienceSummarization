 exact optimization of this parameter was not performed.
  We refer to this model as Combined.
  The Combined model is not a sound probabilistic model as it does not define a probability distribution over parse trees.
  It does however provide a crude way to combine ancestor and left context information.
  The second column in Table 2 shows the accuracy of parse selection using the models described above.
  For comparison, a baseline showing the expected perfor- mance of choosing parses randomly according to a uni- form distribution is included as the first row.
  The accu- racy results are averaged over a ten-fold cross-validation on the data set summarized in Table 1.
  The data we used for this experiment was the set of disambiguated sen- tences that have exactly one preferred parse (comprising a total of 5312 sentences).
  Often the stochastic models we are considering give the same score to several differ- ent parses.
  When a model ranks a set of m parses highest with equal scores and one of those parse
