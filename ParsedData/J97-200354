n equivalence relation.
    (u-1 supp(S) = supp(S)) defines the equivalence relation for regular languages.
    Rs is a finer relation.
    The additional condition in the definition of Rs is that the restriction of the power series [14-1S - v-1S] to u-1 supp(S) = supp(S) is constant.
    The following lemma shows that if there exists a subsequential transducer T computing S with a number of states equal to the number of equivalence classes of Rs, then T is a minimal transducer computing f. If S is a subsequential power series defined on the tropical semiring, Rs has a finite number of equivalence classes.
    This number is bounded by the number of states of any subsequential transducer realizing S. So V(u, v) E (E*)2, 6(i, u) = 6(i, v) = (uRsv).
    This proves the lemma.
    0 The following theorem proves the existence of a minimal subsequential transducer representing S. For any subsequential function S, there exists a minimal subsequential transducer computing it.
    Its number of states is equal to the
