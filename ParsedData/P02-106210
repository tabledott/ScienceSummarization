se. for is a transformation of , where the transformation is applied in the same way as the final feature type in the maximum entropy tagger.
    Each character in the word is mapped to its , but repeated consecutive character types are not repeated in the mapped string.
    For example, Animal would be mapped to Aa in this feature, G.M. would again be mapped to A.A.. for is the same as , but has an additional flag appended.
    The flag indicates whether or not the word appears in a dictionary of words which appeared more often lower-cased than capitalized in a large corpus of text.
    In our example, Animal appears in the lexicon, but G.M. does not, so the two values for would be Aa1 and A.A.0 respectively.
    In addition, and are all defined to be NULL if or .
    Most of the features we describe are anchored on entity boundaries in the candidate segmentation.
    We will use &#8220;feature templates&#8221; to describe the features that we used.
    As an example, suppose that an entity seen in a candida
