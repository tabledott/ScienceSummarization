ased on MUC, where the mention spans are specified in the input,17 or those based on ACE data, where an approximate match is often allowed based on the specified head of the NP mention.
    As noted above, the choice of an evaluation metric for coreference has been a tricky issue and there does not appear to be any silver bullet approach that addresses all the concerns.
    Three metrics have been proposed for evaluating coreference performance over an unrestricted set of entity types: i) The link based MUC metric (Vilain et al., 1995), ii) The mention based B-CUBED metric (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) and iii) The entity based CEAF (Constrained Entity Aligned F-measure) metric (Luo, 2005).
    Very recently BLANC (BiLateral Assessment of NounPhrase Coreference) measure (Recasens and Hovy, 17as is the case in this evaluation with Gold Mentions 2011) has been proposed as well.
    Each of the metric tries to address the shortcomings or biases of the earlier metrics.
    Given a set of key entities K, and a set of
