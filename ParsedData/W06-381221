's ability to separate the merged graph into its previous parts can be measured in an unsupervised way.
    Bordag defines four measures: We used the same program to compute cooccurrences on the same corpus (the BNC).
    Therefore it is possible to directly compare our results to Bordag&#8217;s, who uses a triplet-based hierarchical graph clustering approach.
    The method was chosen because of its appropriateness for unlabelled data: without linguistic preprocessing like tagging or parsing, only the disambiguation mechanism is measured and not the quality of the preprocessing steps.
    We provide scores for his test 1 (word classes separately) and test 3 (words of different frequency bands).
    Data was obtained from BNC's raw text; evaluation was performed for 45 test words.
    Results (tables 3 and 4) suggest that both algorithms arrive at about equal overall performance (P and R).
