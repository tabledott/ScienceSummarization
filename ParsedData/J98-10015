 homographs with different parts of speech (e.g., play as a verb and noun), morphosyntactic disambiguation accomplishes sense disambiguation, and therefore (especially since the development of reliable part-of-speech taggers), WSD work has focused largely on distinguishing senses among homographs belonging to the same syntactic category.
    Step (2), the assignment of words to senses, is accomplished by reliance on two major sources of information: All disambiguation work involves matching the context of the instance of the word to be disambiguated with either information from an external knowledge source (knowledge-driven WSD), or information about the contexts of previously disambiguated instances of the word derived from corpora (data-driven or corpus-based WSD).
    Any of a variety of association methods is used to determine the best match between the current context and one of these sources of information, in order to assign a sense to each word occurrence.
