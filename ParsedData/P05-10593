ction between lexical information and word order also explains the higher performance of IBM model 4 over IBM model 3 for alignment.
    We begin by presenting the probability model in the following section, detailing how we address issues of pruning and smoothing that lexicalization introduces.
    We present alignment results on a parallel Chinese-English corpus in Section 3.
    An Inversion Transduction Grammar can generate pairs of sentences in two languages by recursively applying context-free bilingual production rules.
    Most work on ITG has focused on the 2-normal form, which consists of unary production rules that are responsible for generating word pairs: and binary production rules in two forms that are responsible for generating syntactic subtree pairs: The rules with square brackets enclosing the right hand side expand the left hand side symbol into the two symbols on the right hand side in the same order in the two languages, whereas the rules with pointed brackets expand the left hand side s
