 tune the parameter values to maximize the precision and recall on the 374 SAT questions.
    We hypothesized that LRA is relatively insensitive to the values of the parameters.
    Table 16 shows the variation in the performance of LRA as the parameter values are adjusted.
    We take the baseline parameter settings (given in Section 5.5) and vary each parameter, one at a time, while holding the remaining parameters fixed at their baseline values.
    None of the precision and recall values are significantly different from the baseline, according to the Fisher Exact Test (Agresti 1990), at the 95% confidence level.
    This supports the hypothesis that the algorithm is not sensitive to the parameter values.
    Although a full run of LRA on the 374 SAT questions takes 9 days, for some of the parameters it is possible to reuse cached data from previous runs.
    We limited the experiments with num sim and max phrase because caching was not as helpful for these parameters, so experimenting with them required s
