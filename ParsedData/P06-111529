en, KRISP?s perfor mance degrades gracefully in the presence of noise while other systems?
			performance degrade muchfaster, thus verifying our hypothesis.
			In this exper iment, only the test sentences were corrupted, we get qualitatively similar results when both training and test sentences are corrupted.
			The results are also similar on the GEOQUERY corpus.
	
	
			We presented a new kernel-based approach to learn semantic parsers.
			SVM classifiers based on string subsequence kernels are trained for each ofthe productions in the meaning representation language.
			These classifiers are then used to compositionally build complete meaning representa tions of natural language sentences.
			We evaluatedour system on two real-world corpora.
			The re sults showed that our system compares favorably to other existing systems and is particularly robust to noise.
