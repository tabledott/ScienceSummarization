  Unsupervised Coreference Resolution in a Nonparametric Bayesian Model
  
    We present an unsupervised, nonparametric Bayesian approach to coreference resolution which models both global entity identity across a corpus as well as the sequential anaphoric structure within each document.
    While most existing coreference work is driven by pairwise decisions, our model is fully generative, producing each mention from a combination of global entity properties and local attentional state.
    Despite being unsupervised, our system achieves a 70.3 on the MUC-6 test set, broadly in the range of some recent supervised results.
  
  
    Referring to an entity in natural language can broadly be decomposed into two processes.
    First, speakers directly introduce new entities into discourse, entities which may be shared across discourses.
    This initial reference is typically accomplished with proper or nominal expressions.
    Second, speakers refer back to entities already introduced.
    This anaphoric refe
