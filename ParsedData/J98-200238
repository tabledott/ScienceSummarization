n empirically verified that the use of lexical semantic knowledge is effective in structural disambiguation, such as the PP-attachment problem (Hobbs and Bear 1990; Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner 1990).
    There have been many probabilistic methods proposed in the literature to address the PP-attachment problem using lexical semantic knowledge which, in our view, can be classified into three types.
    The first approach (Hindle and Rooth 1991, 1993) takes doubles of the form (verb, prep) and (nouni, prep), like those in Table 9, as training data to acquire semantic knowledge and judges the attachment sites of the prepositional phrases in quadruples of the form (verb, nouni, prep, noun2)&#8212;e.g., (see, girl, with, telescope)&#8212;based on the acquired knowledge.
    Hindle and Rooth (1991) proposed the use of the lexical association measure calculated based on such doubles.
    More specifically, they estimate P(prep I verb) and P(prep nouni), and calculate the so-called t-score, which is a measure of
