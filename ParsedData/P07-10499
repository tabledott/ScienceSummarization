many parsing errors.
    The adjacency property described in the previous section makes shortest common cover link sets especially suitable for incremental parsing.
    Consider the example given in figure 2.
    When the word the is read, the parser can already construct a link from know to the without worrying about the continuation of the sentence.
    This link is part of the correct parse whether the sentence turns out to be I know the boy or I know the boy sleeps.
    A dependency parser, on the other hand, cannot make such a decision before the end of the sentence is reached.
    If the sentence is I know the boy then a dependency link has to be created from know to boy while if the sentence is I know the boy sleeps then such a link is wrong.
    This problem is known in psycholinguistics as the problem of reanalysis (Sturt and Crocker, 1996).
    Assume the incremental parser is processing a prefix (x1, ... , xk) of an utterance and has already deduced a set of links L for this prefix.
    It can now
