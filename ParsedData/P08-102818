oped) and one incompatible (e.g., horse dissolved).
    Landmarks were taken from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
    Specifically, they belonged to different synsets and were maximally dissimilar as measured by the Jiang and Conrath (1997) measure.3 Our initial set of candidate materials consisted of 20 verbs, each paired with 10 nouns, and 2 landmarks (400 pairs of sentences in total).
    These were further pretested to allow the selection of a subset of items showing clear variations in sense as we wanted to have a balanced set of similar and dissimilar sentences.
    In the pretest, subjects saw a reference sentence containing a subject-verb tuple and its landmarks and were asked to choose which landmark was most similar to the reference or neither.
    Our items were converted into simple sentences (all in past tense) by adding articles where appropriate.
    The stimuli were administered to four separate groups; each group saw one set of 100 sentences.
    The pretest was completed by 53 participants.
