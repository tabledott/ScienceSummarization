al numbers, will represent more: &#8216;the extent according to which x and y are related&#8217;.
    This can be determined in different ways.
    Suppose X is the set of animals, and &#8216;chase&#8217; is a relation on it: chase &#8838; X &#215; X.
    Take x = &#8216;dog&#8217; and y = &#8216;cat&#8217;: with our type-logical glasses on, the obvious choice would be to take cxy to be the number of times &#8216;dog&#8217; has chased &#8216;cat&#8217;, i.e. the number of times the sentence &#8216;the dog chases the cat&#8217; has appeared in the corpus.
    But in the distributional setting, this method will be too syntactic and dismissive of the actual meaning of &#8216;cat&#8217; and &#8216;dog&#8217;.
    If instead the corpus contains the sentence &#8216;the hound hunted the wild cat&#8217;, cxy will be 0, restricting us to only assign meaning to sentences that have directly appeared in the corpus.
    We propose to, instead, use a level of abstraction by taking words such as verbs to be distributions ov
