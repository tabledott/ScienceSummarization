od achieves favorable performance on a range of lecture data sets (See Table 5), and both algorithms attain results close to the range of human agreement scores.
    The attractive feature of our algorithm, however, is robustness to recognition errors &#8212; testing it on the ASR transcripts caused only 7.8% relative increase in Pk measure (from 0.298 to 0.322), compared to a 13.5% relative increase for the UI system.
    We attribute this feature to the fact that the model is less dependent on individual recognition errors, which have a detrimental effect on the local segment language modeling probability estimates for the UI system.
    The block-level similarity function is not as sensitive to individual word errors, because the partition volume normalization factor dampens their overall effect on the derived models.
  
  
    In this paper we studied the impact of long-range dependencies on the accuracy of text segmentation.
    We modeled text segmentation as a graphpartitioning task aiming to simultane
