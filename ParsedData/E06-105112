l clues for detecting the agent and target of the relation, as well as the presence of the relation itself.
    As the type is not known, we use the information provided by the two local contexts of the candidate interacting entities, called left and right local context respectively.
    As typically done in entity recognition, we represent each local context by using the following basic features: Token The token itself.
    Lemma The lemma of the token.
    PoS The PoS tag of the token.
    Orthographic This feature maps each token into equivalence classes that encode attributes such as capitalization, punctuation, numerals and so on.
    Formally, given a relation example R, a local context L = t_w, ... , t_1, t0, t+1, ... , t+w is represented as a row vector where fi is a feature function that returns 1 if it is active in the specified position of L, 0 otherwise3.
    The Local Context kernel KLC(R1, R2) is defined as where Kleft and Kright are defined by substituting the embedding of the left and right lo
