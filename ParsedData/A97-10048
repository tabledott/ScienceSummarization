    We trained our system on 39441 sentences (898737 words) of Wall Street Journal text from sections 00 through 24 of the second release of the Penn Treebank3 (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993).
    We corrected punctuation mistakes and erroneous sentence boundaries in the training data.
    Performance figures for our best performing system, which used a hand-crafted list of honorifics and corporate designators, are shown in Table 1.
    The first test set, WSJ, is Palmer and Hearst's initial test data and the second
