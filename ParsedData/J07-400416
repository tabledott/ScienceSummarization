alyses for the sentences in the training data.
    The conditional-likelihood estimator is also consistent for the conditional distributions (Johnson et al. 1999).
    The same solution is arrived at by Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty (1997) via a maximum entropy argument.
    Another feature of Johnson et al.&#8217;s approach is the use of a Gaussian prior term to avoid overfitting, which involves adding a regularization term to the likelihood function; the regularization term penalizes models whose weights get too large in absolute value.
    This smoothing method for log-linear models is also proposed by Chen and Rosenfeld (1999).
    Calculating the conditional feature expectations can still be problematic if the grammar licenses a large number of analyses for some sentences.
    This is not a problem for Johnson et al. (1999) because their grammars are hand-written and constraining enough to allow the analyses for each sentence to be enumerated.
    However, for grammars with wider coverage it i
