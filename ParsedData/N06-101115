    By the eighth iteration, the model has improved to select it as a best transliteration.
    Not all correct transliterations make it to the top of the candidates list (transliteration model by itself is never as accurate as the complete algorithm on Figure 3).
    That is not required, however, as the model only needs to be good enough to place the correct transliteration anywhere in the candidate list.
    Not surprisingly, some of the top transliteration candidates start sounding like the NE itself, as training progresses.
    On Figure 4, candidates for forsyth on iteration 7 include fross and fossett.
    We ran a series of experiments to see how the size of the initial training set affects the accuracy of the model as training progresses (Figure 5).
    Although the performance of the early iterations is significantly affected by the size of the initial training example set, the algorithm quickly improves its performance.
    As we decrease the size from 254, to 127, to 85 examples, the accurac
