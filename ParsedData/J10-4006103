s confirm that TypeDM is the best of our models, again (slightly) outperforming our LRA implementation.
    Still, our best performance is well below that of OC-Comb, the absolute best, and OC-Rel, the best purely relational model of O&#180; S&#180;eaghdha and Copestake (2009) (the difference in global accuracy between the latter and TypeDM is highly significant, p &lt; 0.000001).
    O&#180; S&#180;eaghdha and Copestake use sophisticated kernel-based methods and extensive parameter tuning to achieve these results.
    We hope that the TypeDM performance would also improve by improving the machine learning aspects of the procedure.
    As an ad interim summary, we observe that TypeDM achieves competitive results in semantic tasks involving relational similarity.
    In particular, in both analogy solving and two out of three relation classification experiments, TypeDM is at least as good as our LRA implementation.
    We now move on to show how this same view of the DM tensor can be successfully applied to as
