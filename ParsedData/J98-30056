s, we would need to develop new templates and the information extraction rules required for them.
    While this is a task we leave to those working in the information extraction field, we note that there do exist tools for semi-automatically acquiring such rules (Lehnert et al. 1993; Fisher et al.
    1995).
    This helps to alleviate the otherwise knowledge-intensive nature of the task.
    We are working on the development of tools for domain-independent types of information extraction.
    For example, our work on extracting descriptions of individuals and organizations and representing them in a formalism that facilitates reuse of the descriptions in summaries can be used in any domain.
    In the remainder of this section, we highlight the novel techniques of SUMMONS and explain why they are important for our work.
    With a few exceptions (cf.
    Section 2), all existing summarizers provide summaries of single articles by extracting sentences from them.
    If such systems were applied to a series o
