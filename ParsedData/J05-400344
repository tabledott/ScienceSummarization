e noise in the dictionary is even more clear for sentence pairs with few words, such as Figure 14, example 6.
    The sentences in that example are tables of soccer team statistics.
    They are judged parallel because corresponding digits align to each other, and according to our dictionary, the Arabic word for &#8220;Mexico&#8221; can be translated as any of the country names listed in the example.
    These examples also show that the problem of finding only true translation pairs is hard.
    Two sentences may share many content words and yet express different meanings (see Figure 14, example 1).
    However, our task of getting useful MT training data does not require a perfect solution; as we have seen, even such noisy training pairs can help improve a translation system&#8217;s performance.
  
  
    While there is a large body of work on bilingual comparable corpora, most of it is focused on learning word translations (Fung and Yee 1998; Rapp 1999; Diab and Finch 2000; Koehn and Knight 2000; Gaussier
