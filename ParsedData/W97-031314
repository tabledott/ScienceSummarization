n one can infer that a gun was used.
    And for some applications, any word that is strongly associated with a category might be useful to include in the semantic lexicon.
    For example, words like ammunition or bullets are highly suggestive of a weapon.
    In the UMass/MUC-4 information extraction system (Lehnert et al., 1992), the words ammunition and bullets were defined as weapons, mainly for the purpose of selectional restrictions.
    The human judges estimated that it took them approximately 10-15 minutes, on average, to judge the 200 words for each category.
    Since the instructions allowed the users to assign a zero to a word if they did not know what it meant, we manually removed the zeros and assigned ratings that we thought were appropriate.
    We considered ignoring the zeros, but some of the categories would have been severely impacted.
    For example, many of the legitimate weapons (e.g., M-16 and AR-15) were not known to the judges.
    Fortunately, most of the unknown words were prope
