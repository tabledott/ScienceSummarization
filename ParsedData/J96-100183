resholds is the only training required for our statistical method, using the same corpus as both the database and the source of input collocations is not a case of testing on the training data.
    The second experiment yielded the lowest results because many input collocations simply did not appear often enough in the database corpus.
    However, we suspected that this could be corrected by using a larger database corpus!'
    Thus, for our third experiment, we used DB2, which contained two years of the Hansards (1986 and 1987), and drew our input collocations from yet a different year (1988).
    Evaluation on this third experiment raised the accuracy to nearly as high as the first experiment, yielding 74%.
  
  
    A bilingual lexicon of collocations has a variety of potential uses.
    The most obvious are machine translation and machine-assisted human translation, but other multilingual applications, including information retrieval, summarization, and computational lexicography, also require access to
