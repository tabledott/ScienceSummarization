epends crucially on evaluating the likelihood of possible deviations from the norms.
    But a language learner has by definition only partial and possibly incorrect knowledge of the syntax, and is therefore unable to consistently identify deviations from the grammatical system.
    With the editing system I describe, the learner need not have the ability to recognize deviations from grammatical norms, but merely the non-linguistic ability to recognize copies of the same thing. far, I have considered the selfcorrection component from the standpoint of parsing.
    However, it is clear that the origins are in the process of generation.
    The mechanism for editing self-corrections that I have proposed has as its essential operation expunging one two identical is unable to expunge a sequence of two elements.
    (The Surface Copy Editor might be viewed as a counterexample to this claim, but see below.)
    Consider expunction now from the standpoint of the generator.
    Suppose self-correction bears a one-to-
