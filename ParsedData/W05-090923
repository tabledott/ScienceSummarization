 and choosing that formula that best correlates with human assessments on the training data* Use Semantic Relatedness to Map Unigrams: So far we have experimented with exact mapping, stemmed mapping and synonymy mapping between unigrams* Our next step is to experiment with different measures of semantic relatedness to match unigrams that have a related meaning, but are not quite synonyms of each other* More Effective Use of Multiple Reference Translations: Our current metric uses multiple reference translations in a weak way: we compare the translation with each reference separately and select the reference with the best match* This was necessary in order to incorporate recall in our metric, which we have shown to be highly advantageous* As our matching approach improves, the need for multiple references for the metric may in fact diminish* Nevertheless, we are exploring ways in which to improve our matching against multiple references* Recent work by (Pang et al, 2003) provides the mechanism for producing se
