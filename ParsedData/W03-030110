bmissions, there were 17 in the Limited resources subtask, and 10 in the Unlimited resources subtask.
    Tables 2 and 3 show all of the submissions for each team in the two subtasks, and provide a brief description of their approaches.
    While each participating system was unique, there were a few unifying themes.
    Four teams had approaches that relied (to varying degrees) on an IBM model of statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993).
    UMD was a straightforward implementation of IBM Model 2, BiBr employed a boosting procedure in deriving an IBM Model 1 lexicon, Ralign used IBM Model 2 as a foundation for their recursive splitting procedure, and XRCE used IBM Model 4 as a base for alignment with lemmatized text and bilingual lexicons.
    Two teams made use of syntactic structure in the text to be aligned.
    ProAlign satisfies constraints derived from a dependency tree parse of the English sentence being aligned.
    BiBr also employs syntactic constraints that must be satisfied.
