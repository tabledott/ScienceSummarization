at use *T* traces can be found in the CCGbank manual.
    This algorithm works also if there is a coordinate structure within the relative clause such that there are two *T* traces (the interest rates they pay *T* on their deposits and charge *T* on their loans), resulting in the following long-range dependencies: that the verb takes the VP and the NP argument in reversed order and change the tree accordingly before translation, resulting in the correct CCG analysis: We obtain the following long-range dependencies: Because our grammar does not use Baldridge&#8217;s (2002) modalities or Steedman&#8217;s (1996) equivalent rule-based restrictions, which prohibit this category from applying to in situ NPs, this may lead to overgeneralization.
    However, such examples are relatively frequent: There are 97 instances of ((S[.
    ]\NP)/NP)/(S[dcl]\NP) in sections 02&#8211;21, and to omit this category would reduce coverage and recovery of long-range extractions.
    By percolating the *T* trace up to the SQ-level
