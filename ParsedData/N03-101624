 edge (for us, this represents a factor of approximately 2 in memory savings).
    Moreover, the context summary estimates require only a single table lookup per edge, while the accelerated version of F requires only a rapid quadratic scan of the input per sentence (less than 1% of parse time per sentence), followed by a table lookup per edge.
    The complex FOMs in (Charniak et al., 1998) require somewhat more online computation to assemble.
    It is interesting that SXR is so much more effective than SXL; this is primarily because of the way that the rules have been encoded.
    If we factor the rules in the other direction, we get the opposite effect.
    Also, when combined with F, the difference in their performance drops from 10.3% to 0.8%; F is a right-filter and is partially redundant when added to SXR, but is orthogonal to SXL.
    A disadvantage of admissibility for the context summary estimates is that, necessarily, they are overly optimistic as to the contents of the outside context.
