ation counts.
    As mentioned in Section 3, instead of generating each modifier independently, the model conditions the generation of modifiers on certain aspects of the history.
    One such function of the history is the distance metric.
    One of the two components of this distance metric is what we will call the &#8220;verb intervening&#8221; feature, which is a predicate vi that is true if a verb has been generated somewhere in the surface string of the previously generated modifiers on the current side of the head.
    For example, in Figure 7, when generating the right-hand +STOP+ nonterminal child of the VP, the vi predicate is true, because one of the previously generated modifiers on the right side of the head dominates a verb, continue.12 More formally, this feature is most easily defined in terms of a recursively defined cv (&#8220;contains verb&#8221;) predicate, which is true if and only if a node dominates a verb: Bikel Intricacies of Collins&#8217; Parsing Model Referring to (2), we define t
