 using only highprecision projected annotations and far outperforms, by more than 35% absolute dependency accuracy, learning an unsupervised parser from raw target-language text alone.
    When a few target-language parse trees are available, projection gives a boost equivalent to doubling the number of target-language trees. first author would like to thank the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval at UMass Amherst.

    Consider the problem of learning a dependency parser, which must produce a directed tree whose vertices are the words of a given sentence.
    There are many differing conventions for representing syntactic relations in dependency trees.
    Say that we wish to output parses in the Prague style and so have annotated a small target corpus&#8212;e.g., 100 sentences&#8212;with those conventions.
    A parser trained on those hu
