the parser are a subset of those in CCGbank.
    The oracle figures are based only on those sentences for which there is a gold-standard analysis, because we wanted to measure how close the two resources are and provide an approximate upper bound for the parser.
    (But, to repeat, the accuracy figures for the parser are based on the complete test set.)
    11 The results reported in Clark and Curran (2007) differ from those here because Clark and Curran used the normal-form model and Viterbi decoder.
    Clark and Curran Wide-Coverage Efficient Statistical Parsing F-score is the balanced harmonic mean of precision (P) and recall (R): 2PR/(P + R).
    # GRs is the number of GRs in DepBank.
    For a GR in the parser output to be correct, it has to match the gold-standard GR exactly, including any subtype slots; however, it is possible for a GR to be incorrect at one level but correct at a subsuming level.
    For example, if an ncmod GR is incorrectly labeled with xmod, but is otherwise correct, it will be c
