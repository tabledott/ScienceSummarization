  Because the proper interpretation of K figures is still open to debate, we interpret the K figures resulting from our tests comparatively, rather than absolutely, (by comparing better and worse levels of agreement).
    We now come to the results of the evaluation of alternative versions of the heuristics dealing with the resolution of direct anaphora (segmentation, selection of potential antecedents, and premodification) discussed in Section 4.1.
    The optimal version of our system is based on the best results we could get for resolving direct anaphora, because we wanted to establish the coreferential relations among discourse NPs as precisely as possible.
    With loose segmentation, it is possible for the system to identify more than one coreference link for a definite description: all antecedents satisfying the requirements within the current window will be indicated as a possible antecedent.
    Therefore, when evaluating the system's results, we may find that all antecedents indicated for the resolu
