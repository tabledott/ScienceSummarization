al evaluation that suggests that these terms provide both additional and useful information.
    Table 1 also shows the recall of the each lexicon relative to the other.
    Whereas the Wilson et al. (2005) and WordNet lexicon have a recall of only 3% relative to the web lexicon, the web lexicon has a recall of 48% and 70% relative to the two other lexicons, indicating that it contains a significant amount of information from the other lexicons.
    However, this overlap is still small, suggesting that a combination of all the lexicons could provide the best performance.
    In Section 3.2 we investigate this empirically through a meta classification system.
    Table 2 shows the distribution of phrases in the web-derived lexicon relative to the number of tokens in each phrase.
    Here a token is simply defined by whitespace and punctuation, with punctuation counting as a token, e.g., &#8220;half-baked&#8221; is counted as 3 tokens.
    For the most part, we see what one might expect, as the number of tokens
