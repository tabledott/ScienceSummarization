Murphy &amp; Pazzani, 1991; Baffes &amp; Mooney, 1993).
    A single linear threshold unit can easily represent such functions, whereas a DNF expression requires &amp;quot;N choose M&amp;quot; terms to represent them.
    Therefore, the difference in their ability to compactly represent such functions explains the observed performance difference between rule induction and neural-networks on this problem.
    2 Of course picking the right bias or learning algorithm for a particular task is a difficult problem.
    A simple approach is to automate the selection of a method using internal cross-validation (Schaffer, 1993).
    Another approach is to use meta-learning to learn a set of rules (or other classifier) that predicts when a learning algorithm will perform best on a domain given features describing the problem (Aha, 1992).
    A recent special issue of the Machine Learning journal on &amp;quot;Bias Evaluation and Selection&amp;quot; introduced by Gordon and desJardins (1995) presents current research in
