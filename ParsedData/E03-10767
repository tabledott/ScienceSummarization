n compound (852) is higher than the preferred choice (825.6).
    On the other hand, a word that has a simple oneto-one correspondence to English may be broken into parts that bear little relation to its meaning.
    We can illustrate this on the example of Freitag (English: Friday), which is broken into frei (English: free) and Tag (English: day):
  
  
    As stated earlier, one of our objectives is the splitting of compounds into parts that have one-to-one correspondence to English.
    One source of information about word correspondence is a parallel corpus: text in a foreign language, accompanied by translations into English.
    Usually, such a corpus is provided in form of sentence translation pairs.
    Going through such a corpus, we can check for each splitting option if its parts have translations in the English translation of the sentence.
    In the case of Aktionsplan we would expect the words action and plan on the English side, but in case of Freitag we would not expect the words free and day.
