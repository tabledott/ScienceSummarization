using these counts in Equations (62)&#8212;(66).
    Equation (64) requires a sum over alignments.
    If Pti satisfies ti(a If,e)=14 ( a; I , e), (105) j=1 as is the case for Models 1 and 2 (see Equation (82)), then this sum can be calculated explicitly for 'et-,(f e;f,e) and Eo(jI i;f,e): -ea(f I e;f,e) m E-6(j i;f,e) EEpo(i I], f, e)5(e, ei)6(f Jj), i=o 1=1 ijo(i Unfortunately, there is no analogous formula for Eo(0 I e; f, e).
    Instead we must be content with In Equation (108), r denotes the set of all partitions of cb.
    Recall that a partition of 0 is a decomposition of 0 as a sum of positive integers.
    For example, 0 = 5 has 7 partitions since 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 3 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 1 + 4 = 2 + 3 = 5.
    For a partition y, we let -yk be the number of times that k appears in the sum, so that 0 = k-y.
    If -y is the partition corresponding to 1 + 1 + 3, then = 2, 'y3 = 1, and -yk = 0 for k other than 1 or 3.
    We adopt the convention that ro consists of the single element
