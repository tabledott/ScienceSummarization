t any other anaphora resolution scheme.
    Connolly, Burger, and Day (1994) treat anaphora resolution as an ML classification problem and compare seven classifier approaches with the solution quality of a naive hand-crafted algorithm whose heuristics incorporate the well-known agreement and recency indicators.
    Aone and Bennett (1996) outline an approach where they consider more than 60 features automatically obtained from the machinery of the host natural language processing system the learner is embedded in.
    The features under consideration include lexical ones like categories, syntactic ones like grammatical roles, semantic ones like semantic classes, and text positional ones, e.g., the distance between anaphor and antecedent.
    These features are packed in feature vectors&#8212;for each pair of an anaphor and its possible antecedent&#8212;and used to train a decision tree, employing Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm (Aone and Bennett 1996), or a whole battery of alternative classifiers in which hybrid va
