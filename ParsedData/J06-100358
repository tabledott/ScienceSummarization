 threshold of ?relatedness?
  for each of the measures.
  This is because the malapropism-detection algorithm requires a boolean related?unrelated judgment, but each of the measures that we tested instead returns a numerical value of relatedness or similarity, and nothing in the measure (except for the Hirst?St-Onge measure) indicates which values count as ?close?.
  Moreover, the values from the dif- ferent measures are incommensurate.
  We therefore set the threshold of relatedness of each measure at the value at which it separated the higher level of the Rubenstein?
  Goodenough pairs (the near-synonyms) from the lower level, as we described in Sec- tion 4.4.2.
  5.3 Results Malapropism detection was viewed as a retrieval task and evaluated in terms of preci- sion, recall, and F-measure.
  Observe that semantic relatedness is used at two different places in the algorithm ?
  to judge whether an original word of the text is related to any nearby word and to judge whether a spelling variation is related ?
