 where there are at least two members present in each column, and all combinations indicated in this structure are present in the corpus, and, in addition, each stem is found with no other suffix.
    (This last condition does not hold for the suffixes; a suffix may well appear in other signatures, and this is the difference between stems and affixes.
    )&amp;quot; If we have a morphological pattern of five suffixes, let us say, and there is a large set of stems that appear with all five suffixes, then that set will give rise to a regular signature with five suffixal members.
    This simple pattern would be perturbed by the (for our purpose) extraneous fact that a stem appearing with these suffixes should also appear with some other suffix; and if all stems that associate with these five suffixes appear with idiosyncratic suffixes (i.e., each different from the others), then the signature of those five suffixes would never emerge.
    In general, however, in a given corpus, a good proportion of stems appea
