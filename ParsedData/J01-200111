, and information retrieval have all contributed to the literature on automatic morphological analysis.
    (As noted earlier, our primary concern here is with morphology and not with regular allomorphy or morphophonology, which is the study of the changes in the realization of a given morpheme that are dependent on the grammatical context in which it appears, an area occasionally confused for morphology.
    Several researchers have explored the morphophonologies of natural language in the context of two-level systems in the style of the model developed by Kimmo Koskenniemi [1983], Lauri Karttunen [1993], and others.)
    The only general review of work in this area that I am aware of is found in Langer (1991), which is ten years old and unpublished.
    Work in automatic morphological analysis can be usefully divided into four major approaches.
    The first approach proposes to identify morpheme boundaries first, and thus indirectly to identify morphemes, on the basis of the degree of predictability of the
