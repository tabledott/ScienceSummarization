ed when the conjuncts consist of single verb tokens.
    The Treebank contains 349 VPs in which a verb form (/VB/) is immediately followed by a conjunction (CC) and another verb form, and has an NP sister (without any coindexation or function tag).
    In CCGbank, sections 02&#8211;21 alone contain 444 sentences with verbal or adjectival right node raising.
    Right node raising is also marked in the Penn Treebank using *RNR* traces for &#8220;parasitic gap&#8221; constructions such as the following: These sentences require rules based on the substitution combinator S (Steedman 1996).
    Our treatment of right node raising traces deals with the first case correctly, via the backward crossing rule &lt;S&#215;, and allows us to obtain the following correct dependencies: The second type of parasitic gap, (44b), would be handled equally correctly by the forward substitution rule &gt;S, since the PPs are both arguments.
    Unfortunately, as we saw in Section 3, the Treebank classifies such PPs as directional ad
