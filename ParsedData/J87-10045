    0362-613X/87 /010031-46$ 03.00 shift-reduce parsing algorithm deterministically guided by a parsing table indicating what action should be taken next.
    The parsing table can be obtained automatically from a context-free phrase structure grammar, using an algorithm first developed by DeRemer (1969, 1971).
    We do not describe the algorithms here, referring the reader to chapter 6 in Aho and Ullman (1977).
    We assume that the reader is familiar with the standard LR parsing a
