es that are translations of one another.
    Although algorithms like these are extremely simple, many of the correlations between English and French words are so pronounced as to fall prey to almost any effort to expose them.
    Thus, the correlation of pairs like (eau I water), (lait I milk), (pourquoi I why), (chambre I house), and many others, simply cannot be missed.
    They shout from the data, and any method that is not stone deaf will hear them.
    But many of the correlations speak in a softer voice: to hear them clearly, we must model the translation process, as Brown et al. (1988) suggest and as Brown et al.
    (1990) and the current paper actually do.
    Only in this way can one hope to hear the quiet call of (marquees d'un asterisque starred) or the whisper of (qui s'est fait bousculer I embattled).
    The series of models that we have described constitutes a mathematical embodiment of the powerfully compelling intuitive feeling that a word in one language can be translated into a word or p
