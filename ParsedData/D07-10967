 as opposed to parsing based on constituent analysis, is that it extends naturally to languages with free or flexible word order.
			This explains the interest in recent years for multilingual evaluation of dependency parsers.
			Even before the 2006 shared task, the parsers of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000), originally developed for English, had been adapted for dependency parsing of Czech, and theparsing methodology proposed by Kudo and Mat sumoto (2002) and Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) had been evaluated on both Japanese and English.
			The parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006) had been applied to English, Czech and Danish, and theparser of Nivre et al (2007) to ten different languages.
			But by far the largest evaluation of mul tilingual dependency parsing systems so far was the2006 shared task, where nineteen systems were eval uated on data from thirteen languages (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).
			One of the conclusions from the 2006 shared task was that parsing accuracy differed greatly between languag
