e Brown parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) and the Berkeley parser (Petrov et al., 2006; Petrov and Klein, 2007), which not only can perform their own part-of-speech tagging but normally give better parsing accuracy when they are allowed to do so.
    This suggests that joint models for tagging and parsing might improve accuracy also in the case of dependency parsing.
    It has been argued that joint morphological and syntactic disambiguation is especially important for richly inflected languages, where there is considerable interaction between morphology and syntax such that neither can be fully disambiguated without considering the other.
    Thus, Lee et al. (2011) show that a discriminative model for joint morphological disambiguation and dependency parsing outperforms a pipeline model in experiments on Latin, Ancient Greek, Czech and Hungarian.
    However, Li et al. (2011) and Hatori et al.
    (2011) report improvements with a joint model also for Chinese, which is not a richly inflected language but
