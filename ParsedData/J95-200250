    5.2.2 Computing outer probabilities.
    The outer probabilities are computed by tracing the complete paths from the final state to the start state, in a single backward pass over the Earley chart.
    Only completion and scanning steps need to be traced back.
    Reverse scanning leaves outer probabilities unchanged, so the only operation of concern is reverse completion.
    We describe reverse transitions using the same notation as for their forward counterparts, annotating each state with its outer and inner probabilities.
    Reverse completion.

    Then 0/ += 0/, The inner probability 7 is not used.
    Rationale.
    Relative to )3, 0' is missing the probability of expanding Y, which is filled in from 7&amp;quot;.
    The probability of the surrounding of Y(/3&amp;quot;) is the probability of the surrounding of X(0), plus the choice of the rule of
