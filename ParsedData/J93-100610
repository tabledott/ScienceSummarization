rown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) is based on a hidden Markov model for the generation of aligned pairs of corpora, whose parameters are estimated from a large text.
    For an application of this method to the Canadian Hansard, good results are reported.
    However, the problem was also considerably facilitated by the way the implementation made use of Hansard-specific comments 139 Linguistics Volume 19, Number German: Length in wards CO German: Length in chars 40 60 80 120 200 400 600 800 English: Length in words English: Length in chars Figure 6 Lengths of Aligned Paragraphs are Correlated: Robust regression between lengths of aligned paragraphs.
    Left: length measured in words.
    Right: length measured in characters. and annotations: these are used in a preprocessing step to find anchors for sentence alignment such that, on average, there are only ten sentences in between.
    Moreover, corpus is for the near literalness of its translations, and it is therefore unclear to what extent the good results are
