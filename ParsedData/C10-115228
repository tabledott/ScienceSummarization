			We may conclude that TSM and Moses have different architectures and BLEU or NIST isnot suitable for comparing them.
			Here is an exam ple to illustrate this: (CW): ?Almost as soon as heleaves, Annius and the guard Publius arrive to es cort Vitellia to Titus, who has now chosen her as his empress.?
			(SW): ?Almost as soon as he leaves,Annius and the guard Publius arrive to take Vitellia to Titus, who has now chosen her as his empress.?
			(Moses): The same as (SW).
			(TSM): ?An nius and the guard Publius arrive to take Vitellia to Titus.
			Titus has now chosen her as his empress.?In this example, Moses generates an exactly iden tical sentence to SW, thus the BLUE and NIST scores of Moses is the highest.
			TSM simplifies the complex sentence by dropping, splitting and substitution, which results in two sentences that are quite different from the SW sentence and thus gets lower BLUE and NIST scores.
			Nevertheless, the sentences generated by TSM seem better than Moses in terms of simplification.
