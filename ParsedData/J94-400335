he criterion for choosing the parameters: if we wish to use small counts, then a should be small, and 6 depends on the required ratio between n1 and n2.
    The optimal values of the parameters should be determined empirically and might depend on the corpora and parsers we use.
    In the previous section, we assumed that the source sentence contains only one ambiguous syntactic tuple.
    In general there may be several ambiguous words that appear in several tuples.
    We should take advantage of the occurrence patterns of all of the tuples to reach a decision.
    Since different relations may favor different translations for an ambiguous word, we should devise a strategy for selecting a consistent translation for all words in the sentence.
    We have used the following constraint propagation algorithm, which receives as input the list of all source tuples along with their alternative translations to target tuples: To illustrate the algorithm, we consider Table 1 using the parameters a = 0.1 and 0 = 0.2.
