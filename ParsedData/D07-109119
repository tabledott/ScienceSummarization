hoden(methods), with a mismatch between the determiner (singular) and the noun (plural), while the adjective is ambiguous.
			In a manual evaluation of intra-NP agreement we found that the factored model reduced the disagreement error within noun phrases of length ? 3 from 15% to 4%.
			English?Spanish systems were trained on a 40,000 sentence subset of the Europarl corpus.
			Here,we also used morphological and part-of-speech fac tors on the output side with an 7-gram sequence model, resulting in absolute improvements of 1.25%(only morph) and 0.84% (morph+POS).
			Improve ments on the full Europarl corpus are smaller.
			English-Czech systems were trained on a 20,000sentence Wall Street Journal corpus.
			Morphologi cal features were exploited with a 7-gram languagemodel.
			Experimentation suggests that it is beneficial to carefully consider which morphological fea tures to be used.
			Adding all features results inlower performance (27.04% BLEU), than consider ing only case, number and gender (27.45% BLEU)
