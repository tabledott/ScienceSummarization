ower lost in other relatively impoverished models of language.
  
  
    In essence, our algorithm works by harnessing several powerful, empirically-observed properties of language, namely the strong tendency for words to exhibit only one sense per collocation and per discourse.
    It attempts to derive maximal leverage from these properties by modeling a rich diversity of collocational relationships.
    It thus uses more discriminating information than available to algorithms treating documents as bags of words, ignoring relative position and sequence.
    Indeed, one of the strengths of this work is that it is sensitive to a wider range of language detail than typically captured in statistical sense-disambiguation algorithms.
    Also, for an unsupervised algorithm it works surprisingly well, directly outperforming Schiitze's unsupervised algorithm 96.7 % to 92.2 %, on a test of the same 4 words.
    More impressively, it achieves nearly the same performance as the supervised algorithm given identical tra
