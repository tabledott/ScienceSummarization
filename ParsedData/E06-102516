    The benchmark (i.e. test set) we use for our experiments is the General Inquirer (GI) lexicon (Stone et al., 1966).
    This is a lexicon of terms labelled according to a large set of categories6, each one denoting the presence of a specific trait in the term.
    The two main categories, and the ones we will be concerned with, are Positive/Negative, which contain 1,915/2,291 terms having a positive/negative orientation (in what follows we will also refer to the category Subjective, which we define as the union of the two categories Positive and Negative).
