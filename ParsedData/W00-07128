t; form what we call a pair of potential morphological variants (PPMVs).
    We define the ruleset of a given rule to be the set of all PPM Vs that have that rule in common.
    For instance, from Figure 2, the ruleset for (&amp;quot;s&amp;quot;, NULL) would be the pairs &amp;quot;cars/car&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cares/care.&amp;quot; Our algorithm establishes a list which identifies the rulesets for every hypothesized rule extracted from the data and then it must proceed to determine which rulesets or PPM Vs describe true morphological relationships.
    Deerwester, et al. (1990) showed that it is possible to find significant semantic relationships between words and documents in a corpus with virtually no human intervention (with the possible exception of a human-built stop word list).
    This is typically done by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to a matrix, M, where each entry M(i,j) contains the frequency of word i as seen in document j of the corpus.
    This methodology is referred to as Lat
