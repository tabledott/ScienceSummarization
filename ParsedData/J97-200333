al states: and define M as M -= L + R. Let (ui, u2) be in (E*)2.
    By definition of d, there exists U E E* such that: This proves that S is M-Lipschitzian5 and a fortiori that it has bounded variation.
    Conversely, suppose that S has bounded variation.
    Since S is rational, according to the theorem of Schtitzenberger (1961) it is recognizable and therefore there exists a string-to-weight transducer 7- = (Q, I, F, E, 6, a, p) realizing S. As in the case of string-to-string transducers, one can show that any transducer admits an equivalent trim unambiguous transducer.
    So, without loss of generality we can assume T trim and unambiguous.
    Furthermore, we describe in the next sections a determinization algorithm.
    We show that this algorithm applies to any transducer that has the twins property Thus, in order to show that S is subsequentiable, it is sufficient to show that T has the twins property Consider two states q and q' of T and let (u, v) E (E* )2 be such that: Since T is trim there exists
