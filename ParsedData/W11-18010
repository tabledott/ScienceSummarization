  Overview of BioNLP Shared Task 2011
  
    The BioNLP Shared Task 2011, an information extraction task held over 6 months up to March 2011, met with community-wide participation, receiving 46 final submissions from 24 teams.
    Five main tasks and three supporting tasks were arranged, and their results show advances in the state of the art in fine-grained biomedical domain information extraction and demonstrate that extraction methods successfully generalize in various aspects.
  
  
    The BioNLP Shared Task (BioNLP-ST, hereafter) series represents a community-wide move toward fine-grained information extraction (IE), in particular biomolecular event extraction (Kim et al., 2009; Ananiadou et al., 2010).
    The series is complementary to BioCreative (Hirschman et al., 2007); while BioCreative emphasizes the short-term applicability of introduced IE methods for tasks such as database curation, BioNLP-ST places more emphasis on the measurability of the state-of-the-art and traceability of challenges in e
