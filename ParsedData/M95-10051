he models of the IDENT equivalence relation, and this strategy is preferable for a number of reasons, on e being that the scores are independent of the particular links used to encode th e equivalence relation .
  The scores themselves are obtained by determining the minima l perturbations to the response that are required to transform its corresponding equivalenc e classes into those of the key .
  Specifically, the recall (respectively precision) error term s are found by calculating the least number of links that need to be added to the respons e (respectively the key) in order to have the classes align .
  Although at first blush thi s seems combinatorially explosive, due to references to minimal spanning subsets of th e equivalence relation, it turns out it can be accomplished with a very simple countin g scheme .
  A PROBLEMATIC CAS E Consider the first problematic example from the coreference task guidelines : ?
  Key Links : &lt;A-B B-C B-D&gt; ?
  Response Links: &lt;A-B C-D&gt; Note that the key lin
