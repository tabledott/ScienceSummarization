    In this paper, we present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach to automatically tokenize (segmenting off clitics), part-ofspeech (POS) tag and annotate base phrases (BPs) in Arabic text.
    We adapt highly accurate tools that have been developed for English text and apply them to Arabic text.
    Using standard evaluation metrics, we report that the SVM-TOR tokenizer achieves an score of 99.12, the SVM-POS tagger achieves an accuracy of 95.49%, and the SVM-BP chunker yields an score of 92.08. your (yours), your (yours) [masc. dual], your (yours) [masc. pl.
