he parser had analyzed &amp;quot;my aunt&amp;quot;, but no further, might include the following predications: where the verb node named v1 dominates &amp;quot;drove&amp;quot;, and the NP node named npl dominates the lexical material &amp;quot;my aunt&amp;quot;.
    Let us assume for the sake of simplicity that while building the PP &amp;quot;from Peoria's&amp;quot;, the parser detects a genitive marker on the proper noun &amp;quot;Peoria's&amp;quot; and knows (magically, for now) that &amp;quot;Peoria's car&amp;quot; is not the correct analysis.
    Given this, the genitive must mark the entire NP &amp;quot;my aunt from Peoria&amp;quot; and thus &amp;quot;my aunt from Peoria&amp;quot; must serve not as the object of the verb &amp;quot;drove&amp;quot; but as the determiner of some larger NP which itself must be the object of &amp;quot;drove&amp;quot;.
    (Unless it is followed by a genitive marker, in which case....) The question we are centrally interested in here is not how the parser comes to the realizati
