rwise comparisons that were annotated more than once by a single annotator.
    As for P(E), it should capture the probability that two annotators would agree randomly.
    Therefore: Note that each of the three probabilities in P(E)&#8217;s definition are squared to reflect the fact that we are considering the chance that two annotators would agree by chance.
    Each of these probabilities is computed empirically, by observing how often annotators actually rank two systems as being tied.
    We note here that this empirical computation is a departure from previous years&#8217; analyses, where we had assumed that the three categories are equally likely (yielding P(E) = 19 + 19 + 19 = 1&#65533;).
    We believe that this is a more principled approach, which faithfully reflects the motivation of accounting for P(E) in the first place.6 6Even if we wanted to assume a &#8220;random clicker&#8221; model, setting P(E) = 3 is still not entirely correct.
    Given that Table 7 gives n values for inter-annotator and
