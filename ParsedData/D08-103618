ing tagging is called the greedy 1-to-1 Then we use the dynamic programming sampler deaccuracy.
    The studies presented by Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) and Johnson (2007) differed in the number of states that they used.
    Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) evaluated against the reduced tag set of 17 tags developed by Smith and Eisner (2005), while Johnson (2007) evaluated against the full Penn Treebank tag set.
    We ran all our estimators in both conditions here (thanks to Noah Smith for supplying us with his tag set).
    Also, the studies differed in the size of the corpora used.
    The largest corpus that Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) studied contained 96,000 words, while Johnson (2007) used all of the 1,173,766 words in the full Penn WSJ treebank.
    For that reason we ran all our estimators on corpora containing 24,000 words and 120,000 words as well as the full treebank.
    We ran each estimator with the eight different combinations of values for the hyperparameters &#945; and &#945;' listed bel
