  Tense As Discourse Anaphor
  
    In this paper, I consider a range of English expressions and show that their context-dependency can be characterized in terms of two properties: 1.
    They specify entities in an evolving model of the discourse that the listener is constructing; 2.
    The particular entity specified depends on another entity in that part of the evolving &amp;quot;discourse model&amp;quot; that the listener is currently attending to. expressions have been called show how tensed clauses share these characteristics, usually just attributed to anaphoric noun phrases.
    This not only allows us to capture in a simple way the but difficult-to-prove intuition that is anaphoric, also contributes to our knowledge of what is needed for understanding narrative text.
