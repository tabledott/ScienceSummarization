 the linear precedence of segmental morphemes within a token is subject to constraints, the dominance relations among their mother and sister constituents is rather free.
    The relativizer f(&#8220;that&#8221;) for example, may attach to an arbitrarily long relative clause that goes beyond token boundaries.
    The attachment in such cases encompasses a long distance dependency that cannot be captured by Markovian processes that are typically used for morphological disambiguation.
    The same argument holds for resolving PP attachment of a prefixed preposition or marking conjunction of elements of any kind.
    A less canonical representation of segmental morphology is triggered by a morpho-phonological process of omitting the definite article h when occurring after the particles b or l. This process triggers ambiguity as for the definiteness status of Nouns following these particles.We refer to such cases in which the concatenation of elements does not strictly correspond to the original surface form as s
