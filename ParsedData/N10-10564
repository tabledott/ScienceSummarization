    (We defer detailed description of how we extract lexical edit instances from data to &#167;3.1.)
    We denote the collection of ~dk in ComplexEW and SimpleEW as C and S, respectively.
    There are at least four possible edit operations: fix (o1), simplify (o2), no-op (o3), or spam (o4).
    However, for this initial work we assume P(o4) = 0.4 Let P(oi  |A) be the probability that oi is applied to A, and P(a  |A, oi) be the probability of A &#8211;* a given that the operation is oi.
    The key quantities of interest are P(o2  |A) in S, which is the probability that A should be simplified, and P(a  |A, o2), which yields proper simplifications of A.
    We start with an equation that models the probability that a phrase A is edited into
