ften be classified into two broad categories.
    In the first category are those methods that employ approximate inference, typically through the use of linear time shift-reduce parsing algorithms (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Scholz, 2004; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).
    In the second category are those that employ exhaustive inference algorithms, usually by making strong independence assumptions, as is the case for edge-factored models (Paskin, 2001; McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b).
    Recently there have also been proposals for exhaustive methods that weaken the edge-factored assumption, including both approximate methods (McDonald and Pereira, 2006) and exact methods through integer linear programming (Riedel and Clarke, 2006) or branch-and-bound algorithms (Hirakawa, 2006).
    For grammar based models there has been limited work on empirical systems for non-projective parsing systems, notable exceptions include the work of Wang and Harper (2004).
