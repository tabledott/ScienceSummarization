way he can.
    In fact, both the simple inference and construction rules are necessary to derive the extended inference rules.
    The extended rules are specified by &amp;quot;meta-rules&amp;quot; which show how to construct new PC/PI rules from old ones.
    The first extended construction rule (EC.1) is: A can achieve that S recognizes that A wants the effect of ACT by achieving that S recognizes that A wants ACT to be done, assuming that S would infer that the effects of ACT are also desired.
    The same rule applies if we replace &amp;quot;wants the effect of ACT&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;wants ACT to be done&amp;quot; by any pair of Y and X, as given in Figure 1.
    We assume all these sutistitu(EC.1) If BsWA(X) =i=&gt; BW(Y) is a PI rule, then WA(BsWA(Y)) =c=&gt; WA(BsWA(X)) is a PC rule.
    Similarly we can generate the corresponding PI rule: (EI.1) If BsWA(X) =i=&gt; BW(Y) is a PI rule, then BsWA(BsWA(X)) =i=&gt; BsWA(BsWA(Y)) is a PI rule.
    EI.1 allows prefixing BsWA to plan inference rules.
