    In this paper we focus primarily ort the first goal.
    The crux of this research is the observation that translations can serve as a source of sense distinctions (Brown et al., 1991; Dagan, 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Dyvik, 1998; Ide, 2000; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999).
    A word that has multiple senses in one language is often translated as distinct words in another language, with the particular choice depending ort the translator and the contextualized meaning; thus the corresponding translation can be thought of as a sense indicator for the instance of the word in its context.
    Looking at parallel translations, it becomes evid
