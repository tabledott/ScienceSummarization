 PATR Phrase-Structure grammars as well as in the categorial PATR grammars, all graphs that may be connected with a word in the input string are either retrieved from the lexicon or from a cache of ah'eady built lexical graphs, or they are constructed on the spot fi'om the \[exical entries through the morphology and through lexical rules.
			For obvious reasons, this approach cannot be used in conjunction with the categorial model just proposed.
			If all adjuncts are included in the valency list, and if moreover all acceptable linearizations are performed in the extended lexicon, there is no upper bound on the number of acceptable lexieal graphs for functors.
			This means that lexical entries cannot be fully instantiated when the word is recognized.
			\]'hey need to be instantiated incrementally as potential arguments are encountered.
			In Uszkoreit (1985b) it is argued that the ordered valency lists of a functor admitted by the lexical \[nstantiation rules form a regular language.
