 lower purity when compared to the Senseval-2 noun grouping as the granularity of the latter is much finer than ODE (entropy is only partially affected by this difference, indicating that we are producing larger groups).
    Indeed, our gold standard (ODE), when compared to the Senseval groupings, obtains a low purity as well (0.75) and an entropy of 0.13.
  
  
    The main reason for building a clustering of WordNet senses is to make Word Sense Disambiguation a feasible task, thus overcoming the obstacles that even humans encounter when annotating sentences with excessively fine-grained word senses.
    As the semantic method outperformed the lexical overlap in the evaluations of previous Section, we decided to acquire a clustering on the entire WordNet sense inventory using this approach.
    As a result, we obtained a reduction of 33.54% in the number of entries (from 60,302 to 40,079 senses) and a decrease of the polysemy degree from 3.14 to 2.09.
    These figures exclude monosemous senses and derivativ
