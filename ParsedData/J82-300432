currently achieve because the re-organization is taking advantage of a number of combinatoric regularities, especially convolution, that are not easily encoded into a chart.
    Section 9 presents an example of the reorganization.
    13 There is a difference between these two sentences because &amp;quot;put&amp;quot; subcategorizes for two objects unlike &amp;quot;see.&amp;quot; Suppose we analyze &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; as lexically ambiguous between two senses, one that selects for exactly two objects like &amp;quot;put&amp;quot; and one that selects for exactly one object as in &amp;quot;I saw it.&amp;quot; The first sense contributes the same number of parses as &amp;quot;put&amp;quot; and the second sense contributes an additional Catalan factor.
    Perhaps it is worthwhile to reformulate chart parsing in our terms in order to show which of the above results can be captured by such an approach and which cannot.
    Traditionally, chart parsers maintain a chart (or matrix) M, whose entries M1 contain th
