d category systems.
    Second. and perhaps more critically, because only certain of the information in a rule is used to guide the parse, say major category information, only such information can be used to filter spurious hypotheses by top-down filtering.
    Note that this problem occurs even if filtering by the rule information is used to eliminate at the earliest possible time constituents and partial constituents proposed during parsing (as is the case in the PATR-II implementation and the 'See. for instance, the coordination and copular &amp;quot;be&amp;quot; analyses from CPSC [41, the nested VP analysis used in some PATR-Il grammars 1151, or almost all categorial analyses, in which general rules of combination play the role of specific phrase-structure rules.
    Earley algorithm given below; cf. the Xerox LFG system).
    Thus, if information about subcategorization is left out of the category information in the context-free skeleton, it cannot be used to eliminate prediction edges.
    For example,
