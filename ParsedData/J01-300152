l point worth noting is that in LDOCE, influence has a verb sense which the part-of-speech filter removed from consideration, and consequently this sense is not included in the feature-vector representation.
    The TiMBL algorithm is trained on tokens presented in this format.
    When disambiguating unannotated text, the algorithm is applied to data presented in the same format without the classification.
    The unclassified vectors are then compared with all the training examples, and it is assigned the class of the closest one.
  
  
    The evaluation of WSD algorithms has recently become a much-studied area.
    Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992a), Resnik and Yarowsky (1997), and Melamed and Resnik (2000) each presented arguments for adopting various evaluation strategies, with Resnik and Yarowsky's proposal directly influencing the set-up of SENSEVAL (Kilgarriff 1998).
    At the heart of their proposals is the ability of human subjects to mark up text with the phenomenon in question (WSD in this case)
