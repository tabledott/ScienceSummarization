nal configuration cm, i.e., Gcm = (Vx, Acm).
    Assuming that the calls o(c) and t(c) can both be performed in constant time, the worst-case time complexity of a deterministic parser based on a transition system S is given by an upper bound on the length of transition sequences in S. When building practical parsing systems, the oracle can be approximated by a classifier trained on treebank data, a technique that has been used successfully in a number of systems (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004; Attardi, 2006).
    This is also the approach we will take in the experimental evaluation in Section 4.
  
  
    Having defined the set of configurations, including initial and terminal configurations, we will now focus on the transition set T required for dependency parsing.
    The total set of transitions that will be considered is given in Figure 2, but we will start in Section 3.1 with the subset Tp (p for projective) consisting of the first three.
    In Section 3.2, we will add the fourth transi
