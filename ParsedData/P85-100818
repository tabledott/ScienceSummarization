ch that plE, X), we define the interpretation of &lt; 1(p), &gt;. suppose we have a functional predicates into We can define the corresponding predicate be such that true if there are a predicate p and a constant the interpretation of is &lt; 1(p), I(X) &gt; true. fact that we can define such a predicate a moderately rich model means that we are licensed to treat opaque adverbials as properties of events and conditions.
    The purpose of this exercise is only to show the viability of approach.
