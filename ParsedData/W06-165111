ressions in order to identify opinion sources.
			Other previous research focuses only on the extraction of opinion expressions (e.g. Kim and Hovy (2005a), Munson et al (2005) andWilson et al (2005)), omitting source identifica tion altogether.There have also been previous efforts to simultaneously extract entities and relations by ex ploiting their mutual dependencies.
			Roth and Yih (2002) formulated global inference using aBayesian network, where they captured the influ ence between a relation and a pair of entities via the conditional probability of a relation, given a pair of entities.
			This approach however, could not exploit dependencies between relations.
			Roth and Yih (2004) later formulated global inference using integer linear programming, which is the approach that we apply here.
			In contrast to our work, Roth and Yih (2004) operated in the domain of factualinformation extraction rather than opinion extraction, and assumed that the exact boundaries of en tities from the gold standard are kn
