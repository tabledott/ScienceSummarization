 word generating superieures.
    But an expert privy to the fact that 50% was among the next few words might be more inclined to select greater or higher.
    Similarly, in the second example, the incorrect rendering of II as He might have been avoided had the translation model used the fact that the word following it is appears.
    In the hope of rectifying these errors, we consider the problem of context-sensitive modeling of word translation.
    We envision, in practice, a separate maximum entropy model, p e(y1x), for each English word e, where pe(Y1x) represents the probability that an expert translator would choose y as the French rendering of e, given the surrounding English context x.
    This is just a slightly recast version of a longstanding problem in computational linguistics, namely, sense disambiguation&#8212;the determination of a word's sense from its context.
    We begin with a training sample of English-French sentence pairs (E, F) randomly extracted from the Hansard corpus, such that E
