t a kernel method for extracting the relations person&#8211;affiliation and organization&#8211;location.
    For example, in the sentence John Smith is the chief scientist of the Hardcom Corporation, there is a person&#8211;affiliation relation between John Smith and Hardcom Corporation (Zelenko, Aone, and Richardella 2003).
    This is similar to the problem of classifying semantic relations (Section 3.4), except that information extraction focuses on the relation between a specific pair of entities in a specific document, rather than a general pair of words in general text.
    Therefore an algorithm for classifying semantic relations should be useful for information extraction.
    In the VSM approach to classifying semantic relations (Turney and Littman 2005), we would have a training set of labeled examples of the relation person&#8211;affiliation, for instance.
    Each example would be represented by a vector of pattern frequencies.
    Given a specific document discussing John Smith and Hardcom Corpor
