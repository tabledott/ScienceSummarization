  Automatic Labeling Of Semantic Roles
  
    We present a system for identifythe semantic relationships, or sefilled by constituents of a sentence within a semantic frame.
    Various lexical and syntactic features are derived from parse trees and used to derive statistical classifiers from hand-annotated training data.
  
  
    Identifying the semantic roles filled by constituents of a sentence can provide a level of shallow semantic analysis useful in solving a number of natural language processing tasks.
    Semantic roles represent the participants in an action or relationship captured by a semantic frame.
    For example, the frame for one sense of the verb &amp;quot;crash&amp;quot; includes the roles AGENT, VEHICLE and TO-LOCATION.
    This shallow semantic level of interpretation can be used for many purposes.
    Current information extraction systems often use domain-specific frame-and-slot templates to extract facts about, for example, financial news or interesting political events.
