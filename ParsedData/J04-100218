    There are verbs in LAB that strongly select for liquids, such as pour, flow, and freeze.
    In FINANCE, these verbs select for assets.
    In FINANCE there are verbs that strongly select for assets such as spend, invest, and tax.
    In the LAB domain, these verbs select for nothing in particular.
    This suggests that liquid is the source concept and asset is the target concept, which implies that LAB and FINANCE are the source and target domains, respectively.
    CorMet computes the overall polarity between two domains (as opposed to between two concepts) by summing over the polarity between each pair of high-salience concepts from the two domains of interest.
    Interconcept polarity is defined as follows: Let &#945; be the set of case slots in domain X with the strongest selectional preference for the node cluster A.
    Let &#946; be the set of case slots in domain Y with the strongest selectional preferences for the node cluster B.
    The degree of structure flow from A in X
