hreshold, it was not allowed to be classified by the Si or EHP method.
    Those NPs that fell between the two thresholds were considered occasionally existential.
    Occasionally existential NPs were handled by observing where the NPs first occurred in the text.
    For example, if the first use of &amp;quot;the guerrillas&amp;quot; was in the first few sentences of a text, it was usually an existential use.
    If the first use was later, it was usually a referential use because a prior definition appeared in earlier sentences.
    We applied an early allowance threshold of three sentences &#8211; occasionally existential NPs occuring under this threshold were classified as existential, and those that occurred above were left unclassified.

    We trained and tested our methods on the Latin American newswire articles from MUC4 (MUC-4 Proceedings, 1992).
    The training set contained 1,600 texts and the test set contained 50 texts.
    All texts were first
