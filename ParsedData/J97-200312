functions, which expresses their closure under composition.
    We use the expression p-subsequential in two ways here.
    One means that a finite number of Example of a subsequential transducer 72. ambiguities is admitted (the closure under composition matches this case), the second indicates that this number equals exactly p. Let f: E* &#8212;&gt; A* be a sequential (resp. p-subsequential) and g: A* -- 9* be a sequential (resp. q-subsequential) function, then g of is sequential (resp. pq-subsequential).
    We prove the theorem in the general case of p-subsequential transducers.
    The case of sequential transducers, first proved by Choffrut (1978), can be derived from the general case in a trivial way.
    Let T1 be a p-subsequential transducer representing f, Ti = (Qi,ii,h, E, A, 61, cri, pi), and T2 = (Q2/ i2/ F2, A, C/, 6'2, 0-2, P2) a q-subsequential transducer representing g. pi and p2 denote the final output functions of T1 and 72, which map Fi to (A*)P and F2 to (S2* )q, respectively. pi (r) repre
