 similarity of the component words.
    We do this by combining metrics of word-to-word similarity and language models into a formula that is a potentially good indicator of the semantic similarity of the two input texts.
    There is a relatively large number of word-to-word similarity metrics that were previously proposed in the literature, ranging from distance-oriented measures computed on semantic networks, to metrics based on models of distributional similarity learned from large text collections.
    From these, we chose to focus our attention on six different metrics, selected mainly for their observed performance in natural language processing applications, e.g. malapropism detection (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001) and word sense disambiguation (Patwardhan et al., 2003), and for their relatively high computational efficiency.
    We conduct our evaluation using the following word similarity metrics: Leacock &amp; Chodorow, Lesk, Wu &amp; Palmer, Resnik, Lin, and Jiang &amp; Conrath.
    Note that all th
