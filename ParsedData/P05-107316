o come up with a labeling that does not contain an obligatory argument.
    We added a whole label sequence feature template that extracts the labels of all argument nodes, and preserves information about the position of the predicate.
    The template also includes information about the voice of the predicate.
    For example, this template will be instantiated as follows for the example candidate argument sequence: [ voice:active ARG1,PRED,ARG4,ARGM-TMP] We also add a variant of this feature which uses a generic ARG label instead of specific labels.
    This feature template has the effect of counting the number of arguments to the left and right of the predicate, which provides useful global information about argument structure.
    As previously observed (Pradhan et al., 2004), including modifying arguments in sequence features is not helpful.
    This was confirmed in our experiments and we redefined the whole label sequence features to exclude modifying arguments.
    One important variation of this fea
