   It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating that relatively more of the content is as highly weighted as possible.
    The exact formula we use is computed as follows.
    Suppose the pyramid has n tiers, Ti, with tier Tn on top and Tl on the bottom.
    The weight of SCUs in tier Ti will be i.5 Let |Ti |denote the number of SCUs in tier Ti.
    Let Di be the number of SCUs in the summary that appear in Ti.
    SCUs in a summary that do not appear in the pyramid are assigned weight zero.
    The total SCU weight D is: The optimal content score for a summary with X SCUs is: In the equation above, j is equal to the index of the lowest tier an optimally informative summary will draw from.
    This tier is the first one top down such that the sum of its cardinality and the cardinalities of tiers above it is greater than or equal to X (summary size in SCUs).
    For example, if X is less than the cardinality of the most highly weighted tier, then j = n and Max is simply X xn (the product of X and the h
