ce for each discourse segment there exists a separate focus space.
    The dominance relations and satisfaction precedence relations determine the pushes and pops of this stack space.
    When a discourse segment purpose contributes to a discourse segment purpose of the immediately preceding discourse segment, the new focus space is pushed onto the stack.
    If the new discourse segment purpose contributes to a discourse segment purpose earlier in the discourse, focus spaces are popped off the stack until the discourse segment that the new one contributes to is on the top of the stack.
    It is crucial to this theory that the linguistic segments be identified, and as stated by Grosz and Sidner, this is a problem area.
    This paper will show that lexical chains are a good indication of the linguistic segmentation.
    When a lexical chain ends, there is a tendency for a linguistic segment to end, as the lexical chains tend to indicate the topicality of segments.
    If a new lexical chain begins, this is a
