an hand-labeled ACE data (Zhou et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2005), we do not know whether syntactic features can improve the performance of unsupervised or distantly supervised IE.
    Most previous research in bootstrapping or unsupervised IE has used only simple lexical features, thereby avoiding the computational expense of parsing (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Etzioni et al., 2005), and the few systems that have used unsupervised IE have not compared the performance of these two types of feature.
  
  
    Except for the unsupervised algorithms discussed above, previous supervised or bootstrapping approaches to relation extraction have typically relied on relatively small datasets, or on only a small number of distinct relations.
    Approaches based on WordNet have often only looked at the hypernym (is-a) or meronym (part-of) relation (Girju et al., 2003; Snow et al., 2005), while those based on the ACE program (Doddington et al., 2004) have been restricted in their evaluation to a small number
