ication of subsequential transducers is linear in the size of the string to which it applies.
    This property makes it worthwhile to use the power series determinization to speed up the application of transducers.
    Not all transducers can be determinized using the power series determinization.
    In the following section, we define a set of transducers that admit determinization, and characterize unambiguous transducers that admit the application of the algorithm.
    Since determinization does not apply to all transducers, it is important to be able to test the determinizability of a transducer.
    We present, in the next section, an algorithm to test this property in the case of unambiguous trim transducers.
    The proofs of some of the theorems in the next two sections are complex; they can be skipped on first reading.
    There are transducers with which determinization does not halt, but rather generates an infinite number of subsets.
    We define determinizable transducers as those transducers
