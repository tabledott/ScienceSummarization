the two senses: Due to the normalization factor in the denominator, these values are generally low, but unrelated senses have values much closer to 0.
    We chose SSI for the semantic matching function as it has the best performance among untrained systems on unconstrained WSD (cf.
    Section 4.1).
  
  
    We evaluated the accuracy of the mapping produced with the lexical and semantic methods described in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, respectively.
    We produced a gold-standard data set by manually mapping 5,077 WordNet senses of 763 randomlyselected words to the respective ODE entries (distributed as follows: 466 nouns, 231 verbs, 50 adjectives, 16 adverbs).
    The data set was created by two annotators and included only polysemous words.
    These words had 2,600 senses in the ODE.
    Overall, 4,599 out of the 5,077 WordNet senses had a corresponding sense in ODE (i.e. the ODE covered 90.58% of the WordNet senses in the data set), while 2,053 out of the 2,600 ODE senses had an analogous entry in WordNet
