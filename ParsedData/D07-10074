challenge to improve current SMT quality, and that it is still unclear what is the most appropriate integration framework for the WSD models in SMT.
			In this paper, we present first results with a new architecture that integrates a state-of-the-artWSD model into phrase-based SMT so as to per form multi-word phrasal lexical disambiguation, and show that this new WSD approach not only produces gains across all available Chinese-EnglishIWSLT06 test sets for all eight commonly used au tomated MT evaluation metrics, but also produces statistically significant gains on the much larger NIST Chinese-English task.
			The main differencebetween this approach and several of our earlier ap proaches as described in Carpuat and Wu (2005b) and subsequently Carpuat et al (2006) lies in the fact that we focus on repurposing the WSD systemfor multi-word phrase-based SMT.
			Rather than us ing a generic Senseval WSD model as we did inCarpuat and Wu (2005b), here both the WSD train ing and the WSD predictions are integrated in
