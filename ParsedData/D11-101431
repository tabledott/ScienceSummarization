interaction between context and polarity words in sentences in a unified framework while simultaneously learning the necessary features to make accurate predictions.
    Other approaches for sentence-level sentiment detection include (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Grefenstette et al., 2004; Ikeda et al., 2008).
    Most previous work is centered around a given sentiment lexicon or building one via heuristics (Kim and Hovy, 2007; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2007), manual annotation (Das and Chen, 2001) or machine learning techniques (Turney, 2002).
    In contrast, we do not require an initial or constructed sentiment lexicon of positive and negative words.
    In fact, when training our approach on documents or sentences, it jointly learns such lexica for both single words and n-grams (see Table 5).
    (Mao and Lebanon, 2007) propose isotonic conditional random fields and differentiate between local, sentence-level and global, document-level sentiment.
