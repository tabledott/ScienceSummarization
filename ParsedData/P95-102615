liable indicators of one of the target word's senses (e.g. flock and bulldozer for &amp;quot;crane&amp;quot;).
    A human judge must decide which one, but this can be done very quickly (typically under 2 minutes for a full list of 30-60 such words).
    Co-occurrence analysis selects collocates that span the space with minimal overlap, optimizing the efforts of the human assistant.
    While not fully automatic, this approach yields rich and highly reliable seed sets with minimal work.
  
  
    Unlike many previous bootstrapping approaches, the present algorithm can escape from initial misclassification.
    Examples added to the the growing seed sets remain there only as long as the probability of the classification stays above the threshold.
    IIf their classification begins to waver because new examples have discredited the crucial collocate, they are returned to the residual and may later be classified differently.
    Thus contexts that are added to the wrong seed set because of a misleading word in
