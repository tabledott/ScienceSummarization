ding tasks to proceed beyond these specific domains, we need semantic frames and semantic understanding systems that do not require a new set of slots for each new application domain.
    In this article we describe a shallow semantic interpreter based on semantic roles that are less domain specific than TO AIRPORT or JOINT VENTURE COMPANY.
    These roles are defined at the level of semantic frames of the type introduced by Fillmore (1976), which describe abstract actions or relationships, along with their participants.
    For example, the JUDGEMENT frame contains roles like JUDGE, EVALUEE, and REASON, and the STATEMENT frame contains roles like SPEAKER, ADDRESSEE, and MESSAGE, as the following examples show: These shallow semantic roles could play an important role in information extraction.
    For example, a semantic role parse would allow a system to realize that the ruling that is the direct object of change in (3) plays the same THEME role as the ruling that is the subject of change in (4): The fact t
