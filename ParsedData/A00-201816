nt constituent lp is conditioned upon even when it is not obviously related to the further conditioning events.
    This is due to the importance of this factor in parsing, as noted in, e.g., [14].
    In keeping with the standard methodology [5, 9,10,15,17], we used the Penn Wall Street Journal tree-bank [16] with sections 2-21 for training, section 23 for testing, and section 24 for development (debugging and tuning).
    Performance on the test corpus is measured using the standard measures from [5,9,10,17].
    In particular, we measure labeled precision (LP) and recall (LR), average number of crossbrackets per sentence (CB), percentage of sentences with zero cross brackets (OCB), and percentage of sentences with &lt; 2 cross brackets (2CB).
    Again as standard, we take separate measurements for all sentences of length &lt; 40 and all sentences of length &lt; 100.
    Note that the definitions of labeled precision and recall are those given in [9] and used in all of the previous work.
    As noted in [5
