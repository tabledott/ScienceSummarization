nd Taiwan or Hong Kong.
    Because of time limitation, we have only spent two days on transforming our GB-coded ICTCLAS to BIG5coded lexical analyzer.
    For each BIG5 closed, we extracted a BIG5-coded core lexicon.
    Then, the Compared with other systems, ICTCLAS especially GB-coded version is competitive.
    In both GB-coded closed tracks, ICTCLAS ranked top.
    ICTCLAS also rank second position in Peking open track.
    Because of the lack of resources, CTB open track is almost as same as CTB closed track.
    The final performance in BIG5 track is not very good.
    As a preliminary BIG-coded system, however, we are satisfied with the result.
    As is shown in Table 1, It could also be concluded that class-based segmentation HMM is effective.
    Excepted for CTB, IV Recall is over 97%.
  
  
    Through the first bakeoff, we have learn more about the development in Chinese word segmentation and become more confident on our HHMMbased approach.
    At the same time, we really find our problems durin
