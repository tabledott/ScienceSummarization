lgorithm since there was no benefit.
    The set of seed patterns listed in Table 1 are indicative of the management succession extraction task and were used for these experiments.
  
  
    Results for both the document and sentence filtering experiments are reported in Table 2 which lists precision, recall and F-measure for each approach on both evaluations.
    Results from the document filtering experiment are shown on the left hand side of the table and continuous F-measure scores for the same experiment are also presented in graphical format in Figure 2.
    While the document-centric approach achieves the highest F-measure of either system (0.83 on the 33rd iteration compared against 0.81 after 48 iterations of the semantic similarity approach) it only outperforms the proposed approach for a few iterations.
    In addition the semantic similarity approach learns more quickly and does not exhibit as much of a drop in performance after it has reached its best value.
    Overall the semantic similarity ap
