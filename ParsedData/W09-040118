vided data did as well as commercial vendors in half of the language pairs.
    The table also lists the best systems among those which used only the provided materials.
    To determine this decision we excluded unconstrained systems which employed significant external resources.
    Specifically, we ruled out all of the commercial systems, since Google has access to significantly greater data sources for its statistical system, and since the commercial RBMT systems utilize knowledge sources not available to other workshop participants.
    The remaining systems were research systems that employ statistical models.
    We were able to draw distinctions between half of these for each of the language pairs.
    There are some borderline cases, for instance LIMSI only used additional monolingual training resources, and LIUM/Systran used additional translation dictionaries as well as additional monolingual resources.
