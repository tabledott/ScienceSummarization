    Negative reviews may contain many apparently positive phrases even while maintaining a strongly negative tone, and the opposite is also common.
    This paper introduces an approach to classifying texts as positive or negative using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a well-known and powerful tool for classification of vectors of real-valued features (Vapnik, 1998).
    The present approach emphasizes the use of a variety of diverse information sources, and SVMs provide the ideal tool to bring these sources together.
    We describe the methods used to assign values to selected words and phrases, and we introduce a method of bringing them together to create a model
