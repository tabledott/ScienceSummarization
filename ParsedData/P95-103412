he symbolic knowledge in the PENMAN system with the statistical knowledge in our language model.
    We took a semantic representation generated automatically from a short Japanese sentence.
    We then used PENMAN to generate 3,456 English sentences corresponding to the 3,456 (= 27 &#8226; 33) possible combinations of the values of seven binary and three ternary features that were unspecified in the semantic input.
    These features were relevant to the semantic representation but their values were not extractable from the Japanese sentence, and thus each of their combinations corresponded to a particular interpretation among the many possible in the presence of incompleteness in the semantic input.
    Specifying a feature forced PENMAN to make a particular linguistic decision.
    For example, adding ( ident if iability&#8212;q t) forces the choice of determiner, while the : lex feature offers explicit control over the selection of open-class words.
    A literal translation of the input sentence was some
