e use a standard data set, which is the same corpus described in the Japanese Word Segmentation.
    3Usually, in Japanese, word boundaries are highly constrained by character types, such as hiragana and katakana (both are phonetic characters in Japanese), Chinese characters, English alphabets and numbers.
    Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the execution time, accuracy4, and |Q |(size of extracted subsets), by changing &#963; from 0.01 to 0.0005.
    The PKI leads to about 2 to 12 times improvements over the PKB.
    In JDP, the improvement is significant.
    This is because B, the average of h(i) over all items i &#8712; F, is relatively small in JDP.
    The improvement significantly depends on the sparsity of the given support examples.
    The improvements of the PKE are more significant than the PKI.
    The running time of the PKE is 30 to 300 times faster than the PKB, when we set an appropriate &#963;, (e.g., &#963; = 0.005 for EBC and JWS, &#963; = 0.0005 for JDP).
    In these settings, we could preserve t
