o a PER.
    To deal with this, we multiply the square roots of each estimate together to form the penalty term.
    The penalty term is then multiplied in a number of times equal to the length of the offending entity; this is meant to &#8220;encourage&#8221; the entity to shrink.7 For example, say we have a document with three entities, Rotor Volgograd twice, once labeled as PER and once as ORG, and Rotor, labeled as an ORG.
    The likelihood of a PER also being an ORG is 5 3151, and of an ORG also Due to the lack of a development set, our consistency model for the CMU Seminar Announcements is much simpler than the CoNLL model, the numbers where selected due to our intuitions, and we did not spend much time hand optimizing the model.
    Specifically, we had three constraints.
    The first is that all entities labeled as start time are normalized, and are penalized if they are inconsistent.
    The second is a corresponding constraint for end times.
    The last constraint attempts to consistently label th
