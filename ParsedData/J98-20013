    The work presented in this paper was inspired by the growing realization in the field of computational linguistics of the need for experimental evaluation of linguistic theories&#8212;semantic theories, in our case.
    The evaluation we are considering typically takes the form of experiments in which human subjects are asked to annotate texts from a corpus (or recordings of spoken conversations) according to a given classification scheme, and the agreement among their annotations is measured (see, for example, Passonneau and Litman 1993 or the papers in Moore and Walker 1997).
    These attempts at evaluation are, in part, motivated by the desire to put these theories on a more &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; footing by ensuring that the semantic judgments on which they are based reflect the intuiti
