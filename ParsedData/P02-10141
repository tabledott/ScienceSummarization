    A separate clustering mechanism then coordinates the possibly contradictory pairwise classifications and constructs a partition on the set of NPs.
    Soon et al. (2001), for example, apply an NP coreference system based on decision tree induction to two standard coreference resolution data sets (MUC-6, 1995; MUC7, 1998), achieving performance comparable to the best-performing knowledge-based coreference engines.
    Perhaps surprisingly, this was accomplished in a decidedly knowledge-lean manner &#8212; the learning algorithm has access to just 12 surface-level features.
    This paper presents an NP coreference system that investigates two types of extensions to the Soon et al. corpus-based approach.
    First, we propose and evaluate three extra-linguistic modifications to the machine learning framework, which together provide substantial and statistically significant gains in coreference resolution precision.
    Second, in an attempt to understand whether incorporating additional knowledge can
