    The results for VII and VIII indicate that attentional state plays a significant role in pronominal anaphora resolution and that even a simple model of attentional state can be quite effective.
    Deactivating the syntax-based elements of the salience weighting mechanism individually led to relatively small deteriorations in the overall success rate (II, III, IV, V. and VI).
    Eliminating the hierarchy of grammatical roles (VI), for example, led to a deterioration of less than 4%.
    Despite the comparatively small degradation in performance that resulted from turning off these elements individually, their combined effect is quite significant, as the results of IX show.
    This suggests that the syntactic salience factors operate in a complex and highly interdependent manner for anaphora resolution.
    X relies solely on syntactic/morphological filtering and proximity to choose an antecedent.
    Note that the sentence pairs of the blind test set were selected so that, for each pro
