  A Syntax-Directed Translator With Extended Domain Of Locality
  
    SD translation schema (synchronous grammar) (string relation) A syntax-directed translator first parses the source-language input into a parsetree, and then recursively converts the tree into a string in the target-language.
    We model this conversion by an extended treeto-string transducer that have multi-level trees on the source-side, which gives our system more expressive power and flexibility.
    We also define a direct probability model and use a linear-time dynamic programming algorithm to search for the best derivation.
    The model is then extended to the general log-linear framework in order to rescore with other fealike language models.
    We devise a simple-yet-effective algorithm to non-duplicate translations rescoring.
    Initial experimental results on English-to-Chinese translation are presented.
