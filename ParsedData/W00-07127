t;ed,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;es,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ing,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;e,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;eful.&amp;quot; We retain only the K most-frequent candidate affixes for subsequent processing.
    The value for K needs to be large enough to account for the number of expected regular affixes in any given language as well as some of the more frequent irregular affixes.
    We arbitrarily chose K to be 200 in our system.
    (It should also be mentioned that we can identify potential prefixes by inserting words into the trie in reversed order.
    This prefix mode can additionally serve for identifying capitalization.)
    Stage 3 Stage 4 ind wo-r\ pairs that are possible morphoWe next identify pairs of candidate affixes that descend from a common ancestor node in the trie.
    For example, (&amp;quot;s&amp;quot;, NULL) constitutes such a pair from Figure 2.
    We call these pairs rules.
    Two words sharing the same root and the same affix rule, such as &amp;quot;cars&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;car,&amp;quo
