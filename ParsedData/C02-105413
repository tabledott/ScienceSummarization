			Table 1 compares TinySVM and XQK in terms of CPU time taken to apply 33 classifiers to process the training data.

			For instance,TinySVM took 11,490.26 seconds (3.2 hours) in to tal for applying OTHER?s classifier to all vectors in the training data.
			Its initialization phase took 2.13 seconds and all vectors in the training data were classified in 11,488.13 ( *=#9#%X?%Q??9????x?#p? ) sec onds.
			On the other hand, XQK took 225.28 secondsin total and its initialization phase took 174.17 sec onds.
