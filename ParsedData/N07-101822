			In effect, G encodes the basic morphologi cal structure of the Sesotho verb (ignoring factors such as derivation morphology and irregular forms), but provides no information about the phonological identity of the morphemes.
			Note that G actually generates a finite language.However, G parameterizes the probability distribu tion over the strings it generates in a manner that would be difficult to succintly characterize except in terms of the productions given above.
			Moreover, with approximately 20 times more productions than training strings, each string is highly ambiguous and estimation is highly underconstrained, so it provides an excellent test-bed for sparse priors.
			We estimated the morphological parses t in two ways.
			First, we ran the IO algorithm initialized with a uniform initial estimate ?0 for ? to produce an estimate of the MLE ??, and then computed the Viterbi parses t?
			of the training corpus w with respect to the PCFG (G, ??).
			Second, we ran the Hastings sampler initialized wit
