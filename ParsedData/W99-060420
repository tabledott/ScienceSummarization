 criterion: This decision rule is an approximation to Eq.
    (1) which would use the translation probability p(lef).
    Using the simplification it is easy to integrate translation and language model in the search process as both models predict target words.
    As experiments have shown this simplification does not affect the quality of translation results.
    To allow the influence of long contexts we use a class-based five-gram language model with backing-off.
    The search space denoted by Eq.
    (8) is very large.
    Therefore we apply two preprocessing steps before the translation of a sentence: 1.
    We_determine the set of all source phrases in f for which an applicable alignment template exists.
    Every possible application of an alignment template to a sub-sequence of the source sentence is called alignment template instantiation.
    2.
    We now perform a segmentation of the input sentence.
    We search for a sequence of This is done efficiently by dynamic programming.
    Because of th
