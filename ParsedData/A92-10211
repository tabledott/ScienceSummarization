ing, searching for a better and more expressive set of rule templates and other variations on the simple but effective theme described below.
  
  
    There has been a dramatic increase in the application of probabilistic models to natural language processing over the last few years.
    The appeal of stochastic techniques over traditional rule-based techniques comes from the ease with which the necessary statistics can be automatically acquired and the fact that very little handcrafted knowledge need be built into the system.
    In contrast, the rules in rule-based systems are usually difficult to construct and are typically not very robust.
    One area in which the statistical approach has done particularly well is automatic part of speech tagging, assigning each word in an input sentence its proper part of speech [Church 88; Cutting et al. 92; DeRose 88; Deroualt and Merialdo 86; Garside et al.
    87; Jelinek 85; Kupiec 89; Meteer et al. 911.
    Stochastic taggers have obtained a high degree of accura
