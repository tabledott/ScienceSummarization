) in Example 78 is one where the domain consists of three entities (domain size = 3): D = {d1,d2,d3} F(loc) = {} F(book) = {d1,d2} F(seller) = {} F(clinton) = {d3} F(be) = {} F(of) = {(d1,d3)} F(agent) = {} F(big) = {} F(patient) = {}Model builders like Paradox generate finite mod els by iteration.
			They attempt to create a model for domain size 1.
			If they fail, they increase the domain size and try again, until either they find a model ortheir resources run out.
			Thus, although there are in finitely many models satisfying fol(drs(T)), modelbuilders generally build a model with a minimal do main size.

			3.5 Approximating Entailment.
			In an ideal world we calculate all the required back ground knowledge and by either finding a proof ora countermodel, decide how T and H relate with re spect to entailment.
			However, it is extremely hard to acquire all the required background knowledge.
			This is partly due to the limitati
