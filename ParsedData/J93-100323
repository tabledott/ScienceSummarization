    Also, using the Poisson distribution instead of the multinomial as the limiting distribution for the distribution of counts may provide some benefits.
    All of these possibilities should be tested.
    For the binomial case, the log likelihood statistic is given by &#8212;21og A = 2 [log L(pi, ki, ni) + log L(p2, k2, n2) &#8212; log L(p, ki, ni) &#8212; log L(p, k2, n2)] where For the multinomial case, this statistic becomes &#8212;2 log = 2 [log L(Pi , + log L(P2, K2) &#8212; log L(Q, ) &#8212; log L(Q, K2)] where kji Ei kii Ei kii Eii kii ki log pi
