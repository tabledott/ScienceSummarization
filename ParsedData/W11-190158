s using predicted data are shown in Tables 18 and 19.
    It can be observed that the relaxed, head word based, scoring does not improve performance very much.
    The only exception was the klenner system whose performance increased from 51.77 to 55.28.
    Overall, the ranking remained quite stable, though it did change for some adjacent systems which had very close exact match scores.
    In order to check how the systems did on various genres, we scored their performance per genre as well.
    Tables 20 and 21 summarize genre based performance for the closed and open track participants respectively.
    System performance does not seem to vary as much across the different genres as is normally the case with language processing tasks, which could suggest that coreference is relatively genre insensitive, or it is possible that scores are two low for the difference to be apparent.
    Comparisons are difficult, however, because the spoken genres were treated here with perfect speech recognition accuracy and
