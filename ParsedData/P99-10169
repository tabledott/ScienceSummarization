not assume any kind of semantic relationship among the hypernyms listed for a particular cluster.)
    Since these hypernyms are learned from the Wall Street Journal, they are domain-specific labels rather than the more general &amp;quot;thing/person&amp;quot;.
    However, if the hierarchy were to be used for text from the financial domain, these labels may be preferred.
    The next level of the hierarchy, the children of the root, is as shown in Table 1.
    (&amp;quot;Conductor&amp;quot; seems out-of-place on this list; see the next section for discussion.)
    These numbers do not add up to 20,014 because 1,288 nouns are attached directly to the root, meaning that they couldn't be clustered to any greater level of detail.
    These tend to be nouns for which little data was available, generally proper nouns (e.g., Reindel, Yaghoubi, Igoe).
    To evaluate the hierarchy, 10 internal nodes dominating at least 20 nouns were selected at random.
    For each of these nodes, we randomly selected 20 of the noun
