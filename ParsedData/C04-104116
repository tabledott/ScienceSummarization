raints, on the size of the packed charts used for model estimation.
			The disk usage is the space taken on disk by the charts,and the memory usage is the space taken in memory during the estimation process.
			The training sen tences are parsed using a number of nodes from a 64-node Beowulf cluster.3 The time taken to parse the training sentences depends on the supertagging and parsing constraints, and the number of nodes used, but is typically around 30 minutes.
			The first row of the table corresponds to using the least restrictive ? value of 0.01, and reverting to ? = 0.05, and finally ? = 0.1, if the chart size exceeds some threshold.
			The threshold was set at300,000 nodes in the chart.
			Packed charts are created for approximately 94% of the sentences in sec tions 2-21 of CCGbank.
			The coverage is not 100%because, for some sentences, the parser cannot pro vide an analysis, and some charts exceed the node limit even at the ? = 0.1 level.
			This strategy was used in our earlier work (Clark and Curr
