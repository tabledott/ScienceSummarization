er clusters.
    TRUMP's knowledge base contains three types of clusters: categorial, functional, and situational.
    The simplest type of cluster is the categorial cluster.
    These clusters consist of the sets of all senses sharing a particular conceptual parent.
    Since the conceptual hierarchy already encodes these clusters implicitly, we need not write formal cluster definitions for them.
    Obviously, a sense will belong to a number of categorial clusters, one for each element of its parent chain.
    The second type of cluster is the functional cluster.
    These consist of the sets of all senses sharing a specified functional relationship.
    For example, our system has a small number of part-whole clusters that list the parts associated with the object named by the cluster.
    Figure 12 shows the part-whole cluster cl-egg for parts of an egg.
    The third type of cluster, the situational cluster, encodes general relationships among senses on the basis of their being associated with a common s
