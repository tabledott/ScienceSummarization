termediate stages in an XG derivation, I will use bracketed strings, made up of A bracketed string is balanced if the brackets in it balance in the usual way.
    Now, an XG rule etc .
    ...un --&gt; V. can be applied to bracketed string s if s = x0u1x1u2 etc. xn_ unxn and each of the gaps x1, ..., xn_1 is balanced.
    The substring of s between xo and xn is the span of the rule application.
    The application rewrites s into new string t, replacing u1 by v followed by n-1 open brackets, and replacing each of u2, un by a close bracket; in short, s is replaced by xov&lt;&lt; ... &lt;x1 &gt;x&gt; ...
    The relation between the original string s and the derived string t is abbreviated as s =&gt; t. In the new string t, the substring between xo and xn is the result of the application.
    In particular, the application of a rule with a single segment in its left-hand side is no different from what it would be in a type-0 grammar Taking again the rule rel marker ... trace --&gt; rel pronoun. its application
