s at either end of the edge as long as they are labelled by the same symbol.
    The string language L(G) associated with G is the set of terminal strings appearing on the frontier of trees in T(G).
    We have given a reasonably precise definition of SA-trees since they play such an important role in the motivation for this work.
    We now describe informally a structure that can be used to encode a DTG derivation.
    A derivation graph for 7 E T(G) results from the addition of insertion edges to a SA-tree r for 7.
    The location in -y of an inserted elementary component a(i) can be unambiguously determined by identifying the source of the node (say the node with address n in the elementary d-tree a') with which the root of this occurrence of a(i) is merged with when d-edges are removed.
    The insertion edge will relate the two (not necessarily distinct) nodes corresponding to appropriate occurrences of a and a' and will be labelled by the pair (i, n).
    Each d-edge in elementary d-trees has an assoc
