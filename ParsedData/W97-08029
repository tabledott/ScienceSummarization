rdNet (Alonge, 1996, 43), we distinguish temporal inclusion by its characteristics that the first event is always a subevent of the second, and thus the relation is called subevent relation.
    The cause relation in WordNet is restricted to hold between verbs.
    We extend its coverage to account for resultative verbs by connecting the verb to its adjectival resultative state.
    For example offnen (to open) causes offen (open).
    Seleetional restrictions, giving information about typical nominal arguments for verbs and adjectives, are additionally implemented.
    They do not exist in WordNet even though their existence is claimed to be important to fully characterize a verbs lexical behavior (Fellbauna, 1993, 28).
    These selectional properties will be generated automatically by clustering methods once a sense&#8212;tagged corpus with GermaNet classes is available.
    Another additional pointer is created to account for regular polysemy in an elegant and efficient way, marking potential regular poly
