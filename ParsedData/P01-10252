n 4.1) are supplemented with precision and recall graphs (section 4.2) over the complete data sets.
    Samples comprising particular frequency strata (high versus low frequencies) are examined (section 4.3).
    In section 5, methods for the treatment of low-frequency data, single (hapaxlegomena) and double occurrences are discussed.
    The significance of differences between the AMs is addressed in section 6.
  
  
    A standard procedure for the evaluation of AMs is manual judgment of the -best candidates identified in a particular corpus by the measure in question.
    Typically, the number of true positives (TPs) among the 50 or 100 (or slightly more) highest ranked word combinations is manually identified by a human evaluator, in most cases the author of the paper in which the evaluation is presented.
    This method leads to a very superficial judgment of AMs for the following reasons: (1) The identification results are based on small subsets of the candidates extracted from the corpus.
