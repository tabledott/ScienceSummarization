 event extraction, it becomes much harder if one is replaced with a coreferencing expression.
    The CO task seeks to address this problem.
    The data sets for the task were produced based on MedCO annotation (Su et al., 2008) and other Genia resources (Tateisi et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2008).
    The REL task (Pyysalo et al., 2011b) involves the recognition of two binary part-of relations between entities: PROTEIN-COMPONENT and SUBUNITCOMPLEX.
    The task is motivated by specific challenges: the identification of the components of proteins in text is relevant e.g. to the recognition of Site arguments (cf.
    GE, EPI and ID tasks), and relations between proteins and their complexes relevant to any task involving them.
    REL setup is informed by recent semantic relation tasks (Hendrickx et al., 2010).
    The task data, consisting of new annotations for GE data, extends a previously introduced resource (Pyysalo et al., 2009; Ohta et al., 2010a).
    The REN task (Jourde et al., 2011) objective is to ext
