ng tokens; how many different values for DEPREL scoring tokens with HEAD=0 can have (if that number is 1, there is one designated label (e.g.
    &#8220;ROOT&#8221;) for tokens with HEAD=0); percentage of scoring tokens with HEAD=0, a head that precedes or a head that follows the token (this nicely shows which languages are predominantly head-initial or head-final); the average number of scoring tokens with HEAD=0 per parse tree unit; the percentage of (scoring and non-scoring) non-projective relations and of parse tree units with at least one non-projective relation.
    For the test data: number of scoring tokens; percentage of scoring tokens with a FORM or a LEMMA that does not occur in the training data. afinal punctuation was deliberately left out during the conversion (as it is explicitly excluded from the tree structure) bthe non-last IGs of a word are non-scoring, see Section 4.1 cin many cases the parse tree unit in PADT is not a sentence but a paragraph din many cases the unit in Sinica is not a sen
