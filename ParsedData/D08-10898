oses, which is to assign three distinct parameters (?m,?s,?d) for the three feature functions: ? fm = ?ni=1 log p(oi = M| . . .)
			fs = ?ni=1 log p(oi = S| . . .)
			fd = ?ni=1 log p(oi = D| . . .).
			There are two key differences between this work and previous orientation models (Tillman, 2004; Koehn et al, 2007): (1) the estimation of factors in Eq.
			3 from data; (2) the segmentation of e and f into phrases, which is static in the case of (Tillman, 2004; Koehn et al, 2007), while it is dynamically updatedwith hierarchical phrases in our case.
			These differ ences are described in the two next sections.
