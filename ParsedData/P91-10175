ared 79 times while none of the other three alternatives appeared more than twice.
    Thus we first prefer 'treaty' to 'contract' because of the noun compound 'peace treaty' and then proceed to prefer 'sign' since it appears most frequently having the object 'treaty' (the order of selection is explained in section 3).
    Thus in this case our method yielded the correct translation.
    Using this method, we take the point of view that some ambiguity problems are easier to solve at the level of the target language instead of the source language.
    The source language sentences are considered as a noisy source for target language sentences, and our task is to devise a target language model that prefers the most reasonable translation.
    Machine translation (MT) is thus viewed in part as a recognition problem, and the statistical model we use specifically for target word selection may be compared with other language models in recognition tasks (e.g.
    Katz (1985) for speech recognition).
