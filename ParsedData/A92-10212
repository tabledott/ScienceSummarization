    These stochastic part of speech taggers make use of a Markov model which captures lexical and contextual information.
    The parameters of the model can be estimated from tagged ([Church 88; DeRose 88; Deroualt and Merialdo 86; Garside et al. 87; Meteer et al.
    91]) or untag,ged ([Cutting et al. 92; Jelinek 85; Kupiec 89]) text.
    Once the parameters of the model are estimated, a sentence can then be automatically tagged by assigning it the tag sequence which is assigned the highest probability by the model.
    Performance is often enhanced with the aid of various higher level pre- and postprocessing procedures or by manually tuning the model.
    A number of rule-based taggers have been built [Klein and Simmons 63; Green and Rubin 71; Hindle 89].
    [Klein and Simmons 63] and [Green and Rubin 71] both have error rates substantially higher than state of the art stochastic taggers.
