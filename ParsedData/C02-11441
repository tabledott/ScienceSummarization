ambiguation (Leacock, Chodorow, Miller 1998) and Question Answering (Pasca and Harabagiu 2001).
			However, they often include many rare senses while missing domain-specific senses.
			For example, in WordNet, the words dog, computer and company all have a sense that is a hyponym of person.
			Such rare senses make it difficult for a coreference resolution system to use WordNet to enforce the constraint that personal pronouns (e.g. he or she) must refer to a person.
			On the other hand, WordNet misses the user-interface object sense of the word dialog (as often used in software manuals).
			One way to deal with these problems is to use a clustering algorithm to automatically induce semantic classes (Lin and Pantel 2001).
			Many clustering algorithms represent a cluster by the centroid of all of its members (e.g., K means) (McQueen 1967) or by a representative element (e.g., K-medoids) (Kaufmann and Rousseeuw 1987).
			When averaging over all elements in a cluster, the centroid of a cluster may be unduly inf
