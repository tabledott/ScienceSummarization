shown that it can indeed improve parser performance (Bacchiani et al., 2006; McClosky et al., 2006a; McClosky et al., 2006b).
    One possible use for this technique is for parser adaptation &#8212; initially training the parser on one type of data for which hand-labeled trees are available (e.g., Wall Street Journal (M. Marcus et al., 1993)) and then self-training on a second type of data in order to adapt the parser to the second domain.
    Interestingly, there is little to no data showing that this actually works.
    Two previous papers would seem to address this issue: the work by Bacchiani et al. (2006) and McClosky et al.
    (2006b).
    However, in both cases the evidence is equivocal.
    Bacchiani and Roark train the Roark parser (Roark, 2001) on trees from the Brown treebank and then self-train and test on data from Wall Street Journal.
    While they show some improvement (from 75.7% to 80.5% f-score) there are several aspects of this work which leave its results less than convincing as to the u
