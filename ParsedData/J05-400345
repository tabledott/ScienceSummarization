et al. 2004).
    We are aware of only three previous efforts aimed at discovering parallel sentences.
    Zhao and Vogel (2002) describe a generative model for discovering parallel sentences in the Xinhua News ChineseEnglish corpus.
    Utiyama et. al (2003) use cross-language information retrieval techniques and dynamic programming to extract sentences from an English-Japanese comparable corpus.
    Fung and Cheung (2004) present an extraction method similar to ours but focus on &#8220;very-non-parallel corpora,&#8221; aggregations of Chinese and English news stories from different sources and time periods.
    The first two systems extend algorithms designed to perform sentence alignment of parallel texts.
    They start by attempting to identify similar article pairs from the two corpora.
    Then they treat each of those pairs as parallel texts and align their sentences by defining a sentence pair similarity score and use dynamic programming to find the least-cost alignment over the whole document pair.
