  Arguments cannot overlap with the predicate.
  If a predicate is outside a clause, its arguments cannot be embedded in that clause.
  Arguments cannot exclusively overlap with the clauses.
  261 Computational Linguistics Volume 34, Number 2 Figure 1 An example of a parse tree and its predicate?argument structure.
  The first constraint comes from the definition of this task that the predicate simply cannot take itself or any constituents that contain itself as arguments.
  The other two constraints are due to the fact that a clause can be treated as a unit that has its own verb?argument structure.
  If a verb predicate is outside a clause, then its argument can only be the whole clause, but may not be embedded in or exclusively overlap with the clause.
  For the argument identification classifier, the features used in full parsing and shallow parsing settings are all binary features, which are described subsequently.
