 Table 3.
    The error rate reduction here of 65% is higher than on arguments only, because the baseline always labels (in error) adjuncts and &#8220;bad&#8221; slots.
    (Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) achieved 63.6% accuracy when having to identify arguments for thematic roles, though note again that this is on a much larger and more general test set.
    Also, although we take into account errors on identified chunks that are not arguments, we are are not counting chunker errors of missing arguments.)
    As others have shown (Gildea and Palmer, 2002), semantic role labelling is more accurate with better preprocessing of the data.
    However, we also think our algorithm may be extendable to deal with many of the adjunct cases we observed.
    Often, adjuncts express time or location; while not argument roles, these do express generalizable semantic relations.
    In future work, we plan to explore the notion of expanding our frame matching step to go beyond VerbNet by initializing potential adjuncts with ap
