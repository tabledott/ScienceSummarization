ring different systems on a large number of test sets of various sizes.
    In this paper, after providing some background, we will examine some properties of the widely used BLEU metric, discuss experimental design, introduce bootstrap resampling methods for statistical significance estimation and report on experimental results that demonstrate the accuracy of the methods.
  
  
    Statistical machine translation was introduced by work at IBM [Brown et al., 1990, 1993].
    Currently, the most successful such systems employ so-called phrase-based methods that translate input text by translating sequences of words at a time [Och, 2002; Zens et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Vogel et al., 2003; Tillmann, 2003] Phrase-based machine translation systems make use of a language model trained for the target language and a translation model trained from a parallel corpus.
    The translation model is typically broken down into several components, e.g., reordering model, phrase translation model, and word translation
