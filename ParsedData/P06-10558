ent annotations, leaving to the user the task of guessing what a good starting annotation might be.
    We take a different, fully automated approach.
    We start with a completely unannotated X-bar style grammar as described in Section 1.1.
    Since we will evaluate our grammar on its ability to recover the Penn Treebank nonterminals, we must include them in our grammar.
    Therefore, this initialization is the absolute minimum starting grammar that includes the evaluation nonterminals (and maintains separate grammar symbols for each of them).5 It is a very compact grammar: 98 symbols,6 236 unary rules, and 3840 binary rules.
    However, it also has a very low parsing performance: 65.8/59.8 LP/LR on the development set.
    Beginning with this baseline grammar, we repeatedly split and re-train the grammar.
    In each iteration we initialize EM with the results of the smaller grammar, splitting every previous annotation symbol in two and adding a small amount of randomness (1%) to break the symmetry.
