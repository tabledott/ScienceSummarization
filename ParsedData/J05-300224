ther tree.
    Given two trees T and T' with root nodes v and v', respectively, the similarity Sim(T,T') between the trees is defined to be the maximum of the three expressions NodeCompare(T,T'), maxs&#8712;c(T) Sim(Ts,T'), and maxs,&#8712;c(T') Sim(T,T,,).
    The upper part of Figure 4 depicts the computation of NodeCompare(T,T'), in which two top nodes are aligned with each other.
    The remaining expressions, maxs&#8712;c(T) Sim(Ts,T'), and maxs'&#8712;c(T') Sim(T, Ts,), capture mappings in which the top of one tree is aligned with one of the children of the top node of the other tree (the bottom of Figure 4).
    The maximization in the NodeCompare formula searches for the best possible alignment for the child nodes of the given pair of nodes and is defined by where M(A,A') is the set of all possible matchings between A and A', and a matching (between A and A') is a subset m of A x A' such that for any two distinct elements (a, a'), (b, b') E m, both a =&#65533; b and a' =&#65533; b'.
