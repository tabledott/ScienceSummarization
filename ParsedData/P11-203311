cies, which are projective dependency trees.
    Cer et al. (2010) report results on Stanford collapsed dependencies, which allow a word to have multiple heads and therefore cannot be produced by a regular dependency parser.
    Their results are relevant although not directly comparable with ours.
    Table 5 shows the results of our final parser, the pure transition-based parser of Zhang and Clark (2008), and the parser of Huang and Sagae (2010) on Chinese.
    We take the standard split of CTB and use gold segmentation and POS-tags for the input.
    Our scores for this test set are the best reported so far and significantly better than the previous systems.
