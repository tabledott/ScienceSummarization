acters long (though collocations up to four characters are also common).
    At the same time, there are several thousand characters in daily use, as in conversation or newspaper text.
    Such lexical differences make it even less obvious whether pure sentence-length criteria are adequately discriminating for statistical alignment.
    Our first goal, therefore, is to test whether purely length-based alignment results can be replicated for English and Chinese, languages from unrelated families.
    However, before length-based methods can be applied to Chinese, it is first necessary to generalize the notion of &amp;quot;number of characters&amp;quot; to Chinese strings, because most Chinese text (including our corpus) includes occasional English proper names and abbreviations, as well as punctuation marks.
    Our approach is to count each Chinese character as having length 2, and each English or punctuation character as having length 1.
    This corresponds to the byte count for text stored in the hybrid En
