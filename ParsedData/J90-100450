the nondeterminism of the call to chained_nodes.
    This general problem has to date received little attention, and no satisfactory solution is found in the logic grammar literature.
    More generally, the backtracking regimen of our implementation of the algorithm may lead to recomputation of results.
    Again, this is a general property of backtrack methods and is not particular to our application.
    The use of dynamic programming techniques, as in chart parsing, would be an appropriate augmentation to the implementation of the algorithm.
    Happily, such an augmentation would serve to eliminate the redundancy caused by the linking relation as well.
    Finally, to incorporate a general facility for auxiliary conditions in rules, some sort of delayed evaluation triggered by appropriate instantiation (e.g. wait declarations; Naish 1986) would be desirable, as mentioned in Section 3.4.
    None of these changes, however, constitutes restructuring of the algorithm; rather, they modify its realization in
