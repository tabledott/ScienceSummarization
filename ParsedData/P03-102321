    We introduced how to adopt the twincandidate model in our competition learning approach to resolve the coreference problem.
    Particularly, we proposed a candidate filtering algorithm that can effectively reduce the computational cost and data noises.
    The experimental results have proved the effectiveness of our approach.
    Compared with the baseline approach using the single-candidate model, the F-measure increases by 1.9 and 1.5 for MUC-6 and MUC-7 data set, respectively.
    The gains in the pronoun resolution contribute most to the overall improvement of coreference resolution.
    Currently, we employ the single-candidate classifier to filter the candidate set during resolution.
    While the filter guarantees the qualification of the candidates, it removes too many positive candidates, and thus the recall suffers.
    In our future work, we intend to adopt a looser filter together with an anaphoricity determination module (Bean and Riloff, 1999; Ng and Cardie, 2002b).
