o one of three types: ?
  CONTROL SHIFT  TYPES - ABDICATION: Okay, go on.
  - REPETITION/SUMMARY: That would be my recommendation a d that will ensure that you get a logically integral set of files.
  - I N T E R R U P T I O N :  It is something new though urn.
  ABDICATIONS 6 correspond to those cases where the controller produces a prompt as the last utterance of the segment.
  The class REPETI- TION/SUMMARY corresponds to the controller pro- ducing a redundant  utterance.
  The utterance is either an exact repetition of previous propositional content, or a summary that realizes a proposition, P, which could have been inferred from what came before.
  Thus orderly control shifts occur when the controller explicitly indicates that s/he wishes to relinquish control.
  What unifies ABDICATIONS and REPETITION/SUMMARIES is that the controller supplies no new propositional content.
  The re- maining class, INTERRUPTIONS, characterize shifts occurring when the noncontroller displays initia- tive by seizing control
