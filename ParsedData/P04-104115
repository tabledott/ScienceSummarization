tional probabilities with frames.
			Given a lemma l and an argument list s, the probability of s given l is estimated as: P(s|l) := count(l, s)?n i=1 count(l, si) Table 2 summarises the results.
			We extract 3586 verb lemmas and 10969 unique verbal semanticform types (lemma followed by non-empty argu ment list).
			Including prepositions associated with the subcategorised OBLs and particles, this number goes up to 14348.
			The number of unique frametypes (without lemma) is 38 without specific prepositions and particles, 577 with.
			F-structure anno tations allow us to distinguish passive and activeframes.
			Table 3 shows the most frequent seman tic forms for accept.
			Passive frames are marked p. We carried out a comprehensive evaluation of the automatically acquired verbal semantic forms against the COMLEX Resource (Macleod et al,1994) for the 2992 active verb lemmas that both resources have in common.
			We report on the evalu ation of GF-based frames for the full frames with complete prepositional an
