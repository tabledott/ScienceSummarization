en processed with the GENIA tagger (Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005; Tsuruoka et al., 2005), a bidirectional inference based tagger that analyzes English sentences and outputs the base forms, part-of-speech tags, chunk tags, and named entity tags in a tab-separated format.
    Additionally, we converted the annotation about scope of negation into a token-per-token representation, following the standard format of the 2006 CoNLL Shared Task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), where sentences are separated by a blank line and fields are separated by a single tab character.
    A sentence consists of a sequence of tokens, each one starting on a new line.
  
  
    We model this task in the same way that we modelled the task for finding the scope of negation (Morante and Daelemans, 2009), i.e., as two consecutive classification tasks: a first one that consists of classifying the tokens of a sentence as being at the beginning of a hedge signal, inside or outside.
    This allows the system to find multiword hedge cues.
