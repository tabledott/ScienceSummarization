d U.S. are locations; that any name containing Mr is a person; that any name containing Incorporated is an organization; and that I.B.M. and Microsoft are organizations).
    The key to the methods we describe is redundancy in the unlabeled data.
    In many cases, inspection of either the spelling or context alone is sufficient to classify an example.
    For example, in .., says Mr. Cooper, a vice president of.. both a spelling feature (that the string contains Mr.) and a contextual feature (that president modifies the string) are strong indications that Mr. Cooper is of type Person.
    Even if an example like this is not labeled, it can be interpreted as a &amp;quot;hint&amp;quot; that Mr and president imply the same category.
    The unlabeled data gives many such &amp;quot;hints&amp;quot; that two features should predict the same label, and these hints turn out to be surprisingly useful when building a classifier.
    We present two algorithms.
    The first method builds on results from (Yarowsky 95) a
