he experiments presented show that predictive class-based models trained using the obtained word classifications can improve the quality of a state-ofthe-art machine translation system as indicated by the BLEU score in both translation tasks.
    When using predictive class-based models in combination with a word-based language model trained on very large amounts of data, the improvements continue to be statistically significant on the test and nist06 sets.
    We conclude that even despite the large amounts of data used to train the large word-based model in our second experiment, class-based language models are still an effective tool to ease the effects of data sparsity.
    We furthermore expect to be able to increase the gains resulting from using class-based models by using more sophisticated techniques for combining them with word-based models such as linear interpolations of word- and class-based models with coefficients depending on the frequency of the history.
