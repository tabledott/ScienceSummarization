en of particular importance: The current tagset comprises only 16 node labels and 34 function tags, yet a. finely grinned classification will take place in the near future.
    We have argued that the selected approach is better suited for producing high quality interpreted corpora in languages exhibiting free constituent order.
    In general, the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.
    As modern linguistics is also becoming more aware of the importance of larger sets of naturally occurring data., interpreted corpora. are a. valuable resource for theoretical and descriptive linguistic research.
    In addition the approach provides empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation, since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions, linea.rizations, and attachments that have been observed in online experiments of language production and comprehension can now be put in relation with the frequency
