 a translation for hitqaddmut.
    Since this word, hitqaddmut, also appears in the tuple (noun-pp: hitqaddmut b- siha), we delete the six target tuples that are inconsistent with the selection of 'progress' (those containing the words 'advance' and 'advancement').
    There now remain only three alternative target tuples for hitqaddmut b- siha.
    We now recompute the values of Ba.
    The maximum value is Ba (7.5, 0.5) -= 0.836&gt; 0 (note that because tuples inconsistent with the previous decisions were eliminated, n2 dropped from 2 to 0, thus increasing 130).
    Thus, 'talk' is selected as the translation of sap.
    Now all the ambiguities have been resolved and the procedure stops.
    In the above example all the ambiguities were resolved since in each stage the value of 13&#8222; exceeded the threshold 6 = 0.2.
    In some cases not all ambiguities are resolved, though the number of ambiguities may decrease.
    It should be noted that other methods may be proposed for combining the statistics of se
