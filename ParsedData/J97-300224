    In bilingual parsing, just as with ordinary monolingual parsing, probabilizing the grammar permits ambiguities to be resolved by choosing the maximum-likelihood parse.
    Our algorithm is similar in spirit to the recognition algorithm for HMMs (Viterbi 1967) and to CYK parsing (Kasami 1965; Younger 1967).
    Let the input English sentence be e1,.
    , eT and the corresponding input Chinese sentence be cl, , cv.
    As an abbreviation we write e, t for the sequence of words es+i,es+2, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; , et, and similarly for cu v; also, es s = c is the empty string.
    It is convenient to use a 4-tuple of the form q = (s, t, u, v) to identify each node of the parse tree, where Growth in number of all legal subconstituent matchings (complete or partial, meaning that some subconstituents are permitted to remain unmatched as singletons) for context-free (syntax-directed) transduction grammars with rank r, versus ITGs on a pair of subconstituent sequences of length r each. the substrings e, and cv
