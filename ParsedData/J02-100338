    In Section 3.3, we proved intersective completeness for two versions of Dale and Reiter&#8217;s Incremental Algorithm, D&amp;R and D&amp;RAtt.
    We now prove Boolean completeness for D&amp;RBoolean, the Boolean extension of D&amp;RPlural.
    Theorem 3: Completeness of D&amp;RBOOk.
    Assume there are at most denumerably many properties, and finitely many distractors (one or more).
    Then if a set can be individuated distributively by any Boolean combination of properties, D&amp;RBoolean will find such a combination.
    Proof Any Boolean expression can be written in conjunctive normal form (CNF), that is, as an intersection of unions of literals (e.g., Fitting 1996).
    Theorem 3 follows from the following lemma.
    Lemma Let cp be a CNF formula whose longest union has a length of n (i.e., it conjoins n literals).
    Then D&amp;RBoolean will find a description cp' that is coextensive with cp, in at most n phases.
    This is proven by induction on the size of n. Basic case: If n = 1, the lemma
