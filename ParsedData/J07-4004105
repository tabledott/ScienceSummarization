ertagging level with &#946; = 0.075; the parser ignores the sentence if it cannot get an analysis at this level.
    The percentage of sentences without an analysis is now over 6% (with automatically assigned POS tags), but the parser is extremely fast, processing over 30 sentences per second.
    This configuration of the system would be useful for obtaining data for lexical knowledge acquisition, for example, for which large amounts of data are required.
    The oracle row gives the parser speed when it is provided with only the correct lexical categories, showing the speeds which could be achieved given the perfect supertagger.
    Table 11 gives the percentage of sentences which are parsed at each supertagger level, for both the new and old parsing strategies.
    The results show that, for the old approach, most of the sentences are parsed using the least restrictive setting of the supertagger (&#946; = 0.005); conversely, for the new approach, most of the sentences are parsed using the most restrictive
