average word frequency m the chain For example, m the third chain the representative words are "field" and "AI" Heur i s t i c  2 We therefore defined a second heu- ristic based on the notion of representative words For each chain m the summary representation, choose the sentence that contains the first appear- ance of a representative chain member m the text In this special case this heuristic gives the same result as the first one Heur i s t i c  3 Often, the same topic is dmcussed in a number of places in the text, so its chain is dL~tnbuted across the whole text Still, m some text unit, this global topic is the central topic (focus) of the segment We try to identify this umt and extract sentences related to the topic from this segment (or successive segments) only We characterize this text umt as a cluster of suc- cessive segments with high density of chain mere- beers Our tlnrd heuristic Is based on thts approach For each chain, find the text umt where the chain Is highly concentrated Extract the sentenc
