aining documents are marked as off-topic as they are either only weakly relevant to a topic or irrelevant to all topics in the existing documents.
    From the in-topic documents, most are found to have high similarity.
    A few of the Chinese and English passages are almost translations of each other.
    Nevertheless, the existence of a considerable amount of off-topic document gives rise to more variety of sentences in terms of content and structure.
    Overall, the TDT 3 corpus contains 110,000 Chinese sentences and 290,000 English sentences.
    Some of the bilingual sentences are translations of each other, while some others are bilingual paraphrases.
    Our proposed method is a first approach that can extract bilingual sentence pairs from this type of very-non-parallel corpus.
    To quantify the parallel-ness or comparability of bilingual corpora, we propose using a lexical matching score computed from the bilingual word pairs occurring in the bilingual sentence pairs.
