pect of these results is that, across all experiments, only the nouns are disambiguated with accuracy greater than that of the majority classifier.
    This is at least partially explained by the fact that, as a class, the nouns have the most uniform distribution of senses.
    This point will be elaborated on in Section 6.1.
    While the choice of feature set impacts accuracy, overall it is only to a small degree.
    We return to this point in Section 6.2.
    The final result, to be discussed in Section 6.3, is that the differences in the accuracy of these three algorithms are statistically significant both on average and for individual words.
    Extremely skewed distributions pose a challenging learning problem since the sample contains precious little information regarding minority classes.
    This makes it difficult to learn their distributions without prior knowledge.
    For unsupervised approaches, this problem is exacerbated by the difficultly in distinguishing the characteristics of the minority
