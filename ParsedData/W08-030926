aged over all translations directions into English and out of English6 For the into English direction the Meteor score with its parameters tuned on adequacy judgments had the strongest correlation with ranking the translations of whole sentences.
    It was tied with the combined method of Gimenez and Marquez (2008) for the highest correlation over all three types of human judgments.
    Bleu was the second to lowest ranked overall, though this may have been due in part to the fact that we were using test sets which had only a single reference translation, since the cost of creating multiple references was prohibitively expensive (see Section 2.1).
    In the reverse direction, for translations out of English into the other languages, Bleu does considerably better, placing second overall after the part-ofspeech variant on it proposed by Popovic and Ney (2007).
    Yet another variant of Bleu which utilizes Meteor&#8217;s flexible matching has the strongest correlation for sentence-level ranking.
