e contrary, the MaxEnt-based reordering model is not limited by this constraint since it is based on features of phrase, not phrase itself.
    It can be easily generalized to reorder unseen phrases provided that some features are fired on these phrases.
    Another advantage of the MaxEnt-based reordering model is that it can take more features into reordering, even though they are nonindependent.
    Tillmann et. al (2005) also use a MaxEnt model to integrate various features.
    The difference is that they use the MaxEnt model to predict not only orders but also blocks.
    To do that, it is necessary for the MaxEnt model to incorporate real-valued features such as the block translation probability and the language model probability.
    Due to the expensive computation, a local model is built.
    However, our MaxEnt model is just a module of the whole log-linear model of translation which uses its score as a real-valued feature.
    The modularity afforded by this design does not incur any computation p
