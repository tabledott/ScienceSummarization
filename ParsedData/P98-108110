he final performance measurements of all taggers.
    Both Tune and Test contain around 2.5% new tokens (wrt Train) and a further 0.2% known tokens with new tags.
    The data in Train (for individual taggers) and Tune (for combination taggers) is to be the only information used in tagger construction: all components of all taggers (lexicon, context statistics, etc.) are to be entirely data driven and no manual adjustments are to be done.
    The data in Test is never to be inspected in detail but only used as a benchmark tagging for quality measurement.&amp;quot;
  
  
    In order to see whether combination of the component taggers is likely to lead to improvements of tagging quality, we first examine the results of the individual taggers when applied to Tune.
    As far as we know this is also one of the first rigorous measurements of the relative quality of different tagger generators, using a single tagset and dataset and identical circumstances.
    The quality of the individual taggers (cf.
