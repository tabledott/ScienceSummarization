 find expressions for f and g such that either h = f(g) or h = Ax.f(g(x)).
    This limited form of the unification problem will allow us to define the ways to split h into subparts that can be recombined with CCG parsing operations, which we will define in the next section, to reconstruct h. CCG (Steedman, 2000) is a linguistic formalism that tightly couples syntax and semantics, and can be used to model a wide range of language phenomena.
    For present purposes a CCG grammar includes a lexicon A with entries like the following: where each lexical item w &#65533;- X : h has words w, a syntactic category X, and a logical form h expressed as a lambda-calculus expression.
    For the first example, these are &#8220;New York,&#8221; NP, and ny.
    CCG syntactic categories may be atomic (such as S, NP) or complex (such as S\NP/NP).
    CCG combines categories using a set of combinatory rules.
    For example, the forward (&gt;) and These rules apply to build syntactic and semantic derivations under the control
