ories): This rule says that a node of category LD can be lifted from its syntactic governor of category SG to its linear governor of category LG through a path consisting of nodes of category C1, , Cn, where the string belongs to L(w).
    Every set of lifting rules defines a particular property of pseudo-projectivity by imposing particular constraints on the lifting.
    A 21t is possible to define pseudo-projectivity purely structurally (i.e. without referring to the labeling).
    For example, we can impose that each node x is lifted to the highest ancestor of x covered by t- ((Nasr, 1996)).
    The resulting pseudo-projectivity is a fairly weak extension to projectivity, which nevertheless covers major nonprojective linguistic structures.
    However, we do not pursue a purely structural definition of pseudo-projectivity in this paper. linguistic example of lifting rule is given in Section 4.
    The idea of building a projective tree by means of lifting appears in (Kunze, 1968) and is used by (Hudson, 19
