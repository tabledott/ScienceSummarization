).
    It can be verified that &#181;(i, t) = v(i, t) for all (i, t), i.e., the marginals for single tags for &#181; and v agree.
    Thus, (&#181;, v) E 20.
    To demonstrate that this fractional point is not in conv(2), we give parameter values such that this fractional point is optimal and all integral points (i.e., actual parses) are suboptimal.
    For the tagging model, set 0(AA &#8594; A, 3) = 0(AB &#8594; B, 3) = 0, with all other parameters having a negative value.
    For the parsing model, set 0(X &#8594; A X,1,1, 3) = 0(X &#8594; A B, 2, 2, 3) = 0(X &#8594; B A, 2, 2, 3) = 0, with all other rule parameters being negative.
    For this objective, the fractional solution has value 0, while all integral points (i.e., all points in 2) have a negative value.
    By Theorem 5.2, the maximum of any linear objective over conv(2) is equal to the maximum over 2.
    Thus, (&#181;, v) E&#65533; conv(2).
    We used the following step size in our experiments.
    First, we initialized &#945;0 to equal 0.5, a
