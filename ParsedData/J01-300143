a categorization of words in the lexicon into subject areas&#8212;Yarowsky used the Roget large categories.
    In LDOCE, primary pragmatic codes indicate the general topic of a text in which a sense is likely to be used.
    For example, LN means &amp;quot;Linguistics and Grammar&amp;quot; and this code is assigned to some senses of words such as &amp;quot;ellipsis&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ablative&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bilingual&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;intransitive&amp;quot;.
    Roget is a thesaurus, so each entry in the lexicon belongs to one of the large categories; but over half (56%) of the senses in LDOCE are not assigned a primary code.
    We therefore created a dummy category, denoted by --, used to indicate a sense which is not associated with any specific subject area and this category is assigned to all senses without a primary pragmatic code.
    These differences between the structures of LDOCE and Roget meant that we had to adapt the original algorithm reported in Yarowsky (1992).
