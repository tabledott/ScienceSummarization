of application are met but the replacement is not carried out.
    That is, we must restrict the relation so that, disregarding for the moment the effect of overlapping applications, every substring of the form A0p in the first element of a pair corresponds to a Alpp in the second element of that pair.
    We can refine this restriction by framing it in terms of our context-marking brackets: the Replace relation must not contain a pair with the substring &lt;0&gt; in one element corresponding to something distinct from &lt;lp&gt; in the other.
    We might try to formulate this requirement by taking the complement of a relation that includes the undesired correspondences, as suggested by the expression This expression might be taken as the starting point for various augmentations that would correctly account for overlapping applications.
    However, pursuing this line of attack will not permit us to establish the fact that obligatory rules also define regular mappings.
    First, it involves the complement o
