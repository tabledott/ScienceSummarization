er (1979).
    Our heuristic matching algorithm also suggests wrong antecedents in cases like the rules in (43), when the last mention refers to a modified concept (the new rules are different from the previous ones).

    The rules will eliminate .
    Finally, the matching algorithm gets the wrong result in cases such as the population .
    . the voting population where the new information indicates a subset, superset, or part of a previously mentioned referent. basis of the tests just discussed, the heuristics that achieve the best results for anaphoric definite descriptions are: In Table 10 we present the overall results on anaphora classification and anaphora resolution for the version of the system that does not attempt to resolve bridging descriptions, for both training data and test data.
    The reason there are different figures for anaphora resolution and classification is that the system may correctly classify a descr
