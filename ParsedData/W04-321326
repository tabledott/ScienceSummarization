est sets indicates consistent behaviour that may generalize to a larger test set, at least on similar classes of verbs.
    When using general thematic roles with a small set of verb classes, the probability used for the baseline, , works very well for subjects and objects (which are primarily Agents and Themes, respectively, for our verbs).
    Indeed, when we examine each of the slot classes individually, we find that, for subjects and objects, the percent correct achieved by the algorithm is indistinguishable from the baseline (both are around 93%, for both subjects and objects).
    For PP objects, on the other hand, the baseline is only around 11% correct, while we achieve 78.5% correct, a 76% reduction in error rate.
    Clearly, when more roles are available, even becomes a weak predictor.5 We could just assign the default role for subjects and objects when using general thematic roles, but we think this is too simplistic.
    First, when we broaden our range of verb classes, subjects and objects will
