    This section formally describes our translation model.
    To make this paper comparable to (Brown et al., 1993), we use English-French notation in this section.
    We assume that an English parse tree is transformed into a French sentence.
    Let the English parse tree consist of nodes , and let the output French sentence consist of French words .
    Three random variables, ,, and are channel operations applied to each node.
    Insertion is an operation that inserts a French word just before or after the node.
    The insertion can be none, left, or right.
    Also it decides what French word to insert.
    Reorder is an operation that changes the order of the children of the node.
    If a node has three children, e.g., there are ways to reorder them.
    This operation applies only to non-terminal nodes in the tree.
    Translation is an operation that translates a terminal English leaf word into a French word.
    This operation applies only to terminal nodes.
