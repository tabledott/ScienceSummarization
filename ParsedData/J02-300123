    4.1.1 Phrase Type.
    Different semantic roles tend to be realized by different syntactic categories.
    For example, in communication frames, the SpEAKER is likely to appear as a noun phrase, Topic as a prepositional phrase or noun phrase, and MEDiUM as a prepositional phrase, as in: &#8220;[Speaker We ] talked [Topic about the proposal ] [Medium over the phone ] .&#8221; The phrase type feature we used indicates the syntactic category of the phrase expressing the semantic roles, using the set of syntactic categories of the Penn Treebank project, as described in Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz (1993).
    In our data, frame elements are most commonly expressed as noun phrases (NPs, 47% of frame elements in the training set), and prepositional phrases (PPs, 22%).
    The next most common categories are adverbial phrases (ADVPs, 4%), particles (e.g.
    &#8220;make something up&#8221;; PRTs, 2%) and clauses (SBARs, 2%, and Ss, 2%).
