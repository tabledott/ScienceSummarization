If it is represented as a list, the above goal would be written ?- sentence(sj LE LE 1).
    The last two arguments of the goal are 1 ]' to mean that the overall extraposition list goes from '[ ]' to '[ ]'; i.e., it is the empty list.
    Thus, no constituent can be repositioned into or out of the top level 'sentence'.
    In this paper I have proposed an extension of DCGs.
    The motivation for this extension was to provide a simple formal device to describe the structure of such important natural language constructions as relative clauses and interrogative sentences.
    In transformational grammar, these constructions have usually been analysed in terms of left extraposition, together with global constraints, such as the complex-NP constraint, which restrict the range of the extraposition.
    Global constraints are not explicit in the grammar rules, but are given externally to be enforced across rule applications.
    These external global constraints cause theoretical difficulties, because the formal pr
