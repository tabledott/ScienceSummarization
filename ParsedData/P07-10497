terminer or the noun that is the head of an NP, it may be easier for a learning algorithm if it did not have to make such a choice.
    The second difference between the structures can be seen in the link from know to sleeps.
    In the shortest common cover link set, there is a path of links connecting know to each of the words separating it from sleeps, while in the dependency structure no such links exist.
    This property, which I will refer to as adjacency plays an important role in incremental parsing, as explained in the next section.
    The last main difference between the representations is the assignment of depth to the common cover links.
    In the present example, this allows us to distinguish between the attachment of the external (subject) and the internal (object) arguments of the verb.
    Dependencies cannot capture this difference without additional labeling of the links.
    In what follows, I will restrict common cover links to having depth 0 or 1.
    This restriction means that any tr
