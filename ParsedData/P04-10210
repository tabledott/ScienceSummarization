  A Joint Source-Channel Model For Machine Transliteration
  
    Most foreign names are transliterated into Chinese, Japanese or Korean with approximate phonetic equivalents.
    The transliteration is usually achieved through intermediate phonemic mapping.
    This paper presents a new framework that allows direct orthographical mapping (DOM) between two different languages, through a joint source-channel model, also transliteration model (TM). the TM model, we automate the orthographic alignment process to derive the aligned transliteration units from bilingual dictionary.
    The TM under the DOM framework greatly reduces system development effort and provides a quantum leap in improvement in transliteration accuracy over that of other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.
    The modeling framework is validated through several experiments for English-Chinese language pair.
  
  
    In applications such as cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) and machine translation, there is an increasing
