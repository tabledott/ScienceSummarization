m any practical text processing task.
    Their lack of robustness is generally due to the difficulty in building knowledge bases that are sufficient for broad-scale processing.
    But a synthesis is possible.
    Applications can achieve greater accuracy by working at the level of word senses instead of word strings.
    That is, they would operate on text in which each word has been tagged with its sense.
    Robustness need not be sacrificed, however, because this tagging does not require a full-blown semantic analysis.
    Demonstrating this claim is one of the goals of this paper.
    Here is an example of the level of analysis a sense tagger would provide to an application program.
    Suppose that the input is (1): The agreement reached by the state and the EPA provides for the safe storage of the waste.
    The analysis would provide an application with the following information.
    Preliminary evidence suggests that having access to a sense tagging of the text improves the performance of informatio
