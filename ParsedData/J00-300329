s small, and higher-order models did not prove useful.
    (This observation, initially based on perplexity, is confirmed by the DA tagging experiments reported in Section 5.)
    Comparing P(U) and P(UIT), we see that speaker identity adds substantial information, especially for higher-order models.
    The relatively small improvements from higher-order models could be a result of lack of training data, or of an inherent independence of DAs from DAs further removed.
    The near-optimality of the bigram discourse grammar is plausible given conversation analysis accounts of discourse structure in terms of adjacency pairs (Schegloff 1968; Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974).
    Inspection of bigram probabilities estimated from our data revealed that conventional adjacency pairs receive high probabilities, as expected.
    For example, 30% of YES-NO-QUESTIONS are followed by YES-ANSWERS, 14% by NO-ANSWERS (confirming that the latter are dispreferred).
    COMMANDS are followed by AGREEMENTS in 23% of the ca
