 The server recorded the time when a set of sentences was given to a judge and the time when the judge returned the sentences.
    We divided the time that it took to do a set by the number of sentences in the set.
    The average amount of time that it took to assign fluency and adequacy to a single sentence was 26 seconds.6 The average amount of time it took to rank a sentence in a set was 20 seconds.
    The average amount of time it took to rank a highlighted constituent was 11 seconds.
    Figure 4 shows the distribution of times for these tasks.
    6Sets which took longer than 5 minutes were excluded from these calculations, because there was a strong chance that annotators were interrupted while completing the task.
    These timing figures are promising because they indicate that the tasks which the annotators were the most reliable on (constituent ranking and sentence ranking) were also much quicker to complete than the ones that they were unreliable on (assigning fluency and adequacy scores).
