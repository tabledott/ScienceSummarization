the number of frequent words, set according to Zipf&#8217;s law.
    The parameter 5 is used to force all tags to be enumerated before a word is seen more than 5 times.
  
  
    Ng and Low (2004) and Shi and Wang (2007) were described in the Introduction.
    Both models reduced the large search space by imposing strong restrictions on the form of search candidates.
    In particular, Ng and Low (2004) used character-based POS tagging, which prevents some important POS tagging features such as word + POS tag; Shi and Wang (2007) used an N-best reranking approach, which limits the influence of POS tagging on segmentation to the N-best list.
    In comparison, our joint model does not impose any hard limitations on the interaction between segmentation and POS information.4 Fast decoding speed is achieved by using a novel multiple-beam search algorithm.
    Nakagawa and Uchimoto (2007) proposed a hybrid model for word segmentation and POS tagging using an HMM-based approach.
    Word information is used to proc
