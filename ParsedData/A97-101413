lar convention ha.s been adopted for constructions in which scope ambiguities have syntactic effects but a one-to-one correspondence between scope and attachment. does not seem reasonable, cf. focus particles such as only or also.
    If the scope of such a word does not directly correspond to a tree node, the word is attached to the lowest node dominating all subconstituents appearing in its scope.
    A problem for the rudimentary argument. structure representations is the use of incomplete structures in natural language, i.e. phenomena such as coordination and ellipsis.
    Since a precise structural description of non-constituent coordination would require a. rich inventory of incomplete phrase types, we have agreed on a sort of unde.rspe.cified representations: the coordinated units are assigned structures in which missing lexical material is not represented at the level of primary links.
