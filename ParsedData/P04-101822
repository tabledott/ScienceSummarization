    A small fluctuation of NAME entities will impact the ACE-value more than many NOMINAL or PRONOUN entities.
    As discussed in Section 3.1, the start penalty can be used to balance the entity miss and false alarm.
    To see this effect, we decode the Devtest set by varying the start penalty and the result is depicted in Figure 2.
    The ACE-value and ECM-F track each other fairly well.
    Both achieve the optimal when .
    To see how the proposed algorithm works on the MUC data, we test our algorithm on the MUC6 data.
    To minimize the change to the coreference system, we first map the MUC data into the ACE style.
    The original MUC coreference data does not have entity types (i.e., &#8220;ORGANIZATION&#8221;, &#8220;LOCATION&#8221; etc), required in the ACE style.
    Part of entity types can be recovered from the corresponding named-entity annotations.
    The recovered named-entity label is propagated to all mentions belonging to the same entity.
    There are 504 out of 2072 mentions of
