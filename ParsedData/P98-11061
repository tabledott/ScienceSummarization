m that can generate pseudoprojective analyses and which is polynomially parsable.
    The paper is structured as follows.
    In Section 2, we introduce our notion of pseudoprojectivity.
    We briefly review a previously proposed formalization of projective dependency grammars in Section 3.
    In Section 4, we extend this formalism to handle pseudo-projectivity.
    We informally present a parser in Section 5.
  
  
    We will use the following terminology and notation in this paper.
    The hierarchical order (dominance) between the nodes of a tree T will be represented with the symbol -&lt;T and Whenever they are unambiguous, the notations -&lt; and -&#8249; will be used.
    When x y, we will say that x is a descendent of y and y an ancestor of x.
    The projection of a node x, belonging to a tree T, is the set of the nodes y of T such that y x.
    An arc between two nodes y and x of a tree T, directed from y to x will be noted either (y, x) or The node x will be referred to as the dependent and y as
