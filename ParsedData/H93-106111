  ConText then moves on to "men," the next content word, and the process repeats.
  If the word is missing, or ff the appropriate sense is missing, the tagger can insert comments calling for the necessary evisions of WordNet.
  Input to ConText In the current version of ConText, text to be tagged semanti- cally must be preprocessed to indicate collocations and proper nouns (by concatenating them with underscores) and to provide syntactic tags.
  Since different corpora come in different formats and so requke slighdy different prepro- cessing, we have not tried to incorporate the preprocessor into ConText it
