ailable for at least one component.5 Also, given a tokenized set of-tuples of parallel sentences, it is always possible to estimate a word-to-word translation model (e.g., Och &amp; Ney, 2003).6 A word-to-word translation model and a lexicalized monolingual grammar are sufficient to drive a synchronizer.
    For example, in Figure 6 a monolingual grammar has allowed only one dependency structure on the English side, and a word-to-word translation model has allowed only one word alignment.
    The syntactic structures of all dimensions of a multitree are isomorphic up to reordering of sibling nodes and deletion.
    So, given a fixed correspondence between the tree leaves (i.e. words) across components, choosing the optimal structure for one component is tantamount to choosing the optimal synchronous structure for all components.7 Ignoring the nonterminal labels, only one dependency structure is compatible with these constraints &#8211; the one indicated by dashed arrows.
