ables which could be further smoothed to provide more reliable distributions.
    Moreover, the triangulated phrase-tables can be easily combined with the standard sourcetarget phrase-table, thereby improving the coverage over unseen source phrases.
    As an example, consider Figure 1 which shows the coverage of unigrams and larger n-gram phrases when using a standard source target phrase-table, a triangulated phrase-table with one (it) and nine languages (all), and a combination of standard and triangulated phrase-tables (all+standard).
    The phrases were harvested from a small French-English bitext and evaluated against a test set.
    Although very few small phrases are unknown, the majority of larger phrases are unseen.
    The Italian and all results show that triangulation alone can provide similar or improved coverage compared to the standard sourcetarget model; further improvement is achieved by combining the triangulated and standard models (all+standard).
    These models and datasets will be des
