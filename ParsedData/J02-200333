associated probabilities, to represent the selectional preferences of a particular verb.
    The preferences and class-based probabilities are then used to estimate probabilities of the form p(n  |v, r), where n is a noun, v is a verb, and r is an argument slot.
    Li and Abe&#8217;s application of MDL requires the hierarchy to be in the form of a thesaurus, in which each leaf node represents a noun and internal nodes represent the class of nouns that the node dominates.
    The hierarchy is also assumed to be in the form of a tree.
    The class-based models consist of a partition of the set of nouns (leaf nodes) and a probability associated with each class in the partition.
    The probabilities are the conditional probabilities of each class, given the relevant verb and argument position.
    Li and Abe refer to such a partition as a &#8220;cut&#8221; and the cut together with the probabilities as a &#8220;tree cut model.&#8221; The probabilities of the classes in a cut, P, satisfy the following constrain
