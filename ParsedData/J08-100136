orative filtering (Joachims 2002) to parsing (Toutanova, Markova, and Manning 2004).
    Other discriminative formulations of the ranking problem are possible (Collins 2002; Freund et al. 2003); however, we leave this to future work.
    The size of the training and test instances for the Earthquakes and Accidents corpora (measured by the number of pairs that contain the original order and a random permutation of this order).
    Earthquakes 1,896 2,056 Accidents 2,095 2,087 Once the ranking function is learned, unseen renderings (xij,xik) of document di can be ranked simply by computing the values w*&#934;(xij) and w*&#934;(xik) and sorting them accordingly.
    Here, w* is the optimized parameter vector resulting from training.
    Data.
    To acquire a large collection for training and testing, we create synthetic data, wherein the candidate set consists of a source document and permutations of its sentences.
    This framework for data acquisition enables large-scale automatic evaluation and is widely us
