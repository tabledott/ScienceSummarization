 the mean level of polysemy for the tested words is a six-way distinction in WordNet as compared to a three-way distinction in Roget's thesaurus.
    As an aside, a rich taxonomy like WordNet permits a more continuous view of the sense vs. homograph distinction.
    For example, town has three senses in WordNet, corresponding to an administrative district, a geographical area, and a group of people.
    Given town as the object of leave, selectional preference will produce a tie between the first two senses, since both inherit their score from a common ancestor, (location).
    In effect, the automatic selection of a class higher in the taxonomy as having the highest score provides the same coarse category that might be provided by a homograph/sense distinction in another setting.
    The choice of coarser category varies dynamically with the context: as the argument in rural town, the same two senses still tie, but with (region) (a subclass of (location)) as the common ancestor that determines the score.
