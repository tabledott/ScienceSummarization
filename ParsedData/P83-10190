    Discussion the rules for Fidditch are written as deterministic pattern-action rules of the same sort as the rules in the parsing grammar, their operation is in a sense isolable.
    The patterns of the self-correction rules are checked first, before any of the grammar rule patterns are checked, at each step in the parse.
    Despite this independence in terms of rule ordering, the operation of the self-corr,:ction component is closely tied to the grammar of the parser; for it is the parsing grammar that specifies what sort of constituents count as the same for copying. example, if the grammar did not treat a noun phrase when it is subject of a sentence, the self-correction rules could not properly resolve a sentence like People-a people from Kennsington the editing rules would never recognize that the same sort of element.
