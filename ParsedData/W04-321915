 and k is the maximal number of replacements for any word).
    In addition, fast algorithms exist for computing the n-best lists over a lattice (Soong &amp; Huang 1991).
    Finally the resultant paraphrases were cleaned up in a post-processing phase to ensure output was not trivially distinguishable from other systems during human evaluation.
    All generic named entity tokens were re-instantiated with their source values, and case was restored using a model like that used in Vita et al. (2003).
    Barzilay &amp; Lee (2003) have released a common dataset that provides a basis for comparing different paraphrase generation systems.
    It consists of 59 sentences regarding acts of violence in the Middle East.
    These are accompanied by paraphrases generated by their Multi-Sequence Alignment (MSA) system and a baseline employing WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), along with human judgments for each output by 2-3 raters.
    The MSA WordNet baseline was created by selecting a subset of the words in each test sentence
