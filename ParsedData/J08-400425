ance, following a long tradition of using variance to measure reliability (see citations in Rajaratnam 1960; Krippendorff 1970).
    A sample&#8217;s variance s2 is defined as the sum of square differences from the mean SS = &#8721;(x &#8722; &#175;x)2 divided by the degrees of freedom df .
    Variance is a useful way of looking at agreement if coders assign numerical values to the items, as in magnitude estimation tasks.
    Each item in a reliability study can be considered a separate level in a single-factor analysis of variance: The smaller the variance around each level, the higher the reliability.
    When agreement is perfect, the variance within the levels (s2within) is zero; when agreement is at chance, the variance within the levels is equal to the variance between the levels, in which case it is also equal to the overall variance of the data: s2within = s2between = s2total.
    The ratios s2within/s2between (that is, 1/F) and s2within/s2total are therefore 0 when agreement is perfect and 1 when ag
