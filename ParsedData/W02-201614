s (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000) are summarized in Table 2.
    We cannot employ the experiments for the probabilistic model using large dataset, since the data size is too large for our current SVMs learning program to terminate in a realistic time period.
    Even though the number of training examples used for the cascaded chunking model is less than a quarter of that for the probabilistic model, and the used feature set is the same, dependency accuracy and sentence accuracy are improved using the cascaded chunking model (89.09% &#8594; 89.29%, 46.17% &#8594; 47.53%).
    The time required for training and parsing are significantly reduced by applying the cascaded chunking model (336h.&#8594;8h, 2.1sec.&#8594; 0.5sec.).
    As can be seen Table 2, the cascaded chunking model is more accurate, efficient and scalable than the probabilistic model.
    It is difficult to apply the probabilistic model to the large data set, since it takes no less than 336 hours (2 weeks) to carry out the experiments even with the s
