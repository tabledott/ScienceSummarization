    In their article on classifying semantic relations, Moldovan et al. (2004) suggest that an important application of their work is question answering (QA).
    As defined in the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) QA track, the task is to answer simple questions, such as &#8220;Where have nuclear incidents occurred?&#8221;, by retrieving a relevant document from a large corpus and then extracting a short string from the document, such as The Three Mile Island nuclear incident caused a DOE policy crisis.
    Moldovan et al. (2004) propose to map a given question to a semantic relation and then search for that relation in a corpus of semantically tagged text.
    They argue that the desired semantic relation can easily be inferred from the surface form of the question.
    A question of the form &#8220;Where... ?&#8221; is likely to be looking for entities with a location relation and a question of the form &#8220;What did ... make?&#8221; is likely to be looking for entities with a product relation.
