 } In the parsing stage we retain for each &amp;quot;N-best&amp;quot; hypothesis (W, T(k)), k = 1 .

    .
    N, only the quantity 0(w77-0)) = p(w, T(0) / N-,N1 ' p k/w7 T(k)) and its derivation(W,T(k)).
    We then scan all the derivations in the &amp;quot;development set&amp;quot; and, for each occurrence of the elementary event (y(m) , x(m)) in derivation(W,T(k)) we accumulate the value 0(W, T(k)) in the C(m)(y(m), x(m)) counter to be used in the next iteration.
    The intuition behind this procedure is that 0(W, T(k)) is an approximation to the P(T(k)/W) probability which places all its mass on the parses that survived the parsing process; the above procedure simply accumulates the expected values of the counts Om) (y(m) , x(m)) under the 0(W, T(k)) conditional distribution.
    As explained previously, the Om) (y(m) , x(m)) counts are the parameters defining our model, making our procedure similar to a rigorous EM approach (Dempster et al., 1977).
