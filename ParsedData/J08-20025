own that these are strongly correlated with the word sense of the verb (Roland and Jurafsky 2002).
    If verbs were disambiguated for sense, the semantic roles of phrases would be closer to independent given the sense of the verb.
    However, because in almost all semantic role labeling work (including ours), the word sense is unknown and the model conditions only on the lemma, there is much joint information between arguments when conditioning only on the verb lemma.
    For example, compare: In the first case the noun phrase after passed is an ARG1, whereas in the second case it is a ARGM-LOC, with the choice governed by the sense of the verb pass.
    Secondly, even with same sense of a verb, different patterns of argument realization lead to joint information between arguments.
    Consider: (4) The meal that the ogre cooked the children is still remembered.
    Despite both examples having an identical surface syntax, knowing that the ARG1 of cook is expressed by the initial noun meal in the second exa
