gmatic relations in MindNet.
    Training: over 100,000 word pairs from a thesaurus and anti-thesaurus produced 285,000 semrel paths containing approx.
    13,500 unique path patterns.
    Testing: over 100,000 (different) word pairs from a thesaurus and anti-thesaurus were evaluated using the path patterns.
    Similar correct Dissimilar correct 84% 82% Human benchmark: random sample of 200 similar and dissimilar word pairs were evaluated by 5 humans and by MindNet: Similar correct Dissimilar correct This powerful similarity procedure may also be used to extend the coverage of the relations in MindNet.
    Equivalent to the use of similarity determination in corpus-based approaches to infer absent n-grams or triples (e.g., Dagan et al. 1994, Grishman and Sterling 1994), an inference procedure has been developed which allows semantic relations not presently in MindNet to be inferred from those that are.
    It also exploits the top-ranked paths between the words in the relation to be inferred.
