    If the object or subject of a clause is not found, Fidditch leaves it empty, as in the last two clauses in Figure 1.
    This non-committal approach simply reduces the effective size of the sample.
    The aim of the parser is to produce an annotated surface structure, building constituents as large as it can, and reconstructing the underlying clause structure when it can.
    In sentence (1), six clauses are found.
    Their predicate-argument information may be coded as a table of 5-tupks, consisting of verb, surface subject, surface object, underlying subject, underlying obje
