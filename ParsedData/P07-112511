e same vein, for the case of entity/relation extraction and classification (Collins and Singer, 1999; Zhang, 2004; Chen et al., 2006) the context of the entity or entities in consideration provides a highly relevant feature space.
    Another interesting factor in our formulation of hedge classification is that the nspec class is defined on the basis of the absence of hedge cues, rendering it hard to model directly.
    This characteristic is also problematic in terms of selecting a reliable set of nspec seed sentences, as by definition at the beginning of the learning cycle the learner has little knowledge about what a hedge looks like.
    This problem is addressed in section 10.3.
    In this study we develop a learning model based around the concept of iteratively predicting labels for unlabelled training samples, the basic paradigm for both co-training and self-training.
    However we generalise by framing the task in terms of the acquisition of labelled training data, from which a supervised classifier
