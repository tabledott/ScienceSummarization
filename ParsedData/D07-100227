			Column NoAnnot refers to questions for which no semantic role labeling is possible because annotated sentences for the relevant predicates are missing.
			For instance,there are no annotations for win (e.g., Q: What divi sion did Floyd Patterson win?
			) or for hit (e.g., Q: What was the Beatles?
			first number one hit?
			Thisproblem is not specific to our method which admit tedly relies on FrameNet annotations for performingthe semantic role assignment (see Section 4).
			Shal low semantic parsers trained on FrameNet would also have trouble assigning roles to predicates for which no data is available.
			Finally, column NoMatch reports the number of questions which cannot be answered due to frame 18 Data Total NoFrame NoAnnot NoMatch Rest TREC02 444 87 (19.6) 29 (6.5) 176 (39.6) 152 (34.2) TREC03 380 55 (14.5) 30 (7.9) 183 (48.2) 112 (29.5) TREC04 203 47 (23.1) 14 (6.9) 67 (33.0) 75 (36.9) TREC05 352 70 (19.9) 23 (6.5) 145 (41.2) 114 (32.4)
