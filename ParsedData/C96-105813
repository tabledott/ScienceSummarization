  r]he contrast recalls an ohl debate over spoken language, as to whether its properties are driven by hearers acoustic needs (coml)rehen- sion) or speakers articulatory needs (generation).
  Models A and B suggest that spe~kers produce text in such a way that the grammatical relations can be easily decoded by a listener, given words preferences to associate with each other and tags preferences to follow each other.
  But model C says that speakers primary goal is to flesh out the syn tactic and conceptual structure [or each word they utter, surrounding it with arguments, modifiers, and flmction words as appropriate.
  According to model C, speakers hould not hesitate to add ex- tra prepositionM phrases to a noun, even if this lengthens ome links that are ordinarily short, or leads to tagging or attachment mzJ)iguities.

  Each time a word i is added, it generates a Markov sequence of (tag,word) pairs to serve, as its left children, and an separat
