ce, but also critical in the application to state-of-the art parsers such as (Collins, 2003) and (Charniak, 2000).In Collins?
			parsing model, for instance, the rules are dynamically generated and include unary productions, mak ing it very hard to convert to CNF by preprocessing, whereas our algorithms can be applied directly to these parsers.
			Second, our Algorithm 3 has an improvementover Jime?nez and Marzal which leads to a slight theoret ical and empirical speedup.
			Third, we have implementedour algorithms on top of state-of-the-art, large-scale sta tistical parser/decoders and report extensive experimentalresults while Jime?nez and Marzal?s was tested on rela tively small grammars.
			On the other hand, our algorithms are more scalable and much more general than the coarse-to-fine approachof Charniak and Johnson.
			In our experiments, we can ob tain 10000-best lists nearly as fast as 1-best parsing, with very modest use of memory.
			Indeed, Charniak (p.c.) hasadopted our Algorithm 3 into his own p
