 to our experiments, we found that unigram co-occurrence statistics is a good automatic scoring metric.
    It consistently correlated highly with human assessments and had high recall and precision in significance test with manual evaluation results.
    In contrast, the weighted average of variable length n-gram matches derived from IBM BLEU did not always give good correlation and high recall and precision.
    We surmise that a reason for the difference between summarization and machine translation might be that extraction-based summaries do not really suffer from grammar problems, while translations do.
    Longer n-grams tend to score for grammaticality rather than content.
    It is encouraging to know that the simple unigram cooccurrence metric works in the DUC 2001 setup.
    The reason for this might be that most of the systems participating in DUC generate summaries by sentence extraction.
    We plan to run similar experiments on DUC 2002 data to see if unigram does as well.
    If it does, we wil
