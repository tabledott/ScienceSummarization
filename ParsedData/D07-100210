		Likely answer candidates are extracted from answer sentences following some pre processing steps detailed in Section 6.
			For each candidate ac, we derive its semantic structureSemStrucac and assume that ac is a frame element of SemStrucac.
			Question and answer seman tic structures are compared using a model based on graph matching detailed in Section 5 (Model II).
			We calculate the similarity of all derived pairs ?SemStrucq,SemStrucac?
			and select the candidate with the highest value as an answer for the question.
	
	
			Our method crucially exploits the annotated sen tences in the FrameNet database together with theoutput of a dependency parser.
			Our guiding assumption is that sentences that share dependency rela tions will also share semantic roles as long as they evoke the same or related frames.
			This is motivated by much research in lexical semantics (e.g., Levin (1993)) hypothesizing that the behavior of words,particularly with respect to the expression and interpretation of their argument
