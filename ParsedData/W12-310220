s constitutes a circle, there are three rankings with the minimum number of 20 violation (ABC, BCA, CAB).
    However, we may want to take the ratio of wins and losses for each pairwise ranking into account.
    Using maximum likelihood estimation, we can define the probability that system s1 is better than system s2 on a randomly drawn sentence as This function scores the three rankings in the example above as follows: One disadvantage of this and the previous ranking method is that they do not take advantage of all available evidence.
    Consider the example: Here, system A is clearly ahead, but how about B and C?
    They are tied in their pairwise comparison.
    So, both ABC and ACB have no pairwise ranking violations and their most probable ranking score, as defined above, is the same.
    B is clearly worse than A, but C has a fighting chance, and this should be reflected in the ranking.
    The following two overall ranking methods overcome this problem.
