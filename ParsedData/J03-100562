for the two cases (1) tc = 10.0, t, = &#8734;, and (2) tc = &#8734;, t, = 15.0.
    (Actually, for one test sentence in the TEST-331 test set, the translations are different, although the translation probabilities are exactly the same.)
    Since the pruning is carried out independently on two different pruning dimensions, no search errors will occur if the thresholds are further increased.
    Table 10 shows the effect of the observation pruning parameter no on mWER for the reordering constraint GE. mWER is significantly reduced by hypothesizing up to the best 50 target words a for a source language word f. mWER increases from 24.9% to 29.3% when the number of hypothesized words is decreased to only a single word.
    Table 11 demonstrates the effect of the combination of the coverage pruning threshold tc = 5.0 and the cardinality pruning threshold t, = 12.5, where the actual values are found in informal experiments: In a typical setting of the two parameters t, should be at least twice as big as tc.
