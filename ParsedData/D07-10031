			State of-the-art QA systems are extremely complex.
			They usually take the form of a pipeline architecture, chaining together modules that perform tasks such as answer type analysis (identifying whether the correct answer will be a person, location, date,etc.), document retrieval, answer candidate extrac tion, and answer reranking.
			This architecture is so predominant that each task listed above has evolvedinto its own sub-field and is often studied and evalu ated independently (Shima et al, 2006).
			At a high level, the QA task boils down to only two essential steps (Echihabi andMarcu, 2003).
			The first step, retrieval, narrows down the search spacefrom a corpus of millions of documents to a focused set of maybe a few hundred using an IR engine, where efficiency and recall are the main focus.
			The second step, selection, assesses each can didate answer string proposed by the first step, and finds the one that is most likely to be an answerto the given question.
