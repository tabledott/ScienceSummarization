the task can be assumed to be the spoken language.
    Finally, anticipating a large pool of workers located in the United States, we felt it possible for us to add a third restriction for the *-to-English language pairs, which is that a worker must have had at least five tasks previously approved on MTurk.13 We organized the ranking sets in groups of 3 per screen, with a monetary reward of $0.05 per screen.
    When we created our tasks, we had no expectation that all the assignments would be completed over the tasks&#8217; lifetime of 30 days.
    This was indeed the case (Table 10), especially for language pairs with a non-English target language, due to workers being in short supply outside the US.
    Overall, we see that the amount of data collected from non-US workers is relatively small (left half of Table 10), whereas the pool of US-based workers is much larger, leading to much higher completion rates for language pairs with English as the target language (right half of Table 10).
    This is in spit
