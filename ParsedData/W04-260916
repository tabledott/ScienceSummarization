 relatively small set of 35 semantic relations covers a significant part of the semantic distribution of these constructions on a large open-domain corpus.
    Moreover, the distribution of these relations is dependent on the type of NP construction, each type encoding a particular subset.
    For example, in the case of of-genitives, there were 21 relations found from the total of 35 relations considered.
    The most frequently occurring relations were PART-WHOLE, ATTRIBUTE-HOLDER, POSSESSION, LOCATION, SOURCE, TOPIC, and THEME.
    By comparing the subsets of semantic relations in each column we can notice that these semantic spaces are not identical, proving our initial intuition that the NP constructions cannot be alternative ways of packing the same information.
    Table 4 also shows that there is a subset of semantic relations that can be fully encoded by all types of NP constructions.
    The statistics about the lexicalized examples are as follows: N-N (30.01%), Adj-N (0%), s-genitive (0%), of-genit
