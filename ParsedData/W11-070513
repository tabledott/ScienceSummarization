s are based on prior polarity of words.
    For obtaining the prior polarity of words, we take motivation from work by Agarwal et al. (2009).
    We use Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL) (Whissel, 1989) and extend it using WordNet.
    This dictionary of about 8000 English language words assigns every word a pleasantness score (E R) between 1 (Negative) - 3 (Positive).
    We first normalize the scores by diving each score my the scale (which is equal to 3).
    We consider words with polarity less than 0.5 as negative, higher than 0.8 as positive and the rest as neutral.
    If a word is not directly found in the dictionary, we retrieve all synonyms from Wordnet.
    We then look for each of the synonyms in DAL.
    If any synonym is found in DAL, we assign the original word the same pleasantness score as its synonym.
    If none of the synonyms is present in DAL, the word is not associated with any prior polarity.
    For the given data we directly found prior polarity of 81.1% of the words.
