 heterogeneous in our verb list, consisting of verbs from several subclasses of the &amp;quot;unexpressed object alternation&amp;quot; class in (Levin, 1993).
    We conclude that the verb classification task is likely easier for very homogeneous classes, and more difficult for more broadly defined classes, even when the exemplars share the critical syntactic behaviors.
    On the other hand, frequency does not appear to be a simple factor in explaining patterns of agreement between experts, or increases in accuracy.
    As in Section 4.3, we again analyze the relation between log frequency of the verbs and classification performance, here considering the performance of the experts.
    We grouped verbs in three log frequency classes: verbs with log frequency less than 2 (i.e., frequency less than 100), those with log frequency between 2 and 3 (i.e., frequency between 100 and 1000), and those with log frequency over 3 (i.e., frequency over 1000).
    The lowfrequency group had 24 verbs (14 unergatives, 5 unac
