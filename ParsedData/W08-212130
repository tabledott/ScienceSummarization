oring system (johansson) is in a class of its own, with scores 2&#8211;3 points higher than the next system.
    This is most likely caused by the fact that Johansson and Nugues (2008) implemented a thorough system that addressed all facets of the task with state-ofthe-art methods: second-order parsing model, argument identification/classification models separately tuned for PropBank and NomBank, reranking inference for the SRL task, and, finally, joint optimization of the complete task using metalearning (more details in Section 5).
    Table 11 lists the official results in the open challenge.
    The results in this challenge are lower than in the closed challenge, but this was somewhat to be expected considering that there were fewer participants in this challenge and none of the top five groups in the closed challenge submitted results in the open challenge.
    Only one of the systems that participated in both challenges (zhang) improved the results submitted in the closed challenge.
