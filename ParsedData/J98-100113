SD is the degree to which the fundamental problems and approaches to the problem were foreseen and developed at that time.
    However, without large-scale resources, most of these ideas remained untested and to a large extent, forgotten, until several decades later.
    Al methods began to flourish in the early 1960s and began to attack the problem of language understanding.
    As a result, WSD in Al work was typically accomplished in the context of larger systems intended for full language understanding.
    In the spirit of the times, such systems were almost always grounded in some theory of human language understanding that they attempted to model, and often involved the use of detailed knowledge about syntax and semantics to perform their task, which was exploited for WSD. in the late 1950s and were immediately applied to the problem of representing word meanings.2 Masterman (1962), working in the area of machine translation, used a semantic network to derive the representation of sentences in an inter
