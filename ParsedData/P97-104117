e score from 87.9 to 89.6, a 14.0% reduction in the error rate.
    Our rule-based algorithm is thus able to produce an improvement to an existing high-performance system.
    Table 1 shows a summary of the four Chinese experiments.
    While Thai is also an unsegmented language, the Thai writing system is alphabetic and the average word length is greater than Chinese.7 We would therefore expect that our character-based transformations would not work as well with Thai, since a context of more than one character is necessary in many cases to make many segmentation decisions in alphabetic languages.
    The Thai corpus consisted of texts' from the Thai News Agency via NECTEC in Thailand.
    For our experiment, the training set consisted of 3367 sentences (40937 words); the test set was a separate set of 1245 sentences (13724 words) from the same corpus.
    The initial segmentation was performed using the maximum matching algorithm, with a lexicon of 9933 Thai words from the word separation filter in cite; a T
