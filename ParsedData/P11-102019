ion metric, has few n-gram overlaps with the source sentence but many n-gram overlaps with the reference sentences.
    This is consistent with our requirement that a good paraphrase should be lexically dissimilar from the source sentence while preserving its semantics.
    Unlike Liu et al. (2010), we treat these two criteria separately, since different applications might have different preferences for each.
    For example, a paraphrase suggestion tool for a word processing software might be more concerned with semantic adequacy, since presenting a paraphrase that does not preserve the meaning would likely result in a negative user experience.
    On the other hand, a query expansion algorithm might be less concerned with preserving the precise meaning so long as additional relevant terms are added to improve search recall.
  
  
    To verify the usefulness of our paraphrase corpus and the BLEU/PINC metric, we built and evaluated several paraphrase systems and compared the automatic scores to human ratings
