xt separately.
    We also plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to gauge performance at a finer level of discrimination (Swets, 1988).
    The ROC plot is the plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate for various settings of a decision criterion.
    In our case, the true positive rate is the fraction of boundaries correctly classified, and the false positive rate is the fraction of non-boundary positions incorrectly classified as boundaries.
    In computing the true and false positive rates, we vary the threshold distance to the true boundary within which a hypothesized boundary is considered correct.
    Larger areas under the ROC curve of a classifier indicate better discriminative performance.
    Spoken lectures are very different in style from other corpora used in human segmentation studies (Hearst, 1994; Galley et al., 2003).
    We are interested in analyzing human performance on a corpus of lecture transcripts with much longer texts and a less clear-cut concep
