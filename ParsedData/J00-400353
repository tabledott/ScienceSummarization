tion of a description were right, or some were right and some wrong, or that all were wrong.
    The recall and precision figures reported here relate to those cases were all resolutions indicated were right according to the annotated corpus.
    In Section 4.1 we also discussed a second segmentation heuristic, which we called recency: the system does not collect all candidate NPs as potential antecedents, but only keeps the last occurrence of an NP from all those having the same head noun, and there are no restrictions regarding the antecedent's distance.
    The results of these two methods for different window sizes are shown in Table 5.
    The results in this table were obtained by considering as potential antecedents indefinites (i.e., NPs with determiners a, an, and some; bare NPs; and cardinal plurals), possessives, and definite descriptions, as in Vieira and Poesio (1996); we also used the premodification heuristics proposed there.
    Alternatives to these heuristics were also evaluated; the results
