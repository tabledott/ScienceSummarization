    Rarely occurring inflected forms of a stem in Arabic often do not accurately translate due to the frequency imbalance with the corresponding translation word in English.
    So called a word (separated by a white space) in Arabic often corresponds to more than one independent word in English, posing a technical problem to the source channel models.
    In the English-Arabic sentence alignment shown in Figure 1, Arabic word AlAHmr (written in Buckwalter transliteration) is aligned to two English words &#8216;the red&#8217;, and llmEArDp to three English words &#8216;of the opposition.&#8217; In this paper, we present a technique to induce a morphological and syntactic symmetry between two languages with different morphological structures for statistical translation quality improvement.
    The technique is implemented as a two-step morphological processing for word-based translation models.
    We first apply word segmentation to Arabic, segmenting a word into prefix(es)-stem-suffix
