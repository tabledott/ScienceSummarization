anscripts of task-oriented dialogues from the HCRC Map Task Corpus (Anderson et al. 1991).
    Utterance-like units referred to as moves were identified in the transcripts, and subjects were asked to identify transaction boundaries.
    Since reliability was lower than the .80 threshold, they concluded that their coding scheme and instructions required improvement.
    Moser and Moore (1995) investigated the reliability of various features defined in Relational Discourse Analysis (Moser, Moore, and Glendening 1995), based in part on RST.
    Their corpus consisted of written interactions between tutors and students, using 3 different tutors.
    Two coders were asked to identify segments, the core utterance of each segment, and certain intentional and informational relations between the core and the other contributor utterances.
    As reported in their talk (not in the paper), reliability on segment structure and core identification was well over the .80 threshold.
    Reliability on intentional and informat
