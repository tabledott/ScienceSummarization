wo dictionaries, together with additional infor mation (hypernyms and domain labels); second, foreach WordNet sense, we determined the best match ing ODE coarse entry.
			As a result, WordNet senses mapped to the same ODE entry were assigned to the same sense cluster.
			WordNet senses with no match were associated with a singleton sense.
			In contrast to the automatic method above, thesense mappings for all the words in our test cor pus were manually produced by the third author, anexpert lexicographer, with the aid of a mapping in terface.
			Not all the words in the corpus could be mapped directly for several reasons: lacking entries in ODE (e.g. adjectives underlying and shivering), 3We adopted WordNet 2.1, available from: http://wordnet.princeton.edu different spellings (e.g. after-effect vs. aftereffect, halfhearted vs. half-hearted, etc.), derivatives (e.g. procedural, gambler, etc.).
			In most of the cases, weasked the lexicographer to map senses of the orig inal word to senses of lexically-related
