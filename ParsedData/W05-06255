gument classifiers.
    Specifically, given k argument classifiers which perform classification on k argument sets, {S1, ... , Sk}.
    The inference process aims to optimize the objective function: ..., traders say, unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures. where Probj is the probability output by system j.
    Note that all systems may not output with the same set of argument candidates due to the pruning and argument identification.
    For the systems that do not output for any candidate, we assign the probability with a prior to this phantom candidate.
    In particular, the probability of the NULL class is set to be 0.6 based on empirical tests, and the probabilities of the other classes are set proportionally to their occurrence frequencies in the training data.
    For example, Figure 1 shows the two candidate sets for a fragment of a sentence, &#8220;..., traders say, unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures.&#8221; In this example, system A has two argument cand
