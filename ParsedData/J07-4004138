 2006).
    Partial dependency structures are extracted from the lexical category sequences, and the training algorithm for the dependency model is extended to deal with partial data.
    Remarkably, the accuracy of the dependency model trained on data derived from lexical category sequences alone is only 1.3% labeled F-score less than the full data model.
    This result demonstrates the significant amount of syntactic information encoded in the lexical categories.
    Future work will look at applying this method to biomedical text.
    We have shown how using automatically assigned POS tags reduces the accuracy of the supertagger and parser.
    In Curran, Clark, and Vadas (2006) we investigate using the multi-tagging techniques developed for the supertagger at the POS tag level.
    The idea is to maintain some POS tag ambiguity for later parts of the parsing process, using the tag probabilities to decide which tags to maintain.
    We were able to reduce the drop Clark and Curran Wide-Coverage Efficient
