d metaphor have been identified as central to the development of new word senses, and hence to language change (see, e.g., Stern 1931; Waldron 1967).
    Some of the best examples of the differences between the two phenomena come from data used in studies of metonymic and metaphorical effects on language change.
    Nevertheless, there are widely differing views on which phenomenon is the more important.
    Some argue that metaphor is a kind of metonymy, and others propose that metonymy is a kind of metaphor, while still others suggest that they are quite different (see Fass 1988c).
    Among the third group, two differences between metonymy and metaphor are commonly mentioned.
    One difference is that metonymy is founded on contiguity whereas metaphor is based on similarity (cf.
    Jakobsen and Halle 1956; Ullmann 1962).
    Contiguity and similarity are two kinds of association.
    Contiguity refers to a state of being connected or touching whereas similarity refers to a state of being alike in essenti
