 know that the former is less interesting because its semantics are compositional.
    In addition, the measure is extremely superficial; it cannot cluster words into appropriate syntactic classes without an explicit preprocess such as Church's parts program 'or Hindle's parser.
    Neither of these preprocesses, though, can help highlight the &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; similarity between nouns such as &amp;quot;picture&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;photograph.&amp;quot; Although one might imagine a preprocess that would help in this particular case, there will probably always be a class of generalizations that are obvious to an intelligent lexicographer, but lie hopelessly beyond the objectivity of a computer.
    Despite these problems, the association ratio could be an important tool to aid the lexicographer, rather like an index to the concordances.
    It can help us decide what to look for; it provides a quick summary of what company our words do keep.
