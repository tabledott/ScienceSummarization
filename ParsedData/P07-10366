 multiple levels of constraints&#8217; violation.
    Conceptually, although not technically, the most related work to ours is (Shen et al., 2005) that, in a somewhat ad-hoc manner uses soft constraints to guide an unsupervised model that was crafted for mention tracking.
    To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to suggest a general semi-supervised protocol that is driven by soft constraints.
    We propose learning with constraints - a framework that combines the approaches described above in a unified and intuitive way.
  
  
    In Section 4 we will develop a general framework for semi-supervised learning with constraints.
    However, it is useful to illustrate the ideas on concrete problems.
    Therefore, in this section, we give a brief introduction to the two domains on which we tested our algorithms.
    We study two information extraction problems in each of which, given text, a set of pre-defined fields is to be identified.
    Since the fields are typically related and interdependent, th
