hes the human ranking, its plot will coincide with the heavy diagonal.
    A line with less deviation from the heavy diagonal line indicates better correlation with the human assessment.
    To quantify the correlation, we compute the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient (p) for each Ngram(1,4)n run at different summary sizes (n).
    We also test the effect of inclusion or exclusion of stopwords.
    The results are summarized in Table 1.
    Although these results are statistically significant (&#945; _ 0.025) and are comparable to IBM BLEU's correlation figures shown in Section 3, they are not consistent across summary sizes and tasks.
    For example, the correlations of the single document task are at the 60% level; while they range from 50% to 80% for the multidocument task.
    The inclusion or exclusion of stopwords also shows mixed results.
    In order to meet the requirement of the first criterion stated in Section 3, we need better results.
    The Ngram(1,4)n score is a weighted average of
