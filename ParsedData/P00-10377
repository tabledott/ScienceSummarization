the probability of generating the string fisikle with the partition f i s i k le would be P(f  |ph) *P(i  |y) * P(s  |s) *P(i  |i) * P(k  |c) *P(le  |al).3 The above example points to advantages of our model compared to previous models based on weighted Damerau-Levenshtein distance.
    Note that neither P(f  |ph) nor P(le  |al) are modeled directly in the previous approaches to error modeling.
    A number of studies have pointed out that a high percentage of misspelled words are wrong due to a single letter insertion, substitution, or deletion, or from a letter pair transposition (Damerau 1964; Peterson 1986).
    However, even if this is the case, it does not imply that nothing is to be gained by modeling more powerful edit operations.
    If somebody types the string confidant, we do not really want to model this error as P(a  |e), but rather P(ant | ent).
    And anticedent can more accurately be modeled by P(anti  |ante), rather than P(i  |e).
    By taking a more generic approach to error modeling, we
