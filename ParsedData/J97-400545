te data (unparsed training corpora) is described in Riezler (1997), and I refer readers to that paper.
    As a closing note, it should be pointed out explicitly that the random field techniques described here can be profitably applied to context-free grammars, as well.
    As Stanley Peters nicely put it, there is a distinction between possibilistic and probabilistic context-sensitivity.
    Even if the language described by the grammar of interest&#8212;that is, the set of possible trees&#8212;is context-free, there may well be context-sensitive statistical dependencies.
    Random fields can be readily applied to capture such statistical dependencies whether or not L(G) is context-sensitive.
  
  
    In the feature selection step, we choose an initial weight 3 for each candidate feature f so as to maximize the gain G = D(-)11 gold) &#8212; D(i)-11cfr,o) of adding f to the field.
    It is actually more convenient to consider log weights a = ln /3.
    For a given feature f, the log weight et that maximize
