   We conjecture that an additional necessary condition is an annotation style that favors more deeply embedded structures, giving rise to chains of left-headed structures where each node is dependent on the preceding one, which increases the number of points at which an incorrect decision can be made by an arcstandard parser.
    However, we have not yet fully verified the extent to which this condition holds for all the data sets where the arc-eager parsers outperform their arc-standard counterparts.
    Although the arc-eager strategy has an advantage in that the decisions involved in attaching a right dependent are simpler, it has the disadvantage that it has to commit early.
    This may either lead the parser to add an arc (i, l, j) (i &lt; j) when it is not correct to do so, or fail to add the same arc in a situation where it should have been added, in both cases because the information available at an early point makes the wrong decision look probable.
    In the first case, the arc-standard parser ma
