  VerbOcean: Mining The Web For Fine-Grained Semantic Verb Relations
  
    Broad-coverage repositories of semantic relations between verbs could benefit many NLP tasks.
    We present a semi-automatic method for extracting fine-grained semantic relations between verbs.
    We detect similarity, strength, antonymy, enablement, and temporal happens-before relations between pairs of strongly associated verbs using lexicosyntactic patterns over the Web.
    On a set of 29,165 strongly associated verb pairs, our extraction algorithm yielded 65.5% accuracy.
    Analysis of types shows that on the relation achieved 75% accuracy.

    Many NLP tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and machine translation could benefit from broad-coverage semantic resources such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and EVCA (English Verb Classes and Alternations) (Levin 1993).
    These extremely useful resources have very high precision entries but have important limitations when used
