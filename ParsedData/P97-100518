under method &amp;quot;LR (Surf.)
    All&amp;quot; means that when all texts were subjected to the NARRATIVE test, 78% of them were classified correctly.
    There are at least two major ways of conceiving what the baseline should be in this experiment.
    If the machine were to guess randomly among k categories. the probability of a correct guess would be 1/k. i.e., 1/2 for NARRATIVE, 1/6 for GENRE, and 1/4 for BROW.
    But one could get dramatic improvement just by building a machine that always guesses the most populated category: NONFICT for GENRE.
    MIDDLE for BROW, and No for NARRATIVE.
    The first approach would be fair, because our machines in fact have no prior knowledge of the distribution of genre facets in the evaluation suite. but we decided to be conservative and evaluate our methods against the latter baseline.
    No matter which approach one takes, however, each of the numbers in the table is significant at p &lt; .05 by a binomial distribution.
    That is, there is less than a 5% cha
