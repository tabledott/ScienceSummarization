    The fact that this is not a unique interpretation of the elliptical event predicate is in some ways irrelevant to the notion of type coercion.
    That there is some event involving the complement is required by the lexical semantics of the governing verb and the rules of type well-formedness, and although there are many ways to act on a novel, I argue that certain relations are &amp;quot;privileged&amp;quot; in the lexical semantics of the noun.
    It is not the role of a lexical semantic theory to say what readings are preferred, but rather which are available.23 Assuming the semantic selection given above for begin is correct, we would predict that, because of the process event-type associated with the telic role for dictionary, there is only one default interpretation for the sentence in 50; namely, the agentive event of &amp;quot;compiling.&amp;quot; 23 There are interesting differences in complement types between finish and complete.
    The former takes both NP and a gerundive VP, whil
