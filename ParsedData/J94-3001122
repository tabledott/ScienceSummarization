gs are in the domain of r and whose surface strings must therefore be different than T provides for.
    The unacceptable string pairs thus belong to the same-length relation 7T*A[Id(Dom(T)) a 7r-lp7r*, and its regular complement in the Coerce operator Coerce(r, A, p) =-- r* A[Id(Dom(r)) o T]p7r* contains all the string pairs that satisfy the rule.
    For most surface coercions it is also the case that this contains only the pairs that satisfy the rule.
    But for one special class of coercions, the epenthesis rules, this relation includes more string pairs than we desire.
    These are rules in which the domain of T includes strings consisting entirely of O's, and the difficulty arises because of the dual nature of two-level O's.
    They behave formally as actual string symbols in same-length relations, but they are also intended to act as the empty string.
    In this way they are similar to the c's in the centers of rewriting rules, and they must also be modeled by special techniques.
