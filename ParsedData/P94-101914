    In each conceptual domain, lexicalized concepts can be organized in a hierarchical structure.
    The conceptual domains for English and Chinese are merged to form interlingua conceptual domains used for similarity measures.
    Following is part of the change-of-state domain containing English and Chinese lexicalized concepts. aim-of-sta.
    Within one conceptual domain, the similarity of two concepts is defined by how closely they are related in the hierarchy, i.e., their structural relations.
    T; ROOT ci The conceptual similarity between Cl and C2 is: C3 is the least common superconcept of Cl and C2.
    Ni is the number of nodes on the path from Cl to C3.
    N2 is the number of nodes on the path from C2 to C3.
    N3 is the number of nodes on the path from C3 to root.
    After defining the similarity measure in one domain
