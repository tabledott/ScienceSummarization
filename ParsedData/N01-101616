 EDITED recall decreases from 0.678 to 0.668).
  
  
    We now turn to the second pass of our two-pass architecture, using an &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; statistical parser to parse the transcribed speech after having removed the words identified as edited by the first pass.
    We first define the evaluation metric we use and then describe the results of our experiments.
    In this section we describe the metric we use to grade the parser output.
    As a first desideratum we want a metric that is a logical extension of that used to grade previous statistical parsing work.
    We have taken as our starting point what we call the &#8220;relaxed labeled precision/recall&#8221; metric from previous research (e.g.
    [3,5]).
    This metric is characterized as follows.
    For a particular test corpus let N be the total number of nonterminal (and non-preterminal) constituents in the gold standard parses.
    Let M be the number of such constituents returned by the parser, and let C be the number of these that
