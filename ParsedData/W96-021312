is to graph the POS tag assignments for a given word as a function of the article in which it occurs.
    Consistently tagged words should have roughly the same tag distribution as the article numbers vary.
    Figure 1 represents each POS tag with a unique integer and graphs the POS annotation of about in the training set as a function of the article# (the points are &amp;quot;scattered&amp;quot; to show density).
    As seen in figure 1, about is usually annotated with tag#1, which denotes IN (preposition), or tag#9, which denotes RB (adverb), and the observed probability of either choice depends heavily on the current article#.
    Upon further examination', the tagging distribution for about changes precisely when the annotator changes.
    Figure 2, which again uses integers to denote POS tags, shows the tag distribution of about as a function of annotator, and implies that the tagging errors for this word are due mostly to inconsistent data.
