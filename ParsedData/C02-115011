al one because it can be trained on a new taxonomy in a very short time.One way to exhibit the difficulty in manually con structing a classifier is to consider reformulations of a question: What tourist attractions are there in Reims?
			What are the names of the tourist attractions in Reims?
			What do most tourists visit in Reims?
			What attracts tourists to Reims?
			What is worth seeing in Reims?
			All these reformulations target the same answertype Location.
			However, different words and syntactic structures make it difficult for a manual clas sifier based on a small set of rules to generalize well and map all these to the same answer type.
			Good learning methods with appropriate features, on the other hand, may not suffer from the fact that the number of potential features (derived from wordsand syntactic structures) is so large and would gen eralize and classify these cases correctly.
