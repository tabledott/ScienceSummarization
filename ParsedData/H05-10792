understanding of how language works.
			Indeed, recognising entailment bears similarities to Turing?s famous test to assess whether machines can think, as access to different sources of knowledge and theability to draw inferences seem to be among the primary ingredients for an intelligent system.
			Moreover, many NLP tasks have strong links to entailment: in summarisation, a summary should be en tailed by the text; paraphrases can be seen as mutualentailment between T and H; in IE, the extracted in formation should also be entailed by the text.In this paper, we discuss two methods for recog nising textual entailment: a shallow method relyingmainly on word overlap (Section 2), and deep se mantic analysis, using state-of-the-art off-the-shelf inference tools, namely a theorem prover and amodel builder (Section 3).
			These tools rely on Dis course Representation Structures for T and H as well as lexical and world knowledge.
			To our knowledge, few approaches to entailment currently use theorem provers and non
