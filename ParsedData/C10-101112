ally considered the reason for long parsing times.However, it is not the most time consuming component as proven by the above analysis.
			There fore, we investigated the question further, askingwhat causes the high time consumption of the fea ture extraction?
			In our next experiment, we left out the mapping of the features to the index of the weight vectors.The feature extraction takes 88 ms/sentence with out the mapping and 1223 ms/sentence with the mapping.
			The feature?index mapping needs 93% of the time to extract the features and 91% of thetotal parsing time.
			What causes the high time con sumption of the feature?index mapping?The mapping has to provide a number as an in dex for the features in the training examples and to filter out the features of examples built, while theparser predicts the dependency structures.
			The al gorithm filters out negative features to reduce the memory requirement, even if they could improve the parsing result.
			We will call the features built due to the training
