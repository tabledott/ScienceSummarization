ll as (or even instead of) making some theoretical point.
    I claim that despite their widely differing theoretical backgrounds, the surveyed systems are similar in terms of the modules they divide the generation process into, the way the modules interact with each other, and (at least in some cases) the kinds of computations each individual module performs.
    In other words, despite different theoretical claims, there is a remarkable level of similarity in how these systems 'really work'; that is, a de facto 'consensus architecture' seems to be emerging for how applied NLG systems should generate text.
    The existence of such agreement among the surveyed systems is especially surprising because in some cases the theoretical backgrounds of the systems examined argue against some aspects of the consensus architecture.
    I also compare the consensus architecture to psycholinguistic knowledge about language generation in human speakers.
    Such a comparison is often difficult to make, because of the man
