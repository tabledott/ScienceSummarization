replacements from the PTs that improve the similarity to the reference sentences.
    For the other applications, only some very short sentences cannot be paraphrased.
    Further results show that the average number of unit replacements in each sentence is 5.36, 4.47, and 1.87 for sentence compression, simplification, and similarity computation.
    It also indicates that sentence similarity computation is more difficult than the other two applications.
    We ask two raters to label the paraphrases based on the criteria defined in Section 4.2.
    The labeling results are shown in the upper part of Table 1.
    We can see that for adequacy and fluency, the paraphrases in sentence similarity computation get the highest scores.
    About 70% of the paraphrases are labeled &#8220;3&#8221;.
    This is because in sentence similarity computation, only the target units appearing in the reference sentences are kept in paraphrase planning.
    This constraint filters most of the noise.
