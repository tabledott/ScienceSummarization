 (Wu and Tseng, 1993; Sproat and Shih, 2001).
    These methods can be roughly classified into dictionary-based methods and statistical-based methods, while many state-ofthe-art systems use hybrid approaches.
    In dictionary-based methods (e.g.
    Cheng et al., 1999), given an input character string, only words that are stored in the dictionary can be identified.
    The performance of these methods thus depends to a large degree upon the coverage of the dictionary, which unfortunately may never be complete because new words appear constantly.
    Therefore, in addition to the dictionary, many systems also contain special components for unknown word identification.
    In particular, statistical methods have been widely applied because they utilize a probabilistic or cost-based scoring mechanism, instead of the dictionary, to segment the text.
    These methods however, suffer from three drawbacks.
    First, some of these methods (e.g.
    Lin et al., 1993) identify unknown words without identifying their
