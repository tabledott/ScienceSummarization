served in the corpus analysis (204); furthermore, the number of false positives produced by such heuristics is almost twice the number of right answers.
    Test Data.
    Version 2 was tested over the test data using automatic evaluation&#8212;i.e., the system was only evaluated as a classifier, and the anchors found were not analyzed.
    A total of 57 bridging relations were found, but only 19 of the definite descriptions classified as bridges by the system had been classified as bridging descriptions in the standard annotation.
    Compared to Version 1 of the system, which does not resolve bridging descriptions, Version 2 has higher recall but lower precision, as shown in Table 21.
    As a second form of evaluation of the performance of the system, we measured its agreement with the annotators on the test data using the K statistic.
    Version 1 of the system finds a classification for 318 out of 464 definite descriptions in Corpus 2 (the test data).
    If all the definite descriptions that the system
