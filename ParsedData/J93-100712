    This questionnaire contains sentences used by Benson for compiling collocational knowledge for the BBI (Benson 1989b).
    Each sentence contains an empty slot that can easily be filled in by native speakers.
    In contrast, second language speakers would not find the missing words automatically but would consider a long list of words having the appropriate semantic and syntactic features such as the ones given in the second column.
    As a consequence, collocations have particular statistical distributions (e.g., Halliday 1966; Cruse 1986).
    This means that, for example, the probability that any two adjacent words in a sample will be &amp;quot;red herring&amp;quot; is considerably larger than the probability of &amp;quot;red&amp;quot; times the probability of &amp;quot;herring.&amp;quot; The words cannot be considered as independent variables.
    We take advantage of this fact to develop a set of statistical techniques for retrieving and identifying collocations from large textual corpora.
