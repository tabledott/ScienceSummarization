    It is a fundamental problem in natural language processing (NLP), and the ability to disambiguate word sense accurately is important for applications like machine translation, information retrieval, etc.
    Corpus-based, supervised machine learning methods have been used to tackle the WSD task, just like the other NLP tasks.
    Among the various approaches to WSD, the supervised learning approach is the most successful to date.
    In this approach, we first collect a corpus in which each occurrence of an ambiguous word w has been manually annotated with the correct sense, according to some existing sense inventory in a dictionary.
    This annotated corpus then serves as the training material for a learning algorithm.
    After training, a model is automatically learned and it is used to assign the correct sense to any previously unseen occurrence of w in a new context.
    While the supervised learning approach has been successful, it has the drawback of requiring manually sense-tagged data.
