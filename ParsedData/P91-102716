  For example, purpose adjuncts like &amp;quot;John quit to pursue a career in finance&amp;quot; are quite rare, accounting for only two percent of the apparent infinitival complements.
    Furthermore, they are distributed across a much larger set of matrix verbs than the true infinitival complements, so any given verb should occur with a purpose adjunct extremely rarely.
    In a histogram sorting verbs by their apparent frequency of occurrence with infinitival complements, those that in fact have appeared with purpose adjuncts and not true subcategorized infinitives will be clustered at the low frequencies.
    The distributions of such clusters can be modeled automatically and the models used for identifying false positives.
    The second requirement for automatically generating a full-scale dictionary is the ability to detect many more types of SFs.
    SFs involving certain prepositional phrases are particularly challenging.
    For example, while purpose adjuncts (mistaken for infinitival complements)
