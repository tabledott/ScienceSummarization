he verb-intervening predicate recursively on the first-order Markov process generating modifying nonterminals: and similarly for right modifiers.
    What is considered to be a verb?
    While this is not spelled out, as it happens, a verb is any word whose part-of-speech tag is one of {VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, VBZ}.
    That is, the cv predicate returns true only for these preterminals and false for all other preterminals.
    Crucially, this set omits MD, which is the marker for modal verbs.
    Another crucial point about the vi predicate is that it does not include verbs that appear within base NPs.
    Put another way, in order to emulate Collins&#8217; model, we need to amend the definition of cv by stipulating that cv(NPB) = false.
    One oddity of Collins&#8217; trainer that we mention here for the sake of completeness is that it skips certain training trees.
    For &#8220;odd historical reasons,&#8221;13 the trainer skips all trees with more than 500 tokens, where a token is considered in this conte
