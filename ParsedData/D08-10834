entiment value to individual expressions, clauses, or sentences.
    Their approach can be viewed as a type of structural inference, but their hand-written rules have not been empirically compared to learning-based alternatives, which one might expect to be more effective in handling some aspects of the polarity classification task.
    In this paper, we begin to close the gap between learning-based approaches to expression-level polarity classification and those founded on compositional semantics: we present a novel learning-based approach that incorporates structural inference motivated by compositional semantics into the learning procedure.
    Adopting the view point of compositional semantics, our working assumption is that the polarity of a sentiment-bearing expression can be determined in a two-step process: (1) assess the polarities of the constituents of the expression, and then (2) apply a relatively simple set of inference rules to combine them recursively.
    Rather than a rigid application of ha
