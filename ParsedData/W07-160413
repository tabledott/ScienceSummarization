of view, from the rest of the sentence.
    Without the comma, the model selected of as the most probable preposition following because, instead of from.
    A set of heuristics was used to locate common sites of comma errors and skip these contexts.
    There were two other common sources of classification error: antonyms and benefactives.
    The model very often confused prepositions with opposite meanings (like with/without and from/to), so when the highest probability preposition was an antonym of the one produced by the writer, we blocked the classifier from marking the usage as an error.
    Benefactive phrases of the form for + person/organization (for everyone, for my school) were also difficult for the model to learn, most likely because, as adjuncts, they are free to appear in many different places in a sentence and the preposition is not constrained by its object, resulting in their frequency being divided among many different contexts.
    When a benefactive appeared in an argument position, the
