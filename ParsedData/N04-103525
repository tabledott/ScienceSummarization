orderings, but flattening the tree structure is not a general solution.
    Indeed, it can only apply to a very limited number of syntactic categories, for which the advantage of having a deep syntactic structure is lost.
    Figure 12 (dotted lines are P alignments) shows an interesting example where flattening the tree structure cannot resolve all crossings in node-reordering models.
    In these models, a crossing remains between MD and AUX no matter how VPs are flattened.
    Our transformation rule model creates a lexicalized rule as shown in the figure, where the transformation of &#8220;will be&#8221; into &#8220;sera&#8221; is the only way to resolve the crossing.
    In the Chinese-English domain, the rules extracted by our algorithm often have the attractive quality that they are the kind of common-sense constructions that are used in Chinese language textbooks to teach students.
    For instance, there are several that illustrate the complex reorderings that occur around the Chinese marker word &#8
