  One can encode the grammar in TAG as follows: S S A B A A A A a x a y Suppose that the heads of the initial trees are respec- tively x and y and that a is the head of both auxiliary 581 trees.
  Then, if the elementary trees are built according to the input string, and if a top-down strategy is used, only A or B trees will be built.
  An application concerns the parsing of discontinuous constituents.
  They are recognized even if there are un- bounded insertions between their components and even if their head is the last element of the string.
  In the two-step strategy described here, before the first step is taken, there is no grammar.
  After the first step, we have a grammar whose size is proportional to the length of the input string.
  The size of the grammar to be taken into consideration i  the analysis of the parsing complexity of grammar formalisms has been reduced to an amount proportional to the length of the input.
  Although we have not yet investigated the implication of this approach on so
