ts about 12% of the annotated data).
    This results in an overall agreement of about 67.3% which is reasonable and closely comparable with previous figures.
    Note that these figures are collected for the entire OMWE data set build so far, which consists of annotated data for more than 350 words.
    In addition to raw inter-tagger agreement, the kappa statistic, which removes from the agreement rate the amount of agreement that is expected by chance(Carletta, 1996), was also determined.
    We measure two figures: micro-average , where number of senses, agreement by chance, and are determined as an average for all words in the set, and macro-average , where inter-tagger agreement, agreement by chance, and are individually determined for each of the words in the set, and then combined in an overall average.
    With an average of five senses per word, the average value for the agreement by chance is measured at 0.20, resulting in a micro- statistic of 0.58.
    For macro- estimations, we assume that word
