es coincide with segment boundaries, and such that no two rectangles overlap either vertically or horizontally.
    The aligned blocks in Figure 10 are outlined with solid lines.
    SIMR's initial output has more expressive power than the alignment that can be derived from it.
    One illustration of this difference is that segment correspondence can represent order inversions, but segment alignment cannot.
    Inversions occur surprisingly often in real bitexts, even for sentence-size segments (Church 1993).
    Figure 10 provides another illustration.
    If, instead of the point in cell (H,e), there was a point in cell (G,f), the correct alignment for that region would still be ((G,H), (e,f)).
    If there were points of correspondence in both (H,e) and (G,f), the correct alignment would still be the same.
    Yet, the three cases are clearly different.
    If a lexicographer wanted to see a word in segment G in its bilingual context, it would be useful to know whether segment f is relevant.
