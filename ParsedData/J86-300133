the intentional structure is developed as the text is being written.
    Figure 1 illustrates some fundamental distinctions between the intentional and attentional components of discourse structure.
    First, the dominance hierarchy provides, among other things, a complete record of the discourse-level intentions and their dominance (as well as, when relevant, satisfaction-precedence) relationships, whereas the focusing structure at any one time can essentially contain only information that is relevant to purposes in a portion of the dominance hierarchy.
    Second, at the conclusion of a discourse, if it completes normally, the focus stack will be empty, while the intentional structure will have been fully constructed.
    Third, when the discourse is being processed, only the attentional state can constrain the interpretation of referring expressions directly.
    We can now also clarify some misinterpretations of focus-space diagrams and task structure in our earlier work (Grosz 1978a, 1981, 1974).
