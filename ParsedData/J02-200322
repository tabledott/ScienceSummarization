i 1996; Pedersen 1996), which can be applied to tables regardless of the size of the counts they contain.
    The main problem with this test is that it is computationally expensive, especially for large contingency tables.
    What we have found in practice is that applying the chi-square test to tables dominated by low counts tends to produce an insignificant result, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.
    The consequences of this for the generalization procedure are that low-count tables tend to result in the procedure moving up to the next node in the hierarchy.
    But given that the purpose of the generalization is to overcome the sparsedata problem, moving up a node is desirable, and therefore we do not modify the test for tables with low counts.
    The final issue to consider is which chi-square statistic to use.
    Dunning (1993) argues for the use of G2 rather than X2, based on the claim that the sampling distribution of G2 approaches the true chi-square distribution quicker than the sampling
