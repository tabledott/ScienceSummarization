ordering over the systems, we instead relied on random selection and a reasonably large sample size to make the comparisons fair.
    We use the collected rank labels to assign each system a score that reflects how highly that system was usually ranked by the annotators.
    The score for some system A reflects how frequently it was judged to be better than or equal to other systems.
    Specifically, each block in which A appears includes four implicit pairwise comparisons (against the other presented systems).
    A is rewarded once for each of the four comparisons in which A wins or ties.
    A&#8217;s score is the number of such winning (or tying) pairwise comparisons, divided by the total number of pairwise comparisons involving A.
    The system scores are reported in Section 5.
    Appendix A provides detailed tables that contain pairwise head-to-head comparisons between pairs of systems.
    We were interested in determining the inter- and intra-annotator agreement for the ranking task, since a reason
