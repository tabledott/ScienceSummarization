ements of the second set from/to the first).
    (Re)compute the probability model, using counts over the items in .
    Add to all slots in for which: &#8211;at least two candidates meet the evidence count threshold for a given probability level (see Figure 1); and &#8211;the log ratio between the two highest probability candidates meets the log ratio threshold.
    For each slot in , assign the highest probability role.
    Set to and set to .
    Decrement the log ratio threshold.
  
  
    For the initial set of experiments, we chose 54 target verbs from three top-level VerbNet classes: preparing-26.3, transfer mesg-37.1, and contribute13.2.
    We looked for classes that contained a large number of medium to high frequency verbs displaying a variety of interesting properties, such as having ambiguous (or unambiguous) semantic roles given certain syntactic constructions, or having ambiguous semantic role assignments that could (or alternatively, could not) be distinguished by knowledge of verb class.
