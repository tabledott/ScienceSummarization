tten: For the training of the above model parameters, we use the maximum likelihood criterion in the so-called maximum approximation.
    When aligning the words in parallel texts (for IndoEuropean language pairs like Spanish-English, French-English, Italian-German,...), we typically observe a strong localization effect.
    In many cases, although not always, there is an even stronger restriction: over large portions of the source string, the alignment is monotone.
    In this approach, we first assume that the alignments satisfy the monotonicity requirement.
    Within the translation search, we will introduce suitably restricted permutations of the source string, to satisfy this requirement.
    For the alignment model, the monotonicity property allows only transitions from a3_1 to ai with a jump width 6: 6 a3 &#8212; ai_i E ICI, 1, 21.
    Theses jumps correspond to the following three cases (6 = 0, 1, 2): new target word is generated.
    &#8226; 8 = 2 (skip transition = non-aligned word): This case corr
