y translated with SI and the third column indicates the number of these collocations that were incorrectly translated with SI.
    The last column and the last row show the total number of collocations correctly and incorrectly translated when the Dice coefficient or SI is used respectively.
    From the table we see that every time SI produced good results, the Dice coefficient also produced good results; there were no cases for which SI produced a correct result while the Dice coefficient produced an incorrect one.
    In addition, we see that out of the 17 incorrect results produced by SI, the Dice coefficient corrected 10.
    Although based on only a few cases, this experiment confirms that the Dice coefficient outperforms SI in the context of Champollion.
    Table 4 gives concrete examples from this experiment in which the Dice coefficient outperforms specific mutual information.
    The table has a format similar to that of Table 2.
