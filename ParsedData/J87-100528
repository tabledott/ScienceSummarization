,person(x),here(x))) Note that because of the recursive call in pull-opaque-args these two readings will be generated even if this form is embedded within other transparent predicates.
  
  
    The notion of applicable term used above was quite simple.
    A complex term was applicable to a wff if it was embedded in no other complex term within the wff.
    The restriction is motivated by the following consideration.
    Suppose the input wff is the remaining complex term would include a free occurrence of y so that when it is later applied, resulting in the formula the variable y occurs free in the restriction of q, .
    Thus, it is critical that a term never be applied to a form when a variable that is free in the term is bound outside of it in the form.
    The simple definition of applicability goes part of the way towards enforcing this requirement.
    Unfortunately, this simple definition of applicability is inadequate.
    If x had itself been free in the embedded complex term, as in the wff the app
