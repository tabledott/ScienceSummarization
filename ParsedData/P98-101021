earning models for full parsing, i.e., learning hierarchical structures.
    We refer here only to the DOP (Data Oriented Parsing) method (Bod, 1992) which, like the present work, is a memory-based approach.
    This method constructs parse alternatives for a sentence based on combinations of subtrees in the training corpus.
    The MBSL approach may be viewed as a linear analogy to DOP in that it constructs a cover for a candidate based on subsequences of training instances.
    Other implementations of the memory-based paradigm for NLP tasks include Daelemans et al. (1996), for POS tagging; Cardie (1993), for syntactic and semantic tagging; and Stanfill and Waltz (1986), for word pronunciation.
    In all these works, examples are represented as sets of features and the deduction is carried out by finding the most similar cases.
    The method presented here is radically different in that it makes use of the raw sequential form of the data, and generalizes by reconstructing test examples from different piec
