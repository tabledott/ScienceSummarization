dge representation system.
  
  
    In this section I turn to the question of whether current theories have changed the way we look at representation and lexicon design.
    The question here is whether the representations assumed by current theories are adequate to account for the richness of natural language semantics.
    It should be pointed out here that a theory of lexical meaning will affect the general design of our semantic theory in several ways.
    If we view the goal of a semantic theory as being able to recursively assign meanings to expressions, accounting for phenomena such as synonymy, antonymy, polysemy, metonymy, etc., then our view of compositionality depends ultimately on what the basic lexical categories of the language denote.
    Conventional wisdom on this point paints a picture of words behaving as either active functors or passive arguments (Montague 1974).
    But we will see that if we change the way in which categories can denote, then the form of compositionality itself changes
