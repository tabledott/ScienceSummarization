For Spanish, the units for string operations in the evaluation metrics are words, whereas for Japanese they are Japanese characters.
    The training and test data for the English-to-Spanish experiments were taken from a set of transcribed utterances from the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) corpus together with a translation of each utterance to Spanish.
    An utterance is typically a single sentence but is sometimes more than one sentence spoken in sequence.
    Alignment search and transduction training was carried out only on bitexts with sentences up to length 20, a total of 13,966 training bitexts.
    The test set consisted of 1,185 held-out bitexts at all lengths.
    Table 1 shows the word accuracy percentages (see Section 5.1) for the trained model, e2s, against the original held-out translations at various source sentence lengths.
    Scores are also given for a &amp;quot;word-for-word&amp;quot; baseline, sww, in which each English word is translated by the most highly correlated Spanish word.
