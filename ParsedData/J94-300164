text strings do not result in rule applications, either because the rule is optional or because the other conditions of the rule are not satisfied.
    Thus, the relation must disregard the markers corresponding to those occurrences inside the identity substrings between rule applications.
    Relations with this behavior can be obtained through the use of the ignoring operator defined in Section 3, which is notated by subscripting.
    Let m (for marker) be {&lt;, &gt;}, the set of both markers.
    Then our next approximation to the replacement relation is defined as follows: This allows arbitrary strings of matching symbols drawn from EU {&lt;, &gt;} between rule applications and requires &lt; : &lt; and &gt; : &gt; to key off a 0-0 replacement.
    The subscript m's also indicate that &lt; and &gt; can be ignored in the middle of the replacement, since the appearance of left- or right-context strings is irrelevant in the middle of a given rule application.
