 the recency and segmentation heuristics: just one potential antecedent for each different head noun is available for resolution, the last 27 In our experiments small differences in recall, precision, and F measures are frequent.
    We generally assume in this paper that such differences are not significant, but a more formal significance test along the lines of that in Chinchor (1995) will eventually be necessary to verify this. occurrence of that head noun.
    The resolution still respects the segmentation heuristic (loose version).
    The results are presented in Table 7.
    This table shows that by combining the recency and loose segmentation approaches to segmentation we obtain a better trade-off between recall and precision than using each heuristic separately.
    The version with higher F value in Table 7 (four-sentence window plus recency) was chosen as standard and used in the tests discussed in the rest of this section. of potential antecedents discussed in Section 4.1, using four-sentence-wind
