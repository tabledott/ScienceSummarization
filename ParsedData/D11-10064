pervised parsers by a significant margin.
    This result holds in the presence of both gold POS tags as well as automatic tags projected from English.
    This emphasizes that even for languages with no syntactic resources &#8211; or possibly even parallel data &#8211; simple transfer methods can already be more powerful than grammar induction systems.
    Next, we use this delexicalized English parser to seed a perceptron learner for the target language.
    The model is trained to update towards parses that are in high agreement with a source side English parse based on constraints drawn from alignments in the parallel data.
    We use the augmented-loss learning procedure (Hall et al., 2011) which is closely related to constraint driven learning (Chang et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2010).
    The resulting parser consistently improves on the directly transferred delexicalized parser, reducing relative errors by 8% on average, and as much as 18% on some languages.
    Finally, we show that by transferring pa
