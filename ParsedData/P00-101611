    What that study did not address, however, was the cost of the human labor and/or machine cycles involved to construct such a system, nor the relative cost of obtaining the training data for the machine learning system.
    This paper will estimate and contrast these costs relative to performance.
    To investigate the costs of a human rule-writing system, we used a similar framework to that of Brill &amp; Ngai.
    The system was written as a cgi script which could be accessed across the web from a browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer.
    Like Brill &amp; Ngai's 1999 approach, our rules were based on Perl regular expressions.
    However, instead of explicitly defining rule actions and having different kinds of rules, our rules implicitly define their actions by using different symbols to denote the placement of the base noun phrase-enclosing parentheses prior to and after the application of the rule.
    Table 1 presents a comparison of our rule format against that of Brill &amp; Ngai's.
