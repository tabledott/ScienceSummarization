  1043 5 Evaluat ion The objective of the evaluation is to examine the advantages of the DSM over the FSG-based model for simplification.
  In the FSG approach since the input to the simplifier is a set of noun and verb groups, the rules for the simplifier have to identify basic predicate argument relations to ensure that the right chunks remain together in the output.
  The simplifier in the DSM has access to infor- mation about argument structure, which makes it much easier to specify simplification patterns involving complete constituents.
