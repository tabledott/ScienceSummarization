	We collected 30 newspaper articles (575 sentences) from the British National Corpus (BNC) and the American News Text corpus, forwhich we obtained manual compressions.
			In or der to confirm that the task was feasible, five of these documents were initially compressed by two annotators (not the authors).
			The annotators weregiven instructions that explained the task and defined sentence compression with the aid of examples.
			They were asked to paraphrase while preserv ing the most important information and ensuring the compressed sentences remained grammatical.They were encouraged to use any rewriting opera tions that seemed appropriate, e.g., to delete words, add new words, substitute them or reorder them.Assessing inter-annotator agreement is notori ously difficult for paraphrasing tasks (Barzilay, 2003) since there can be many valid outputs for a given input.
