irs with the relation type set to NONE and participating systems would replace that value with one of the six allowed relation types.
    However, participating systems were allowed to not replace NONE and not be penalized for it.
    Those cases would not be counted when compiling the scores in table 6.
    Table 7 lists those systems that did not classify all relation and the percentage of relations for each task that those systems did not classify.
    A comparison with the Tempeval-1 results from Semeval-2007 may be of interest.
    Six systems participated in the TempEval-1 tasks, compared to seven or eight systems for TempEval-2.
    Table 8 lists the average scores and the standard deviations for all the tasks (on the English data) that Tempeval-1 and Tempeval-2 have in common.
    The results are very similar except for task D, but if we take a away the one outlier (the NCSUjoint score of 0.21) then the average becomes 0.78 with a standard deviation of 0.05.
    However, we had expected that for TempE
