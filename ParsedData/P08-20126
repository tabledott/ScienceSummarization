 Equation 2.
    As noted, these assignments may not be a legal clustering because there is no guarantee of transitivity.
    The transitive closure happens in an ad-hoc manner after this assignment is found: any two mentions linked through other mentions are determined to be coreferent.
    Our SOON-STYLE baseline used the same training and testing regimen as Soon et al. (2001).
    Our D&amp;B-STYLE baseline used the same test time method as Denis and Baldridge (2007), however at training time we created data for all mention pairs.
    Because of the ad-hoc manner in which transitivity is enforced in our baseline systems, we do not necessarily find the most probable legal clustering.
    This is exactly the kind of task at which integer linear programming excels.
    We need to first formulate the objective function which we wish the ILP solver to maximize at test time.2 Let p(i j) = log P(x(i ,j)  |mi, mj; 0), which is the log probability that mi and mj are coreferent according to the pairwise logistic cla
