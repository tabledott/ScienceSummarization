itions, paraphrases were posited for 1194 sentences, conditions 3 and 4 could be applied to 1142 of those sentences, but conditions 5&#8211;8 could only be applied to 876 sentences.
    The substitution constraints reduce coverage to 73% of the test sentences.
    Given that the extraction constraints have better coverage and nearly identical performance on 3Our results show a significantly lower score for the baseline than reported in Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005).
    This is potentially due to the facts that in this work we evaluated on out-of-domain news commentary data, and we randomly selected phrases.
    In the pervious work the test phrases were drawn from WordNet, and they were evaluated solely on in-domain European parliament data. the meaning criterion, they might be more suitable in some circumstances.
  
  
    In this paper we have presented a novel refinement to paraphrasing with bilingual parallel corpora.
    We illustrated that a significantly higher performance can be achieved by const
