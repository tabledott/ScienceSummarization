method exploitssyntactic information in the form of dependency re lation paths together with FrameNet-like semanticroles to smooth lexical and syntactic divergences be tween question and answer sentences.
			Our approach is less domain dependent and resource intensive than Narayanan and Harabagiu (2004), it solely employs a dependency parser and the FrameNet database.
			In contrast to Kaisser (2006), we model the semanticrole assignment and answer extraction tasks numerically, thereby alleviating the coverage problems en countered previously.
	
	
			We briefly summarize the architecture of the QA system we are working with before formalizing the mechanics of our FrameNet-based answer extractionmodule.
			In common with previous work, our over all approach consists of three stages: (a) determiningthe expected answer type of the question, (b) retrieving passages likely to contain answers to the question, and (c) performing a match between the ques tion words and retrieved passages in order to extract the answe
