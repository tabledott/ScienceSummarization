) and applied it to QA.Similarly, Murdock and Croft (2005) adopted a sim ple translation model from IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al, 1993) and applied it to QA.Porting the translation model to QA is not straight forward; it involves parse-tree pruning heuristics (the first two deterministic steps in Echihabi andMarcu, 2003) and also replacing the lexical trans lation table with a monolingual ?dictionary?
			which simply encodes the identity relation.
			This brings usto the question that drives this work: is there a statistical translation-like model that is natural and accu rate for question answering?
			We propose Smith andEisner?s (2006) quasi-synchronous grammar (Sec tion 3) as a general solution and the Jeopardy model (Section 4) as a specific instance.
	
	
			For a formal description of QG, we recommendSmith and Eisner (2006).
			We briefly review the central idea here.
			QG arose out of the empirical observation that translated sentences often have some isomorphic syntactic structure, bu
