ndi 1990).
    Here we employ the tools of semantic analysis from Section 1 to examine the behavior of metonymy with reporting verbs.
    We will show, on the basis of corpus analysis, how verbs display marked differences in the ability to license metonymic operations over their arguments.
    Such information, we argue, is part of the preference semantics for a sublanguage, as automatically derived from corpus.
    Metonymy can be seen as a case of &amp;quot;licensed violation&amp;quot; of selectional restrictions.
    For example, while the verb announce selects for a human subject, sentences like The Phantasie Corporation announced third quarter losses are not only an acceptable paraphrase of the selectionally correct form Mr. Phantasie Jr. announced third quarter losses for Phantasie Corp, but they are the preferred form in the Wall Street Journal).
    This is an example of subject type coercion, as discussed in Section 1.
    For example, the qualia structure for a noun such as corporation might be repr
