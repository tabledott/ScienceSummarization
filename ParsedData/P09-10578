EX software (a commercial IP solver package).
    Alternatively, there are other programs such as lp solve, which are free and publicly available for use.
    Once we create an integer program for the full test corpus, and pass it to CPLEX, the solver returns an sponding grammar sizes for the sample word sequence from Figure 2 using the given dictionary and grammar.
    The IP solver finds the smallest grammar set that can explain the given word sequence.
    In this example, there exist two solutions that each contain only 4 tag pair entries, and IP returns one of them. objective function value of 459.3 CPLEX also returns a tag sequence via assignments to the link variables.
    However, there are actually 104378 tag sequences compatible with the 459-sized grammar, and our IP solver just selects one at random.
    We find that of all those tag sequences, the worst gives an accuracy of 50.8%, and the best gives an accuracy of 90.3%.
    We also note that CPLEX takes 320 seconds to return the optimal solution
