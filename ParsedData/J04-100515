 we believe are too many to gain a general insight into the meaning of the specific &#954;Co value.
    Alternatively, Byrt, Bishop, and Carlin (1993) suggest that intercoder reliability be reported as three numbers: &#954;Co and two adjustments of &#954;Co, one with bias removed, the other with prevalence removed.
    The value of &#954;Co adjusted for bias turns out to be ... &#954;S&amp;C.
    Adjusted for prevalence, &#954;Co yields a measure that is equal to 2P(A) &#8722; 1.
    The results for Example 1 should then be reported as &#954;Co = 0.6724, &#954;S&amp;C = 0.6632, 2P(A)&#8722;1 = 0.6666; those for Example 6 as &#954;Co = 0.418, &#954;S&amp;C = 0.27, and 2P(A)&#8722;1 = 0.3.
    For both Examples 3 and 4, 2P(A) &#8722; 1 = 0.8.
    Collectively, these three numbers appear to provide a means of better judging the meaning of &#954; values.
    Reporting both &#954; and 2P(A) &#8722; 1 may seem contradictory, as 2P(A) &#8722; 1 does not correct for expected agreement.
    However, when the distribut
