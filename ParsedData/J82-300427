s whose left sub-tree l is from L and whose right sub-tree r is from R. (22) L x R = {(1, r) 11 cL &amp; r&#8364;R} This is a formal definition.
    For practical purposes, it may be more useful for the parser to output the list in the factored form: which is much more concise than a list of trees.
    It is possible, for example, that semantic processing can take advantage of factoring, capturing a semantic generalization that holds across all subjects or all predicates.
    Imagine, for example, that there is a semantic agreement constraint between predicates and arguments.
    For example, subjects and predicates might have to agree on the feature +human.
    Suppose that we were given sentences where this constraint was violated by all ambiguous interpretations of the sentence.
    In this case, it would be more efficient to employ a feature vector scheme (Dostert and Thompson 1971) which propagates the features in factored form.
    That is, it computes a feature vector for the union of all possible subj
