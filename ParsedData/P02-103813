tor by a constant positive value does not affect the decision rule.
    We see that adding new features also has an effect on the other model scaling factors.
  
  
    The use of direct maximum entropy translation models for statistical machine translation has been suggested by (Papineni et al., 1997; Papineni et al., 1998).
    They train models for natural language understanding rather than natural language translation.
    In contrast to their approach, we include a dependence on the hidden variable of the translation model in the direct translation model.
    Therefore, we are able to use statistical alignment models, which have been shown to be a very powerful component for statistical machine translation systems.
    In speech recognition, training the parameters of the acoustic model by optimizing the (average) mutual information and conditional entropy as they are defined in information theory is a standard approach (Bahl et al., 1986; Ney, 1995).
    Combining various probabilistic models for speech
