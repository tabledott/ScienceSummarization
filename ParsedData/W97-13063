;quot; Humans, unlike most coreference algorithms, notice such cases of ambiguity and can then ask for clarification or at least grumble about how we cannot climb into the writers head to figure out what they meant.
    But in that grumble we have articulated the essence of the problem--we don't have sufficient knowledge to satisfy ourselves that an antecedent has been found.
    Pronoun resolution systems have extremely limited knowledge sources, they cannot access a fraction of human common sense knowledge.
    To appreciate this consider the following text with grammatical tags replacing words with pronouns and names left in place: The city council VERBGROUP the women NP CC they VB NN Mariana VBD PP Sarah TO VB herself PP DT MD NN Without lexical knowledge a human attempting to resolve the pronouns is in much the knowledge impoverished position of the typical coreference algorithm.
    It is no surprise that texts with so little information provided in them tend to be more ambiguous than the texts in flesh
