t a set of more informative relations.
    For example, it combined the subject and complement of the verb 'be' (as in 'the man is happy') into a single relation.
    Likewise, a verb with its preposition and the head noun of a modifying prepositional phrase (as in sit on the chair) were also combined.
    The routine was designed to choose relations that impose considerable restrictions on the possible (or probable) syntactic tuples.
    On the other hand, these relations should not be too specific, to allow statistically meaningful samples.
    The first step in resolving an ambiguity is to find all the syntactic tuples containing the ambiguous words.
    For (3) we get the following syntactic tuples: (these tuples translate as joining-increase, increase-chance, achieve-progress, and progressin-talks).
    In using these tuples, we expect to capture lexical constraints that are imposed by syntactic relations.
    The set of syntactic tuples in the source language sentence is reflected in its translation to
