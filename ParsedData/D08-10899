All phrase pairs inthis paper are extracted with the phrase-extract algo rithm (Och and Ney, 2004), with maximum length set to 7.Word-based orientation model: This model an alyzes word alignments at positions (s?1,u?1) and (s?1,v+1) in the alignment grid shown in Fig.
			2(a).
			Specifically, orientation is set to oi = M if (s? 1,u? 1) contains a word alignment and (s?1,v+1) contains no word alignment.
			It is set to oi = S if (s?1,u?1) contains no word alignment and (s?1,v+1) contains a word alignment.
			In all other cases, it is set to oi = D. This procedure is exactly the same as the one implemented in Moses.2 Phrase-based orientation model: The modelpresented in (Tillman, 2004) is similar to th
