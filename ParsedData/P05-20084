r the results produced by one classifier are statistically significantly better than those from another, at a confidence interval of at least 95%.
    Engstr&#168;om (2004) demonstrated how machinelearning techniques for sentiment classification can be topic dependent.
    However, that study focused on a three-way classification (positive, negative and neutral).
    In this paper, for uniformity across different data sets, we focus on only positive and negative sentiment.
    This experiment also provides an opportunity to evaluate the Naive Bayes classifier as the previous work used SVMs.
    We use subsets of a Newswire dataset (kindly provided by Roy Lipski of Infonic Ltd.) that relate to the topics of Finance (FIN), Mergers and Aquisitions (M&amp;A) and a mixture of both topics (MIX).
    Each subset contains further subsets of articles of positive and negative sentiment (selected by independent trained annotators), each containing 100 stories.
    We trained a model on a dataset relating to one topic an
