he semantic similarity computation, the presence of these monosemous words provides strong reinforcement for the INSECT sense of bee.
    Moreover, it enables us to tag instances of bee with their more specific compound-noun senses when they appear within a compound that is known to the sense inventory. lit the third step, the target set is treated as a problem of monolingual sense disambiguation with respect to the target-language sense inventory.
    Consider the target set {disaster, tragedy, situation}: to the human reader, the juxtaposition of these words within a single set automatically brings certain senses 2We used a small set of compound-matching rules considering a window of two tokens to the right and left, and also used the &amp;quot;satellite&amp;quot; annotations in SENSEVAL data as part of our preprocessing. to the foreground.
    The same intuitive idea is exploited by Resnik's (1999b) algorithm for disambiguating groups of related nouns, which we apply here.
    For a target set {el, ..., en
