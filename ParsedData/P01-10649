thm allows the text to be segmented anywhere between words; i.e., all the positions between words are candidates for segment boundaries.
    It is easy, however, to modify the algorithm so that the text can only be segmented at particular positions, such as the ends of sentences or paragraphs.
    This is done by using a subset of in Equation (15).
    We use only the edges whose initial and terminal vertices are candidate boundaries that meet particular conditions, such as being the ends of sentences or paragraphs.
    We then obtain the minimum-cost path by doing Steps 1 and 2.
    The minimum-cost segmentation thus obtained meets the boundary conditions.
    In this paper, we assume that the segment boundaries are at the ends of sentences.
    Generally speaking, the number of segments obtained by our algorithm is not sensitive to the length of a given text, which is counted in words.
    In other words, the number of segments is relatively stable with respect to variation in the text length.
