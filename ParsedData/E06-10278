 to measure the similarity between candidate words and sentiment-bearing words such as good and bad (Kamps et al, 2004).In this paper, we propose an approach to sentiment annotation of WordNet entries that was implemented and tested in the Semantic Tag Extrac tion Program (STEP).
			This approach relies bothon lexical relations (synonymy, antonymy and hyponymy) provided in WordNet and on the WordNet glosses.
			It builds upon the properties of dic tionary entries as a special kind of structured text:such lexicographical texts are built to establish se mantic equivalence between the left-hand and theright-hand parts of the dictionary entry, and there fore are designed to match as close as possible the components of meaning of the word.
			They have relatively standard style, grammar and syntactic structures, which removes a substantial source of noise common to other types of text, and finally, they have extensive coverage spanning the entire lexicon of a natural language.
			The STEP algorithm starts with a s
