FUs are regular expressions specifying paths in f-structure between a source(where linguistic material is encountered) and a target (where linguistic material is interpreted semantically).
			To account for the fronted sentential con stituents in Figures 3 and 4, an FU equation of the form ? TOPIC = ? COMP* COMP would be required.The equation states that the value of the TOPIC at tribute is token identical with the value of the finalCOMP argument along a path through the immedi ately enclosing f-structure along zero or more COMPattributes.
			This FU equation is annotated to the top icalised sentential constituent in the relevant CFG rules as follows S ? S NP VP ?TOPIC=?
			?SUBJ=?
			?TOPIC=?COMP*COMP and generates the LDD-resolved proper f-structurein Figure 3 for the traceless tree in Figure 4, as re quired.In addition to FU equations, subcategorisation in formation is a crucial ingredient in LFG?s accountof LDDs.
			As an example, for a topicalised con stituent to be resolved as the argument of a local pr
