			This lead to the question if we can iterate the retrieval process several times to get further improvement, or if the observed improvement results form using for (good) translations, which have more diversity than the translations in an n-best list.
			On the other side the oracle experiment also shows that the optimally expected improvement is limited by the translation model and decoding algorithm used in the current SMT system.
	
	
			In this paper, we studied language model adaptation for statistical machine translation.
			Extracting sentences most similar to the initial translations, building specific language models for each sentence to be translated, and interpolating those with the background language models gives significant improvement in translation quality.
			Using structured query models, which capture word order information, leads to better results that plain bag of words models.
			The results obtained suggest a number of extensions of this work: The first question is if more data to
