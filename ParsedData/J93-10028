mance of an optimized variant of Tomita's (1987) generalized LR parsing algorithm to an (efficiently indexed and optimized) chart parser.
    We report promising results of a pilot study training on 150 noun definitions from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) and retesting on these plus a further 55 definitions.
    Finally, we discuss limitations of the current system and possible extensions to deal with lexical (syntactic and semantic) frequency of occurrence.
  
  
    The task of syntactically analyzing substantial corpora of naturally occurring text and transcribed speech has become a focus of recent work.
    Analyzed corpora would be of great benefit in the gathering of statistical data regarding language use, for example to train speech recognition devices, in more general linguistic research, and as a first step toward robust wide-coverage semantic interpretation.
    The Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT) system is a wide-coverage lexical, morphological, and syntactic analysis s
