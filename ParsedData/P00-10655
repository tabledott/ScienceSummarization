   Examples of domains (see Figure 1) include &amp;quot;motion&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;cognition&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;communication&amp;quot;.
    Within these frames, examples of a total of 1462 distinct lexical predicates, or target words, were annotated: 927 verbs, 339 nouns, and 175 adjectives.
    There are a total of 49,013 annotated sentences, and 99,232 annotated frame elements (which do not include the target words themselves).
  
  
    Assignment of semantic roles is an important part of language understanding, and has been attacked by many computational systems.
    Traditional parsing and understanding systems, including implementations of unification-based grammars such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1994), rely on handdeveloped grammars which must anticipate each way in which semantic roles may be realized syntactically.
    Writing such grammars is time-consuming, and typically such systems have limited coverage.
    Data-driven techniques have recently been applied to template-based semantic inter
