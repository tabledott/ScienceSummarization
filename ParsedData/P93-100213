nd 1:2 sentence beads.
    To reduce the number of independent parameters we need to estimate, we tied these distributions together.
    We assumed that the distribution of word beads in 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 sentence beads are identical.
    We took the distribution of word beads in I To be precise, we assumed a uniform distribution over some arbitrarily large finite range, as one cannot have a uniform distribution over a countably infinite set.
    1:0 and 0:1 sentence beads to be identical as well except restricted to the relevant subset of word beads and normalized appropriately, i.e., we took where pe refers to the distribution of word beads in 1:0 sentence beads, pi refers to the distribution of word beads in 0:1 sentence beads, Pb refers to the distribution of word beads in 1:1, 2:1, and 1:2 sentence beads, and Be and B1 refer to the sets of 1:0 and 0:1 word beads in the vocabulary, respectively.
    The probability of generating a 0:1 or 1:0 sentence bead can be calculated efficiently using the equation g
