xistential NPs.
    When we combined the Si and EHP heuristics, recall increased to 80% with precision dropping only slightly to 82%.
    When we combined all three methods (Si, EHP, and DO), recall increased to 82% without any corresponding loss of precision.
    These experiments show that these heuristics substantially increase recall and are identifying different sets of existential NPs.
    Finally, we tested our vaccine algorithm to see if it could increase precision without sacrificing much recall.
    We experimented with two variations: Va used an upper definite probability threshold of 70% and VI, used an upper definite probability threshold of 50%.
    Both variations used a lower definite probability threshold of 25%.
    The results are shown in rows 7-8 of Figure 7.
    Both vaccine variations increased precision by several percentage points with only a slight drop in recall.
    In previous work, the system developed by Vieria &amp; Poesio achieved 74% recall and 85% precision for identifying &
