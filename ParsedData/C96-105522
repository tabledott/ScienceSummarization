rectly with the verbs classified by Leviu.
  The "closest" synonyms are then selected flom these sets by comparing the LDOCE grammar codes of tire unknown word with those associated with each synonym candi- date.
  The use of LDOCE as a syntactic filter on tire semantics derived from WordNet is tire key to resolv- ing word-sense ambiguity during the acquisition pro- cess.
  The fldl acquisition algorithm is as follows: 325 Given a verb, check I,evin (:lass.
  If in Levitt, classify directly.
  2. if not in Levin, find synonym set from WordNet.
  (a) if synonym in Levin, select, the class that has the closest match with canonical LDOCE codes.
  (b) If no synonyms in Levin or canonical LDOCE codes are completely mismatched, hypothesize new class.
  Note that this algorithm assmnes that there is a "canonicM" set of LDOCE codes tbr each of Levins semantic lasses.
  Table 5 describes the significance of a subset of the syntactic codes in LDOCE.
  (The total nmnber of codes is 174.)
