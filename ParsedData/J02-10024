    Some of these algorithms produce hierarchical dialogue segmentations whose evaluation is outside the scope of this discussion.
    There are two major difficulties associated with evaluating algorithms for text segmentation.
    The first is that since human judges do not always agree where boundaries should be placed and how fine grained an analysis should be, it is difficult to choose a reference segmentation for comparison.
    Some evaluations circumvent this difficulty by detecting boundaries in sets of concatenated documents, where there can be no disagreements about the fact of the matter (Reynar 1994; Choi 2000); others have several human judges make ratings to produce a &#8220;gold standard.&#8221; The second difficulty with evaluating these algorithms is that for different applications of text segmentation, different kinds of errors become important.
    For instance, for information retri
