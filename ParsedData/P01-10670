  A Syntax-Based Statistical Translation Model
  
    We present a syntax-based statistical translation model.
    Our model transforms a source-language parse tree into a target-language string by applying stochastic operations at each node.
    These operations capture linguistic differences such as word order and case marking.
    Model parameters are estimated in polynomial time using an EM algorithm.
    The model produces word alignments that are better than those
  
  
    A statistical translation model (TM) is a mathematical model in which the process of humanlanguage translation is statistically modeled.
    Model parameters are automatically estimated using a corpus of translation pairs.
    TMs have been used for statistical machine translation (Berger et al., 1996), word alignment of a translation corpus (Melamed, 2000), multilingual document retrieval (Franz et al., 1999), automatic dictionary construction (Resnik and Melamed, 1997), and data preparation for word sense disambiguation programs (
