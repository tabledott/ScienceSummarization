ace defined by the kernel function.
    Classification then consists of determining on which side of the separating hyperplane x lies.
    A support vector machine (SVM) is a type of classifier that formulates the task of finding the separating hyperplane as the solution to a quadratic programming problem (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000).
    Support vector machines attempt to find a hyperplane that not only separates the classes but also maximizes the margin between them.
    The hope is that this will lead to better generalization performance on unseen instances.
  
  
    Our task is to detect and classify relations between entities in text.
    We assume that entity tagging has been performed; so to generate potential relation instances, we iterate over all pairs of entities occurring in the same sentence.
    For each entity pair, we create an augmented dependency tree (described below) representing this instance.
    Given a labeled training set of potential relations, we define a tree kernel over d
