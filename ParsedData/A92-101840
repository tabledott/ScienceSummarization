complementizers, and indicators of sentence boundaries, and an &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; type.
    After a sentence has been partitioned, each simple noun phrase is examined in the context of the phrase to its left and the phrase to its right.
    On the basis of this local context and a set of rules, the noun phrase is marked as a syntactic Subject, Object, Predicative, or is not marked at all.
    A label of Predicative is assigned only if it can be determined that the governing verb group is a form of a predicating verb (e.g., a form of &amp;quot;be&amp;quot;).
    Because this cannot always be determined, some Predicatives are labeled Objects.
    If a noun phrase is labeled, it is also annotated as to whether the governing verb is the closest verb group to the right or to the left.
    The algorithm has an accuracy of approximately 80% in assigning grammatical functions.
