he spectrum are domain-specific roles such as the FRoM AIRPoRT, To AIRPoRT, or DEPART TIME discussed above, or verb-specific roles such as EATER and EATEN for the verb eat.
    The opposite end of the spectrum consists of theories with only two &#8220;proto-roles&#8221; or &#8220;macroroles&#8221;: PRoTo-AGENT and PRoTo-PATIENT (Van Valin 1993; Dowty 1991).
    In between lie many theories with approximately 10 roles, such as Fillmore&#8217;s (1971) list of nine: AGENT, EXPERIENCER, INSTRUMENT, OBJECT, SoURCE, GoAL, LoCATIoN, TIME, and PATH.1 Sample domains and frames from the FrameNet lexicon.
    Many of these sets of roles have been proposed by linguists as part of theories of linking, the part of grammatical theory that describes the relationship between semantic roles and their syntactic realization.
    Other sets have been used by computer scientists in implementing natural language understanding systems.
    As a rule, the more abstract roles have been proposed by linguists, who are more concerned wit
