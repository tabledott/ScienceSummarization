the parser will add an extra predication effecting just the same &amp;quot;reanalysis&amp;quot; as was done for (6.1).
    We assume that the passive rule inserts a trace either immediately after a verb, or after the preposition immediately following a verb, if that preposition is lexically specified for that verb.
    We will not argue for this analysis here; suffice it to say that this analysis is motivated by facts which also motivate recent somewhat similar analyses of passive, e.g.
    [Hornstein and Weinberg 811 and [Bresnan 821.
    Given this analysis, the parser will now drop a passive trace for the subject &amp;quot;the house&amp;quot; into the buffer after the lexically specified preposition &amp;quot;of&amp;quot;, and the parse will then move to completion.
    (One issue that remains open, though, is exactly how the parser knows not to drop the passive trace after &amp;quot;made&amp;quot;.
    The solution to this particular problem must interact correctly with many such control problems involvin
