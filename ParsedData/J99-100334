such intersections that are large enough to accommodate new chains, Segments i and j switched places during translation.
    Any nonmonotonic segment of the TBM will occupy the intersection of a vertical gap and a horizontal gap in the monotonic first-pass map.
    These larger nonmonotonic segments can be recovered during a second sweep through the bitext space. so the second-pass search requires only a small fraction of the computational effort of the first pass.
  
  
    SIMR's parameters&#8212;the fixed chain size; the LCSR threshold used in the matching predicate; and the thresholds for maximum point dispersal, maximum angle deviation, and maximum point ambiguity&#8212;interact in complicated ways.
    Ideally, SIMR should be reparameterized so that its parameters are pairwise independent.
    Then it may be possible to optimize the parameters analytically, or at least in a probabilistic framework.
    For now, the easiest way to optimize these parameters is via simulated annealing (Vidal 1993), a simpl
