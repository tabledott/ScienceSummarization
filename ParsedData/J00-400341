scribe the heuristics we developed for handling the first three of these classes: lexical bridges, bridges based on names, and bridges to entities introduced by nonhead nouns in a compound nominal (Poesio, Vieira, and Teufel 1997).
    4.4.1 Bridging Descriptions and WordNet.
    In order to get a system that could be evaluated on a corpus containing texts in different domains, we used WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) as an approximation of a lexical knowledge source.
    We developed a WordNet interface (Vieira and Teufel 1997) that reports a possible semantic link between two nouns when one of the following is true: Sometimes, finding a relation between two predicates involves complex searches through WordNet's hierarchy.
    For example, there may be no relation between two head nouns, but there is a relation between compound nouns in which these nouns appear: thus, there is no semantic relation between record/album, but only a synonymy relation between record _album/album .
    We found that extended searches of t
