	A Discriminative Matching Approach To Word Alignment
		We present a discriminative, large margin approach to feature-based matching for word alignment.
		In thisframework, pairs of word tokens re ceive a matching score, which is basedon features of that pair, including mea sures of association between the words,distortion between their positions, sim ilarity of the orthographic form, and soon.
		Even with only 100 labeled train ing examples and simple features whichincorporate counts from a large unlabeled corpus, we achieve AER perfor mance close to IBM Model 4, in muchless time.
		Including Model 4 predic tions as features, we achieve a relativeAER reduction of 22% in over inter sected Model 4 alignments.
	
	
			The standard approach to word alignment from sentence-aligned bitexts has been to constructmodels which generate sentences of one language from the other, then fitting those genera tive models with EM (Brown et al, 1990; Och and Ney, 2003).
			This approach has two primary advantages and two prima
