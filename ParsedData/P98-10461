tactic and semantic properties.
  
  
    The difficulty of achieving adequate handcrafted semantic representations has limited the field of natural language processing to applications that can be contained within well-defined subdomains.
    The only escape from this limitation will be through the use of automated or semi-automated methods of lexical acquisition.
    However, the field has yet to develop a clear consensus on guidelines for a computational lexicon that could provide a springboard for such methods, although attempts are being made (Pustejovsky, 1991), (Copestake and Sanfilippo, 1993), (Lowe et al., 1997), (Dorr, 1997).

    One of the most controversial areas has to do with polysemy.
    What constitutes a clear separation into senses for any one verb, and how can these senses be computationally characterized and distinguished?
    The answer to this questi
