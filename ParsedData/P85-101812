omain of &amp;quot;nonterminals,&amp;quot; namely, the elements of the restricted domain.
    This idea can be applied to solve many of the problems engendered by infinite nonterminal domains, allowing preprocessing of grammars as required by LR and LC algorithms, allowing top-down filtering or prediction as in Earley and top-down backtrack parsing, guaranteeing termination, etc.
  
  
    Before discussing the use of restriction in parsing algorithms, we present some technical details, including a brief introduction to the PATR-II grammar formalism, which will serve as the grammatical formalism that the presented algorithms will interpret.
    PATR-II is a simple grammar formalism that can serve as the least common denominator of many of the complex-feature-based and unification-based formalisms prevalent in linguistics and computational linguistics.
    As such it provides a good testbed for describing algorithms for complex-feature-based formalisms.
    The PATR-II nonterminal domain is a lattice of direct
