bility of a framework in allowing one to make modifications is an important dimension of evaluation.
    The figures 2, 3 and 4 show for each pronominal category, the distribution of successes and failures for both algorithms.
    Since the main purpose of evaluation must be to improve the theory that we are evaluating, the most interesting cases are the ones on which the algorithms' performance varies and those that neither algorithm gets correct.
    We discuss these below.
    In the Wheels data, 4 examples rest on the assumption that the identities of speakers and hearers is recoverable.
    For example in The GM president smiled.
    &amp;quot;Except Henry will be damned forceful and the papers won't print all HIS language.&amp;quot;, getting the his correct here depends on knowing that it is the GM president speaking.
    Only 4 examples rest on being able to produce collections or discourse entities, and 2 of these occurred with an explicit instruction to the hearer to produce such a collection by usin
