isting survey papers discuss learning-based coreference research primarily in the context of the influential mention-pair model, we additionally survey recently proposed learning-based coreference models, which attempt to address the weaknesses of the mention-pair model.
    Due to space limitations, however, we will restrict our discussion to the most commonly investigated kind of coreference relation: the identity relation for NPs, excluding coreference among clauses and bridging references (e.g., part/whole and set/subset relations).
  
  
    The widespread popularity of machine learning approaches to coreference resolution can be attributed in part to the public availability of annotated coreference corpora.
    The MUC-6 and MUC-7 corpora, though relatively small (60 documents each) and homogeneous w.r.t. document type (newswire articles only), have been extensively used for training and evaluating coreference models.
    Equally popular are the corpora produced by the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE1
