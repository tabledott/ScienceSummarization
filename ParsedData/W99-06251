such common information and constructing thematic groups of text units across multiple documents. pieces of text has many applications (e.g., summarization, information retrieval, text clustering).
    Most research in this area has centered on detecting similarity between documents [Willet 1988], similarity between a query and a document [Salton 1989] or between a query and a segment of a document [Callan 1994].
    While effective techniques have been developed for document clustering and classification which depend on inter-document similarity measures, these techniques mostly on shared words, or occasionally collocations of words [Smeaton 1992].
    When larger units of text are compared, overlap may be sufficient to detect similarity; but when the units of text are small, simple surface matching of words and phrases is less likely to succeed since the number of potential matches is smaller.
    Our task differs from typical text matching applications not only in the smaller size of the text units compare
