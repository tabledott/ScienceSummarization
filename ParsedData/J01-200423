paper will present our parsing model, its application to language modeling for speech recognition, and empirical results.
    Statistically based heuristic best-first or beam-search strategies (Caraballo and Charniak 1998; Charniak, Goldwater, and Johnson 1998; Goodman 1997) have yielded an enormous improvement in the quality and speed of parsers, even without any guarantee that the parse returned is, in fact, that with the maximum likelihood for the probability model.
    The parsers with the highest published broad-coverage parsing accuracy, which include Charniak (1997, 2000), Collins (1997, 1999), and Ratnaparkhi (1997), all utilize simple and straightforward statistically based search heuristics, pruning the search-space quite dramatically!'
    Such methods are nearly always used in conjunction with some form of dynamic programming (henceforth DP).
    That is, search efficiency for these parsers is improved by both statistical search heuristics and DP.
    Here we will present a parser that uses simple
