e near future to test this hypothesis.
    Nevertheless, we believe that we have already demonstrated some very useful results.
    MENE is highly portable, as we have already demonstrated with our result on upper-case English text and even in its current state, its results are already comparable to that of the only other purely statistical English NE system which we are aware of (Miller et al., 1998).
    As shown with our result on running MENE with only the lexical features that it learns from the training corpus, porting MENE can be done with very little effort if appropriate training data is provided&#8212;it isn't even necessary to provide it with dictionaries to generate an acceptable result.
    We are working on a port to Japanese NE to further demonstrate MENE's flexibility.
    However, we believe that the results on combining MENE with other systems are some of the most intriguing.
    We would hypothesize that, given sufficient training data, any handcoded system would benefit from having its out
