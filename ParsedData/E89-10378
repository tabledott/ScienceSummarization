tching a given rule-category, the functional description will include an equation containing that node (or an expression such as n2 that designates it) instead of *.
    The equation (4)(M(n2)) suBJ)=4)(n2) that we inferred above also results from instantiating the schema (4)(M(*)) Sui3J) =4)(*) annotated to the NP element of the S rule in (2a) when that rule-element is matched against the tree in (lb).
    Kaplan observes that the t and metavariables in the Kaplan/Bresnan formulation of LFG are simply convenient abbreviations for the complex expressions 4)(M(*)) and 4)(*), respectively, thus explicating the traditional, more palatable formulation in (2b).
    This basic conception of descriptions and correspondences has been extended in several ways.
    First, this framework has been generalized to additional kinds of structures that represent other subsystems of linguistic information (Kaplan, 1987; Halvorsen, 1988).
    These structures can be related by new correspondences that permit appropriate descrip
