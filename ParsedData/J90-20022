    Thus, in its most highly developed form, translation involves a careful study of the original text and may even encompass a detailed analysis of the author's life and circumstances.
    We, of course, do not hope to reach these pinnacles of the translator's art.
    In this paper, we consider only the translation of individual sentences.
    Usually, there are many acceptable translations of a particular sentence, the choice among them being largely a matter of taste.
    We take the view that every sentence in one language is a possible translation of any sentence in the other.
