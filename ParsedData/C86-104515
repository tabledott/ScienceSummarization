tiple stacks for leftward and rightward arguments and the DCG-like encoding of the ordering positions in the graphs.
			In Sections 3.
			and 4., I will discuss further extensions ofthe formalism and specific linguistic analyses.
			The following section contains a summary of the motivations for working on and with CUG and the main objectives of this work.
	
	
			Both terms, unification grammar and categorial grammar are used for classes of grammar formalisms, for individual grammar formalisms, and finally for grammars that are written in these formalisms.
			In addition, they might also be used by linguists to denote linguistic theories that are built around or on top of such a formalism.
			This is the type of terminological overloading that linguists have learned to live with--or at least gotten accustomed to.
			As I indicated in the previous section, I consider CUG to stand for a family of grammar formalisms that might be described as the intersection of categorial and 192 unification grammar formalisms.
