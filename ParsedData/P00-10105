een tokenized into words and sentences and tagged for part-of-speech.
    The program passes each sentence first to a module that identifies time expressions, and then to another module (SC) that resolves selfcontained time expressions.
    The program then takes the entire document and passes it to a discourse processing module (DP) which resolves context-dependent time expressions (indexicals as well as other expressions).
    The DP module tracks transitions in temporal focus, uses syntactic clues, and various other knowledge sources.
    The module uses a notion of Reference Time to help resolve context-dependent expressions.
    Here, the Reference Time is the time a context-dependent expression is relative to.
    In our work, the reference time is assigned the value of either the Temporal Focus or the document (creation) date.
    The Temporal Focus is the time currently being talked about in the narrative.
    The initial reference time is the document date.
    We now discuss the modules that assign
