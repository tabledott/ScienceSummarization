subtreei (n2 ) &#8710;(n1 , n2) can be computed by the following recursive rules: where nc(n1) is the child number of n1, ch(n,j) is the jth child of node n and&#955; (0&lt;&#955; &lt;1) is the decay factor in order to make the kernel value less variable with respect to the subtree sizes.
    In addition, the recursive rule (3) holds because given two nodes with the same children, one can construct common sub-trees using these children and common sub-trees of further offspring.
    The parse tree kernel counts the number of common sub-trees as the syntactic similarity measure between two relation instances.
    The time complexity for computing this kernel is O( |N1  |&#8901;  |N2|) .
    In this paper, two composite kernels are defined by combing the above two individual kernels in the following ways: is the coefficient.
    Evaluation on the development set shows that this composite kernel yields the best performance when &#945; is set to 0.4.
    Here, K&#710;(&#8226;,&#8226;) is the normalizedK(&#8226;,&#
