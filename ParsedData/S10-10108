    For the extents of events and time expressions (tasks A and B), precision, recall and the f1-measure are used as evaluation metrics, using the following formulas: Where tp is the number of tokens that are part of an extent in both key and response, fp is the number of tokens that are part of an extent in the response but not in the key, and fn is the number of tokens that are part of an extent in the key but not in the response.
    For attributes of events and time expressions (the second part of tasks A and B) and for relation types (tasks C through F) we use an even simpler metric: the number of correct answers divided by the number of answers.
  
  
    Eight teams participated in TempEval-2, submitting a grand total of eighteen systems.
    Some of these systems only participated in one or two tasks while others participated in all tasks.
    The distribution over the six languages was very uneven: sixteen systems for English, two for Spanish and one for English and Spanish.
    The result
