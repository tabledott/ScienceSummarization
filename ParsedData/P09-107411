 whether both CEs are syntactic subjects; another indicates whether the CEs are in an appositive construction.
    Semantic (19): Capture semantic information about one or both NPs such as tests for gender and animacy, semantic compatibility based on WordNet, and semantic comparisons of NE types.
    Classification and Clustering.
    We configure RECONCILEACL09 to use the Averaged Perceptron learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1999) and to employ single-link clustering (i.e. transitive closure) to generate the final partitioning.3 Our experiments rely on the MUC and ACE corpora.
    For ACE, we use only the newswire portion because it is closest in composition to the MUC corpora.
    Statistics for each of the data sets are shown in Table 2.
    When available, we use the standard test/train split.
    Otherwise, we randomly split the data into a training and test set following a 70/30 ratio.
    Scoring Algorithms.
    We evaluate using two common scoring algorithms4 &#8212; MUC and B3.
    The MUC sco
