an ratings from Rubenstein and Goodenough?s and Miller and Charles?s original experiments (labeled ?Humans?)
  and the ratings of the Rubenstein?Goodenough and Miller?Charles word pairs produced by (our implementations of) the Hirst?St-Onge, Jiang?Conrath, Leacock?Chodorow, Lin, and Resnik measures of relatedness are given in Tables 1 and 2, and in Figures 2 and 3.8 4.4 Discussion When comparing two sets of ratings, we are interested in the strength of the linear asso- ciation between two quantitative variables, so we follow Resnik (1995) in summarizing the comparison results by means of the coefficient of correlation of each computational measure with the human ratings; see Table 3.
  (For Jiang and Conrath?s measure, the coefficients are negative because their measure returns distance rather than similarity; so for convenience, we show absolute values in the table.

  To get an idea of the upper bound on perfor- mance of a computational measure, we can again refer to hum
