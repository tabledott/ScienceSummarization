e length of the target string, and J is the length of the source string.
    Among all possible target strings, we will choose the string with the highest probability as given by Bayes&#8217; Architecture of the statistical translation approach based on Bayes&#8217; decision rule.
    Pr(eI1) is the language model of the target language, whereas Pr l eI1) is the string translation model.
    The language model probability is computed using a trigram language model.
    The string translation probability Pr(fJ1  |eI1) is modeled using a series of five models of increasing complexity in training.
    Here, the model used for the translation experiments is the IBM-4 model.
    This model uses the same parameter set as the IBM-5 model, which in preliminary experiments did not yield better translation results.
    The actual implementation used during the experiments is described in AlOnaizan et al. (1999) and in Och and Ney (2000).
    The argmax operation denotes the search problem (i.e., the generation of the o
