mar is well-defined in the following three senses.
    The terminology used here is taken from Booth and Thompson (1973).
  
  
    For an SCFG G over an alphabet E, with start symbol S, we say that' a) G is proper iff for all nonterminals X the rule&amp;quot; probabilities sum to unity, i.e., where P(S 4 x) is induced by the rule probabilities according to Definition 1(a). c) G has no useless nonterminals iff all nonterminals X appear in at least one derivation of some string x E E* with nonzero probability, i.e., P(S AX 4' x) &gt; 0.
    It is useful to translate consistency into &amp;quot;process&amp;quot; terms.
    We can view an SCFG as a stochastic string-rewriting process, in which each step consists of simultaneously replacing all nonterminals in a sentential form with the right-hand sides of productions, randomly drawn according to the rule probabilities.
    Booth and Thompson (1973) show that the grammar is consistent if and only if the probability that stochastic rewriting of the start symbol S l
