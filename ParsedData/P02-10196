 picks the partition boun cy, the probability that she mistypes this word as boun cie will be P(boun ! boun)P(cie ! cy).
    The probability P(wjr) is estimated as the maximum over all partitions of r of the probability that w is generated from r given that partition.
    We use this method to build an error model for letter strings and a separate error model for phone sequences.
    Two models are learned; one model LTR (standing for &#8220;letter&#8221;) has a set of substitution probabilities P(a !
    ,) where a and , are character strings, and another model PH (for &#8220;phone&#8221;) has a set of substitution probabilities P(a !
    ,) where a and , are phone sequences.
    We learn these two models on the same data set of misspellings and correct words.
    For LTR, we use the training data as is and run the Brill and Moore training algorithm over it to learn the parameters of LTR.
    For PH, we convert the misspelling/correctword pairs into pairs of pronunciations of the misspelling and the correct
