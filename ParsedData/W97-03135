92).
    We experimented with larger window sizes and found that the narrow windows more consistently included words related to the target category.
    Note that this is not exactly a conditional probability because a single word occurrence can belong to more than one context window.
    For example, consider the sentence: I bought an AK-47 gun and an M-16 rifle.
    The word M-16 would be in the context windows for both gun and rifle even though there was just one occurrence of it in the sentence.
    Consequently, the category score for a word can be greater than 1.

    Next, we remove stopwords, numbers, and any words with a corpus frequency &lt; 5.
    We used a stopword list containing about 30 general nouns, mostly pronouns (e.g., I, he, she, they) and determiners (e.g., this, that, those).
    The stopwords and numbers are not specific to any category and are common across many domains, so we felt it was safe to remove them.
    The remaining nouns are sorted by category score and ranked so tha
