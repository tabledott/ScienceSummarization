    To investigate the importance of recognizing neutral instances, we perform two sets of polarity classification (step two) experiments.
    First, we experiment with classifying the polarity of all gold-standard polar instances&#8212;the clue instances identified as polar in context by the manual polarity annotations.
    Second, we experiment with using the polar instances identified automatically by the neutral&#8211;polar classifiers.
    Because the second set of experiments includes the neutral instances misclassified in step one, we can compare results for the two sets of experiments to see how the noise of neutral instances affects the performance of the polarity features.
    All experiments are performed using 10-fold cross validation over a test set of 10,287 sentences from 494 MPQA corpus documents.
    We measure performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure.
    Accuracy is simply the total number of instances correctly classified.
    Recall, precision, a
