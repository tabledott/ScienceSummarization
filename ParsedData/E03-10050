  An Efficient Implementation Of A New DOP Model
  
    Two apparently opposing DOP models exist in the literature: one which computes the parse tree involving the most frequent subtrees from a treebank and one which computes the parse tree involving the fewest subtrees from a treebank.
    This paper proposes an integration of the two models which outperforms each of them separately.
    Together with a PCFGreduction of DOP we obtain improved accuracy and efficiency on the Wall Street Journal treebank Our results show an 11% relative reduction in error rate over previous models, and an average processing time of 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence.
  
  
    The distinctive feature of the DOP approach when it was proposed in 1992 was to model sentence structures on the basis of previously observed frequencies of sentence structure fragments, without imposing any constraints on the size of these fragments.
    Fragments include, for instance, subtrees of depth 1 (corresponding to context-free rules) as well as enti
