on the shape of the paths between nodes in the text graph which correspond to adjacent nodes in the hypothesis graph.
    Preserved edges receive the highest score, and longer paths receive lower scores.
    In the final stage of processing, we make a decision about whether or not the hypothesis is entailed by the text, conditioned on the typed dependency graphs, as well as the best alignment between them.
    Because we have a data set of examples that are labeled for entailment, we can use techniques from supervised machine learning to learn a classifier.
    We adopt the standard approach of defining a featural representation of the problem and then learning a linear decision boundary in the feature space.
    We focus here on the learning methodology; the next section covers the definition of the set of features.
    Defined in this way, one can apply any statistical learning algorithm to this classification task, such as support vector machines, logistic regression, or naive Bayes.
    We used a logistic
