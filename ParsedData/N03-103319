r the model in the second row.
    As there are no tag sequence features in these models, the accuracy drops significantly if a higher cutoff is used (from a per tag accuracy of about 93.7% to only 60.2%).
    The third row shows a model where a tag is decided solely by the three words centered at the tag position (3W).
    As far as we are aware, models of this sort have not been explored previously, but its accuracy is surprisingly high: despite having no sequence model at all, it is more accurate than a model which uses standard tag fourgram HMM features ((t0, w0), (t0, t&#8722;1), (t0, t&#8722;1, t&#8722;2), (t0, t&#8722;1, t&#8722;2, t&#8722;3), shown in Table 2, model L+LL+LLL).
    The fourth and fifth rows show models with bidirectional tagging features.
    The fourth model (3W+TAGS) uses the same tag sequence features as the last model in Table 2 ((t0, t&#8722;1), (t0, t&#8722;1, t&#8722;2), (t0, t&#8722;1, t+1), (t0, t+1), (t0, t+1, t+2)) and current, previous, and next word.
    The last model has
