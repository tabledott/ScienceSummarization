    For the purposes of the statistical modelling, we are also considering building alternative structures that include the long-range dependencies, but which can be modelled using better motivated probability models, such as generative models.
    This will be important for applying the parser to tasks such as language modelling, for which the possibility of incremental processing of CCG appears particularly attractive.
