er, specific information is not always superior, for TotPrecision scores higher than TagPrecision.
    This might be explained by the fact that recall information is missing (for overall performance this does not matter, since recall is equal to precision).
    'Even the worst combinator, Majority, is significantly better than E: using McNemar's chi-square, p=0.
  
  
    So far, we have only used information on the performance of individual taggers.
    A next step is to examine them in pairs.
    We can investigate all situations where one tagger suggests T1 and the other T2 and estimate the probability that in this situation the tag should actually be Tx, e.g. if E suggests DT and T suggests CS (which can happen if the token is &amp;quot;that&amp;quot;) the probabilities for the appropriate tag are: CS subordinating conjunction 0.3276 DT determiner 0.6207 QL quantifier 0.0172 WPR wh-pronoun 0.0345 When combining the taggers, every tagger pair is taken in turn and allowed to vote (with the probability descr
