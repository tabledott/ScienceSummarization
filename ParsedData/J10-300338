    Once the seeding examples are extracted, the next step is to extract contextual features for both the positive and the negative examples.
    These features take the form of aligned part-of-speech sequences of a given length from the left and the right of the example.
    For instance, we can extract the contextual feature [(L1 : PRP1,R1 : TO1), (L2 : PRP1,R2 : TO1)] of length 1 for the positive example (tried, tried).
    This particular contextual feature contains two tuples, one for each sentence.
    The first tuple (L1 : PRP1,R1 : TO1) indicates that, in the first sentence, the POS tag sequence to the left of the word tried is a personal pronoun (he) and the POS tag sequence to the right of tired is the preposition to.
    The second tuple is identical for this case.
    Note that the tags of identical tokens are indicated as such by subscripts on the POS tags.
    All such features are extracted for both the positive and the negative examples for all lengths less than or equal to some specified leng
