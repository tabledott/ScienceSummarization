 Hiero, which achieves significantly better translation performance than Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004a), which is a state-of-the-art phrasebased statistical MT system.
    Recently, some researchers investigated whether performing WSD will help to improve the performance of an MT system.
    Carpuat and Wu (2005) integrated the translation predictions from a Chinese WSD system (Carpuat et al., 2004) into a ChineseEnglish word-based statistical MT system using the ISI ReWrite decoder (Germann, 2003).
    Though they acknowledged that directly using English translations as word senses would be ideal, they instead predicted the HowNet sense of a word and then used the English gloss of the HowNet sense as the WSD model&#8217;s predicted translation.
    They did not incorporate their WSD model or its predictions into their translation model; rather, they used the WSD predictions either to constrain the options available to their decoder, or to postedit the output of their decoder.
    They reported the negative result th
