 is said to be monotonic if there is a total ordering ? on R such that every weightfunction f in H is monotonic in each of its arguments ac cording to ?, i.e., if f : Rm 7?

			In this paper we will assume this monotonicity, whichcorresponds to the optimal substructure property in dy namic programming (Cormen et al, 2001).
			Definition 3.
			We denote |e| = |T (e)| to be the arity of the hyperarc.
			If |e| = 0, then f (e) ? R is a constant and wecall h(e) a source vertex.
			We define the arity of a hyper graph to be the maximum arity of its hyperarcs.
			Definition 4.
			The backward-star BS(v) of a vertex v is the set of incoming hyperarcs {e ? E | h(e) = v}.
			The in-degree of v is |BS (v)|.Definition 5.
			A derivation D of a vertex v in a hyper graph H, its size |D| and its weight w(D) are recursively d
