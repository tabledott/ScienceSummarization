s is indicated, but overlap is not.
    Editing signals, when noted by the transcriber, are indicated in the transcripts with a double dash.
    It is clear that this approach to transcription oniy imperfectly reflects the phonetics of editing signals; we can't be sure to what extent the editing signals in our transcripts represent facts about production and to what extent they represent facts about perception.
    Nevertheless, except for a general tendency toward underrepresentation, there seems to be no systematic bias in our transcriptions of the editing signals, and therefore our findings are not likely to be undone by a better understanding of the phonetics of self-correction.
    One major problem in analyzing the syntax of English is the multiple category membership of words.
    In general, most decisions about category membership can be made on the basis of local context.
    However, by its nature, selfcorrection disrupts the local context, and therefore the disambiguation of lexical categories bec
