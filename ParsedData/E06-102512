erms that the algorithm should have spotted but has not spotted).
    In Section 5 this will prevent us from drawing comparisons between this method and our own.
    Baroni and Vegnaduzzo (2004) apply the PMI method, first used by Turney and Littman (2003) to determine term orientation, to determine term subjectivity.
    Their method uses a small set S, of 35 adjectives, marked as subjective by human judges, to assign a subjectivity score to each adjective to be classified.
    Therefore, their method, unlike our own, does not classify terms (i.e. take firm classification decisions), but ranks them according to a subjectivity score, on which they evaluate precision at various level of recall.
  
  
    term orientation by semi-supervised learning The method we use in this paper for determining term subjectivity and term orientation is a variant of the method proposed in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) for determining term orientation alone.
    This latter method relies on training, in a semisupervised way, a b
