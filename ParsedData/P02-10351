ly fine-grained grammars and stochastic disambiguation components has seen considerable progress in recent years.
    However, such attempts have so far been confined to a relatively small scale for various reasons.
    Firstly, the rudimentary character of functional annotations in standard treebanks has hindered the direct use of such data for statistical estimation of linguistically fine-grained statistical parsing systems.
    Rather, parameter estimation for such models had to resort to unsupervised techniques (Bouma et al., 2000; Riezler et al., 2000), or training corpora tailored to the specific grammars had to be created by parsing and manual disambiguation, resulting in relatively small training sets of around 1,000 sentences (Johnson et al., 1999).
    Furthermore, the effort involved in coding broadcoverage grammars by hand has often led to the specialization of grammars to relatively small domains, thus sacrificing grammar coverage (i.e. the percentage of sentences for which at least one analysis
