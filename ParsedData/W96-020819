resents the time required to classify the complete set of 894 test examples.
    With respect to accuracy, naive Bayes and perceptron perform significantly better (p &lt; 0.05) than all other methods for all training-set sizes.
    Naive Bayes and perceptron are not significantly different, except at 1,200 training examples where naive Bayes has a slight advantage.
    Note that the results for 1,200 training examples are comparable to those obtained by Leacock et al. (1993b) for similar methods.
    PFOIL-DLisT is always significantly better than PFoiL-DNF and PFoit-CNF and significantly better than 3 Nearest Neighbor and C4.5 at 600 and 1,200 training examples.
    C4.5 and 3 Nearest Neighbor are always significantly better than PFoit-DNF and PFoIL-CNF but not significantly different from each other.
    Finally, PFoIL-DNF is significantly better than PFoiLCNF at 600 and 1,200 training examples.
    With respect to training time, virtually all differences are significant.
