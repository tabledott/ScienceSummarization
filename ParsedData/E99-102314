o the large data set mentioned in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995): Wall Street Journal corpus sections 2-21 as training material and section 0 as test material.
    With our present hardware applying our optimal experiment, configuration to this data would require several months of computer time.
    Therefore we have only used the best stage 1 approach with IOB1 tags: a left and right context of three words and three POS tags combined with k=3.
    This time the chunker achieved a p3=1 score of 93.81 which is half a point better than the results obtained by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995): 93.3 (other chunker rates for this data: accuracy: 98.04%; precision: 93.71%; recall: 93.90%).
  
  
    The concept of chunking was introduced by Abney in (Abney, 1991).
    He suggested to develop a chunking parser which uses a two-part syntactic analysis: creating word chunks (partial trees) and attaching the chunks to create complete syntactic trees.
    Abney obtained support for such a chunking stage from psycholinguistic lite
