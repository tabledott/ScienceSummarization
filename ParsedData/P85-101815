mic dag.
    For instance, the following subsumption relations hold: Finally, given two dags D' and D&amp;quot;, the unification of the dags is the most general dag D such that D' C D and D&amp;quot; C D. We notate this D = D' U D&amp;quot;.
    The following examples illustrate the notion of unification: The unification of two dags is not always well-defined.
    In the cases where no unification exists, the unification is said to fail.
    For example the following pair of dags fail to unify with each other: [a: 1 a: (b : cl 1 &#8222; id: al JULd: [b:dli=16.
    &#8226; Now, consider the notion of restriction of a dag, using the term almost in its technical sense of restricting the domain of a function.
    By viewing dags as partial functions from labels to dag values, we can envision a process of restricting the domain of this function to a given set of labels.
    Extending this process recursively to every level of the (lag, we have the concept of restriction used below.
    Given a finite specification
