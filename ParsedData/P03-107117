has found that discourse particles like now, well provide valuable information about the structure of texts (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Litman, 1994; Passonneau and Litman, 1997).
    We analyzed the correlation between words in the meeting corpus and labeled topic boundaries, and automatically extracted utterance-initial cue phrases9 that are statistically correlated with boundaries.
    For every word in the meeting corpus, we counted the number of its occurrences near any topic boundary, and its number of appearances overall.
    Then, we performed k2 significance tests (e.g. figure 2 for okay) under the null hypothesis that no correlation exists.
    We selected terms whose k2 value rejected the hypothesis under a 0.01-level confidence (the rejection criterion is k2 &#8805; 6.635).
    Finally, induced cue phrases whose usage has never been described in other work were removed (marked with &#8727; in Table 3).
    Indeed, there is a risk that the automatically derived list of cue phrases could
