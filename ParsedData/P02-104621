    Now consider the precision of the old and new classifiers at predicting t. Of the instances that the old classifier labels t, let A be the number that are correctly labeled and B be the number that are incorrectly labeled.
    Defining Nt = A + B, the precision of the old classifier is Qt = A/Nt.
    Let &#916;A be the number of new instances that the rule under consideration correctly labels, and let &#916;B be the number that it incorrectly labels.
    Defining n = &#916;A + &#916;B, the precision of the rule is q = &#916;A/n.
    The precision of the new classifier is Qt+1 = (A + &#916;A)/Nt+1, which can be written as: That is, the precision of the new classifier is a weighted average of the precision of the old classifier and the precision of the new rule.
    An immediate consequence is that, if we only accept rules whose precision exceeds a given threshold B, then the precision of the new classifier exceeds B.
    Since measured precision equals true precision under our previous assumptions,
