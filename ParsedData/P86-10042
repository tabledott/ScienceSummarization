 specific referents for the entities.
    In this way the task of making implicit linguistic information explicit becomes a subset of the tasks performed by reference resolution.
    The success of this approach is dependent on marking missing syntactic constituents as elided and missing semantic roles as ESSENTIAL so that reference resolution can know when to look for referents.
  
  
    This paper describes the SDC PUNDIT2 system for processing natural language messages.
    PUNDIT, written in Prolog, is a highly modular system consisting of distinct syntactic, semantic and pragmatics components.
    Each component draws on one or more sets of data, including a lexicon, a broad-coverage grammar of English, semantic verb decompositions, rules mapping between syntactic and semantic constituents, and a domain model.
    PUNDIT has been developed cooperatively with the NYU PROTEUS system (Prototype Text Understanding System), These systems are funded by DARPA as part of the work in natural language understandi
