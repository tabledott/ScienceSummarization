at we can get similar values for many noncommutative semirings as well.
    We will refer to these analogous quantities as reverse values.
    For instance, the quantity analogous to the outside value for the Viterbi semiring will be called the reverse Viterbi value.
    Notice that the inside semiring values of a hidden Markov model (1-IMM) correspond to the forward values of HMMs, and the reverse inside values of an HMM correspond to the backwards values.
    Compare the outside algorithm (Baker 1979; Lan i and Young 1990), given in Figure 7, to the inside algorithm of Figure 2.
    Notice that while the inside and recognition algorithms are very similar, the outside algorithm is quite a bit different.
    In particular, while the inside and recognition algorithms looped over items from shortest to longest, the outside algorithm loops over items in the reverse order, from longest to shortest.
    Also, compare the inside algorithm's main loop formula to the outside algorithm's main loop formula.
