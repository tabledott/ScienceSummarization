ALKA (Kim and Moldovan, 1993) and CRYSTAL (Soderland et al., 1995)).
    The case frames learned by our system are not necessarily more powerful then those generated by other systems.
    The advantage of our approach is that it requires no special training resources.
    Our technique requires only preclassified training texts and a few hours of manual filtering to build the intermediate dictionaries.
    Given preclassified texts, it is possible to build a dictionary of conceptual case frames for a new domain in one day.
    Another advantage of our approach is its highly empirical nature; a corpus often reveals important patterns in a domain that are not necessarily intuitive to people.
    By using corpus-based methods to generate all of the intermediate dictionaries and the final case frame structures, the most important words, role assignments, and semantic preferences are less likely to be missed.
    Our empirical approach aims to exploit the text corpus to automatically acquire the syntactic and sema
