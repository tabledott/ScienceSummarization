tion, however, does not adopt the state-of-theart techniques in those fields, relying only on sim ple proximity-based or pattern-based methods.
			Inthis context, this paper empirically shows that incor porating machine learning-based techniques devisedfor predicate-argument structure analysis and bridg ing reference resolution improve the performanceof both aspect-evaluation and aspect-of relation extraction.
			Furthermore, we also show that combin ing contextual clues with a common co-occurrencestatistics-based technique for bridging reference resolution makes a significant improvement on aspect of relation extraction.
	
	
			Our present goal is to build a computational model to extract opinions from Web documents in such a form as: Who feels how on which aspects of which subjects.
			Given the passage presented in Figure 1, for example, the opinion we want to extract is: ?the writer feels that the colors of pictures taken with Powershot (product) are beautiful.?
			As suggested by this example, we conside
