een evaluated either subjectively (e.g.
    White and O'Connell 1993) or using relative metrics, such as perplexity with respect to other models (Brown et al. 1993b).
    Objective and more accurate tests can be carried out using a &amp;quot;gold standard.&amp;quot; I hired bilingual annotators to link roughly 16,000 corresponding words between on-line versions of the Bible in French and English.
    This bitext was selected to facilitate widespread use and standardization (see Melamed [1998c] for details).
    The entire Bible bitext comprised 29,614 verse pairs, of which 250 verse pairs were hand-linked using a specially developed annotation tool.
    The annotation style guide (Melamed 1998b) was based on the intuitions of the annotators, so it was not biased towards any particular translation model.
    The annotation was replicated five times by seven different annotators.
    Each of the four methods was used to estimate a word-to-word translation model from the 29,614 verse pairs in the Bible bitext.
