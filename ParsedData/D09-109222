xicons by aligning topic-specific vocabulary, PLTM may also be useful for adapting machine translation systems to new domains by finding translations or near translations in an unstructured corpus.
    These aligned document pairs could then be fed into standard machine translation systems as training data.
    To evaluate this scenario, we train PLTM on a set of document tuples from EuroParl, infer topic distributions for a set of held-out documents, and then measure our ability to align documents in one language with their translations in another language.
    It is not necessarily clear that PLTM will be effective at identifying translations.
    In finding a lowdimensional semantic representation, topic models deliberately smooth over much of the variation present in language.
    We are therefore interested in determining whether the information in the document-specific topic distributions is sufficient to identify semantically identical documents.
    We begin by dividing the data into a training set of
