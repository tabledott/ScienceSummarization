arlier rules apply to the final A at a time before the context required for that vowel has been established.
    Reordering the rules to fix this problem will cause the previous correct analyses to fail.
    The proper results in all cases come only if we describe Turkish vowel harmony with rules that proceed left to right through the string as a group, applying at each position whichever one matches.
    This is the mode of application for a set of rules collected together as a batch.
    The notion of a batch rule apparently has not arisen as a distinctive formal concept in phonological theories.
    The reason is doubtless that batch rules are unnecessarily prolix and, in particular, they fail to capture generalizations that can almost always be made about the individual rules that make up a batch.
    Phonologists prefer rules that are based on feature matrices.
    These rules allow segments to be referred to by specifying which members of a finite set of properties they do or do not have.
