ed bywhitespace, followed by an uppercase letter.

    This method meets our stated goals for the overall system.

    It is easily parameterizable, providing the expressive power to concisely define accurate and robust token classes.
    The lexicon module is responsible for enumerating parts of speech and their associated stems for each word it is given.
    For the English word &amp;quot;does,&amp;quot; the lexicon might return &amp;quot;do, verb&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;doe, plural-noun.&amp;quot; It is also responsible for identifying ambiguity classes based upon sets of tags.
