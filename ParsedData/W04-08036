    Participants could submit two runs, one with (non-restrictive case) and one without (restrictive case) using the additional data; these were scored separately.
    FrameNet recognizes the permissibility of &#8220;conceptually salient&#8221; frame elements that have not been instantiated in a sentence; these are called null instantiations (see Johnson et al. for a fuller description).
    An example occurs in the following sentence (sentID=&amp;quot;1087911&amp;quot;) from the Motion frame: &#8220;I went and stood in the sitting room doorway, but I couldn't get any further -- my legs wouldn't move.&#8221; In this case, the FrameNet taggers considered the Path frame element to be an indefinite null instantiation (INI).
    Frame elements that have been so designated for a particular sentence appear to be Core frame elements, but not all core frame elements missing from a sentence have designated as null instantiations.
    The correct answer for this case, based on the tagging, is
