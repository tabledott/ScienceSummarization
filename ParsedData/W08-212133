    Results are sorted in descending order of the labeled F1 score for semantic dependencies on the WSJ+Brown corpus.
    The number in parentheses next to the WSJ+Brown scores indicates the system rank in the corresponding task.
  
  
    Table 5 summarizes the properties of the systems that participated in the closed the open challenges.
    The second column of the table highlights the overall architectures.
    We used + to indicate that the components are sequentially connected.
    The lack of a + sign indicates that the corresponding tasks are performed jointly.
    For example, Riedel and Meza-Ruiz (2008) perform predicate and argument identification and classification jointly, whereas Ciaramita et al. (2008) implemented a pipeline architecture of three components.
    We use the  ||to indicate that several different architectures that span multiple subtasks were deployed in parallel.
    This summary of system architectures indicates that it is common that systems combin
