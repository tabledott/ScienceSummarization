    The initial distribution was not the uniform distribution over binary trees Pbin(B).
    That was undesirable as an initial point because, combinatorily, almost all trees are relatively balanced.
    On the other hand, in language, we want to allow unbalanced structures to have a reasonable chance to be discovered.
    Therefore, consider the following uniformsplitting process of generating binary trees over k terminals: choose a split point at random, then recursively build trees by this process on each side of the split.
    This process gives a distribution Psplit which puts relatively more weight on unbalanced trees, but only in a very general, non language-specific way.
    This distribution was not used in the model itself, however.
    It seemed to bias too strongly against balanced structures, and led to entirely linear-branching structures.
    The smoothing used was straightforward.
    For each yield &#945; or context x, we added 10 counts of that item as a constituent and 50 as a distit
