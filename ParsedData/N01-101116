m different teams, so the best accuracy shown in column 6 may actually be higher than that of any single participating SENSEVAL system.
    The average accuracy in column 7 is the product of the average precision and recall reported for the participating SENSEVAL teams.
    Column 8 shows the accuracy of the decision tree using the J48 learning algorithm and the features identified by a power divergence statistic.
    Column 10 shows the accuracy of the decision tree when the Dice Coefficient selects the features.
    Columns 9 and 11 show the accuracy of the decision stump based on the power divergence statistic and the Dice Coefficient respectively.
    Finally, column 13 shows the accuracy of the Naive Bayesian classifier based on a bag of words feature set.
    The most accurate method is the decision tree based on a feature set determined by the power divergence statistic.
    The last line of Table 1 shows the win-tie-loss score of the decision tree/power divergence method relative to every other method
