s: verb.02: ARG0, ARG1, ARGM-LOC receives a labeled precision score of 2/4 because two out of four semantic dependencies are incorrect: the dependency to ROOT is labeled 02 instead of 01 and the dependency to the ARGM-TMP is incorrectly labeled ARGM-LOC.
    Using this strategy we compute precision, recall, and FI scores for both labeled and unlabeled semantic dependencies.
    Finally, we combine the syntactic and semantic measures into one global measure using macro averaging.
    We compute macro precision and recall scores by averaging the labeled precision and recall for semantic dependencies with the LAS for syntactic dependencies:3 where LMP is the labeled macro precision and LPsem is the labeled precision for semantic dependencies.
    Similarly, LMR is the labeled macro recall and LRsem is the labeled recall for semantic dependencies.
    Wsem is the weight assigned to the semantic task.4 The macro labeled FI score, which was used for the ranking of the participating systems, is computed as the harmo
