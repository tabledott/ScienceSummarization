aints that hold for a free-word-order language such as German and derived our results from empirical studies of real-world texts.
    We also augmented the ordering criteria of the forward-looking center list such that it accounts not only for (pro)nominal anaphora but also for inferables (restricted to the subset of functional anaphora), an issue that, up to now, has only been sketchily dealt with in the centering framework.
    The extensions we proposed were validated by the empirical analysis of various texts of considerable length selected from different domains and genres.
    The &amp;quot;evaluation metric&amp;quot; we used refers to a new cost-based model of interpreting the validity of centering data.
    The distinction between cognitively cheap and expensive transition pairs led us to replace Rule 2 from the original model by a formulation that explicitly incorporates this cost-oriented distinction.
    A resolution module for (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn 1995) and one for functional ana
