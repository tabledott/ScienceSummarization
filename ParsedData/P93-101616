t is assigned a 0-role, but not case-marked.
    To ensure that the movement chains satisfy 0criterion we need only to make sure that the items representing the parents of intermediate traces and landing sites of the movements satisfy these conditions: Sub jacency: Movement cannot cross more than' one barrier (Haegeman, 1991, p.494).
    A wh-movement carries a whbarrier attribute.
    The value -whbarrier means that the movement has not crossed any barrier and +whbarrier means that the movement has already crossed one barrier.
    Barrier links allow items with -whbarrier to pass through, but change the value to +whbarrier.
    Items with +whbarrier are blocked by barrier links.
    When a wh-movement leaves an intermediate trace at a position, the corresponding whbarrier becomes -.
    The subjacency of np-movements is similarly handled with a npbarrier attribute.
    Empty Category Principle (ECP): A trace&amp;quot; or its parent must be properly governed.
    In literature, proper government is not, as th
