 suffix with u, with the probability of drawing w increasing as the length of the common suffix increases.
    This is because w will be more likely under the context of the common suffix as well.
    The hierarchical Chinese restaurant process is equivalent to the hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model insofar as the distribution induced on words drawn from them are exactly equal.
    However, the probability vectors Gu&#8217;s have been marginalized out in the procedure, replaced instead by the assignments of words xul to draws yuk from the parent distribution, i.e. the seating arrangement of customers around tables in the Chinese restaurant process corresponding to Gu.
    In the next section we derive tractable inference schemes for the hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model based on these seating arrangements.
  
  
    In this section we give a high level description of a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling based inference scheme for the hierarchical PitmanYor language model.
