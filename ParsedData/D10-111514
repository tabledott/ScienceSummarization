d in principle limit ourselves to collecting vectors for the ANs to be analyzed (the AN test set) and their components.
    However, to make the analysis more challenging and interesting, we populate the semantic space where we will look at the behaviour of the ANs with a large number of adjectives and nouns, as well as further ANs not in the test set.
    We refer to the overall list of items we build semantic vectors for as the extended vocabulary.
    We use a subset of the extended vocabulary containing only nouns and adjectives (the core vocabulary) for feature selection and dimensionality reduction, so that we do not implicitly bias the structure of the semantic space by our choice of ANs.
    To construct the AN test set, we first selected 36 adjectives across various classes: size (big, great, huge, large, major, small, little), denominal (American, European, national, mental, historical, electronic), colors (white, black, red, green) positive evaluation (nice, excellent, important, appropriate), temp
