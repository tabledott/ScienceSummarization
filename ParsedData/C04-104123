 this ischanged to ? = 0.01k=100; if the node limit is ex ceeded (for these experiments set at 1,000,000), ? is changed to 0.05.
			If the node limit is still exceeded, ? is changed to 0.075, and finally 0.1.
			The second row has the CCGbank rule restriction applied, and the third row the Eisner normal-form restrictions.The next three rows correspond to our new strat egy of starting with the least restrictive setting of thesupertagger (?
			= 0.1), and moving through the set tings if the parser cannot find a spanning analysis.
			The table shows that the normal-form constraints have a significant impact on the speed, reducing theparse times for the old strategy by 72%, and reduc ing the times for the new strategy by 84%.
			The new strategy also has a spectacular impact on the speed compared with the old strategy, reducing the times by 83% without the normal-form constraints and 90% with the constraints.
			The 94% coverage row corresponds to using only the first two supertagging levels; the parser ignores t
