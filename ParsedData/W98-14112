any two facts, but whose use is not preferred).
    Each relation has a nucleus and a satellite (we don't consider multiple nuclei or satellites here, apart from the case of &amp;quot;joint&amp;quot;, which is essentially multinuclear).
    Each relation may be indicated by a distinctive &amp;quot;cue phrase&amp;quot;, with the nucleus and satellite being realised in some fashion around it.
    Each relation has applicability conditions which can be tested between two atomic facts.
    For two complex text spans, a relation holds exactly when that relation holds between the nuclei of those spans.
    Relations can thus hold between text spans of arbitrary size.
    Figure 1 shows an example of the form of the input that is used for the experiments reported here.
    Each primitive &amp;quot;fact&amp;quot; is represented in terms of a subject, verb and complement (as well as a unique identifier).
    The &amp;quot;subject&amp;quot; is assumed to be the entity that the fact is &amp;quot;about&amp;quot;.
    The
