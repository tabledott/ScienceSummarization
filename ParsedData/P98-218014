 Braden-Harder, 1993).
    Detailed information from the parse, both morphological and syntactic, sharply reduces the range of senses that can be plausibly assigned to each word.
    Other aspects of dictionary structure are also exploited, including domain information associated with particular senses (e.g., Baseball).
    In processing normal input text outside of the context of MindNet creation, WSD relies crucially on information from MindNet about how word senses are linked to one another.
    To help mitigate this bootstrapping problem during the initial construction of MindNet, we have experimented with a two-pass approach to WSD.
    During a first pass, a version of MindNet that does not include WSD is constructed.
    The result is a semantic network that nonetheless contains a great deal of &amp;quot;ambient&amp;quot; information about sense assignments.
    For instance, processing the definition spin 101: (of a spider or silkworm) to produce thread.., yields a semrel structure in which the sense
