 also show the benefits of the entitybased representation in a readability assessment task, where the goal is to predict the comprehension difficulty of a given text.
    In contrast to existing systems which focus on intra-sentential features, we explore the contribution of discourse-level features to this task.
    By incorporating coherence features stemming from the proposed entity-based representation, we improve the performance of a state-of-the-art readability assessment system (Schwarm and Ostendorf 2005).
    In the following section, we provide an overview of entity-based theories of local coherence and outline previous work on its computational treatment.
    Then, we introduce our entity-based representation, and define its linguistic properties.
    In the subsequent sections, we present our three evaluation tasks, and report the results of our experiments.
    Discussion of the results concludes the article.
  
  
    Our approach is inspired by entity-based theories of local coherence, and is w
