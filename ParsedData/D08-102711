re better than individual non-experts.
    In our next comparison we ask how many averaged non-experts it would take to rival the performance of a single expert.
    We did this by averaging the labels of each possible subset of n non-expert annotations, for value of n in {1, 2, ... ,10}.
    We then treat this average as though it is the output of a single &#8216;meta-labeler&#8217;, and compute the ITA with respect to each subset of five of the six expert annotators.
    We then average the results of these studies across each subset size; the results of this experiment are given in Table 2 and in Figure 1.
    In addition to the single meta-labeler, we ask: what is the minimum number of non-expert annotations k from which we can create a meta-labeler that has equal or better ITA than an expert annotator?
    In Table 2 we give the minimum k for each emotion, and the averaged ITA for that meta-labeler consisting of k non-experts (marked &#8220;k-NE&#8221;).
    In Figure 1 we plot the expert ITA correlation
