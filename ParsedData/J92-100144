st a noun, the corrector lets it remain ambiguous unless it is immediately preceded by a determiner (a good clue for nouns), or it is immediately preceded by a plural noun or a preposition, or is immediately followed by a determiner (three clues that suggest a word may be a verb).
    The system is able to correct for all the systematic errors we have identified thus far using just nine rules of this sort.
    After tagging, the preprocessor eliminates all senses corresponding to unselected parts of speech.
    Following the syntactic filtering of senses, TRUMP's preprocessor identifies collocations and establishes semantic preferences for the senses associated with them.
    In this stage of preprocessing, the system recognizes the following types of collocations: To recognize a collocation, the preprocessor relies on a set of simple patterns, which match the general syntactic context in which the collocation occurs.
    For example, the system recognizes the collocation &amp;quot;take profit&amp;quot; found
