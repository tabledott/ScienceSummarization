of entities as those that made DIRT learn the inference rule in the first place, hence ISP will not filter out many incorrect inferences.
  
  
    We presented algorithms for learning what we call inferential selectional preferences, and presented evidence that learning selectional preferences can be useful in filtering out incorrect inferences.
    Future work in this direction includes further exploration of the appropriate inventory of semantic classes used as SP&#8217;s.
    This work constitutes a step towards better understanding of the interaction of selectional preferences and inferences, bridging these two aspects of semantics.
