    Logistic regression and boosting involve different algorithms and criteria for training the parameters &#175;a, but recent work (Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani 2000; Lafferty 1999; Duffy and Helmbold 1999; Mason, Bartlett, and Baxter 1999; Lebanon and Lafferty 2001; Collins, Schapire, and Singer 2002) has shown that the methods have strong similarities.
    The next section describes parameter estimation methods.
    A central idea in both logistic regression and boosting is that of a loss function, which drives the parameter estimation methods of the two approaches.
    This section describes loss functions for binary classification.
    Later in the article, we introduce loss functions for reranking tasks which are closely related to the loss functions for classification tasks.
    First, consider a logistic regression model.
    The parameters of the model a&#175; are used to define a conditional probability where F&#240;x, &#175;a&#222; is as defined in equation (2).
