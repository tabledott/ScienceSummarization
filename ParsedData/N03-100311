nce alignment (MSA) of the sentences in a given cluster.
    Pairwise MSA takes two sentences and a scoring function giving the similarity between words; it determines the highest-scoring way to perform insertions, deletions, and changes to transform one of the sentences into the other.
    Pairwise MSA can be extended efficiently to multiple sequences via the iterative pairwise alignment, a polynomial-time method commonly used in computational biology (Durbin et al., 1998).3 The results can be represented in an intuitive form via a word lattice (see Figure 3), which compactly represents (n-gram) structural similarities between the cluster&#8217;s sentences.
    To transform lattices into generation-suitable patterns requires some understanding of the possible varieties of lattice structures.
    The most important part of the transformation is to determine which words are actually instances of arguments, and so should be replaced by slots (representing variables).
    The key intuition is that because the se
