the remaining entropy graphs.
    A normal logarithmic scale is used for the time axis.
    The fact that the time axis is logarithmic is especially useful for determining how much more efficient one algorithm is than another at a given performance level.
    If one picks a performance level on the vertical axis, then the distance between the two curves at that level represents the ratio between their speeds.
    There is roughly a factor of 8 to 10 difference between using the prior and not using it at all graphed performance levels, with a slow trend towards smaller differences as the thresholds are loosened.
    We tried experiments comparing global thresholding to beam thresholding.
    Figure 13 shows the results of this experiment, and later experiments.
    In the best case, global thresholding works twice as well as beam thresholding, in the sense that to achieve the same level of performance requires only half as much time, although smaller improvements were more typical.
    We have found that, in g
