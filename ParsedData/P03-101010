    Let JZ and EZ be the words of Japanese and English sentences for i-th alignment.
    The similarity6 between JZ and EZ is: where a one-to-one correspondence between Japanese and English words.
    JZ and EZ are obtained as follows.
    We use ChaSen to morphologically analyze the Japanese sentences and extract content words, which consists of JZ.
    We use Brill&#8217;s tagger (Brill, 1992) to POS-tag the English sentences, extract content words, and use WordNet&#8217;s library7 to obtain lemmas of the words, which consists of EZ.
    We use simple heuristics to obtain JZ x EZ, i.e., a one-to-one correspondence between the words in JZ and EZ, by looking up JapaneseEnglish and English-Japanese dictionaries made up by combining entries in the EDR Japanese-English bilingual dictionary and the EDR English-Japanese bilingual dictionary.
    Each of the constructed dictionaries has over 300,000 entries.
    We evaluated the implemented program against a corpus consisting of manually aligned Japanese and Engli
