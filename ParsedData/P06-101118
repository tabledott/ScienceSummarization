rformance are caused only by differences in the parallel training data.
    Our test data consists of news articles from the Time Bank corpus, which were translated into Romanian, and has 1000 sentences.
    Translation performance is measured using the automatic BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) metric, on one reference translation.
    We report BLEU% numbers, i.e. we multiply the original scores by 100.
    The 95% confidence intervals of our scores, computed by bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004), indicate that a score increase of more than 1 BLEU% is statistically significant.
    The scores are presented in Figure 6.
    On the BBC corpus, the fragment extraction method produces statistically significant improvements over the baseline, while the sentence extraction method does not.
    Training on both datasets together brings further improvements.
    This indicates that this corpus has few parallel sentences, and that by going to the sub-sentence level we make better use of it.
