egorization and associated frequency information from the citations, in the process successfully parsing 380K words.
    We then parsed the test set, with each verb subcategorization possibility weighted by its raw frequency score, and using the naive add-one smoothing technique to allow for omitted possibilities.
    The GEIG measures for the lexicalized parser show a 7% improvement in the crossing bracket score (figure 6). the existing test corpus this is not statisti- 'Carroll &amp; Briscoe (1996) use the same test set, although the baseline results reported here differ slightly due to differences in the mapping from parse trees to Susanne-compatible bracketings.
    361 significant at the 95% level p = if the pattern of differences were maintained over a larger test set of 470 sentences it would be significant.
    We expect that a more sophisticated smoothing technique, a larger acquisition corpus, and extensions to the system to deal with nominal and adjectival predicates would improve accuracy still fu
