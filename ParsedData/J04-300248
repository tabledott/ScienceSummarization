on piece classes.
    PSEinsts is the set of PSE instances to be disambiguated (line 1).
    HiDensity (initialized on line 2) will be the subset of PSEinsts that are retained.
    In the loop, the density of each PSE instance P is calculated.
    This is the number of subjective elements that begin or end in the W words preceding or following P (line 6).
    P is retained if its density is at least T (line 7).
    Lines 8&#8211;9 of the algorithm assess the precision of the original (PSEinsts) and new (HiDensity) sets of PSE instances.
    If prec(HiDensity) is greater than prec(PSEinsts), then there is evidence that the number of subjective elements near a PSE instance is related to its subjectivity in context.
    To create more data points for this analysis, WSJ-SE was split into two (WSJ-SE1 and WSJ-SE2) and annotations of the two judges are considered separately.
    WSJ-SE2-D, for example, refers to D&#8217;s annotations of WSJ-SE2.
    The process in Figure 3 was repeated for different parameter setti
