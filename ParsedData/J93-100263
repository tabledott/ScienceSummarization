d improved the initially poor performance of the parser by a factor of about three.
    As for actual parse times, Table 4 compares those for the GDE chart parser, the semi-automatic, user-directed LR parser, and the nondeterministic LR parser.
    Our general experience is that although the nondeterministic LR parser is only around 30-50% faster than the chart parser, it often generates as little as a third the amount of garbage.
    (The relatively modest speed advantage compared with the substantial space saving appears to be due to the larger overheads involved in LR parsing).
    Efficient use of space is obviously an important factor for practical parsing of long and ambiguous texts.

    LR Parsing with Probabilistic Disambiguation Several researchers (Wright and Wrigley 1989; Wright 1990; Ng and Tomita 1991; Wright, Wrigley, and Sharman 1991) have proposed using LR parsers as a practical method of parsing with a probabilistic context-free grammar.
    This approach assumes that probabilities are
