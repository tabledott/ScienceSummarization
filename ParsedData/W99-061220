res 1 and 2) .
    If the new distribution in one of the nodes on the path of a known token gains a dominant (for example &amp;quot;place&amp;quot;) then the effect of this change is propagated by reestimating other node distributions given this change.
    Each distribution on the context paths in which that token occurred in the text is modified, by subtracting from the &amp;quot;questionable&amp;quot; mass a quantity proportional to the number of times the respective token was found in that context and adding it to the dominant-position (e.g.
    &amp;quot;place&amp;quot;) mass.
    For the newly obtained distributions that gained a dominant (in our example &amp;quot;place&amp;quot;) in the context trie, the bootstrapping procedure is called for all tokens that occurred in that context, and so on, recursively.
    Here it is very important that we consider raw distributions and not normalize them.
    For example, if word &amp;quot;Mariana&amp;quot; occurs x times with the right context &amp;quot;merge&amp
