to each French noun phrase in Fi.
    All correspondences are thus equally weighted, reflecting a state of ignorance.
    Weights are summed over the corpus, so noun phrases that co-occur in several sentences will have larger sums.
    The weights Co(s, t) can be interpreted as the mean number of times that npF(t) corresponds to npE(s) given the corpus and the initial assumption of equiprobable correspondences.
    These weights can be used to form a new estimate of the probability that npF(t) corresponds to npE(s), by considering the mean number of times npF(t) corresponds to npE(s) as a fraction of the total mean number of correspondences for npE(s), as in Equation (2).
    The procedure is then iterated using Equations (3), and (2) to obtain successively refined, convergent estimates of the probability that npF(t) corresponds to npE(s).
    The probability of correspondences can be used as a method of ranking them (occurrence counts can be taken into account as an indication of the reliability of a corresp
