ST machine translation evaluation it yields results that are significantly better statistically than all competing research and commercial translation systems.
  
  
    We are given a source (French) sentence f =f1J = f1, ... ,fj, ... , fJ, which is to be translated into a target (English) sentence e = eI1 = e1, ... , ei, ... , eI.
    Among all possible target sentences, we will choose the sentence with the highest probability:2 The argmax operation denotes the search problem, that is, the generation of the output sentence in the target language.
    As an alternative to the often used source&#8211;channel approach (Brown et al. 1993), we directly model the posterior probability Pr(eI1  |f J1) (Och and Ney 2002).
    An especially well-founded framework for doing this is the maximum-entropy framework (Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996).
    In this framework, we have a set of M feature functions hm(eI1,fJ1), m = 1, ... , M. For each feature function, there exists a model 2 The notational conventio
