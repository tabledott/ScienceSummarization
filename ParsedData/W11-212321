ad-only and uncached.
    Memory mapping also allows the same model to be shared across processes on the same machine.
    Along with IRSTLM and TPT, our binary format is memory mapped, meaning the file and in-memory representation are the same.
    This is especially effective at reducing load time, since raw bytes are read directly to memory&#8212;or, as happens with repeatedly used models, are already in the disk cache.
    Lazy mapping reduces memory requirements by loading pages from disk only as necessary.
    However, lazy mapping is generally slow because queries against uncached pages must wait for the disk.
    This is especially bad with PROBING because it is based on hashing and performs random lookups, but it is not intended to be used in low-memory scenarios.
    TRIE uses less memory and has better locality.
    However, TRIE partitions storage by n-gram length, so walking the trie reads N disjoint pages.
    TPT has theoretically better locality because it stores ngrams near their suffixes, th
