GHT-ARCel (for some l) or tp = SHIFT then &#8710;(p) = 0, which contradicts our assumption that &#8710;(p) &gt; q &gt; 0.
    (This follows because the arc-eager algorithm, unlike its arc-standard counterpart, does not allow nodes to be moved back from the stack to the buffer.)
    Case 1: If tp = LEFT-ARCl (for some l), then there is a node k such that i &lt; k &lt; j, (j, l, k) E Acp, and cp&#8722;1 = (6|i|k,j|P,Acp&#8722; I(j,l,k)}).
    Because &#8710;(p &#8722; 1) &lt; q, we can use the inductive hypothesis to infer &#928;(p &#8722; 1, k, j) and, from this, &#928;(p, k, j).
    Moreover, because there has to be an earlier configuration cp&#8722;r (r &lt; &#8710;(p)) such that cp&#8722;r = (6|i,k|P,Acp&#8722;r) and &#8710;(p &#8722; r) &lt; q, we can use the inductive hypothesis again to infer &#928;(p &#8722; r, i, k) and &#928;(p, i, k).
    &#928;(p, i, k), &#928;(p, k, j) and (j,l, k) E Acp together entail &#928;(p, i, j).
    Case 2: If the transition tp = REDUCE, then there is a node k such that i &
