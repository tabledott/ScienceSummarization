 and a preliminary step.
    A LKB is formed by a set of concepts and relations among them, and a dictionary, i.e., a list of words (typically, word lemmas) each of them linked to at least one concept of the LKB.
    Given any such LKB, we build an undirected graph G = (V, E) where nodes represent LKB concepts (vi), and each relation between concepts vi and vj is represented by an undirected edge ei,j.
    In our experiments we have tried our algorithms using three different LKBs: Given an input text, we extract the list Wi i = 1... m of content words (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) which have an entry in the dictionary, and thus can be related to LKB concepts.
    Let Conceptsi = {v1, ... , vi.} be the im associated concepts of word Wi in the LKB graph.
    Note that monosemous words will be related to just one concept, whereas polysemous words may be attached to several.
    As a result of the disambiguation process, every concept in Conceptsi, i = 1, ... , m receives a score.
    Then, for each
