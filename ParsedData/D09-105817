eled data reaches 3.72G (billion) tokens, which is approximately 4,000 times larger than the size of labeled training data.
    In general we will assume that the input sentences include both words and part-of-speech (POS) tags.
    Our baseline features (&#8220;baseline&#8221;) are very similar to those described in (McDonald et al., 2005a; Koo et al., 2008): these features track word and POS bigrams, contextual features surrounding dependencies, distance features, and so on.
    English POS tags were assigned by MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), which was trained on the training data described in Section 4.1.
    Czech POS tags were obtained by the following two steps: First, we used &#8216;feature-based tagger&#8217; included with the PDT3, and then, we used the method described in (Collins et al., 1999) to convert the assigned rich POS tags into simplified POS tags.
    In a second set of experiments, we make use of the feature set used in the semi-supervised approach of (Koo et al., 2008).
