 in a round-robin fashion, holding approximations to the others fixed.
    We first describe the variable groups, then the updates which optimize them in turn.
    Decomposition: We decompose the entity variables E into types, T, one for each entity, and word lists, L, one for each entity and property.
    We decompose the mentions M into referring mentions (propers and nominals), Mr, and pronominal mentions, Mp (with sizes nr and np respectively).
    The entity assignments Z are similarly divided into Zr and Zp components.
    For pronouns, rather than use Zp, we instead work with the corresponding antecedent variables, denoted Ap, and marginalize over antecedents to obtain Zp.
    With these variable groups, we would like to approximation our model posterior P(T, L, Zr, Ap, -r, 7rJM, X) using a simple factored representation.
    Our variational approximation takes the following form: We use a mean field approach to update each of the RHS factors in turn to minimize the KL-divergence between the current va
