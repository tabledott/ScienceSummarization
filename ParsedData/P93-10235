temperature of the modified noun (at least when used in their nonmetaphorical senses; metaphorical usage of scalar words normally also follows the order of the scale by analogy).
    Scales are not limited to adjectives; for example, (may, should, must) and (sometimes, often, always) (Horn, 1972) are linguistic scales consisting of auxiliary verbs expressing obligation and of adverbs expressing frequency respectively.
    In the case of adjectives, the above definition is commonly relaxed to replace the total order among the elements of the scale by a partial one, so that the elements of the scale may be partitioned into two groups (sub-scales), within each of which the order is total.
    The two sub-groups correspond to positive and negative degrees of the common property that the scale describes.
    For example, the set of adjectives (cold, lukewarm, warm, hot) are normally considered part of one scale, even though no direct ordering of semantic strength exists between cold and hot.
