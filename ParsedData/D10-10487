nford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).
    The syntactic information is used to identify the mention head words and to define the ordering of mentions in a given sentence (detailed in the next section).
    For a fair comparison with previous work, we do not use gold named entity labels or mention types but, instead, take the labels provided by the Stanford named entity recognizer (NER) (Finkel et al., 2005).
    We use three evaluation metrics widely used in the literature: (a) pairwise F1 (Ghosh, 2003) &#8211; computed over mention pairs in the same entity cluster; (b) MUC (Vilain et al., 1995) &#8211; which measures how many predicted clusters need to be merged to cover the gold clusters; and (c) B3 (Amit and Baldwin, 1998) &#8211; which uses the intersection between predicted and gold clusters for a given mention to mark correct mentions and the sizes of the the predicted and gold clusters as denominators for precision and recall, respectively.
