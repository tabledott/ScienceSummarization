tation of the information content of the sentence.
    An important part of regularization involves mapping fragment structures onto canonical verbsubject-object patterns, with missing elements flagged.
    For example, the tvo fragment consists of a tensed verb + object as in Replaced spindle motor.
    Regularization of this fragment, for example, maps the tvo syntactic structure into a verb+ subject+ object structure: verb(replace),subject(X),object(Y) As shown here, verb becomes instantiated with the surface verb, e.g., replace while the arguments of the subject and object terms are variables.
    The semantic information derived from the noun phrase object spindle motor becomes associated with Y.
    The absence of a surface subject constituent results in a lack of semantic information pertaining to X.
    This lack causes the semantic and pragmatic components to provide a semantic filler for the missing subject using general pragmatic principles and specific domain knowledge.
