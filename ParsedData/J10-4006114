 verb corresponds to estimating the amount of fillers they share.
    Measures of &#8220;slot overlap&#8221; have been used by Joanis, Stevenson, and James (2008) as features to classify verbs on the basis of their argument alternations.
    Levin and Rappaport-Hovav (2005) define argument alternations as the possibility for verbs to have multiple syntactic realizations of their semantic argument structure.
    Alternations involve the expression of the same semantic argument in two different syntactic slots.
    We expect that, if a verb undergoes a particular alternation, then the set of nouns that appear in the two alternating slots should overlap to a certain degree.
    Argument alternations represent a key aspect of the complex constraints that shape the syntax&#8211;semantics interface.
    Verbs differ with respect to the possible alternations they can undergo, and this variation is strongly dependent on their semantic properties (semantic roles, event type, etc.).
    Levin (1993) has in fact propose
