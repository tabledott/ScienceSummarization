eterministic incremental parsing algorithms.
    Sections 4 and 5 contain the formal analysis of four different algorithms, defined within the formal framework, with proofs of correctness and complexity.
    Section 6 presents the experimental evaluation; Section 7 reports on related work; and Section 8 contains our main conclusions.
  
  
    Dependency-based syntactic theories are based on the idea that syntactic structure can be analyzed in terms of binary, asymmetric dependency relations holding between the words of a sentence.
    This basic conception of syntactic structure underlies a variety of different linguistic theories, such as Structural Syntax (Tesni`ere 1959), Functional Generative Description (Sgall, Haji&#711;cov&#180;a, and Panevov&#180;a 1986), Meaning-Text Theory (Mel&#8217;&#711;cuk 1988), and Word Grammar (Hudson 1990).
    In computational linguistics, dependencybased syntactic representations have in recent years been used primarily in data-driven models, which learn to produce depend
