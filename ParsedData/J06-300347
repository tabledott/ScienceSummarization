rase words can appear in a phrase. quarts liquid volume volume in quarts quarts of volume volume capacity quarts quarts in volume volume being about two quarts quart total volume volume of milk in quarts quart of spray volume volume include measures like quart replace only one word).
    If a phrase is n words long, there are n &#8722; 2 intervening words between the members of the given word pair (e.g., between quart and volume).
    Thus a phrase with n words generates 2(n&#8722;2) patterns.
    (We use max phrase = 5, so a phrase generates at most eight patterns.)
    For each pattern, count the number of pairs (originals and alternates) with phrases that match the pattern (a wild card must match exactly one word).
    Keep the top num patterns most frequent patterns and discard the rest (we use num patterns = 4, 000).
    Typically there will be millions of patterns, so it is not feasible to keep them all. more weight to columns (patterns) with frequencies that vary substantially from one row (word pair)
