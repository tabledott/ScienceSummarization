 phrases appear alone in their intermediate phrase (tokens coded with initial OF, corresponding to Discourse Type A in Figure 6): such items are most frequently judged to be discourse uses.
    There is also considerable agreement (163 tokens, or 92.6%) on the classification of the tokens between the authors in such cases.
    There is even greater agreement when cue phrases appear in noninitial position in a larger intermediate phrase (NONF*&#8212;Sentential Type B in Figure 6); these tend to be judged sentential.
    When the token is deaccented, or receives a complex or high accent (NONFD, NONFC and NONFH), the fit with the model, as well as the agreement figures on classification, are especially striking.
    A small majority of tokens in the L* accent class (NONFL) do not fit the sentential prosodic model; note that the agreement Feature complexes are coded as follows: Initial 0 or NO-consists of a single intermediate phrase or not.
    Medial F or NF-appears first-in-phrase or not.
