ction we describe our model&#8217;s &#8220;generative story&#8221; for producing the data we observe.
    We formalize our model in the context of two languages &#163; and F. However, the formulation can be extended to accommodate evidence from multiple languages as well.
    We provide an example of parallel phrase generation in Figure 1.
    High-level Generative Story We have a parallel corpus of several thousand short phrases in the two languages &#163; and F. Our model provides a generative story explaining how these parallel phrases were probabilistically created.
    The core of the model consists of three components: a distribution A over bilingual morpheme pairs (abstract morphemes), a distribution E over stray morphemes in language &#163; occurring without a counterpart in language F, and a similar distribution F for stray morphemes in language F. As usual for hierarchical Bayesian models, the generative story begins by drawing the model parameters themselves &#8211; in our case the three distributi
