	Non-Projective Dependency Parsing Using Spanning Tree Algorithms
		We formalize weighted dependency pars ing as searching for maximum spanning trees (MSTs) in directed graphs.
		Using this representation, the parsing algorithmof Eisner (1996) is sufficient for search ing over all projective trees in O(n3) time.
		More surprisingly, the representation isextended naturally to non-projective pars ing using Chu-Liu-Edmonds (Chu andLiu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967) MST algorithm, yielding an O(n2) parsing al gorithm.
		We evaluate these methodson the Prague Dependency Treebank using online large-margin learning tech niques (Crammer et al, 2003; McDonald et al, 2005) and show that MST parsingincreases efficiency and accuracy for lan guages with non-projective dependencies.
	
	
			Dependency parsing has seen a surge of interest lately for applications such as relation extraction (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), machine translation (Ding and Palmer, 2005), synonym genera tion (Shinyama et al, 2002), and lexical resource augme
