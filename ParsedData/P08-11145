, Hiero&#8217;s translation model is a weighted synchronous contextfree grammar.
    Hiero employs a generalization of the standard non-hierarchical phrase extraction approach in order to acquire the synchronous rules of the grammar directly from word-aligned parallel text Rules have the form X &#8594; he, 1i, where e and f are phrases containing terminal symbols (words) and possibly co-indexed instances of the nonterminal symbol X.2 Associated with each rule is a set of translation model features, Oi(&#65533;f, e); for example, one intuitively natural feature of a rule is the phrase translation (log-)probability O( f, e) _ log p(e |f) , directly analogous to the corresponding feature in non-hierarchical phrase-based models like Pharaoh (Koehn et al., 2003).
    In addition to this phrase translation probability feature, Hiero&#8217;s feature set includes the inverse phrase translation probability log p(&#65533;f|e), lexical weights lexwt(&#65533;f|e) and lexwt(e |&#65533;f), which are estimates of translatio
