just a special case of reference resolution.
    Treating nn as a predicate variable in this way seems to indicate that the relation between the two nouns can be anything, and there are good reasons for believing this to be the case (e.g., Downing, 1977).
    In &amp;quot;lube-oil alarm&amp;quot;, for example, the relation is As, y [y sounds if pressure of x drops too low] However, in our implementation we use a first-order simulation of this approach.
    The symbol nn is treated as a predicate constant, and the most common possible relations (see Levi, 1978) are encoded in axioms.
    The axiom (V x, y)part(y, D nn(x, y) allows interpretation of compound nominals of the form &amp;quot;&lt;whole&gt; &lt;part&gt;&amp;quot;, such as &amp;quot;filter element&amp;quot;.
    Axioms of the form (V z, y)sample(y, nn(x, y) handle the very common case in which the head noun is a relational noun and the prenominal noun fills one of its roles, as in &amp;quot;oil sample&amp;quot;.
    Complex relations such as the one
