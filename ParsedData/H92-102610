nsists of 1600 sentences that are never seen by the grammarian.
  The  Grammar The grammar used in this experiment is a broad- coverage, feature-based unification grammar.
  The gram- mar is context-free but uses unification to express rule templates for the the context-free productions.
  For ex- ample, the rule template: (3) : n unspec  : n corresponds to three CFG productions where the second feature : n is either s, p, or : n. This rule template may elicit up to 7 non-terminals.
  The grammar has 21 features whose range of values maybe from 2 to about 100 with a median of 8.
  There are 672 rule templates of which 400 are actually exercised when we parse a corpus of 15,000 sentences.
  The number of productions that are realized in this training corpus is several hundred thousand.
  P -CFG While a NT in the above grammar is a feature vector, we group several NTs into one class we call a mnemonic represented by the one NT that is the least specified in that class.
  For example, the mnemonic VBOPASTSG* cor
