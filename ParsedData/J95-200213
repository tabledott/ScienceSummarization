ith empty LHS such as those above are useful in other contexts, as will be shown in Section 5.4.
    We will refer to them collectively as dummy states.
    Dummy states enter the chart only as a result of initialization, as opposed to being derived from grammar productions.
    It is easy to see that Earley parser operations are correct, in the sense that each chain of transitions (predictions, scanning steps, completions) corresponds to a possible (partial) derivation.
    Intuitively, it is also true that a parser that performs these transitions exhaustively is complete, i.e., it finds all possible derivations.
    Formal proofs of these properties are given in the literature; e.g., Aho and Ullman (1972).
    The relationship between Earley transitions and derivations will be stated more formally in the next section.
    The parse trees for sentences can be reconstructed from the chart contents.
    We will illustrate this in Section 5 when discussing Viterbi parses.
    Table 1 shows a simple grammar and
