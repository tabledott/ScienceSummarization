    Grammar formalisms based on the encoding of grammatical information in complex-valued feature systems enjoy some currency both in linguistics and natural-language-processing research.
    Such formalisms can be thought of by analogy to context-free grammars as generalizing the notion of nonterminal symbol from a finite domain of atomic elements to a possibly infinite domain of directed graph structures of a certain sort.
    Unfortunately, in moving to an infinite nonterniinal domain, standard methods of parsing may no longer be applicable to the formalism.
    Typically, the problem manifests itself as gross inefficiency or even nonterminat ion of the algorithms.
    In this paper, we discuss a solution to the problem of extending parsing algorithms to formalisms with possibly infinite nonterminal domains, a solution based on a gen
