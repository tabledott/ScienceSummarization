erful grammar formalisms and their grammatical inference problems.
    For instance, Baker (1979) generalized the parameter estimation methods for HMMs to stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) (Booth, 1969) as the inside-outside algorithm.
    Unfortunately, the application of SCFGs and the original inside-outside algorithm to natural-language modeling has been so far inconclusive (Lan and Young, 1990; Jelinek et al., 1990; Lan and Young, 1991).
    Several reasons can be adduced for the difficulties.
    First, each iteration of the inside-outside algorithm on a grammar with n nonterminals may require 0(n31iv13) time per training sentence w, while each iteration of its finite-state counterpart training an HMM with s states requires at worst (s2iw i) time per training sentence.
    That complexity makes the training of sufficiently large grammars computationally impractical.
    Second, the convergence properties of the algorithm sharply deteriorate as the number of nonterminal symbols increases.
