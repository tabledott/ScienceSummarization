 diverge, giving rise to two daughters of c. Our clustering procedure is thus as follows.
    We start with very low 0 and a single cluster whose centroid is the average of all noun distributions.
    For any given 0, we have a current set of leaf clusters corresponding to the current free energy (local) minimum.
    To refine such a solution, we search for the lowest which is the critical value for some current leaf cluster splits.
    Ideally, there is just one split at that critical value, but for practical performance and numerical accuracy reasons we may have several splits at the new critical point.
    The splitting procedure can then be repeated to achieve the desired number of clusters or model cross-entropy.
  
  
    All our experiments involve the asymmetric model described in the previous section.
    As explained there, our clustering procedure yields for each value of 0 a set Cp of clusters minimizing the free energy F, and the asymmetric model for estimates the conditional verb distribution fo
