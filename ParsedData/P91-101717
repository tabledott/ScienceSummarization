e selection of the automatic procedure is correct.
    As a result of this process, the Hebrew set contained 105 ambiguous words (which had at least one unacceptable translation) and the German set 54 ambiguous words.
    Now it was necessary to identify the lexical relations within each of the sentences.
    As explained before, this should be done using a source language parser, and then mapping the source relations to the target relations.
    At this stage of the research, we still do not have the necessary resources to perform the entire process automatically', therefore we have approximated it by translating the sentences into English and extracting the lexical relations using the English Slot Grammar (ESG) parser (mcCord, 1989) 4 .
    Using this parser we have classified the lexical relations to rather general classes of syntactic relations, based on the slot structure of ESG.
    The important syntactic relations used were between a verb and its arguments and modifiers (counting as one class all obje
