ed actions and away from undesired actions, but also provide the parser with means of choosing between several desired actions.
    We want the parser to be able to defer some desired actions until more structure is available and a more informed prediction can be made.
    This desire is reflected in our choice of features: some of our features are designed to signal to the parser the presence of possibly &#8220;incomplete&#8221; structures, such as an incomplete phrase, a coordinator without conjuncts, and so on.
    When considering an action ACTION(i), we limit ourselves to features of partial structures around the attachment point: pi&#8722;2, pi&#8722;1, pi, pi+1, pi+2, pi+s, that is the two structures which are to be attached by the action (pi and pi+1), and the two neighbouring structures on each side3.
    While these features encode local context, it is local in terms of syntactic structure, and not purely in terms of sentence surface form.
    This let us capture some, though not all, long-distance
