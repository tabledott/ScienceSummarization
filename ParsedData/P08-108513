 a potentially high number of tags for each token.
    On average, in our corpus, the number of possible analyses per known word reached 2.7, with the ambiguity level of the extended POS tagset in corpus for English (1.41) (Dermatas and Kokkinakis, 1995).
    In this work, we use the morphological analyzer of MILA &#8211; Knowledge Center for Processing Hebrew (KC analyzer).
    In contrast to English tagsets, the number of tags for Hebrew, based on all combinations of the morphological attributes, can grow theoretically to about 300,000 tags.
    In practice, we found &#8216;only&#8217; about 3,560 tags in a corpus of 40M tokens training corpus taken from Hebrew news material and Knesset transcripts.
    For testing, we manually tagged the text which is used in the Hebrew Treebank (Sima&#8217;an et al., 2001) (about 90K tokens), according to our tagging guidelines.
    General syntagmatic constraints We define 4 syntagmatic constraints over p(t|t_1, t+1): (1) a construct state form cannot be followed by a ve
