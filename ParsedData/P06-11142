the 2005 and 2006 PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges (Dagan et al., 2005).
    1 As currently defined, the RTE task requires systems to determine whether, given two text fragments, the meaning of one text could be reasonably inferred, or textually entailed, from the meaning of the other text.
    We believe that systems developed specifically for this task can provide current question-answering systems with valuable semantic information that can be leveraged to identify exact answers from ranked lists of candidate answers.
    By replacing the pairs of texts evaluated in the RTE Challenge with combinations of questions and candidate answers, we expect that textual entailment could provide yet another mechanism for approximating the types of inference needed in order answer questions accurately.
    In this paper, we present three different methods for incorporating systems for textual entailment into the traditional Q/A architecture employed by many current systems.
    Our experimental re
