e some clear trends in the results of Table 2.
    First, performance increases with the order of the parser: edge-factored models (dep1 and MD1) have the lowest performance, adding sibling relationships (MD2) increases performance, and adding grandparent relationships (dep2) yields even better accuracies.
    Similar observations regarding the effect of model order have also been made by Carreras (2007).
    Second, note that the parsers using cluster-based feature sets consistently outperform the models using the baseline features, regardless of model order or label usage.
    Some of these improvements can be quite large; for example, a first-order model using cluster-based features generally performs as well as a second-order model using baseline features.
    Moreover, the benefits of cluster-based feature sets combine additively with the gains of increasing model order.
    For example, consider the unlabeled parsers in Table 2: on Section 23, increasing the model order from dep1 to dep2 results in a re
