    WIKI RELATEDNESS BEST the highest relatedness score from all (CREi,n, CREj,m) category pairs.
    WIKI RELATEDNESS AVG the average relatedness score from all (CREi,n, CREj,m) category pairs.
    The last semantic knowledge enhancement for the baseline system uses SRL information.
    In our experiments we use the ASSERT parser (Pradhan et al., 2004), an SVM based semantic role tagger which uses a full syntactic analysis to automatically identify all verb predicates in a sentence together with their semantic arguments, which are output as PropBank arguments (Palmer et al., 2005).
    It is often the case that the semantic arguments output by the parser do not align with any of the previously identified noun phrases.
    In this case, we pass a semantic role label to a RE only when the two phrases share the same head.
    Labels have the form &#8220;ARG1 pred1 ... ARGn predn&#8221; for n semantic roles filled by a constituent, where each semantic argument label is always defined with respect to
