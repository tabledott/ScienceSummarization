 over &amp;quot;radiator&amp;quot;).
    Furthermore, the combination of sigdiff and strong conditioning worked better than either by itself.
    Thus all results in this paper, unless explicitly noted otherwise, were gathered using sigdiff and strong conditioning combined.
  
  
    We tested five subjects (all of whom were unaware of our goals) for their concept of a &amp;quot;part.&amp;quot; We asked them to rate sets of 100 words, of which 50 were in our final results set.
    Tables 6 - 11 show the top 50 words for each of our six seed words along with the number of subjects who marked the word as a part of the seed concept.
    The score of individual words vary greatly but there was relative consensus on most words.
    We put an asterisk next to words that the majority subjects marked as correct.
    Lacking a formal definition of part, we can only define those words as correct and the rest as wrong.
    While the scoring is admittedly not perfect', it provides an adequate reference result.
