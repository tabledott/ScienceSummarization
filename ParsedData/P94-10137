ted above, it offers a broad spectrum of ambiguity types, both syntactic and semantic, and shows the ability of the algorithm to handle these diverse problems.
    Second, the correct accent pattern is directly recoverable: unlimited quantities of test material may be constructed by stripping the accents from correctly-accented text and then using the original as a fully objective standard for automatic evaluation.
    By contrast, in traditional word-sense disambiguation, hand-labeling training and test data is a laborious and subjective task.
    Third, the task of restoring missing accents and resolving ambiguous forms shows considerable commercial applicability, both as a stand-alone application or part of the frontend to NLP systems.
    There is also a large potential commercial market in its use in grammar and spelling correctors, and in aids for inserting the proper diacritics automatically when one types'.
    Thus while accent restoration may not be be the prototypical member of the class of lexical
