  These accounts are intended as components of computational systems for machine translation between Japanese and English or for natural anguage processing in Japanese alone.
  This paper has three aims: (1) to generalize a computational ccount of the discourse process called CEN- TERING (Sidner 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished), (2) to apply this account o discourse processing * University of Pennsylvania, Computer Science Department, Philadelphia PA 19104.
