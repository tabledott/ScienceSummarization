s: they are called atomic types.
  AGR, NUM and GEN are called complex types.
  From a set of type definitions, one can extract, a par- tial order on type symbols.
  For example, from the *Researdl reported in this paper is partly supported by the German Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT, Bun- desminister ffir Forschung und Technologie), under grant No.
  The views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing official policies.
  293 set of definitions above, we can derive the following partial order on type symbols (Fig.
  l) where T rep- resents the greatest element (no information) and 3_ the smallest element (inconsistent information, lead- ing to failure in unification).
  This partial order is in turn used to derive a lattice of type syml)ols, which is then exl.ended to typed FSs or(lere(1 by (typed) sub- stunption, forming a lattice on which the interpreter works (see a formal account in [2]).
