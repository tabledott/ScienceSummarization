ecognition patterns for these by using a list of top-level and country domains.
  
  
    Gimpel et al. (2011) provided a dataset of POStagged tweets consisting almost entirely of tweets sampled from one particular day (October 27, 2010).
    We were concerned about overfitting to timespecific phenomena; for example, a substantial fraction of the messages are about a basketball game happening that day.
    We created a new test set of 547 tweets for evaluation.
    The test set consists of one random English tweet from every day between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012.
    In order for a tweet to be considered English, it had to contain at least one English word other than a URL, emoticon, or at-mention.
    We noticed biases in the outputs of langid.py, so we instead selected these messages completely manually (going through a random sample of one day&#8217;s messages until an English message was found).
    Gimpel et al. provided a tagset for Twitter (shown in Appendix A), which we used unmodified.
