    Klein and Manning (2001) formalize parsing as a hypergraph search problem and derive an O(n3) parser for lattices.
  
  
    We have achieved substantial gains in translation performance by decoding compact representations of alternative source language analyses, rather than single-best representations.
    Our results generalize previous gains for lattice translation of spoken language input, and we have further generalized the approach by introducing an algorithm for lattice decoding using a hierarchical phrase-based model.
    Additionally, we have shown that although word lattices complicate modeling of word reordering, a simple heuristic offers good performance and enables many standard distortion models to be used directly with lattice input.
