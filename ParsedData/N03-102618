ted for the condensed string.
    In the automatic evaluation of f-structure match, three different system variants were compared.
    Firstly, randomly chosen transferred f-structures were matched against the manually selected f-structures for the manually created condensations.
    This evaluation constitutes a lower bound on the F-score against the given gold standard.
    Secondly, matching results for transferred fstructures yielding the maximal F-score against the gold standard were recorded, giving an upper bound for the system.
    Thirdly, the performance of the stochastic model within the range of the lower bound and upper bound was measured by recording the F-score for the f-structure that received highest probability according to the learned distribution on transferred structures.
    In order to make our results comparable to the results of Knight and Marcu (2000) and also to investigate the correspondence between the automatic evaluation and human judgments, a manual evaluation of the strings ge
