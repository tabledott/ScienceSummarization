ing selected for C&amp;C than TNT.
    The experiments using a seed set size of 50 showed a similar trend, but the difference between the two taggers was less marked.
    By examining the subsets chosen from the labelled cache at each round, we also observed that a large proportion of the cache was being selected for both taggers.
    Agreement-based co-training for POS taggers is effective but computationally demanding.
    The previous two agreement maximisation experiments involved retraining each tagger 2, 500 times.
    Given this, and the observation that maximisation generally has a preference for selecting a large proportion of the labelled cache, we looked at naive co-training: simply retraining upon all available mateTNT and C&amp;C (500 seed sentences).
    The upper curve is for C&amp;C. rial (i.e. the whole cache) at each round.
    Table 2 shows the naive co-training results after 50 rounds of co-training when varying the size of the cache.
    50 manually labelled sentences were used as the see
