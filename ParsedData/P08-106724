 et al., 2004; Henderson, 2004; Turian and Melamed, 2007).
    In comparison, thanks to the efficient decoding, our work not only scaled to the whole Treebank, but also successfully incorporated non-local features, which showed an absolute improvement of 0.44% over that of local features alone.
  
  
    We have presented a framework for reranking on packed forests which compactly encodes many more candidates than n-best lists.
    With efficient approximate decoding, perceptron training on the whole Treebank becomes practical, which can be done in about a day even with a Python implementation.
    Our final result outperforms both 50-best and 100-best reranking baselines, and is better than any previously reported systems trained on the Treebank.
    We also devised a dynamic programming algorithm for forest oracles, an interesting problem by itself.
    We believe this general framework could also be applied to other problems involving forests or lattices, such as sequence labeling and machine translation.
