e different types of entities which are also used for general noun phrase reference problems.
    Implicit syntactic entities, ELIDED CONSTITUENTS, are treated like pronouns, and implicit semantic entities, ESSENTIAL ROLES are treated like definite noun phrases.
    The pragmatic module as currently implemented consists mainly of a reference resolution component, which is sufficient for the pragmatic issues described in this paper.
    We are in the process of adding a time module to handle time issues that have arisen during the analysis of the Navy CASREPS.
  
  
    The syntactic component has three parts: the grammar, a parsing mechanism to execute the grammar, and a lexicon.
    The grammar consists of context-free BNF definitions (currently numbering approximately 80) and associated restrictions (approximately 35).
    The restrictions enforce contextsensitive well-formedness constraints and, in some cases, apply optimization strategies to prevent unnecessary structure-building.
    Each of these three
