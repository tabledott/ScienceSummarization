ication, which is difficult due to the fact that the polarity scores in the three lexicons are not on the same scale.
    To rank sentences we defined the purity of a sentence X as the normalized sum of the sentiment scores for each phrase x in the sentence: This is a normalized score in the range [&#8722;1, 1].
    Intuitively, sentences with many terms of the same polarity will have purity scores at the extreme points of the range.
    Before calculating purity, a simple negation heuristic was implemented that reversed the sentiment scores of terms that were within the scope of negations.
    The term 6 helps to favor sentences with multiple phrase matches.
    Purity is a common metric used for ranking sentences for inclusion in sentiment summaries (Lerman et al., 2009).
    Purity and negative purity were used to rank sentences as being positive and negative sentiment, respectively.
    The data used in our initial English-only experiments were a set of 554 consumer reviews described in (McDonald et al.,
