model to induce large numbers of plausible semantic and syntactic clusters.
    Both approaches have two flaws: they cannot deal well with ambiguity, though Schiitze addresses this issue partially, and they do not cope well with rare words.
    Since rare and ambiguous words are very common in natural language, these limitations are serious.
  
  
    Whereas earlier methods all share the same basic intuition, i.e. that similar words occur in similar contexts, I formalise this in a slightly different way: each word defines a probability distribution over all contexts, namely the probability of the context given the word.
    If the context is restricted to the word on either side, I can define the context distribution to be a distribution over all ordered pairs of words: the word before and the word after.
    The context distribution of a word can be estimated from the observed contexts in a corpus.
    We can then measure the similarity of words by the similarity of their context distributions, using the Ku
