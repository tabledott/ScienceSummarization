orrelation metric.
    After carefully studying the errors produced, we suspected that the Dice measure would produce better results for our task, according to the arguments given above.
    Consider the example given in Table 2.
    In the table, the second column represents candidate French word pairs for translating the single word today.
    The third column gives the frequency of the word today in a subset of the Hansards containing 182,584 sentences.
    The fourth column gives the frequency of each French word pair in the French counterpart of the same corpus, and the fifth column gives the frequency of appearance of today and each French word pair in matched sentences.
    Finally, the sixth and seventh columns give the similarity scores for today and each French word pair computed according to the Dice measure or specific mutual information (in bits) respectively.
    Of the four candidates, aujourd hui (shown in bold) is the only correct translation.'
    We see from the table that the specific mutu
