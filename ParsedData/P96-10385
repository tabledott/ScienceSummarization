discourse-level properties (e.g., interpreting paragraph breaks as discourse segment boundaries); or 'theory-neutral' discourse segmentations, where subjects are given instructions to simply mark changes in topic.
    Recent studies have focused on the question of whether discourse structure itself can be empirically determined in a reliable manner, a prerequisite to investigating linguistic cues to its existence.
    An intention-based theory of discourse was used in (Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992) to identify intonational correlates of discourse structure in news stories read by a professional speaker.
    Discourse structural elements were determined by experts in the Grosz and Sidner (1986) theory of discourse structure, based on either text alone or text and speech.
    This study revealed strong correlations of aspects of pitch range, amplitude, and timing with features of global and local structure for both segmentation methods.
