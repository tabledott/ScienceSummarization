and was more likely to cross seg- ment boundaries because of its function in talking about the proposed plan.
  We also found that con- trol was distributed and exchanged ifferently in the ADs and TODs.
  These results provide support for the control rules.
  In our analysis we argued for hierarchical orga- nization of the control segments on the basis of specific examples of interruptions.
  We also be- lieve that there are other levels of structure in dis- course that are not captured by the control rules, e.g.
  control shifts do not always correspond with task boundaries.
  There can be topic shifts with- out change of initiation, change of control without a topic shift[WS88].
  The relationship of cue words, intonational contour[PH90] and the use of modal subordination[Rob86] to the segments derived from the control rules is a topic for future research.
  A more controversial question concerns rhetori- cal relations and the extent to which these are de- tected and used by listeners[GS86].
