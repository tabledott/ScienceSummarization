node, and the context c of the current node.
    For each unique coarse symbol s we tie together the distributions &#960;ss0z0c for all possible parent and context combinations (i.e., s', z', and c) using a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP).
    Specifically, for a single s, each distribution &#960;ss0z0c over subsymbols is drawn from a DP with concentration parameter &#945; and base distribution &#946;s over subsymbols.
    This base distribution &#946;s is itself drawn from a GEM prior with concentration parameter &#947;.
    By formulating the generation of z as an HDP, we can share parameters for a single coarse symbol&#8217;s subsymbol distribution while allowing for individual variability based on node parent and context.
    Note that parameters are not shared across different coarse symbols, preserving the distinctions expressed via the coarse tag annotations.
    Finally, we generate the word x from a finite multinomial with parameters &#966;sz, where s and z are the symbol and subsymbol of the cu
