 enjoys great popularity in research systems is the parser described in Collins (1999) (henceforth &#8220;the Collins parser&#8221;).
    This system not only is frequently used for off-line data preprocessing, but also is included as a black-box component for applications such as document summarization (Daume and Marcu, 2002), information extraction (Miller et al., 2000), machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001), and question answering (Harabagiu et al., 2001).
    This is because the Collins parser shares the property of robustness with other statistical parsers, but more than other such parsers, the categories of its parse-trees make grammatical distinctions that presumably are useful for meaningsensitive applications.
    For example, the categories of the Model 3 Collins parser distinguish between heads, arguments, and adjuncts and they mark some longdistance dependency paths; these distinctions can guide application-specific postprocessors in extracting important semantic relations.
