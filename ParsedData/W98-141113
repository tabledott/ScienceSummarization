nly one way smoothly to include a fact in the text, the chance of finding it by random subtree swapping is very low.
    The same goes for fixing other local problems in the text.
    The introduction of &amp;quot;the previous jewel&amp;quot; is an example of this.
    This entity can only be introduced elegantly through the fact that it, like the current item, is encrusted with jewels.
    The text is also still suffering from material getting between a satellite and its nucleus.
    For instance, there is a relation (indicated by the colon) between &amp;quot;It is encrusted with jewels&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;it has silver links encrusted asymmetrically...&amp;quot;, but this is weakened by the presence of &amp;quot;and is an Organic style jewel&amp;quot; in the middle).
    The trouble is that subtree swapping needs incrementally to acquire all good features not &#8226;present in whichever initial tree develops into the best solution.
    It can only acquire these features &amp;quot;accidentally&amp;quot;
