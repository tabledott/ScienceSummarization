 use the same value for k?, their results will not be comparable.
			While V I has a number of very useful distance properties when analyzing a single data set across a number of settings, it has limited utility as a general purpose clustering evaluation metric for use across disparate clusterings of disparate data sets.
			Our homogeneity (h) and completeness (c) terms both range over [0,1] and are completely n-invariant andk?-invariant.
			Furthermore, measuring each as a ra tio of bit lengths has greater intuitive appeal than a more opportunistic normalization.
			V-measure has another advantage as a clusteringevaluation measure over V I and Q0.
			By evaluating homogeneity and completeness in a symmetrical, complementary manner, the calculation of V measure makes their relationship clearly observable.Separate analyses of homogeneity and completeness are not possible with any other cluster evalu ation measure.
			Moreover, by using the harmonic mean to combine homogeneity and completeness, V-measure is uni
