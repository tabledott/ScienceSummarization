ms in the corpus.
    Given the frequency counts for uni-, bi-, and trigrams, the weights can be very efficiently determined with a processing time linear in the number of different trigrams.
    The algorithm is given in figure 1.
    Note that subtracting 1 means taking unseen data into account.
    Without this subtraction the model would overfit the training data and would generally yield worse results.
    Currently, the method of handling unknown words that seems to work best for inflected languages is a suffix analysis as proposed in (Samuelsson, 1993).
    Tag probabilities are set according to the word's ending.
    The suffix is a strong predictor for word classes, e.g., words in the Wall Street Journal part of the Penn Treebank ending in able are adjectives (.11) in 98% of the cases (e.g. fashionable, variable) , the rest of 2% are nouns (e.g. cable, variable).
    The probability distribution for a particular suffix is generated from all words in the training set that share the same suffix of some
