constituents, and other sequences that share such contexts with otherwise good NP sequences.
    This is a danger of not jointly modeling yield and context, and of not modeling any kind of recursive structure.
    Class 5 is mainly composed of verb phrases and verb groups.
    No class corresponded neatly to PPs: perhaps because they have no signature contexts.
    The 2-class model is effective at identifying them only because they share contexts with a range of other constituent types (such as NPs and VPs).
    A reasonable criticism of the experiments presented so far, and some other earlier work, is that we assume treebank part-of-speech tags as input.
    This criticism could be two-fold.
    First, state-of-the-art supervised PCFGs do not perform nearly so well with their input delexicalized.
    We may be reducing data sparsity and making it easier to see a broad picture of the grammar, but we are also limiting how well we can possibly do.
    It is certainly worth exploring methods which supplement or
