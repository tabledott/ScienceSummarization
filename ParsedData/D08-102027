    We thus create a classification problem: given two articles, is article 1 more readable than article 2?
    For each pair of texts whose readability ratings on the 1 to 5 scale differed by at least 0.5, we form one data point for the ranking problem, resulting in 243 examples.
    The predictors are the differences between the two articles&#8217; features.
    For classification, we used WEKA&#8217;s linear support vector implementation (SMO) and performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
    The classification results are shown in Table 7.
    When all features are used for prediction, the accuracy is high, 88.88%.
    The length of the article can serve as a baseline feature&#8212;longer articles are ranked lower by the assessors, so this feature can be taken as baseline indicator of readability.
    Only six features used by themselves lead to accuracies higher than the length baseline.
    These results indicate that the most important individual factors in the readability ranking task
