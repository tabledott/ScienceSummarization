x &#8712; X and y &#8712; Y be an input and output, where X and Y represent the set of possible inputs and outputs, respectively.
    C stands for the set of cliques in an undirected graphical model G(x, y), which indicates the interdependency of a given x and y. yc denotes the output from the corresponding clique c. Each clique c&#8712;C has a potential function IFc.
    Then, the CRFs define the conditional probability p(y|x) as a product of IFcs.
    In addition, let f = (f1, ..., fI) be a feature vector, and A = (A1, ..., AI) be a parameter vector, whose lengths are I. p(y|x; A) on a CRF is defined as follows: where Z(x) = Py&#8712;Y Qc&#8712;C 'Fc(yc, x; A) is the partition function.
    We generally assume that the potential function is a non-negative real value function.
    Therefore, the exponentiated weighted sum over the features of a clique is widely used, so that, Suppose we have J kinds of probability models (PMs).
    The j-th joint PM is represented by pj(xj, y; 0j) where 0j is a model paramet
