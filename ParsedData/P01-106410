le, the algorithm divides a newspaper editorial consisting of about 27 sentences into 4 to 6 segments, while on the other hand, it divides a long text consisting of over 1000 sentences into 10 to 20 segments.
    Thus, the number of segments is not proportional to text length.
    This is due to the term in Equation (11).
    The value of this term increases as the number of words increases.
    The term thus suppresses the division of a text when the length of the text is long.
    This stability is desirable for summarization, because summarizing a given text requires selecting a relatively small number of topics from it.
    If a text segmentation system divides a given text into a relatively small number of segments, then a summary of the original text can be composed by combining summaries of the component segments (Kan et al., 1998; Nakao, 2000).
    A finer segmentation can be obtained by applying our algorithm recursively to each segment, if necessary.5
