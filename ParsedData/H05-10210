	Local Phrase Reordering Models For Statistical Machine Translation
		We describe stochastic models of localphrase movement that can be incorporated into a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) system.
		These models pro vide properly formulated, non-deficient, probability distributions over reorderedphrase sequences.
		They are implemented by Weighted Finite State Trans ducers.
		We describe EM-style parameter re-estimation procedures based on phrase alignment under the complete translationmodel incorporating reordering.
		Our ex periments show that the reordering modelyields substantial improvements in trans lation performance on Arabic-to-English and Chinese-to-English MT tasks.
		We also show that the procedure scales as the bitext size is increased.
	
	
			Word and Phrase Reordering is a crucial component of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems.However allowing reordering in translation is computationally expensive and in some cases even prov ably NP-complete (Knight, 1999).
