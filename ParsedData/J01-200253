 combination of tagging difficulty and frequency.
    Examples of primarily difficult words are much and more.
    Even though they have relatively low frequencies, they are ranked high on the error lists.
    Words whose high error rate stems from their difficulty can be recognized by their high error percentage scores.
    Examples of words whose high error rate stems from their frequency are to and in.
    The error percentages show that these two words are actually tagged surprisingly well, as to is usually quoted as a tough case and for in the taggers have to choose between 14 possible tags.
    The first place on the list is taken by as, which has both a high frequency and a high difficulty level (it is also the most ambiguous word with 17 possible tags in LOB).
    Table 7 shows yet again that there are clear differences between the base taggers, providing the opportunity for effective combination.
    For all but one word, in, the combiner manages to improve on the best tagger for that specific word.
