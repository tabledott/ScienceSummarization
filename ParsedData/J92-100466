tinues on improving all aspects of these domains.
    Our current research is directed at a number of different remaining issues.
    As of this writing, we have a fully integrated version of the VOYAGER system, using an A* search algorithm (Goodine et al. 1991).
    The parser produces a set of next-word candidates dynamically for each partial theory.
    We have not yet incorporated probabilities from TINA into the search, but they are used effectively to resort the final output sentence candidates.
    In order to incorporate the probabilities into the search we need a tight upper bound on the future linguistic score for the unseen portion of each hypothesis.
    This is a current research topic in our group.
    We also plan to experiment with further reductions in perplexity based on a discourse state.
    This should be particularly effective within the ATIS domain where the system often asks directed questions about as yet unresolved particulars to the flight.
