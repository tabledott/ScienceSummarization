    5.1 Results of the Intonational Analysis We looked first at the set of 878 tokens whose classification as discourse or sentential we both agreed upon.
    Our findings from this set confirmed the prosodic model we found in the studies described above to distinguish discourse from sentential uses successfully.
    The distribution of these judgments with respect to the prosodic model of discourse and sentential cue phrases depicted in Figure
