    Another class of approaches make use of syntactic information in the target language alone, treating the translation problem as a parsing problem.
    Yamada and Knight (2001) use a parser in the target language to train probabilities on a set of operations that transform a target parse tree into a source string.
    Paying more attention to source language analysis, Quirk et al. (2005) employ a source language dependency parser, a target language word segmentation component, and an unsupervised word alignment component to learn treelet translations from parallel corpus.
    In this paper, we propose a statistical translation model based on tree-to-string alignment template which describes the alignment between a source parse tree and a target string.
    A TAT is capable of generating both terminals and non-terminals and performing reordering at both low and high levels.
    The model is linguistically syntax-based because TATs are extracted automatically from word-aligned, source side parsed pa
