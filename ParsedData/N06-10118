del (line 6).
    It then uses temporal alignment (with thresholding) to select the best transliteration candidate for the next round of training (lines 8, and 9).
    Once the training is complete, lines 4 through 10 are executed without thresholding for each NE in to discover its counterpart in .
    In order to generate time sequence for a word, we divide the corpus into a sequence of temporal bins, and count the number of occurrences of the word in each bin.
    We then normalize the sequence.
    We use a method called the F-index (Hetland, 2004) to implement the similarity function on line 8 of the algorithm.
    We first run a Discrete Fourier Transform on a time sequence to extract its Fourier expansion coefficients.
    The score of a pair of time sequences is then computed as a Euclidian distance between their expansion coefficient vectors.
    .
    As we mentioned earlier, an NE in one language may map to multiple morphological variants and transliterations in another.
