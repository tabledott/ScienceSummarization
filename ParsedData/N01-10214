    Aware that the n-gram obscures many linguistically-significant distinctions (Chomsky, 1956, section 2.3), many speech researchers (Jelinek and Lafferty, 1991) sought to incorporate hierarchical phrase structure into language modeling (see (Stolcke, 1997)) although it was not until the late 1990s that such models were able to significantly improve on 3-grams (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998).
    Stolcke&#8217;s probabilistic Earley parser is one way to use hierarchical phrase structure in a language model.
    The grammar it parses is a probabilistic context-free phrase structure grammar (PCFG), e.g.
    Such a grammar defines a probabilistic language in terms of a stochastic process that rewrites strings of grammar symbols according to the probabilities on the rules.
    Then each sentence in the language of the grammar has a probability equal to the product of the probabilities of all the rules used to generate it.
    This multiplication embodies the assumptio
