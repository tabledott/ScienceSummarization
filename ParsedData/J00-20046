osed machine learning techniques to induce models of the process from examples of its input and output.
    The proposal generated much excitement, because it held the promise of automating a task that forty years of research have proven very labor-intensive and error-prone.
    Yet very few other researchers have taken up the cause, partly because Brown et al. 's (1988) approach was quite a departure from the paradigm in vogue at the time.
    Formally, Brown et al. (1988) built statistical models of translational equivalence (or translation models', for short).
    In the context of computational linguistics, translational equivalence is a relation that holds between two expressions with the same meaning, where the two expressions are in different languages.
    Empirical estimation of statistical translation models is typically based on parallel texts or bitexts&#8212;pairs of texts that are translations of each other.
    As with all statistical models, the best translation models are those whose paramete
