    Regular tree languages are strictly contained in tree sets of tree adjoining grammars (Joshi and Schabes, 1997).
  
  
    Section 1 informally described the root-to-frontier transducer class R. We saw that R allows, by use of states, finite lookahead and arbitrary rearrangement of nonsibling input subtrees removed by a finite distance.
    However, it is often easier to write rules that explicitly represent such lookahead and movement, relieving the burden on the user to produce the requisite intermediary rules and states.
    We define xR, a convenience-oriented generalization of weighted R. Because of its good fit to natural language problems, xR is already briefly touched on, though not defined, in (Rounds, 1970).
    A weighted extended-lhs root-to-frontier tree transducer X is a quintuple (E, A, Q, Qi, R) where E is the input alphabet, and A is the output alphabet, Q is a finite set of states, Qi &#8712; Q is the initial (or start, or root) state, and R &#8838; Q
