cabulary is to be translated.
    In the easiest case it is identical to the vocabulary found in the source language part of the training corpus.
    The other extreme would be an extended vocabulary containing all automatically generated inflected forms of all base forms occurring in the training corpus.
    This vocabulary is annotated with morpho-syntactic tags, ideally under consideration of all possible readings of all word forms.
    To enable the application of the hierarchical lexicon model, the source language input sentences in test have to be analyzed and annotated with their lemma-tag representation before the actual translation process.
    So far, the sum over the readings in equation (4) has been ignored, because when the techniques for reducing the amount of ambiguity described in Section 2.2 and the disambiguated conventional dictionaries resulting from the approach presented in Section 5.1 are applied, there remains almost always only one reading per word form.
