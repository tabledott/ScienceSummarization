constructed.
    However, structural divergences between languages (Dorr, 1994),which are due to either systematic differences between languages or loose translations in real corpora,pose a major challenge to syntax-based statistical MT.
    As a result, the syntax based MT systems have to transduce between non-isomorphic tree structures.
    (Wu, 1997) introduced a polynomial-time solution for the alignment problem based on synchronous binary trees.
    (Alshawi et al., 2000) represents each production in parallel dependency trees as a finite-state transducer.
    Both approaches learn the tree representations directly from parallel sentences, and do not make allowances for nonisomorphic structures.
    (Yamada and Knight, 2001, 2002) modeled translation as a sequence of tree operations transforming a syntactic tree into a string of the target language.
    When researchers try to use syntax trees in both languages, the problem of non-isomorphism must be addressed.
    In theory, stochastic tree transducers
