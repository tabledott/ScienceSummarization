oiting the textual content and context of each relevant substring as well as the document relationships between them.
    Experiments on human protein tagging demonstrate the advantages of collective extraction on several annotated corpora of Medline abstracts.
  
  
    Given a collection of documents D, we associate with each document dE Da set of candidate entities d.E, in our case a restricted set of token sequences from the document.
    Each entity e E d.E is characterized by a predefined set of boolean features e.F.
    This set of features is the same for all candidate entities, and it can be assimilated with the relational database definition of a table.
    One particular feature is e.label which is set to 1 if e is considered a valid extraction, and 0 otherwise.
    In this document model, labels are the only hidden features, and the inference procedure will try to find a most probable assignment of values to labels, given the current model parameters.
    Each document is associated with an undire
