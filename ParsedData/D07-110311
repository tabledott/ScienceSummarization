less than exp(?20), we will select phrase pairs with a negative-log-p-value greater than 20.
			This has the advantage of working with ordinary-sized numbers and the happy convention that bigger means more pruning.
			2.4 C(s?, t?)
			= 1, 1-1-1 Tables and the ? Threshold An important special case of a table occurs when a phrase pair occurs exactly once in the corpus, and each of the component phrases occurs exactly once in its side of the parallel corpus.
			These phrase pairs will be referred to as 1-1-1 phrase pairs and the corresponding tables will be called 1-1-1 contingency tables because C(s?) = 1, C(t?) = 1, and C(s?, t?)
			= 1.
			Moore (2004) comments that the p-value for these tables under Fisher?s exact test is 1/N . Since we areusing thresholds of the negative logarithm of the p value, the value ? = log(N) is a useful threshold to consider.
			In particular, ? +  (where  is an appropriately small positive number) is the smallest threshold thatresults in none of the 1-1-1 phrase pairs being in cl
