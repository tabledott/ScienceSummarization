 method will fare on WSD of a common test data set like the one we used, nor has his method been tested on a large data set with highly ambiguous words tagged with the refined senses of WORDNET.
    The work of (Miller et al., 1994) is the only prior work we know of which attempted to evaluate WSD on a large data set and using the refined sense distinction of WORDNET.
    However, their results show no improvement (in fact a slight degradation in performance) when using surrounding words to perform WSD as compared to the most frequent heuristic.
    They attributed this to insufficient training data in SEMCOR.
    In contrast, we adopt a different strategy of collecting the training data set.
    Instead of tagging every word in a running text, as is done in SEMCOR, we only concentrate on the set of 191 most frequently occurring and most ambiguous words, and collected large enough training data for these words only.
    This strategy yields better results, as indicated by a better performance of LEXAS compare
