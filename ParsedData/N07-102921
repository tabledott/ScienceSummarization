ce or phrase-level combination.
    The system weights seem to yield even higher BLEU scores but not always lower TER scores on both languages.
    Despite slightly hurting the TER score on Arabic, the TER 8 combination result was considered the best due to the highest BLEU and significantly lower TER compared to any single system.
    Similarly, the BLEU 8 was considered the best combination result on Chinese.
    Internal HTER experiments showed that BLEU 8 yielded lower scores after post-editing even though no weights 6 had lower automatic TER score.
  
  
    Three methods for machine translation system combination were presented in this paper.
    The sentencelevel combination was based on re-ranking a merged -best list using generalized linear models with features derived from each system&#8217;s output.
    The combination yields slight gains on the tuning set.
    However, the gains were very small, if any, on the test sets.
    The re-ranked -best lists were used successfully in the word-level combin
