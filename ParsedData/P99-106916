    The pseudo-likelihood estimator described in the last section finds parameter values which maximize the conditional probabilities of the observed parses (syntactic analyses) given the observed sentences (yields) in the training corpus.
    One of the empirical evaluation measures we use in the next section measures the number of correct parses selected from the set of all possible parses.
    This suggests another possible objective function: choose 0 to maximize the number Co (c3) of times the maximum likelihood parse (under 0) is in fact the correct parse, in the training corpus.
    C9(c73) is a highly discontinuous function of 0, and most conventional optimization algorithms perform poorly on it.
    We had the most success with a slightly modified version of the simulated annealing optimizer described in Press et al. (1992).
    This procedure is much more computationally intensive than the gradient-based pseudo-
