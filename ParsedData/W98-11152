sed alternative is to remove the constituents from the agenda according to a figure of merit (FOM).
    The idea is that the FOM selects &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; items to be processed, leaving the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; ones&#8212; the ones that are not, in fact, part of the correct parse&#8212; sitting on the agenda.
    When one has a completed parse, or perhaps several possible parses, one simply stops parsing, leaving items remaining on the agenda.
    The time that would have been spent processing these remaining items is time saved, and thus time earned.
    In our work we have found that exhaustively parsing maximum-40-word sentences from the Penn II treebank requires an average of about 1.2 million edges per sentence.
    Numbers like this suggest that any approach that offers the possibility of reducing the work load is well worth pursuing, a fact that has been noted by several researchers.
    Early on, Kay (1980) suggested the use of the chart agenda for this purpose.
    More recently, the statis
