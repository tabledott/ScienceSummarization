t the LHS of the rule has a gap, there are three ways that the gap can be passed down to the RHS: Head: The gap is passed to the head of the phrase, as in rule (3) in Figure 7.
    Left, Right: The gap is passed on recursively to one of the left or right modifiers of the head or is discharged as a TRACE argument to the left or right of the head.
    In rule (2) in Figure 7, it is passed on to a right modifier, the S complement.
    In rule (4), a TRACE is generated to the right of the head VB.
    We specify a parameter type Pg(G |P, h, H) where G is either Head, Left, or Right.
    The generative process is extended to choose among these cases after generating the head of the phrase.
    The rest of the phrase is then generated in different ways depending on how the gap is propagated.
    In the Head case the left and right modifiers are generated as normal.
    In the Left and Right cases a +gap requirement is added to either the left or right SUBCAT variable.
    This requirement is fulfilled (and removed
