tual disjointness of the T,, and the independence of the parameters in the Ti.
    We also have, when T is a proper subtree of the thesaurus tree: Since the number of free parameters of a model in the entire thesaurus tree equals the number of nodes in the model minus one due to the stochastic condition (that the probability parameters must sum to one), when T equals the entire thesaurus tree, theoretically the parameter description length for a tree cut model of T should be: where IS I is the size of the entire sample.
    Since the second term log21s1 in (19) is constant once the input sample S is fixed, for the purpose of finding a model with the minimum description length, it is irrelevant.
    We will thus use the identity (18) both when T is the entire tree and when it is a proper subtree.
    (This allows us to use the same recursive algorithm, Find-MDL, in all cases.)
    It follows from (17) and (18) that the minimization of description length can be done essentially independently for each subtree.
