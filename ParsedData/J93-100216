    In the field of speech recognition, statistical techniques based on hidden Markov modeling are well established (see e.g.
    Holmes 1988:129f for an introduction).
    The two main algorithms utilized are the Viterbi (1967) algorithm and the Baum-Welch algorithm (Baum 1972).
    These algorithms provide polynomial solutions to the tasks of finding the most probable derivation for a given input and a stochastic regular grammar, and of performing iterative re-estimation of the parameters of a (hidden) stochastic regular grammar by considering all possible derivations over a corpus of inputs, respectively.
    Baker (1982) demonstrates that Baum-Welch re-estimation can be extended to context-free grammars (CFGs) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).
    Fujisaki et al. (1989) demonstrate that the Viterbi algorithm can be used in conjunction with the CYK parsing algorithm and a CFG
