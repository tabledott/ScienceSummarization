    LexDM is a 30,693 x 3,352,148 x 30,693 tensor with density 0.00001%.
    TypeDM.
    This model is based on the idea, motivated and tested by Baroni et al. (2010)&#8212; but see also Davidov and Rappoport (2008a, 2008b) for a related method&#8212;that what matters is not so much the frequency of a link, but the variety of surface forms that express it.
    For example, if we just look at frequency of co-occurrence (or strength of association), the triple (fat, of&#8722;1, land) (a figurative expression) is much more common than the semantically more informative (fat, of&#8722;1, animal).
    However, if we count the different surface realizations of the former pattern in our corpus, we find that there are only three of them (the fat of the land, the fat of the ADJ land, and the ADJ fat of the land), whereas (fat, of&#8722;1, animal) has nine distinct realizations (a fat of the animal, the fat of the animal, fats of animal, fats of the animal, fats of the animals, ADJ fats of the animal,
