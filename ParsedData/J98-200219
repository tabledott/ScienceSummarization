ta in Figure 1 using various tree cut models of the thesaurus tree in Figure 3 are shown in Table 4.
    (Table 3 shows how the description length is calculated for the model of tree cut [BIRD, bug, bee, insect].)
    These figures indicate that the model in Figure 6 is the best model, according to MDL.
    Thus, given the data in Table 1 as input, the generalization result shown in Table 5 is obtained.
    In generalizing values of a case frame slot using MDL, we could, in principle, calculate the description length of every possible tree cut model and output a model with the minimum description length as the generalization result, if computation time were of no concern.
    But since the number of cuts in a thesaurus tree is exponential in the size of the tree (for example, it is easy to verify that for a complete b-ary tree of depth d it is of the order O(2bd 1)), it is impractical to do so.
    Nonetheless, we were able to devise a Description length of the five tree cut models.
