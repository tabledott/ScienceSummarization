    At BBN, researchers called their system HWIM for (Hear What I Mean).
    They hoped to use NLP techniques such as ATNs (Woods 1970) to understand the sentences that they were trying to recognize even though the output of their front end was highly variable and ambiguous.
    The emphasis today on empirical methods in the speech recognition community is a reaction to the failure of knowledge-based approaches of the 1970s.
