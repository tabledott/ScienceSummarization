els, averaged across resamplings each of which obtains k annotations per example.
    RTE has an average +4.0% acWhere JHJ is simply the number of tokens in headline H, ignoring tokens not observed in the training set.
    We use 100 headlines as a training set (examples 500-599 from the test set of SemEval Task 14), and we use the remaining 900 headlines as our test set.
    Since we are fortunate to have the six separate expert annotations in this task, we can perform an extended systematic comparison of the performance of the classifier trained with expert vs. non-expert data.
    For this evaluation we compare the performance of systems trained on expert and non-expert annotations.
    For each expert annotator we train a system using only the judgments provided by that annotator, and then create a gold standard test set using the average of the responses of the remaining five labelers on that set.
    In this way we create six independent expert-trained systems and compute the average across their perfor
