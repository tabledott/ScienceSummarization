d as countable).
    For model (b), an additional backoffparameter was used, specifying the minimum frequency that triggers backoff.
    The models and their performance on the test set are listed in Table 12.
    The best Altavista model is the conditional det-noun model (f (det,n)/f (n)), which achieves 88.38% on countable and 91.22% on uncountable nouns.
    On the BNC, the simple unigram model performs best.
    Its performance is not statistically different from that of the best Altavista model.
    Note that for the BNC models, data sparseness means the det-noun models perform poorly, which is why the backoff model was not attempted here.
    Table 13 shows that both the Altavista model and BNC model significantly outperform the baseline (relative frequency of the majority class on the gold-standard data).
    The comparison with the literature shows that both the Altavista and the BNC model perform significantly worse than the best model proposed by Baldwin and Bond (2003); this is a supervised model t
