ituents in the translation.
    In contrast, our MBR algorithm directly selects the hypothesis in the hypergraph with the maximum expected approximate corpus BLEU score (Tromble et al., 2008).
  
  
    A translation lattice compactly encodes a large number of hypotheses produced by a phrase-based SMT system.
    The corresponding representation for an SMT system based on SCFGs (e.g.
    Chiang (2007), Zollmann and Venugopal (2006), Mi et al. (2008)) is a directed hypergraph or a packed forest (Huang, 2008).
    Formally, a hypergraph is a pair 7-1 = (V, &#163;) consisting of a vertex set V and a set of hyperedges &#163; C_ V* x V. Each hyperedge e E &#163; connects a head vertex h(e) with a sequence of tail vertices T(e) = {v1, ..., v,,,}.
    The number of tail vertices is called the arity (|e|) of the hyperedge.
    If the arity of a hyperedge is zero, h(e) is called a source vertex.
    The arity of a hypergraph is the maximum arity of its hyperedges.
    A hyperedge of arity 1 is a regular edge, and a hy
