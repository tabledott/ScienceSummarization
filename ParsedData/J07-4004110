  However, we feel that the onus of mapping into another formalism should ideally lie with the researchers making claims about their own particular parser.
    The second difficulty is that some constructions may be analyzed differently across formalisms, and even apparently trivial differences such as tokenization can complicate the comparison (Crouch et al. 2002).
    Despite these difficulties we have attempted a cross-formalism comparison of the CCG parser.
    For the gold standard we chose the version of DepBank reannotated by Briscoe and Carroll (2006) (hereafter B&amp;C), consisting of 700 sentences from Section 23 of the Penn Treebank.
    The B&amp;C scheme is similar to the original DepBank scheme in many respects, but overall contains less grammatical detail.
    Briscoe and Carroll (2006) describe the differences between the two schemes.
    We chose this resource for the following reasons: It is publicly available, allowing other researchers to compare against our results; the GRs making up the
