998) (Jaynes, 1996).
    As many authors have remarked, though, the most useful thing about maximum entropy modeling is that it allows the modeler to concentrate on finding the features that characterize the problem while letting the M.E. estimation routine worry about assigning the relative weights to the features.
  
  
    MENE consists of a set of C++ and Pen l modules which forms a wrapper around a publicly available M.E. toolkit (Ristad, 1998) which computes the values of the a parameters of equation 2 from a pair of training files created by MENE.
    MENE's flexibility is due to its object-based treatment of the three essential components of a maximum entropy system: histories, futures, and features (Borthwick et al., 1997).
    History objects in MENE act as containers for a list of &amp;quot;history views&amp;quot;.
    The history view classes each represent a different type of information about the history object.
    When the features attempt to determine whether or not they fire on a given histo
