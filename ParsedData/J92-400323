co-occurrence statistics.
    The mutual information of the pair w1 and w2 as adjacent words is If w2 follows wi less often than we would expect on the basis of their independent frequencies, then the mutual information is negative.
    If w2 follows wi more often than we would expect, then the mutual information is positive.
    We say that the pair w1 w2 is sticky if the mutual information for the pair is substantially greater than 0.
    In Table 5, we list the 20 stickiest pairs of words found in a 59,537,595-word sample of text from the Canadian parliament.
    The mutual information for each pair is given in bits, which corresponds to using 2 as the base of the logarithm in equation 18.
    Most of the pairs are proper names such as Pontius Pilate or foreign phrases that have been adopted into English such as mutatis mutandis and avant garde.
    The mutual information for Hum pty Dumpty, 22.5 bits, means that the pair occurs roughly 6,000,000 times more than one would expect from the individual frequen
