 automatically configured by general maximum likelihood estimation.
    As shown in Table 2, we can employ a number of templates to capture POS hierarchies.
    Furthermore, some overlapping features (e.g., forms and types of conjugation) can be used, which was not possible in the extended HMMs.
    L2-CRFs perform slightly better than L1-CRFs, which indicates that most of given features (i.e., overlapping features, POS hierarchies, suffixes/prefixes and character types) are relevant to both of two datasets.
    The numbers of active (nonzero) features used in L1-CRFs are much smaller (about 1/8 - 1/6) than those in L2-CRFs: (L2CRFs: 791,798 (KC) / 580,032 (RWCP) v.s., L1CRFs: 90,163 (KC) / 101,757 (RWCP)).
    L1-CRFs are worth being examined if there are some practical constraints (e.g., limits of memory, disk or CPU resources).
  
  
    In this paper, we present how conditional random fields can be applied to Japanese morphological analysis in which word boundary ambiguity exists.
    By virtue of CRFs, 1
