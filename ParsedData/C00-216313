  Table 2 shows the aligmnent quality of different alignment models.
  Here the alignment models of IIMM and Model 4 do not include a dependence on word classes.
  We conclude that more sophisti- cated alignment lnodels are crtlcial tbr good align- ment quality.
  Consistently, the use of a first-order aligmnent model, modeling an elnpty word and fer- tilities result in better alignments.
