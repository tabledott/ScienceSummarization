  31 Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1 Although, as we saw above, already for two measures the details of their medium- similarity regions differ, there appears to be an interesting commonality at the level of general structure: in the vicinity of sim = 2, the plots of human similarity ratings for both the Miller?Charles and the Rubenstein?Goodenough word pairs display a very clear horizontal band that contains no points.
  For the Miller?Charles data (Figure 3), the band separates the pair crane?implement (#16) from brother?monk (#14),13 and for the Rubenstein-Goodenough set (Figure 2), it separates magician?oracle (#37) from crane?
  implement (#38).
  On the graphs of the computed ratings, these empty bands correspond to regions with at most a few points?no more than two points for the Miller?Charles set and no more than four for the Rubenstein?Goodenough set.
  These regions are shown in Figures 3(b)?
