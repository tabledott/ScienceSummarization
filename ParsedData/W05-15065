ber et al, 1995; Goodman, 1999; Nederhof, 2003) falls into this class.
			Inour experiments, we apply the algorithms to the lexical ized PCFG parser of Bikel (2004), which is very similar to Collins?
			Model 2 (Collins, 2003), and to a synchronous CFG based machine translation system (Chiang, 2005).
	
	
			As pointed out by Charniak and Johnson (2005), the ma jor difficulty in k-best parsing is dynamic programming.The simplest method is to abandon dynamic programming and rely on aggressive pruning to maintain tractabil ity, as is used in (Collins, 2000; Bikel, 2004).
			But thisapproach is prohibitively slow, and produces rather lowquality k-best lists (see Sec.
			5.1.2).
			Gildea and Juraf sky (2002) described an O(k2)-overhead extension for the CKY algorithm and reimplemented Collins?
			Model 1 to obtain k-best parses with an average of 14.9 parses per sentence.
			Their algorithm turns out to be a special case of our Algorithm 0 (Sec.
			4.1), and is reported to also be prohibitively slow.
			Since the
