    On the other hand, MTG is a subof Multiple CFG (Seki al., where the functions that render the RHS of production rules may not mix symbols from different components.
    3 Synchronous Parsers Inference of synchronous structures requires a synparser.
    A parser an algorithm that can infer the syntactic structure of each component text in a multitext and simultaneously infer the correspondence relation between these struc- To facilitate complexity analysis (below), we specify our parsers using declarative inference rules.'
    &amp;quot;X :- Y, Z&amp;quot; means that X can be inferred from Y and Z. V means the same thing.
    An item that appears in an inference rule stands for the proposition that the item is in the parse chart.
