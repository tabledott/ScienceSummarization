ems should be processed.
    This approach also dramatically reduces the work done during parsing, though it, too, gives no guarantee that the first parse returned is the actual Viterbi parse (nor does it maintain a worst-case cubic time bound).
    We discuss best-first parsing further in section 3.3.
    Both of these speed-up techniques are based on greedy models of parser actions.
    The beam search greedily prunes partial parses at each beam stage, and a best-first FOM greedily orders parse item exploration.
    If we wish to maintain optimality in a search procedure, the obvious thing to try is A* methods (see for example Russell and Norvig, 1995).
    We apply A* search to a tabular itembased parser, ordering the parse items based on a combination of their known internal cost of construction and a conservative estimate of their cost of completion (see figure 1).
    A* search has been proposed and used for speech applications (Goel and Byrne, 1999, Corazza et al., 1994); however, it has been little us
