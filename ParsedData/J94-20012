l not necessarily improve the tagging accuracy.
    In fact, it will generally degrade this accuracy, except when only a limited amount of hand-tagged text is available.
  
  
    A lot of effort has been devoted in the past to the problem of tagging text, i.e. assigning to each word the correct tag (part of speech) in the context of the sentence.
    Two main approaches have generally been considered: Derouault and Merialdo 1986; DeRose 1988; Church 1989; Beale 1988; Marcken 1990; Merialdo 1991; Cutting et al. 1992).
    More recently, some work has been proposed using neural networks (Benello, Mackie, and Anderson 1989; Nakamura and Shikano 1989).
    Through these different approaches, some common points have emerged: These kinds of considerations fit nicely inside a probabilistic formulation of the problem (Beale 1985; Garside and Leech 1985), which offers the following advantages: In this paper we present a particular probabilistic model, the triclass model, and results from experiments involving differe
