e the latter takes only an NP (cf. for example, Freed [1979] for discussion).
    Ia.
    John finished the book. b. John finished writing the book.
    2a.
    John completed the book. b.

    The difference would indicate that, contrary to some views (e.g.
    Wierzbicka [19881 and Dixon [19911), lexical items need to carry both syntactic and semantic selectional information to determine the range of complements they may take.
    Notice here also that complete tends to select the agentive role value for its complement and not the telic role.
    The scope of semantic selection is explored at length in Pustejovsky (forthcoming).
