    Table 1 shows that both the blocking algorithm and the chaining algorithm are sandwiched between the upper and lower bounds.
    Table 2 shows some of these results in more detail.
    The block similarity algorithm seems to work slightly better than the chaining algorithm, although the difference may not prove significant over the long run.
    Furthermore, in both versions of the algorithm, changes to the parameters of the algorithm perturbs the resulting boundary markings.
    This is an undesirable property and perhaps could be remedied with some kind of information-theoretic formulation of the problem.
  
  
    This paper has described algorithms for the segmentation of expository texts into discourse units that reflect the subtopic structure of expository text.
    I have introduced the notion of the recognition of multiple simultaneous themes, which bears some resemblance to .Chafe's Flow Model of discourse and Skorochod'ko's text structure types.
    The algorithms are fully implemented:
