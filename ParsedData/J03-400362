ch more likely when it does not cross a verb. shows the modification to the Penn Treebank annotation to relabel base-NPs as NPB.
    It also illustrates a problem that arises if a distinction between the two is not made: Structures such as that in Figure 19(b) are assigned high probabilities even if they Examples of other phrases in the Penn Treebank in which nonrecursive and recursive phrases are not differentiated. are never seen in training data.
    (Johnson [1997] notes that this structure has a higher probability than the correct, flat structure, given counts taken from the treebank for a standard PCFG.)
    The model is fooled by the binary-branching style into modeling both PPs as being adjacent to the head of the noun phrase, so 19(b) will be assigned a very high probability.
    This problem does not apply only to NPs: Other types of phrases such as adjectival phrases (ADJPs) or adverbial phrases (ADVPs) also have nonrecursive (bar 1) and recursive (bar 2) levels, which are not differentiated in the
