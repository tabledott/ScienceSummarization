ng templates which, at the same time, (a) cannot be generalized by further reduction and (b) cannot be further extended keeping the same generality level.
    In order to properly define the notion of maximal most general templates, we introduce some formal definitions and notations.
    DEFINITION: For a spanning template t we define a sentence set, denoted with &#963;(t), as the set of all parsed sentences in S containing t. For each pair of templates t1 and t2, we use the notation t1 :&#65533; t2 to denote that t1 is included as a subgraph or is equal to t2.
    We use the notation t1 &#8826; t2 when such inclusion holds strictly.
    We define T(S) as the set of all spanning templates in the sample S. DEFINITION: A spanning template t E T (S) is maximal most general if and only if both of the following conditions hold: Condition A ensures that the extracted templates do not contain spanning sub-structures that are more &#8221;general&#8221; (i.e. having a larger sentence set); condition B ensures that the
