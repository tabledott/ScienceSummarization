ot only linguistic but also world knowledge which is not accessible to our model.
			Although thesystem can be forced to match the human compression rate, the grammaticality and information con tent both suffer.
			More sophisticated features could allow the system to narrow this gap.
			We next examined the output of our system inmore detail by recording the number of substitu tions, deletions and insertions it performed on the test data.
			Deletions accounted for 67% of rewrite operations, substitutions for 27%, and insertions for 6%.
			Interestingly, we observe a similar ratio in the human compressions.
			Here, deletions arealso the most common rewrite operation (69%) fol lowed by substitutions (24%), and insertions (7%).
			The ability to perform substitutions and insertions increases the compression potential of our system, but can also result in drastic meaning changes.
			In most cases (63%) the compressions produced byour system did not distort the meaning of the orig inal.
			Humans are clearly be
