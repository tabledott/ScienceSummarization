h the linear kernel, and so the results for this model only, seen in figure 3, were obtained using a polynomial kernel with parameter set to 2 (default is 1) and the constraints violation penalty set at 2 (default is 1).
    Several hybrid SVM models were further tested using the results from the previously described models as features.
    In these models, the feature values for each event represent the distance from the dividing hyperplane for each constituent model.
  
  
    The accuracy value represents the percentage of test texts which were classified correctly by the model.
    Results on the first dataset, without topic information, are shown in figure 2.
    The results for 3-fold cross validation show how the present feature sets compare with the best performing SVM reported in Pang et al. In general, the addition of Osgood values does not seem to yield improvement in any of the models.
    The Turney values appear more helpful, which is not surprising given their superior performance alone.
