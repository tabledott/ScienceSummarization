on of the population: Egypt (.eg), Saudi Arabia (.sa), Kuwait (.kw), etc.
    In addition, we used a list of .com domains known to originate in Arabic-speaking countries.
    This list provided an additional 21 specific domains (e.g., (emiratesbank.com), (checkpoint.com)); note that the list is by no means exhaustive.
    In the experiments we report here, we mined two crawls from 2001, comprising 8TB and 12TB (i.e., less than one-sixth of the Archive as it existed at the time of the mining effort in early 2002) spread over 27 machines.
    Our list of URLs with relevant domains, obtained through pattern matching in Archive index files, numbers 19,917,923 pages.22 The language-specific substrings given earlier were subtracted from these URLs to generate handles, resulting in 786,880 buckets with an average of 25 pages per bucket.
    When all possible English-Arabic page pairs were generated from all 19 The Internet Archive tags its data for language using standard n-gram language identification techniques. b
