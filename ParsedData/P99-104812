nite NPs which are rarely, if ever, seen in indefinite constructions.
    The chances that a reader will encounter &amp;quot;an F.B.I.&amp;quot; are slim to none.
    These NPs appeared to be perfect candidates for a corpus-based approach.
    To locate &amp;quot;definite-only&amp;quot; NPs we made two passes over the corpus.
    The first pass produced a list of every definite NP and its frequency.
    The second pass counted indefinite uses of all NPs cataloged during the first pass.
    Knowing how often an NP was used in definite and indefinite constructions allowed us to sort the NPs, first by the probability of being used as a definite (its definite probability), and second by definite-use frequency.
    For example, &amp;quot;the contrary&amp;quot; appeared high on this list because its head noun occurred 15 times in the training corpus, and every time it was in a definite construction.
    From this, we created a definite-only list by selecting those NPs which occurred at least 5 times and only in def
