 abilities with single numbers, much of the existing PCFG machinery based on EM can be modularly imported into the Bayesian framework.
			Rule probabilities q(?): For an ordinary PCFG, the M-step simply involves taking ratios of expected2In particular, the variational distance between the stickbreaking distribution and the truncated version decreases expo nentially as the truncation level K increases.
			693 counts: ?Bz (zl, zr) = C(z ? zl zr) C(z ? ??)

			B??T + ~C(z)), (7)where ~C(z) is the matrix of counts of rules with lefthand side z. These distributions can then be summa rized with multinomial weights which are the onlynecessary quantities for updating q(z) in the next it eration: WBz (zl, zr) def = expEq[log?Bz (zl, zr)] (8) = e?(C(z?zl zr)+?
