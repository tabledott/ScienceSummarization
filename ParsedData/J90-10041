raversal of the analysis tree for the string being generated in a semantic-head-driven fashion.
  
  
    The problem of generating a well-formed natural language expression from an encoding of its meaning possesses properties that distinguish it from the converse problem of recovering a meaning encoding from a given natural language expression.
    This much is axiomatic.
    In previous work (Shieber 1988), however, one of us attempted to characterize these differing properties in such a way that a single uniform architecture, appropriately parameterized, might be used for both natural language processes.
    In particular, we developed an architecture inspired by the Earley deduction work of Pereira and Warren (1983), but which generalized that work allowing for its use in both a parsing and generation mode merely by setting the values of a small number of parameters.
    As a method for generating natural language expressions, the Earley deduction method is reasonably successful along certain dimensions.
