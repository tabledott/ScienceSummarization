ese differences, depending instead on powerful inference mechanisms to identify the referents of referring expressions.
    Although such approaches may suffice, especially for well-formed texts, they are insufficient in general.
    In particular, such approaches will not work for generation.
    Here the relationships among focusing, coherence, and referring expressions are essential and must be explicitly provided for.
    Theories&#8212;and systems based on them--will generate unacceptable uses of referring expressions if they do not take these relationships into account.3
  
  
    In our theory, the centers of a sentence in a discourse serve to integrate that sentence into the discourse.
    Each sentence, S, has a single backward-looking center, Cb(S), and a set of forward-looking centers, Cf(S).
    Cb(S) serves to link S to the preceding discourse, while Cf(S) provides a set of entities to which the succeeding discourse may be linked.
    To avoid confusion, the phrase 'the center' will he used to re
