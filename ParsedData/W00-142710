    However there are exceptions to this, and in any case the input to the morphological generator does not contain information about stress.
    Consider the Flex rule in (3), where the symbols C and V abbreviate the character sets consisting of (upper and lower case) consonants and ,vowels,- respectively.
    Given the input submit-i-ed_V this rule correctly generates submitted.
    However, the verb to exhibit does not undergo consonant doubling so this rule will generate, incorrectly, the word form exhibitted.
    In order to ensure that the correct inflection of a verb is generated, the morphological generator uses a list of (around 1,100) lemmata that allow consonant doubling, extracted automatically from the British National Corpus (BNC; Burnard, 1995).
    The list is checked before inflecting verbs.
