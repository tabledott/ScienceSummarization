 processes.
    The segmenter handles the grouping of hanzi into words and outputs word pronunciations, with default pronunciations for hanzi it cannot group; we focus here primarily on the system's ability to segment text appropriately (rather than on its pronunciation abilities).
    The model incorporates various recent techniques for incorporating and manipulating linguistic knowledge using finite-state transducers.
    It also incorporates the Good-Turing method (Baayen 1989; Church and Gale 1991) in estimating the likelihoods of previously unseen constructions, including morphological derivatives and personal names.
    We will evaluate various specific aspects of the segmentation, as well as the overall segmentation performance.
    This latter evaluation compares the performance of the system with that of several human judges since, as we shall show, even people do not agree on a single correct way to segment a text.
    Finally, this effort is part of a much larger program that we are undertaking to
