			The determination of syntactic structure is an important step in natural language processing as syntactic structure strongly determines semantic interpretation in the form of predicate-argument struc ture, dependency relations or logical form.
			For a substantial number of linguistic phenomena such as topicalisation, wh-movement in relative clausesand interrogative sentences, however, there is an important difference between the location of the (surface) realisation of linguistic material and the location where this material should be interpreted semantically.
			Resolution of such long-distance dependencies (LDDs) is therefore crucial in the determination of accurate predicate-argument struc1Manually constructed f-structures for 105 randomly se lected trees from Section 23 of the WSJ section of the Penn-II Treebankture, deep dependency relatio
