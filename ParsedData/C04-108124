 can result in worse performance, as seen in the AS dataset.
			5.4 Error analysis and discussion.
			Several typical errors are observed in error anal ysis.
			One typical error is caused by inconsistent segmentation labeling in the test set.
			This is mostnotorious in CTB dataset.
			The second most typical error is in new, out-of-vocabulary words, especially proper names.
			Although our new word detec tion fixes many of these problems, it is not effectiveenough to recognize proper names well.
			One solution to this problem could use a named entity ex tractor to recognize proper names; this was found to be very helpful in Wu (2003).
			One of the most attractive advantages of CRFs (and maximum entropy models in general) is its the flexibility to easily incorporate arbitrary features,here in the form domain-knowledge-providing lex icons.
			However, obtaining these lexicons is not a trivial matter.
			The quality of lexicons can affect the performance of CRFs significantly.
			In addition, compared to sim
