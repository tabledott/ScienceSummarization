llustrate the effect of the constraint.
    Consider the partial alignment in Figure 2.
    When the system attempts to link of and de, the new link will induce the dotted dependency, which crosses a previously induced dependency between service and donn&#180;ees.
    Therefore, of and de will not be linked. the status of the data service&#10065; l' &#233;tat du service de donn&#233;es&#10065; In this section we introduce two types of features that we use in our implementation of the probability model described in Section 2.
    The first feature type fta concerns surrounding links.
    It has been observed that words close to each other in the source language tend to remain close to each other in the translation (Vogel et al., 1996; Ker and Change, 1997).
    To capture this notion, for any word pair (ei, fj), if a link l(ei,, fj,) exists where i &#8722; 2 &#8804; i' &#8804; i + 2 and j &#8722; 2 &#8804; j' &#8804; j + 2, then we say that the feature fta(i&#8722;i', j&#8722;j', ei,) is active for this contex
