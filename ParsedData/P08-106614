an replace X by X2, but not by X1 based on the definition of category operations.
    Now we explain how we get the string-todependency rules from training data.
    The procedure is similar to (Chiang, 2007) except that we maintain tree structures on the target side, instead of strings.
    Given sentence-aligned bi-lingual training data, we first use GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to generate word level alignment.
    We use a statistical CFG parser to parse the English side of the training data, and extract dependency trees with Magerman&#8217;s rules (1995).
    Then we use heuristic rules to extract transferrules recursively based on the GIZA alignment and the target dependency trees.
    The rule extraction procedure is as follows.
    All the 4-tuples (P?
    ',&#65533; phrase alignments, where source phrase P ?
    ',&#65533; &#65533;is e under alignment3 A, and D, the dependency structure for P m,n e , is well-formed.
    All valid phrase templates are valid rules templates.
