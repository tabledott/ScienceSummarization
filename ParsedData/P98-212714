    In (Dagan et al., 1993) and (Pereira et al., 1993), clusters of similar words are evaluated by how well they are able to recover data items that are removed from the input corpus one at a time.
    In (Alshawi and Carter, 1994), the collocations and their associated scores were evaluated indirectly by their use in parse tree selection.
    The merits of different measures for association strength are judged by the differences they make in the precision and the recall of the parser outputs.
    The main contribution of this paper is a new evaluation methodology for automatically constructed thesaurus.
    While previous methods rely on indirect tasks or subjective judgments, our method allows direct and objective comparison between automatically and manually constructed thesauri.
    The results show that our automatically created thesaurus is significantly closer to WordNet than Roget Thesaurus is.
    Our experiments also surpasses previous experiments on automatic thesaurus construction in
