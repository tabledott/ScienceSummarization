aptation data (+4.02).
    The benefit of using the background data together with indomain data is very small, and rapidly vanishes as the amount of such data increases.
    If English synthetic texts are employed to adapt the LM component, the increase in performance is significantly lower but still remarkable (see Table 2).
    By employing all the available data, the gain in BLEU% score was of 4% relative, that is from 22.60 to 23.52. opment set as usual.
    Results of these experiments are reported in Figure 3.
    Results suggest that regardless of the used bilingual corpora the in-domain TMs and RMs work better alone than combined with the original models.
    We think that this behavior can be explained by a limited disciminative power of the resulting combined model.
    The background translation model could contain phrases which either do or do not fit the adaptation domain.
    As the weights are optimized to balance the contribution of all phrases, the system is not able to well separate the posi
