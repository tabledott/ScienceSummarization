ike in this Portuguese fragment: Tudo a possive7 encontrar em o IX Sa7&#65533;o de Antiguidades, desde objectos de ouro e prata, moedas, ...
    The problem here is due to the pronoun Tudo (Anything), which is the object of encontrar (find), but which is also the head of desde (from) and its preceding comma.
    In order to be able to properly link desde to Tudo, it is necessary to postpone its processing; hence it is saved with Extract to the temporary stack and put back later in front of the comma with Insert.
    In fact the pair Extract/Insert behaves like a generalized Rightn/Leftn, when n is not known.
    As in the example, except for the case where n=2, it is difficult to predict the value of n, since there can be an arbitrary long sequence of tokens before reaching the position where the link can be inserted.
