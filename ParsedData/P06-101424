tions, thus constituting an obstacle that must be overcome.
    We believe that the research topic analyzed in this paper is a first step towards making WSD a feasible task and enabling language-aware applications, like information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, etc.
    In a future work, we plan to investigate the contribution of coarse disambiguation to such real-world applications.
    To this end, we aim to set up an Open Mind-like experiment for the validation of the entire mapping from WordNet to ODE, so that only a minimal error rate would affect the experiments to come.
    Finally, the method presented here could be useful for lexicographers in the comparison of the quality of dictionaries, and in the detection of missing word senses.
