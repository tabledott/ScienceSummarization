    We do not model inter-personal exchanges; instead, we model factors that influence stance taking.
    Lin at al (2006) identify opposing perspectives.
    Though apparently related at the task level, perspectives as they define them are not the same as opinions.
    Their approach does not involve any opinion analysis.
    Fujii and Ishikawa (2006) also work with arguments.
    However, their focus is on argument visualization rather than on recognizing stances.
    Other researchers have also mined data to learn associations among products and features.
    In their work on mining opinions in comparative sentences, Ganapathibhotla and Liu (2008) look for user preferences for one product&#8217;s features over another&#8217;s.
    We do not exploit comparative constructs, but rather probabilistic associations.
    Thus, our approach and thei
