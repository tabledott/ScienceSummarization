mary translate of.f~0 (the hth word in the [:rench sentence) shoukl more accurately be given by the probability P(e,,kl .f,,,h,m,n) that depends both on word positions and sentence lengths.
  1o keep the formulation as simple as possiblE, WE can restrict ourselves to tile functional form l(ei ,k I /i,,,h,m,n) = PW(e,~ I fh) PD(k l h,m,n) (5.1) In (5.1) we make thc distortion distribution PD(klh,m,n) indcpcndcnt o1 the identity of the words whose positional discrepancy it dcscribcs.
  As far as secondary generation is concerned, it is first clear that the production of preceding words differs from that of those that Iollow.
  So the R and Q probabilities hould be split into left and right probabilities RL and QL, and RR and QR.
  Furthermore, e shnuld provide the Q -probabilities with their own distortion components that would depend on the distance of the secondary word from its primary parent.
  As a result of these cons!derations, the probability that f~, generates (for instance) the primary words e,~ and p
