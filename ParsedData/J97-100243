   Greene and Cappella (1986) show very good reliability for a monologue segmentation task based on the &amp;quot;idea&amp;quot; structure of the monologue, but they explicitly tell the coders that most segments are made up of two or three clauses.
    Describing a typical size may improve agreement, but might also weaken the influence of the real segmentation criteria.
    In addition, higher-level segments such as transactions vary in size considerably.
    More discussion between the expert and the novices might also improve agreement on segmentation, but would make it more difficult for others to apply the coding systems.
  
  
    Subjective coding has been described for three different levels of task-oriented dialogue structure, called conversational moves, games, and transactions, and the reliability of all three kinds of coding discussed.
    The codings were devised for use with the HCRC Map Task Corpus.
    The move coding divides the dialogue up into segments corresponding to the different discours
