baseline model corresponds to a pronoun resolution algorithm commonly applied to written text, i.e., it uses only the features in the first two parts of Table 3.
    For the baseline model we generated training and test data which included only NPantecedents.
    Then we performed experiments using the features introduced for spoken dialogue.
    The training and test data for the models using additional features included NP- and non-NP-antecedents.
    For each data set we followed the iterative procedure outlined in Section 5.1.
    In the following tables we present the results of our experiments.
    The first column gives the number of coreference links correctly found by the classifier, the second column gives the number of all coreference links found.
    The third column gives the total number of coreference links (1250) in the corpus.
    During evaluation, the list of all correct links is used as the key list against which the response list produced by the classifier (cf. above) is compared.
    The
