ussion and our conclusions are given in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.
  
  
    We first define the probability of a segmentation of a given text in this section.
    In the next section, we then describe the algorithm for selecting the most likely segmentation.
    Let be a text consisting of words, and let be a segmentation of consisting of segments.
    Then the probability of the segmentation is defined by: because is a constant for a given text .
    The definitions of and given below, in that order.
    We define a topic by the distribution of words in that topic.
    We assume that different topics have different word distributions.
    We further assume that different topics are statistically independent of each other.
    We also assume that the words within the scope of a topic are statistically independent of each other given the topic.
    Let be the number of words in segment , and let be the -th word in .
    If we define as The definition of can vary depending on our prior information about t
