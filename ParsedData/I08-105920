human evaluation of our system prototype, we decided to 3 Chodorow et al (2007) evaluate their system on.
			proprietary student essays from non-native students, where they achieve 77.8% precision at 30.4% recall for the preposition substitution task.
			simply address the question of accuracy on the determiner and preposition choice tasks on a sample of non-native text.
			For this purpose we ran the system over a random sample of sentences from the CLEC corpus (8k for the preposition evaluation and 6k for the determiner evaluation).
			An independent judge annotated each flag produced by the system as belonging to one of the following categories: ?

			(3) the original and the rewrite are both equally good ?
			(4) the error is at or near the suggested correction, but it is a different kind of error (not having to do with prepositions/determiners) ?
			(5) There is a
