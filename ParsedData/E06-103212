    Figure 1 gives a scatterplot of each of the hypothesis translations produced by the second best Bleu system from the 2005 NIST MT Evaluation.
    The number of possible permutations for some translations is greater than 1073.
    In addition to the factorial number of ways that similarly scored Bleu items can be generated by permuting phrases around bigram mismatch points, additional variation may be synthesized by drawing different items from the reference ngrams.
    For example, since the hypothesis translation from Table 1 has a length of 18 with 15 unigram matches, 10 bigram matches, 5 trigram matches, and three 4-gram matches, we can artificially construct an identically scored hypothesis by drawing an identical number of matching ngrams from the reference translations.
    Therefore the far less plausible: was being led to the  |calm as he was | would take  |carry him  |seemed quite | when  |taken would receive the same Bleu score as the hypothesis translation from Table 1, even though human jud
