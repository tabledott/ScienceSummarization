    The morpheme please can occur initially only in sentences which convey a request.

    We have given evidence in this paper for an account of indirect speech acts based on rationality (plan construction), imputing rationality to others (plan inference), surface speech act definitions relating form to &amp;quot;literal&amp;quot; intentions, and illocutionary acts allowing a variety of realizing forms for the same intentions.
    The reader may object that we are suggesting a complex solution to what appears to be a simple problem.
    It is important to distinguish here the general explanation of indirect speech acts (which is presented here partly through an algorithm) fr
