select the property BROWN, resulting in a set of properties that may be realized as the brown desk bought by Sony and by Philips.
    Such descriptions appear to be quite natural.
    One might even argue, on Gricean grounds (Grice 1975), that identifying a simply as being bought by Philips can give rise to the false implicature that a was not bought by Sony.
    This suggests that the proposed algorithm might also be empirically more accurate than the one using limited backtracking provided, of course, properties are properly aggregated (e.g., Dalianis and Hovy 1996).
    To prove intersective completeness, certain assumptions concerning the cardinality of sets need to be made.
    To give an extreme example, suppose one wanted to refer to a real number that does not have a &#8220;proper name&#8221; (unlike, e.g., 7r); then the class of potentially useful properties is so vast that no GRE algorithm can take them all into consideration.
    As long as the number of properties (i.e., Attribute/Value combinatio
