 have also found a way to scale up the size of the vocabulary).
  Secondly, we were concerned that their estimates might lack robustness (at least in some cases): "This algorithm leads to a local maximum of the probability of the observed pairs as a function of the parameters of the model.
  There may be many such local maxima.
  The particular one at which we arrive will, in general, depend on the initial choice of parameters."
  (Brown et al., p. 82) In particular, we looked at their estimates for the word hear, which is surprisingly often translated as bravo (espeeiaUy, Hear, hear?
  ), though it is not clear just how common this is.
  reported that more than 99% of the uses of hear were translated with bravo, whereas we estimate the fraction to be much closer to 60% (which is fairly consistent with their more recent estimates (Brown, personal communication)).
  The fact that estimates can vary so widely from 99% to 60% indicates that there might be a serious problem with robustness.
  It became clear afte
