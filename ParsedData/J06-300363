owing equation: In steps 5 and 6 of the LRA algorithm (Section 5.5), we ensure that the matrix X is symmetrical, so that equation (8) is necessarily true for LRA.
    The matrix is designed so that the row vector for A:B is different from the row vector for B:A only by a permutation of the elements.
    The same permutation distinguishes the row vectors for C:D and D:C. Therefore the cosine of the angle between A:B and C:D must be identical to the cosine of the angle between B:A and D:C (see equation (7)).
    To discover the consequences of this design decision, we altered steps 5 and 6 so that symmetry is no longer preserved.
    In step 5, for each word pair A:B that appears in the input set, we only have one row.
    There is no row for B:A unless B:A also appears in the input set.
    Thus the number of rows in the matrix dropped from 17,232 to 8,616.
    In step 6, we no longer have two columns for each pattern P, one for &#8220;word1 P word2&#8221; and another for &#8220;word2 P word1.&#8221; However,
