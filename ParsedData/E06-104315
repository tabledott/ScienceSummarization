ic and the rest as literal.
    We assess the overall goodness of a measure by looking at its accuracy (Acc) and the relative reduction in error rate (RER) on the classification task described above.
    The RER of a measure reflects the improvement in its accuracy relative to another measure (often a baseline).
    We consider two baselines: (i) a random baseline, , that randomly assigns a label (literal or idiomatic) to each verb&#8211;noun pair; (ii) a more informed baseline, , an information-theoretic measure widely used for extracting statistically significant collocations.3 We use the British National Corpus (BNC; &#8220;http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/&#8221;) to extract verb&#8211; noun pairs, along with information on the syntactic patterns they appear in.
    We automatically parse the corpus using the Collins parser (Collins, 1999), and further process it using TGrep2 (Rohde, 2004).
    For each instance of a transitive verb, we use heuristics to extract the noun phrase (NP) in either the direct object
