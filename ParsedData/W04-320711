arsing algorithm since a split parsing algorithm will preclude inference of certain configurations of word alignments that are allowed by a non-split parser (Melamed, 2003).
    We trained the parser on sentences of 15 words or fewer in the WSJ Treebank sections 01&#8211;21.5 99.49% dependency attachment accuracy was achieved on the training set, and 76.68% and 75.00% were achieved on sections 22 and 23, respectively.
    Performance on the English side of our KTB test set was 71.82% (averaged across 5 folds, u = 1.75).
    This type of discriminative training has been applied to log-linear variants of hidden Markov models (Lafferty et al., 2001) and to lexical-functional grammar (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2002).
    To our knowledge, it has not been explored for context-free models (including bilexical dependency models like ours).
    A review of discriminative approaches to parsing can be found in Chiang (2003).
