 Figure 3 &#8212; is any binary parse of the (wi ti) &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; (Wn, to) (&lt;Is&gt; , SE) sequence with the restriction that (&lt;/s&gt;, TOP') is the only allowed head.
    Note that ((wi, ti) .
    (w, t)) needn't be a constituent, but for the parses where it is, there is no restriction on which of its words is the headword or what is the non-terminal label that accompanies the headword.
    The model will operate by means of three modules: (unary, NTlabel), (adjoin-left, NTlabel) or (adj oin-right , NTlabel) until it passes control to the PREDICTOR by taking a null transition.
    NTlabel is the non-terminal label assigned to the newly built constituent and {left , right} specifies where the new headword is inherited from.
    The operations performed by the PARSER are illustrated in Figures 4-6 and they ensure that all possible binary branching parses with all possible headword and non-terminal label assignments for the w1 wk word sequence can be generated.
    The following algorithm formal
