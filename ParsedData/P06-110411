8226;), Kp(&#8226;,&#8226;) is the polynomial expansion of K(&#8226;,&#8226;) with degree d=2, i.e.
    Kp(&#8226;,&#8226;) = (K(&#8226;,&#8226;)+1)2 , and &#945; is the coefficient.
    Evaluation on the development set shows that this composite kernel yields the best performance when &#945; is set to 0.23.
    The polynomial expansion aims to explore the entity bi-gram features, esp. the combined features from the first and second entities, respectively.
    In addition, due to the different scales of the values of the two individual kernels, they are normalized before combination.
    This can avoid one kernel value being overwhelmed by that of another one.
    The entity kernel formulated by eqn.
    (1) is a proper kernel since it simply calculates the dot product of the entity feature vectors.
    The tree kernel formulated by eqn.
    (3) is proven to be a proper kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001).
    Since kernel function set is closed under normalization, polynomial expansion and linear combination (S
