ull derivation is presented in Florian and Ngai (2001)).
    The case of (2), however, is much simpler.
    It is easy to notice that C [s'] =&#65533; C [b (s')] and s' E B (r) implies that b (s') E&#65533; B (r); indeed, a necessary condition for a sample s' to be in a set C [b (s)] = tr in formula (1) and removing the test altogether for case of (2).
    The formulae used to generate rules r that might have their counts increased (equations (3) and (4)) are obtained in the same fashion as in Case I.
    At every point in the algorithm, we assumed that all the rules that have at least some positive outcome (good (r) &gt; 0) are stored, and their score computed.
    Therefore, at the beginning of the algorithm, all the rules that correct at least one wrong classification need to be generated.
    The bad counts for these rules are then computed by generation as well: in every position that has the correct classification, the rules that change the classification are generated, as in Case 4, and their bad count
