 S&amp;T can achieve higher accuracy not only on segmentation but also on POS tagging (Ng and Low, 2004).
    Besides the usual character-based features, additional features dependent on POS&#8217;s or words can also be employed to improve the performance.
    However, as such features are generated dynamically during the decoding procedure, two limitation arise: on the one hand, the amount of parameters increases rapidly, which is apt to overfit on training corpus; on the other hand, exact inference by dynamic programming is intractable because the current predication relies on the results of prior predications.
    As a result, many theoretically useful features such as higherorder word or POS n-grams are difficult to be incorporated in the model efficiently.
    To cope with this problem, we propose a cascaded linear model inspired by the log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2004) widely used in statistical machine translation to incorporate different kinds of knowledge sources.
