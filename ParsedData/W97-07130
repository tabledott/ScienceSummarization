  From Discourse Structures To Text Summaries
  
    We describe experiments that show that the concepts of rhetorical analysis and nucleanty can be used effectively for deternulling the most important units in a text We show how these concepts can be implemented and we discuss results that we obtained with a discourse-based summanzation program 1 Motivation The evaluation of automatic summanzers has always been a thorny problem most papers on summarization describe the approach that they use and give some &amp;quot;consamples of the output In very few cases, output of a summarization program with a human-made summary or evaluated with the help of human subjects, usually, the results are modest Unfortunately, evaluating the results of a particular implementation does not enable one to determine what part of the failure is due to the implementation itself and what part to its underlying assumptions The position that we take in this paper is that, in order to build high-quality summarization programs, one need
