  The average pairwise percentage agreement is 92% and the average pairwise kappa value is 0.78.
    These results are comparable to those of Spertus (1997), who reports 98% agreement on noninflammatory messages and 64% agreement on inflammatory messages.
    Two of the annotators were then asked to identify the flame elements in the entire corpus NG-FE.
    Flame elements are the subset of subjective elements that are perceived to be inflammatory.
    The two annotators were asked to do this in the entire corpus, even those messages not identified as flames, because messages that were not judged to be flames at the document level may contain some individual inflammatory phrases.
    As above, no training was performed for the expression-level task, and a single round of tagging was performed, without communication between annotators.
    Agreement was measured in the same way as in the subjective-element study above.
    The kappa value for flame element annotations in corpus NG-FE is 0.46.
