n is evaluated: p(8) is the alignment probability for the three cases above, pe I., .) denoting the trigram language model. e, e', e&amp;quot;, e&amp;quot; are the four final words which are considered in the dynamic programming taking into account the monotonicity restriction and a trigram language model.
    The DP equation is evaluated recursively to find the best partial path to each grid point (j, , e).
    No explicit length model for the length of the generated target string ef given the source string fi/ is used during the generation process.
    The length model is implicitly given by the alignment probabilities.
    The optimal translation is obtained by carrying out the following optimization: where J is the length of the input sentence and $ is a symbol denoting the sentence end.
    The complexity of the algorithm for full search is J- E4, where E is the size of the target language vocabulary.
    However, this is drastically reduced by beam-search.
    The baseline alignment model does not permi
