h the path statistics improves results.
    Note that this method can only identify frame elements that have a corresponding constituent in the automatically generated parse tree.
    For this reason, it is interesting to calculate how many true frame elements overlap with the results of the system, relaxing the criterion that the boundaries must match exactly.
    Results for partial matching are shown in Table 6.
    When the automatically identified constituents were fed through the role labeling system described above, 79.6% of the constituents which had been correctly identified in the first stage were assigned the correct role in the second, roughly equivalent to the performance when assigning roles to constituents identified by hand.
  
  
    Our preliminary system is able to automatically label semantic roles with fairly high accuracy, indicating promise for applications in various natural language tasks.
    Lexical statistics computed on constituent head words were found to be the most important of
