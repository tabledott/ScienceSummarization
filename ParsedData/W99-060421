e simplified decision rule (Eq.

    (9) P(zlik) instead of p(zI4).
    Afterwards the actual translation process begins.
    It has a search organization along the positions of the target language string.
    In search we produce partial hypotheses, each of which contains the following information: A partial hypothesis is extended by appending one target word.
    The set of all partial hypotheses can be structured as a graph with a source node representing the sentence start, leaf nodes representing full translations and intermediate nodes representing partial hypotheses.
    We recombine partial hypotheses which cannot be distinguished by neither language model nor translation model.
    When the elements 1 - 5 of two partial hypotheses do not allow to distinguish between two hypotheses it is possible to drop the hypothesis with higher costs for the subsequent search process.
    We also use beam-search in order to handle the huge search space.
    We compare in beamsearch hypothe
