also provided evidence that the use of more unlabeled data in SSL can lead to further improvements.
    Moreover, our experimental analysis revealed that it may also induce an improvement in the expected performance for unseen data in terms of the unlabeled data coverage.
    Our results may encourage the adoption of the SSL method for many other real world applications.
