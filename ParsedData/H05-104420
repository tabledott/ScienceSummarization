			It is only with all the features that we get the best result, good precision with the highest recall.
			The clues in the prior-polarity lexicon have 19,506 instances in the test set.
			According to the28-feature neutral-polar classifier, 5,671 of these in stances are polar in context.
			It is these clue instancesthat are passed on to the second step in the contex tual disambiguation process, polarity classification.
			6.3.2 Polarity Classification Ideally, this second step in the disambiguationprocess would be a three-way classification task, determining whether the contextual polarity is positive, negative or bo
