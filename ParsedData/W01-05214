 of its parent.
    The remaining two distributions generate the non-head children one after the other.
    A special #STOP# symbol is generated to terminate the sequence of children for a given parent.
    Each child is generated in two steps: first its syntactic category C and head tag Cht are chosen given the parent's and head child's features and a function A representing the distance from the head child: Then the new child's head word Chw is chosen: For each of the three distributions, the empirical distribution of the training data is interpolated with less specific backoff distributions, as we will see in Section 5.
    Further details of the model, including the distance features used and special handling of punctuation, conjunctions, and base noun phrases, are described in Collins (1999).
    The fundamental features of used in the probability distributions are the lexical heads and head tags of each constituent, the co-occurrences of parent nodes and their head children, and the cooccurrences of chi
