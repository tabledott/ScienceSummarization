rsion of th Obligatory Contour Principle (OCP) (Goldsmith, 1979) which disallows repeated segments except in the prosodic template and in the surface string.
    McCarthy points out the roots like /smnn/, which appear to violate the OCP can invariably be reanalyzed as biliteral roots like /sm/ and, if this is done, our analysis, like his, goes through.
    The OCP does seem likely to cause some trouble when we come to treat one of the principal remaining problems, namely that of the forms in row I of table I.
    It turns out that the vowel that appears in the second syllable of these forms is not provided by the vocalism, but by the root.
    The vowel that appears in the perfect is generally different from the one that appears in the imperfect, and four different pairs are possible.
    The pair that is used with a given root is an idiosyncratic property of that root.
    One possibility is, therefore, that we treat the traditional triliteral roots as consisting not simply of three consonants, but as three
