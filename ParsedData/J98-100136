 for WordNet's widespread use is that it is the first broad-coverage lexical resource that is freely and widely available; as a result, whatever its limitations, WordNet's sense divisions and lexical relations are likely to impact the field for several years to come.11 Some of the earliest attempts to exploit WordNet for sense disambiguation are in the field of information retrieval.
    Using the hyponomy links for nouns in WordNet, Voorhees (1993) defines a construct called a hood in order to represent sense categories, much as Roget's categories are used in the methods outlined above.
    A hood for a given word w is defined as the largest connected subgraph that contains w. For each content Ide and Veronis Introduction word in a document collection, Voorhees computes the number of times each synset appears above that word in the WordNet noun hierarchy, which gives a measure of the expected activity (global counts); she then performs the same computation for words occurring in a particular document or quer
