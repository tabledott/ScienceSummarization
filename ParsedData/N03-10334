n the model.
    Indeed, as for the voted perceptron of Collins (2002), we can get performance gains by reducing the support threshold for features to be included in the model.
    Combining all these ideas, together with a few additional handcrafted unknown word features, gives us a part-of-speech tagger with a per-position tag accuracy of 97.24%, and a whole-sentence correct rate of 56.34% on Penn Treebank WSJ data.
    This is the best automatically learned part-of-speech tagging result known to us, representing an error reduction of 4.4% on the model presented in Collins (2002), using the same data splits, and a larger error reduction of 12.1% from the more similar best previous loglinear model in Toutanova and Manning (2000).
  
  
    When building probabilistic models for tag sequences, we often decompose the global probability of sequences using a directed graphical model (e.g., an HMM (Brants, 2000) or a conditional Markov model (CMM) (Ratnaparkhi, 1996)).
    In such models, the probability assigned
