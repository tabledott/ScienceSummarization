 nodes as its children.
    Note that by equations (1) through (3), if two senses have the virtual root node as their only upper bound then their similarity value is 0.
    Example.
    The following table shows the semantic similarity computed for several word pairs, in each case shown with the most informative subsumer.6 Probabilities were estimated using the Penn Treebank version of the Brown corpus.
    The pairs come from an example given by Church and Hanks (1989), illustrating the words that human subjects most frequently judged as being associated with the word doctor.
    (The word sick also appeared on the list, but is excluded here because it is not a noun.)
