expansion techniques in that our question-answer translation model uses the whole question-answer corpus as information source, and our approach to paraphrasing deploys large amounts of bilingual phrases as highcoverage information source for synonym finding.
    Furthermore, both approaches take the entire query context into account when proposing to add new terms to the original query.
    The approaches that are closest to our models are the SMT approach of Radev et al. (2001) and the paraphrasing approach of Duboue and Chu-Carroll (2006).
    None of these approaches defines the problem of the lexical gap as a query expansion problem, and both approaches use much simpler SMT models than our systems, e.g., Radev et al. (2001) neglect to use a language model to aid disambiguation of translation choices, and Duboue and Chu-Carroll (2006) use SMT as black box altogether.
    In sum, our approach differs from previous work in QA and IR in the use SMT technology for query expansion, and should be applicable in
