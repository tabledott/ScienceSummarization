s) are non-overlapping, non-recursive noun phrases.
    In their experiments they have modeled chunk recognition as a tagging task: words that are inside a baseNP were marked I, words outside a baseNP received an 0 tag and a special tag B was used for the first word inside a baseNP immediately following another baseNP.
    A text example: original: In [N early trading NI in [N Hong Kong N] [N Monday NI , [N gold N] was quoted at [N $ 366.50 NI [N an ounce N] &#8226; tagged: Other representations for NP chunking can be used as well.
    An example is the representation used in (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) where all the chunkinitial words receive the same start tag (analogous to the B tag) while the remainder of the words in the chunk are paired with a different tag.
    This removes tagging ambiguities.
    In the Ratnaparkhi representation equal noun phrases receive the same tag sequence regardless of the context in which they appear.
    The data representation choice might influence the performance of chunking syste
