ount of definite descriptions based on functionality); (The reason definite descriptions in appositive and copular constructions tend to be discourse-new, in fact unfamiliar, is that the information needed for the identification is given by the NP to which the apposition is attached and the predicative part of the copular construction, respectively') Finally, we found that three classes of what Hawkins called &amp;quot;larger situation&amp;quot; definites (those whose existence can be assumed to be known on the basis of encyclopedic knowledge, such as the pope) can also be recognized on the basis of heuristics exploiting syntactic and lexical features: In our corpus study we found that our subjects did much better at identifying discourse-new descriptions all together (K = 0.68) than they did at distinguishing unfamiliar from larger situation cases (K -= 0.63).
    This finding was confirmed by our implementation: although each of the heuristics is designed, in principle, to identify only one of the uses (lar
