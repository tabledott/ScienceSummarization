size in number of tokens As words occurring several times are reduced to word-frequency pairs, the size of the queries generated from the 100-best translation lists is only 9 times as big as the queries generated from the first-best translations.
			The queries generated from the translation model contain many more translation alternatives, summing up to almost 3.4 million tokens.
			Using the lattices the whole information of the translation model is kept.
			4.3.1 Results for Query 1TQ In the first experiment we used the first-best translations to generate the queries.
			For each of the 4 corpora different numbers of similar sentences (1, 10, 100, and 1000) were retrieved to build specific language models.
			Figure-2 shows the language model adaptation after tuning the interpolation factor ? by a grid search over [0,1].
			Typically ? is around 0.80.
