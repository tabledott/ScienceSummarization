al words in aligned sentences are extracted and filtered according to their predictive power.
    Then, these contexts are used to extract new paraphrases.
    In addition to learning lexical paraphrases, the method also learns syntactic paraphrases, by generalizing syntactic patterns of the extracted paraphrases.
    Extracted paraphrases are then applied to the corpus, and used to learn new context rules.
    This iterative algorithm continues until no new paraphrases are discovered.
    A novel feature of our approach is the ability to extract multiple kinds of paraphrases: Identification of lexical paraphrases.
    In contrast to earlier work on similarity, our approach allows identification of multi-word paraphrases, in addition to single words, a challenging issue for corpus-based techniques.
    Extraction of morpho-syntactic paraphrasing rules.
    Our approach yields a set of paraphrasing patterns by extrapolating the syntactic and morphological structure of extracted paraphrases.
    This process re
