hrases.
    2) The lexicalized TSRs make the major contribution since they can capture non-syntactic phrases with syntactic structure features. refers to the structure reordering rules that have at least two non-terminal leaf nodes with inverted order in the source and target sides, which are usually not captured by phrase-based models.
    Note that the reordering between lexical words and non-terminal leaf nodes is not considered here) and Discontinuous Phrase Rules (DPR: refers to these rules having at least one non-terminal leaf node between two lexicalized leaf nodes) in our tree sequence-based model (d = 4 and h = 6 ) Table 3 shows the contributions of SRR and DPR.
    It clearly indicates that SRRs are very effective in reordering structures, which improve performance by 1.45 (26.07-24.62) BLEU score.
    However, DPRs have less impact on performance in our tree sequence-based model.
    This seems in contradiction to the previous observations3 in literature.
    However, it is not surprising simply be
