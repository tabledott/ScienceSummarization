istic independence assumption.
    Example.
    The most informative subsumer for doctor and nurse is (health professional), and therefore that pairing contributes support to the sense of doctor as an M.D., but not a Ph.D.
    Similarly, it contributes support to the sense of nurse as a health professional, but not a nanny.
    The amount of support contributed by a pairwise comparison is proportional to how informative the most informative subsumer is.
    Therefore the evidence for the senses of a word will be influenced more by more similar words and less by less similar words.
    By the time this process is completed over all pairs, each sense of each word in the group has had the potential of receiving supporting evidence from a pairing with every other word in the group.
    The value assigned to that sense is then the proportion of support it did receive, out of the support possible.
    (The latter is kept track of by array normalization in the pseudocode.)
