e lengths l (l = 1.. min(i, K), where i points to the current considering character).
    Line 6 enumerates all POS&#8217;s for the word w spanning length l and ending at position i.
    Line 8 considers each candidate result in N-best list at prior position of the current word.
    Function D derives the candidate result from the word-POS pair p and the candidate q at prior position of p.
  
  
    We reported results from two set of experiments.
    The first was conducted to test the performance of the perceptron on segmentation on the corpus from SIGHAN Bakeoff 2, including the Academia Sinica Corpus (AS), the Hong Kong City University Corpus (CityU), the Peking University Corpus (PKU) and the Microsoft Research Corpus (MSR).
    The second was conducted on the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0 (CTB5.0) to test the performance of the cascaded model on segmentation and Joint S&amp;T.
    In all experiments, we use the averaged parameters for the perceptrons, and F-measure as the accuracy measure.
