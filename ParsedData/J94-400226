    The next class of errors involves antecedents that receive a low salience weighting owing to the fact that the evoking NP is embedded in a matrix NP or is in another structurally nonprominent position (such as object of an adverbial PP).
    The users you enroll may not necessarily be new to the system and may already have a user profile and a system distribution directory entry.
    &amp;ofc. checks for the existence of these objects and only creates them as necessary.
    Despite the general preference for intrasentential candidates, user.
    (1.2) is selected as the antecedent, since the only factor contributing to the salience weight of object.
    (2.8) is sentence recency.
    Selectional restrictions or statistically measured lexical preferences (see Section 5) could clearly help in at least some of these cases.
    In another class of cases, RAP fails because semantic/pragmatic information is required to identify the correct antecedent. conditions.
