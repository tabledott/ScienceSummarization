y resolves NPs dominating MWEs or NEs.
    Understanding base-NP structure is important, since otherwise parsers will propose nonsensical noun phrases like Force contract by default and pass them onto downstream components.
    For example, Question Answering (QA) systems need to supply an NP as the answer to a factoid question, often using a parser to identify candidate NPs to return to the user.
    If the parser never generates the correct sub-NP structure, then the system may return a nonsensical answer even though the correct dominating noun phrase has been found.
    Base-NP structure is also important for annotated data derived from the Penn Treebank.
    For instance, CCGbank (Hockenmaier, 2003) was created by semi-automatically converting the Treebank phrase structure to Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 2000) derivations.
    Since CCG derivations are binary branching, they cannot directly represent the flat structure of the Penn Treebank base-NPs.
