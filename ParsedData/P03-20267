rd classes, their root forms, five combinations of these (the targeted word, the one preceding and one following/ the targeted word and the one preceding/ the targeted word and the one following/ the targeted word and the two preceding/ the targeted word and the two following), and the first and last letters of the word.
    The Maximum Entropy (ME) model (Jaynes 1957) is a general technique that is used to estimate the probability distributions of data.
    The over-riding principle in ME is that when nothing is known, the distribution should be as uniform as possible, i.e., maximum entropy.
    We calculated the distribution of probabilities p(a,b) with this method when Eq.
    1 was satisfied and Eq.
    2 was maximized.
    We then selected the category with maximum probability, as calculated from this distribution of probabilities, to be the correct category.
    We assumed that the constraint of feature sets fi (i&#8806;j&#8806;k) was defined by Eq.
    1.
    This is where A is a set of categories and
