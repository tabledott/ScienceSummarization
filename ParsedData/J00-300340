    In the case of utterance duration, the measure correlates both with length in words and with overall speaking rate.
    The gender feature that classified speakers as either male or female was used to test for potential inadequacies in FO normalizations.
    Where appropriate, we included both raw features and values normalized by utterance and/or conversation.
    We also included features that are the output of the pitch accent and boundary tone event detector of Taylor (2000) (e.g., the number of pitch accents in the utterance).
    A complete description of prosodic features and an analysis of their usage in our models can be found in Shriberg et al. (1998).

    Decision trees allow the combination of discrete and continuous features, and
