tperforms the equivalent lexical association approach given the same information.
    Amongst all the comparisons performed in these experiments one stands out as exhibiting the greatest contrast.
    In all experiments the dependency model provides a substantial advantage over the adjacency model, even though the latter is more prevalent in proposals within the literature.
    This result is in accordance with the informal reasoning given in section 1.3.
    The model also has the further commendation that it predicts correctly the observed proportion of left-branching compounds found in two independently extracted test sets.
    In all, the most accurate technique achieved an accuracy of 81% as compared to the 67% achieved by guessing left-branching.
    Given the high frequency of occurrence of noun compounds in many texts, this suggests that the use of these techniques in probabilistic parsers will result in higher performance in broad coverage natural language processing.
