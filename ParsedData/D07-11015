			For simplicity, labels of the factors have been omitted.
			A first-ordermodel considers only ?h, m?.
			The second-order model of McDonald and Pereira (2006) considers ?h, m, ch?.
			For the PP attachment decision (factor in row 5), the higher-order model allows us to define features that relate the verb (?sold?)
			with the content word of the prepositional phrase (?U.S.?).
			second-order features through a function ?2(x, h, m, c) which maps a head, a modifierand a child in a feature vector in Rd2 . The param eters of the model are a collection of four vectors for each dependency label: wl1 ? Rd1 as in the first-order model; and wlh,wlmi and wlmo, all three in Rd2 and each associated to one of the adjacent dependencies in the factor.
			The score of a factor is: score2(w,x, ?h, m, l, ch, cmi, cmo?)
			= ?1(x, h, m) ? wl1 + ?2(x, h, m, ch) ? wlh + ?2(x,
