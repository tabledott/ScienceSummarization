for Trigrams), based on context statistics P(ti 14_1, ti_2) and lexical statistics P(tilwi) directly estimated from relative corpus frequencies.
    The Viterbi algorithm is used to determine the most probable tag sequence.
    Since this model has no facilities for handling unknown words, a Memory-Based system (see below) is used to propose distributions of potential tags for words not in the lexicon.
    The second system is the Transformation Based Learning system as described by Brill (19941; henceforth tagger R, for Rules).
    This 1 Brill's system is available as a collection of C programs and Perl scripts at ftp : //ftp . cs . jhu . edu/pub/brill/Programs/ RULE_BASED_TAGGER_V .

    Z system starts with a basic corpus annotation (each word is tagged with its most likely tag) and then searches through a space of transformation rules in order to reduce the discrepancy between its current annotation and the correct one (in our case 528 rules were learned).
    During tagging these ru
