text analyzers substantially faster.
    These methods are applicable not only to the NLP tasks but also to general machine learning tasks where training and test examples are represented in a binary vector.
    More specifically, we focus on a Polynomial Kernel of degree d, which can attain feature combinations that are crucial to improving the performance of tasks in NLP.
    Second, we introduce two fast classification algorithms for this kernel.
    One is PKI (Polynomial Kernel Inverted), which is an extension of Inverted Index in Information Retrieval.
    The other is PKE (Polynomial Kernel Expanded), where all feature combinations are explicitly expanded.
    By applying PKE, we can convert a kernel-based classifier into a simple and fast liner classifier.
    In order to build PKE, we extend the PrefixSpan (Pei et al., 2001), an efficient Basket Mining algorithm, to enumerate effective feature combinations from a set of support examples.
