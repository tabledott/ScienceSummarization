    Let maxrow(.) be an operator that operates row-wise on a matrix and sets all entries of a row to zero except the largest entry, which is set to 1.
    Then the algorithm is denoted as simple as this: By applying maxrow(.
    ), Dt-1 has exactly n non-zero entries.
    This causes the time-complexity to be dependent on the number of edges, namely O(k&#8226;|E|).
    In the worst case of a fully connected graph, this equals the time-complexity of MCL.
    A problem with the matrix CW process is that it does not necessarily converge to an iterationinvariant class matrix D, but rather to a pair of oscillating class matrices.
    Figure 5 shows an example.
    This is caused by the stepwise update of the class matrix.
    As opposed to this, the CW algorithm as outlined in figure 1 continuously updates D after the processing of each node.
    To avoid these oscillations, one of the following measures can be taken: While converging to the same limits, the continuous update strategy converges the fastest becaus
