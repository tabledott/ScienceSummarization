ls the total number of atomic properties.
    Consider our old example, where the preference order of atomic properties corresponds with the order in which they are listed, and where the same order extends to their negations, all of which are less preferred.
    Abbreviating B = BLACK, D = DOG, P = POODLE, and W = WHITE, we have P = (B, D, P, W, B, D, P, W).
    Now, if S = {c, d, e} and S = {c} (as before) are to be characterized, nothing eventful happens.
    In both cases, a description is found during Phase 1: P in the first case, B n P in the second.
    The situation gets more interesting if S = {a, b, d, e}, which triggers Phase 2.
    For instance, if positive literals precede negative literals, the properties relevant for Phase 2 might be ordered as follows: (BUD,BUP,BUW,DUP,DUW,PUW,BUD,BUP,BUW,DUB, DUP,DUW,PUB,PUD,PUW, WUB, WUD, WUP,BUD,BUP, BUW,DUP,DUW,PUW) During Phase 1, no property is selected, since the only property true of all elements in S = {a, b, d, e} is D, which fails to remove any distr
