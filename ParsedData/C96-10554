  We adopt the central thesis of Levin (1993), i.e., that the semantic class of a verb and its syntactic behav- ior are predictably related.
  We base our work on a correlation between semantic classes and patterns of grammar codes in the Longmans Dictionary of Con- temporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978).
  While the LDOCE has been used previously in automatic x- traction tasks (Alshawi, 1989; Farwell, Guthrie, and Wilks, 1993; Boguraev and Briscoe, 1989; ,Wilks et al., 1989; Wilks et al., 1990) these tasks are primarily con- cerned with the extraction of other types of informa- tion including syntactic phrase structure and broad ar- gument restrictions or with the derivation of semantic structures from definition analyses.
  The work of San- filippo and Poznanski (1992) is more closely related to our approach in that it attempts to recover a syntactic- semantic relation from machine-readable dictionaries.
  Itowever, they claim that the semantic lassification of verbs based on standard mac
