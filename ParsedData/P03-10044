ntation and Japanese Dependency Parsing show that PKI and PKE perform respectively 2 to 13 times and 30 to 300 times faster than standard kernel-based systems, without a discernible change in accuracy.
  
  
    Suppose we have a set of training data for a binary classification problem: (x1, y1), .
    .
    .
    , (xL, yL) xj E RN, yj E {+1, &#8722;1}, where xj is a feature vector of the j-th training sample, and yj is the class label associated with this training sample.
    The decision function of SVMs is defined by where: (A) &#966; is a non-liner mapping function from RN to RH (N &#171; H).
    (B) &#945;j, b E R, &#945;j &gt; 0.
    The mapping function &#966; should be designed such that all training examples are linearly separable in RH space.
    Since H is much larger than N, it requires heavy computation to evaluate the dot products &#966;(xi) &#183; &#966;(x) in an explicit form.
    This problem can be overcome by noticing that both construction of optimal parameter &#945;i (we will omit the de
