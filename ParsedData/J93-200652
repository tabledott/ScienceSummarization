hrase.
    Therefore, no model at all would be at least 50% accurate.
    In our test, many of the test cases involved three or more possible attachment points for the prepositional phrase, which provided a more realistic test.
    An interesting next step would be to combine these two probabilistic models (perhaps via linear weights) in order to get the benefit of domain-specific knowledge, as we have explored, and the benefits of domain-independent knowledge, as Hindle and Rooth have explored.
    The experiments on the effectiveness of finding core NPs using only local information were run by midsummer 1990.
    In fall 1990, another alternative, the Fast Partial Parser (FPP), which is a derivative of earlier work (de Marcken 1990), became available to us.
    It finds fragments using a stochastic part of speech algorithm and a nearly deterministic parser.
    It produces fragments averaging three to four words in length.
    Figure 9 shows an example output for the sentence.
