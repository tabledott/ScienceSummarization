thorough account is provided in Brown et al. (1991).
    We imagine that an English sentence E generates a French sentence F in two steps.
    First, each word in E independently generates zero or more French words.
    These words are then ordered to give a French sentence F. We denote the ith word of E by e, and the jth word of F by yi.
    (We employ yi rather than the more intuitive fi to avoid confusion with the feature function notation.)
    We denote the number of words in the sentence E by 1E1 and the number of words in the sentence F by IF 1.
    The generative process yields not only the French sentence F but also an association of the words of F with the words of E. We call this association an alignment, and denote it by A.
    An alignment A is parametrized by a sequence of IFI numbers al, with 1 &lt; a, &lt; IE l. For every word position j in F, aj is the word position in E of the English word that generates yl.
    Figure 4 depicts a typical alignment.
    The probability p(FIE) that F is the t
