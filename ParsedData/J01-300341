igh-frequency verbs (exploded, jumped, opened, played, rushed), we used the first 100 occurrences as the simplest way to collect the sample.
    In response to an anonymous reviewer's concern, we later verified that these counts were not different from counts obtained by random sampling of 100 VBD occurrences.
    A paired t-test of the two sets of counts (first 100 sampling and random sampling) indicates that the two sets of counts are not statistically different (t = 1.283, DF 4, p = 0.2687). and objects for a verb-also captures a &amp;quot;reciprocity&amp;quot; effect for some object-drop verbs (such as call), in which subjects and objects can be similar types of entities.
    Finally, although expected to be a redundant indicator of transitivity, PASS and VBN, unlike TRANS, have very similar values for unaccusative and object-drop verbs, indicating that their distributions are sensitive to factors we have not yet investigated.
    One issue we must address is how precisely the automatic counts reflect the
