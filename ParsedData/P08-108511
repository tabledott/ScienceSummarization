    Linear-Context-based p(t|w) approximation The method of Levinger et al. makes use of Hebrew inflection patterns in order to estimate context free approximation of p(t|w) by relating a word to its different inflections.
    However, the context in which a word occurs can also be very informative with respect to its POS-analysis (Sch&#168;utze, 1995).
    We propose a novel algorithm for estimating p(t|w) based on the contexts in which a word occurs.3 The algorithm starts with an initial p(t|w) estimate, and iteratively re-estimates: 3While we rely on the same intuition, our use of context differs from earlier works on distributional POS-tagging like (Sch&#168;utze, 1995), in which the purpose is to directly assign the possible POS for an unknown word.
    In contrast, our algorithm aims to improve the estimate for the whole distribution p(tIw), to be further disambiguated by the EM-HMM learner. where Z is a normalization factor, W is the set of all words in the corpus, C is the set of all contexts, an
