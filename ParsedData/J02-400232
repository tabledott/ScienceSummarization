s in running text were recognized, and self-citations were recognized and specifically marked up.
    (Linguistic) example sentences and example pseudocode were manually marked up, such that clean textual material (i.e., the running text of the article without interruptions) was isolated for automatic processing.
    The implementation uses the Text Tokenization Toolkit (TTT) software (Grover, Mikheev, and Matheson 1999).

    Annotators.
    Three task-trained annotators were used: Annotators A and B have degrees in cognitive science and speech therapy.
    They were paid for the experiment.
    Both are well-used to reading scientific articles for their studies and roughly understand the contents of the articles they annotated because of the closeness of their fields to computational linguistics.
    Annotator C is the first author.
