hen smoothing these estimates in order to deal with the sparse-data problems).
    See Gale et al. (to appear) for further details.
    At first, we thought that the method was completely dependent on the availability of parallel corpora for training.
    This has been a problem since parallel text remains somewhat difficult to obtain in large quantity, and what little is available is often fairly unbalanced and unrepresentative of general language.
    Moreover, the assumption that differences in translation correspond to differences in word-sense has always been somewhat suspect.
    Recently, Yarowsky (1992) has found a way to extend our use of the Bayesian techniques by training on the Roget's Thesaurus (Chapman, 1977)2 and Grolier's Encyclopedia (1991) instead of the Canadian Hansards, thus circumventing many of the objections to our use of the Hansards.
    Yarowsky (1992) inputs a 100-word context surrounding a polysemous word and scores each of the 1042 Roget Categories by: The program can also be run
