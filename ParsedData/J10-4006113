1xLW2 whose corresponding vectors in W1LxW2 have a cosine similarity over a given threshold.
    We leave this possibility to further work.
    Among the linguistic objects represented by the W1LxW2 vectors, we find the syntactic slots of verb frames.
    For instance, the vector labeled with the tuple (read, sbj&#8722;1) represents the subject slot of the verb read in terms of the distribution of its noun fillers, which label the dimensions of the space.
    We can use the W1LxW2 space to explore the semantic properties of syntactic frames, and to extract generalizations about the inner structure of lexico-semantic representations of the sort formal semanticists have traditionally been interested in.
    For instance, the high similarity between the object slot of kill and the subject slot of die might provide a distributional correlate to the classic cause(subj,die(obj)) analysis of killing by Dowty (1977) and many others.
    Measuring the cosine between the vectors of different syntactic slots of the same
