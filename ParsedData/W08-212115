    NomBank annotation (Meyers et al., 2004) uses essentially the same framework as PropBank to annotate arguments of nouns.
    Differences between PropBank and NomBank stem from differences between noun and verb argument structure; differences in treatment of nouns and verbs in the Penn Treebank; and differences in the sophistication of previous research about noun and verb argument structure.
    Only the subset of nouns that take arguments are annotated in NomBank and only a subset of the non-argument siblings of nouns are marked as ARGM.
    These limitations were necessary to make the NomBank task consistent and tractable.
    In addition, long distance dependencies of
