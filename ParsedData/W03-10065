 the PTB with fairly high accuracy.
    Furthermore, they show that this method can be used in conjunction with a parser to produce parses annotated with semantic labels, and that the parser outperforms a chunker.
    The features they use in their experiments can be listed as follows.
    Head Word (HW.)
    The predicate&#8217;s head word as well as the argument&#8217;s head word is used.
    Phrase Type.
    This feature represents the type of phrase expressing the semantic role.
    In Figure 3 phrase type for the argument prices is NP.
    Path.
    This feature captures the surface syntactic relation between the argument&#8217;s constituent and the predicate.
    See Figure 3 for an example.
    Position.
    This binary feature represents whether the argument occurs before or after the predicate in the sentence.
    Voice.
    This binary feature represents whether the predicate is syntactically realized in either passive or active voice.
    Notice that for the exception of voice, the features solely
