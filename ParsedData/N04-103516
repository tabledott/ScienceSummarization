mal graph fragments, as shown in Figure 8.
    Thus, the entire set of frontier graph fragments (and all rules derivable from these fragments) can be computed systematically as follows: compute the set of minimal frontier graph fragments, compute the set of graph fragments resulting from composing 2 minimal frontier graph fragments, compute the set of graph fragments resulting from composing 3 minimal graph fragments, etc.
    In this way, the rules derived from the minimal frontier graph fragments can be regarded as a basis for all other rules derivable from frontier graph fragments.
    Furthermore, we conjecture that the set of rules derivable from frontier graph fragments is in fact equivalent to PA(S, T).
    Thus we have boiled down the problem of extracting complex rules to the following simple problem: find the set of minimal frontier graph fragments of a given alignment graph.
    The algorithm is a two-step process, as shown below.
    Step 1 can be computed in a single traversal of the alignment gr
