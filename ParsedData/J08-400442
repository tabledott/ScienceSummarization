    This reproducibility is measured by &#960;.
    But whenever the optimistic and pessimistic analysts agree on a recommendation for a particular stock, whether it is &#8220;buy&#8221; or &#8220;sell,&#8221; the confidence that this is indeed the right decision is higher than the same advice from two like-minded analysts.
    This is why &#954; &#8220;rewards&#8221; biased annotators: it is not a matter of reproducibility (reliability) but rather of trustworthiness (validity).
    Having said this, we should point out that, first, in practice the difference between &#960; and &#954; doesn&#8217;t often amount to much (see discussion in Section 4).
    Moreover, the difference becomes smaller as agreement increases, because all the points of agreement contribute toward making the coder marginals similar (it took a lot of experimentation to create data for Table 4 so that the values of &#960; and &#954; w
