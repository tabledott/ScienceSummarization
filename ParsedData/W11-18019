ract renaming pairs of Bacillus subtilis gene/protein names from PubMed abstracts, motivated by discrepancies between nomenclature databases that interfere with search and complicate normalization.
    REN relations partially overlap several concepts: explicit renaming mentions, synonymy, and renaming deduced from biological proof.
    While the task is related to synonymy relation extraction (Yu and Agichtein, 2003), it has a novel definition of renaming, one name permanently replacing the other.
  
  
    Table 2 shows the task schedule, split into two phases to allow the use of supporting task results in addressing the main tasks.
    In recognition of their higher complexity, a longer development period was arranged for the main tasks (3 months vs 7 weeks).
  
  
    BioNLP-ST 2011 received 46 submissions from 24 teams (Table 3).
    While seven teams participated in multiple tasks, only one team, UTurku, submitted final results to all the tasks.
    The remaining 17 teams participated in only single task
