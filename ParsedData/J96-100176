ar, taken from the aligned Hansards.
    Table 8 illustrates the range of translations which Champollion produces.
    Flexible collocations are shown with ellipsis points (... ) indicating where additional, variable words could appear.
    These examples show cases where a two word collocation is translated as one word (e.g., health insurance), a two word collocation is translated as three words (e.g., employment equity), and how words can be inverted in the translation (e.g., additional costs).
    In this section, we discuss the design of the separate tests and our evaluation methodology, and present the results of our evaluation.
    We carried out three tests with Champollion using two database corpora and three sets of source collocations.
    The first database corpus (DB1) consists of 8 months of Hansards aligned data taken from 1986 (16 megabytes, 3.5 million words) and the second database corpus (DB2) consists of all of the 1986 and 1987 transcripts of the Canadian Parliament (a total of approximate
