ask was developed and the best systems achieved impressive accuracy (with an F-measure approaching 95%).
    What should be underlined here is that these systems were trained for a specific domain and a particular language (English), typically making use of hand-coded rules, taggers, parsers and semantic lexicons.
    Indeed, most named entity recognizers that have been published either use tagged text, perform syntactical and morphological analysis or use semantic information for contextual clues.
    Even the systems that do not make use of extensive knowledge about a particular language, such as Nominator (Choi et al., 1997), still typically use large data files containing lists of names, exceptions, personal and organizational identifiers.
    Our aim has been to build a maximally languageindependent system for both named-entity identification and classification, using minimal information about the source language.
    The applicability of AI-style algorithms and supervised methods is limited in the multi
