ts, in aggregate thescores were highly correlated with those found by Ruben stein and Goodenough (at ? = .944 by our calculation).Resnik (1999) replicated the Miller and Charles experiment and reported that the average per-subject linear cor relation on the dataset was around r = 0.90, providing a rough upper bound on any system?s linear correlation performance with respect to the Miller and Charles data.
			Figure 3 shows that the ZKL measure on the MarkovLink model has linear correlation coefficient r = .903?at the limit of human inter-annotator agreement.Recently, a larger set of word relatedness judg ments was obtained by (Finkelstein et al, 2002) in the WordSimilarity-353 (WS-353) collection.
			Despite the collection?s name, the study instructed participants to score word pairs for relatedness (on a scale of 0 to10), which is in contrast to the similarity judgments re quested of the Miller and Charles (MC) and Rubenstein and Goodenough (RG) participants.
			For this reason, the WordSimilarity-353 data c
