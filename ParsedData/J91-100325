 between two entities referred to in discourse.
    The example of metonymy they show is &amp;quot;after the alarm,&amp;quot; which really means after the sounding of the alarm.
    Hobbs and Martin seem to assume a selection restrictions approach to metonymy because metonymy is sought after a selection restrictions violation (ibid., p. 521).
    In their approach, solving metonymy involves finding: [1] the referents for 'after' and 'alarm' in the domain model, which are after(e0, a) and alarm(a); [2] an implicit entity z to which 'after' really refers, which is after(eo, z); and [3] the implicit relation between the implicit entity z and the referent of 'alarm,' q(z, a).
    Like Hobbs and Martin (1987), Stallard (1987) translates language into logical form.
    Stallard argues that with nominal compounds and metonymies &amp;quot;the problem is determining the binary relation which has been 'elided' from the utterance&amp;quot; (ibid., p. 180) and suggests shifting the argument place of a predicate &amp;quot
