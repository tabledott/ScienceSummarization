 of children (E = 2 here).
    Heads (208,599) The instances of this schema are tuples of head-to-head dependencies, as mentioned above.
    The category of the node that is the least common ancestor of the head and the dependent is included in the instance (this provides a crude distinction between different classes of arguments).
    The parameters of this schema are whether the heads involved are lexical or functional heads, the number of heads in an instance, and whether the lexical item or just the head&#8217;s part of speech are included in the instance.
    LezFunHeads (2,299) The instances of this feature are the pairs of parts of speech of the lexical head and the functional head of nodes in parse trees.
    WProj (158,771) The instances of this schema are preterminals together with the categories of E of their closest maximal projection ancestors.
    The parameters of this schema control the number E of maximal projections, and whether the preterminals and the ancestors are lexicalized.
