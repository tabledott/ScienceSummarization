ch assumes that activating a node corresponding to, say, the concept THROW will activate the &amp;quot;physical object&amp;quot; sense of ball, whose activation would in turn inhibit the activation of other senses of ball, such as &amp;quot;social event.&amp;quot; Quillian's semantic network, described above, is the earliest implementation of a spreading activation network used for word sense disambiguation.
    A similar model is implemented by Cottrell and Small (1983); see also Cottrell (1985).
    In both of these models, each node in the network represents a specific word or concept.'
    Waltz and Pollack (1985) and Bookman (1987) hand-encode sets of semantic &amp;quot;microfeatures,&amp;quot; corresponding to fundamental semantic distinctions (animate/inanimate, edible/inedible, threatening/safe, etc.
    ), characteristic durations of events (second, minute, hour, day, etc.
    ), locations (city, country, continent, etc.
    ), and other similar distinctions, in their networks.
