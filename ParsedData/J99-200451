ines them by adjunction and substitution operations to derive a parse of the sentence.
    The grammar of XTAG has been used to parse sentences from ATIS, IBM Manual and WSJ corpora (TAG-Group 1995).
    The resulting XTAG corpus contains sentences from these domains along with all the derivations for each sentence.
    The derivations provide In this section, we define the key properties of LTAGs: lexicalization, Extended Domain of Locality (EDL), and factoring of recursion from the domain of dependency (FRD), and discuss how these properties are realized in natural language grammars written in LTAGs.
    A more detailed discussion about these properties is presented in Joshi (1985, 1987), Kroch and Joshi (1985), Schabes, Abeille, and Joshi (1988), and Joshi and Schabes (1996).
    A grammar is lexicalized if it consists of: This property proves to be linguistically crucial since it establishes a direct link between the lexicon and the syntactic structures defined in the grammar.
    In fact, in lexicalized
