ent rate.
  The any-consistent rate is 90% when we require the structure and the labels to agree and 96% when unla- beled bracketing is required.
  These results are obtained on 760 sentences from 7 t0 17 words long from test ma- terial that has never been seen by the grammarian.
  The parse base is 1.35 parses/word.
  This translates to about 23 parses for a 12-word sentence.
  The unlabeled Viterbi rate stands at 64% and the labeled Viterbi rate is 60%.
  While we believe that the above Vitevbi rate is close if not the state-of-the-art performance, there is room for improvement by using a more refined statistical model to achieve the labeled arty-cortsistertt ra e of 90% with this grammar.
  There is a significant gap between the labeled Viterbi and arty-cortsistent ra es: 30 percentage points.
  Instead of the usual approach where a grammarian tries to fine tune the grammar in the hope of improving the Viterbi rate we use the combination of a large Treebank and the resulting derivation histories with a dec
