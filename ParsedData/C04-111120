oach).
			WordNet consistently generated higher precision relationships although both algorithms approach WordNet quality on 6GB (the pattern based algorithm even surpasses WordNet precision on 15GB).
			Furthermore, WordNet only generated a hyponym 40% of the time.
			This is mostly due to the lack of proper noun coverage in WordNet.
			On the 6 GB corpus, the co-occurrence approach took approximately 47 single Pentium-4 2.5 GHz processor days to complete, whereas it took the pattern-based approach only four days to complete on 6 GB and 10 days on 15 GB.
			5.3 Recall.
			The co-occurrence model has higher precision than the pattern-based algorithm on most datasets.
