 via parameter optimization.
    We did not get as deeply into L&#215;W1W2 space as we did with the other views, but our preliminary results on qualia harvesting suggest at least that looking at links as Links selected in all folds of the leave-one-out procedure to extract links typical of each qualia role.
  
  
    n is q, q is n, q become n, n coord q, n have q, n use q, n with q, n without q q coord n, q have n, n in q, n provide q, q such as n
  
  
    q after n, q alongside n, q as n, q before n, q behind n, q by n, q like n, q obj n, q besides n, q during n, q in n, q obj n, n sbj intr q, q through n, q via n q out n, q over n, q since n, q unlike n LxW1W2 vectors might be useful for feature selection in W1W2xL or for tasks in which we are given a set of pairs, and we have to find links that can function as verbal labels for the relation between the word pairs (Turney 2006a).
    Dimensionality reduction techniques such as the (truncated) SVD approximate a sparse co-occurrence matrix with a denser low
