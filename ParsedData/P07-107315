 new A method for eliminating this type of bias is intro- weighting scheme. duced in Section 5.1.
    If all the word weights are set to 1, then the new &#9632; [Type II Bias] While Type I bias is due to words kernel is equivalent to the old one.
    What we want, that are correlated with the arguments of a relation however, is a set of weights where words that are instance, the Type II bias is caused by words that correlated with either of the two arguments are given are specific to the relation instance itself.
    Using lower weights.
    For any word, the decrease in weight 579 should reflect the degree of correlation between that word and the two arguments.
    Before showing the formula used for computing the word weights, we first introduce some notation: The quantity P(wjX.a1 V X.a2) &#8226; C(X) represents the expected number of sentences in which w would occur, if the only causes were X.a1 or X.a2, independent of each other.
    We want to discard this quantity from the total number of occurrences C
