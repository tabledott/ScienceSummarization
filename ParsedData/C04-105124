hat exhibit lexical and short phrasal alternations that can be aligned with considerable success.
			Given a large dataset and a well-motivated clustering of documents, useful datasets can be gleaned even without resorting to more sophisticated techniques Figure 2.

			Mean number of instances of paraphrase phenomena per sentence (such as Multiple Sequence Alignment, as employed by Barzilay &amp; Lee 2003).
			However, there is a disparity between the kinds of paraphrase alternations that we need to be able to align and those that we can already align well using current SMT techniques.
			Based solely on the criterion of word AER, the L12 data would seem to be superior to the F2 data as a source of paraphrase knowledge.
			Hand evaluation, though, indicates that many of the phenomena that we are interested in learning may be absent from this L12 d
