L rate of 5.9%.
    The difference in NULL rates, however, raises some doubts that the numbers are truly measuring the same thing.
    There is also a small body of work on parsing disfluent sentences [8,11].
    Hindle&#8217;s early work [11] does not give a formal evaluation of the parser&#8217;s accuracy.
    The recent work of Schubert and Core [8] does give such an evaluation, but on a different corpus (from Rochester Trains project).
    Also, their parser is not statistical and returns parses on only 62% of the strings, and 32% of the strings that constitute sentences.
    Our statistical parser naturally parses all of our corpus.
    Thus it does not seem possible to make a meaningful comparison between the two systems.
  
  
    We have presented a simple architecture for parsing transcribed speech in which an edited word detector is first used to remove such words from the sentence string, and then a statistical parser trained on edited speech (with the edited nodes removed) is used to parse the tex
