 the Treebank, strictly right-branching trees were created for all base-NPs.
    This has an unwelcome effect when conjunctions occur within an NP (Figure 1).
    An additional grammar rule is needed just to get a parse, but it is still not correct (Hockenmaier, 2003, p. 64).
    The awkward conversion results in bracketing (a) which should be (b): We have previously experimented with using NEs to improve parsing performance on CCGbank.
    Due to the mis-alignment of NEs and right-branching NPs, the increase in performance was negligible.
  
  
    The NP bracketing task has often been posed in terms of choosing between the left or right branching structure of three word noun compounds: Most approaches to the problem use unsupervised methods, based on competing association strength between two of the words in the compound (Marcus, 1980, p. 253).
    There are two possible models to choose from: dependency or adjacency.
    The dependency model compares the association between words 1-2 to words 1-3, while th
