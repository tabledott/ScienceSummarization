tagset were selected on the basis of their importance to the potential users, as estimated from a number of in-depth interviews with interested parties in the Netherlands.
    The Wotan tagset is not only very large (233 base tags, leading to 341 tags when counting each ditto tag separately), but furthermore contains distinctions that are very difficult for automatic taggers, such as verb transitivity, syntactic use of adjectives, and the recognition of multitoken units.
    It has an average ambiguity of 7.46 tags per token in the corpus.
    For our experiments, we also designed a simplification of the tagset, dubbed WotanLite, which no longer contains the most problematic distinctions.
    WotanLite has 129 tags (with a complement of ditto tags leading to a total of 173) and an average ambiguity of 3.46 tags per token.
    An example of Wotan tagging is given below (only underlined parts remain in WotanLite):&amp;quot; first part of singular neutral case proper noun second part of singular neutral case pro
