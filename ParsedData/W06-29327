n find the highest scoring label sequence with Viterbi&#8217;s algorithm.
    We use the MIRA online learner to set the weights (Crammer and Singer, 2003; McDonald et al., 2005a) since we found it trained quickly and provide good performance.
    Furthermore, it made the system homogeneous in terms of learning algorithms since that is what is used to train our unlabeled parser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
    Of course, we have to define a set of suitable features.
    We used the following: dependent have identical values?
    Is this the left/rightmost dependent for the head?
    Is this the first dependent to the left/right of the head?
    Various conjunctions of these were included based on performance on held-out data.
    Note that many of these features are beyond the scope of the edge based factorizations of the unlabeled parser.
    Thus a joint model of parsing and labeling could not easily include them without some form of re-ranking or approximate parameter estimation.
