te senses, others are not mentioned at all).
    It would be straightforward to augment it with pointers indicating which senses are basic to a class of verbs and which can be generated automatically, and include corresponding syntactic information.
    Figure 3 shows intersective classes involving two classes of verbs of manner of motion (run and roll verbs) and a class of verbs of existence (meander verbs).
    Roll and run verbs have semantic components describing a manner of motion that typically, though not necessarily, involves change of location.
    In the absence of a goal or path adjunct they do not specify any direction of motion, and in some cases (e.g., float, bounce) require the adjunct to explicitly specify any displacement at all.
    The two classes differ in that roll verbs relate to manners of motion characteristic of inanimate entities, while run verbs describe manners in which animate entities can move.
    Some manner of motion verbs allow a transitive alternation in addition to the basi
