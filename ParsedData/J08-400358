er R. The symbols occurring in filled cells indicate for which parsing algorithms the feature is active, where S stands for arcstandard stack-based, E for arc-eager stack-based, N for non-projective list-based, and P for projective list-based.
    Features that are used for some but not all algorithms are typically not meaningful for all algorithms.
    For example, a right dependent of the first node in the buffer R can only exist (at decision time) when using the arc-standard stackbased algorithm.
    Hence, this feature is inactive for all other algorithms.
    The SVM classifiers were trained with a quadratic kernel K(xi, xj) = (-yxTi xj + r)2 and LIBSVM&#8217;s built-in one-versus-one strategy for multi-class classification, converting symbolic features to numerical ones using the standard technique of binarization.
    The parameter settings were -y = 0.2 and r = 0 for the kernel parameters, C = 0.5 for the penalty parameter, and c = 1.0 for the termination criterion.
    These settings were extrapolate
