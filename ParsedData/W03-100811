ts for individual constituents while making certain independence assumptions necessary for efficient probability estimation.
    In particular, we assume that sets of roles appear independent of their linear order, and that the features F of a constituents are independent of other constituents&#8217; features given the constituent&#8217;s role.
    In the CCG version, we replace the features above with corresponding features based on both the sentence&#8217;s CCG derivation tree (shown in Figure 1) and the CCG predicate-argument relations extracted from it (shown in Table 1).
    The parse tree path feature, designed to capture grammatical relations between constituents, is replaced with a feature defined as follows: If there is a dependency in the predicate-argument structure of the CCG derivation between two words w and w', the path feature from w to w' is defined as the lexical category of the functor, the argument slot i occupied by the argument, plus an arrow (&#8592; or &#8594;) to indicate whether w or
