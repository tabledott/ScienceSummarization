a baseline in which Testing set performance on the best models for each MeSH level Levels of the MeSH Hierarchy the algorithm guesses yields about 5% accuracy.
    We see that our method is a significant improvement over the tabular logistic-regression-based approach, which yields an accuracy of only 31 percent.
    Additionally, despite the significant reduction in raw information content as compared to the lexical representation, the MeSH-based neural network performs as well as the lexical-based neural network.
    (And we again stress that the lexical-based neural network is not a viable option for larger domains.)
    Figure 2 shows the results for each relation.
    MeSH-based generalization does better on some relations (for example 14 and 15) and Lexical on others (7, 22).
    It turns out that the test set for relationship 7 (&#8220;Produces on a genetic level&#8221;) is dominated by NCs containing the words alleles and mrna and that all the NCs in the training set containing these words are assigned
