r of clusters of Random was chosen to be roughly equal to the average number of senses in the GS.
    This baseline is executed five times and the results are averaged.
    Table 4 shows the V-Measure (VM) performance of the 26 systems participating in the task.
    The last column shows the number of induced clusters of each system in the test set.The MFS baseline has a V-Measure equal to 0, since by definition its completeness is 1 and homogeneity is 0.
    All systems outperform this baseline, apart from one, whose V-Measure is equal to 0.
    Regarding the Random baseline, we observe that 17 perform better, which indicates that they have learned useful information better than chance.
    Table 4 also shows that V-Measure tends to favour systems producing a higher number of clusters than the number of GS senses, although VMeasure does not increase monotonically with the number of clusters increasing.
    For that reason, we introduced the second unsupervised evaluation measure (paired F-Score) that penalis
