006) approximate the expectation of log BLEU score.
    In both cases, a linear metric makes it easier to compute the expectation.
    While we have applied lattice MBR decoding to the approximate BLEU score, we note that our procedure (Section 3) is applicable to other gain functions which can be decomposed as a sum of local gain functions.
    In particular, our framework might be useful with translation metrics such as TER (Snover et al., 2006) or METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007).
    In contrast to a phrase-based SMT system, a syntax based SMT system (e.g.
    Zollmann and Venugopal (2006)) can generate a hypergraph that represents a generalized translation lattice with words and hidden tree structures.
    We believe that our lattice MBR framework can be extended to such hypergraphs with loss functions that take into account both BLEU scores as well as parse tree structures.
    Lattice and Forest based search and training procedures are not yet common in statistical machine translation.
    However, the
