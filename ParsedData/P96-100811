mantic components of these nodes are considered independently.
    Under these assumptions, the probability of a slot fill operation is: and the probability P(S I FT, 7) is simply the product of all such slot fill operations in the augmented tree.
    Transition probabilities are estimated from a training corpus of augmented trees.
    Unlike probabilities in the parsing model, there obviously is not sufficient training data to estimate slot fill probabilities directly.
    Instead, these probabilities are estimated by statistical decision trees similar to those used in the Spatter parser (Magerman 1995).
    Unlike more common decision tree classifiers, which simply classify sets of conditions, statistical decision trees give a probability distribution over all possible outcomes.
    Statistical decision trees are constructed in a two phase process.
    In the first phase, a decision tree is constructed in the standard fashion using entropy reduction to guide the construction process.
    This phase is the s
