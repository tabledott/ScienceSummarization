to the chart in Figure 1.
    In general, chart parsing cannot support strategies that would create active edges by reducing the symbols in the right-hand side of a rule in any arbitrary order.
    This is because an active edge must correspond to a contiguous sequence of analyzed symbols.
    Definite clause proof procedures do not have this limitation.
    For example, it is very simple to define a strategy, &amp;quot;head word narsing&amp;quot;2 (McCord, 1080), which would use the reduction rule to Each arc in the chart is labeled with the number of a clause in the proof.
    In each clause that corresponds to a chart arc, two literal arguments correspond to the two endpoints of the arc.
    These arguments have been underlined in the derivation.
    Notice how the endpoint arguments are the two string arguments in the head for unit clauses (passive edges) but, in the case of nonunit clauses (passive edges), are the first string argument in the head and the first in the leftmost literal in the body.
