CG parser can directly build derived structures, including longrange dependencies.
    These derived structures can be of any form we like&#8212;for example, they could in principle be standard Penn Treebank structures.
    Since we are interested in dependency-based parser evaluation, our parser currently builds dependency structures.
    Furthermore, since we want to model the dependencies in such structures, the probability model is defined over these structures rather than the derivation.
    The training and testing material for this CCG parser is a treebank of dependency structures, which have been derived from a set of CCG derivations developed for use with another (normal-form) CCG parser (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b).
    The treebank of derivations, which we call CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a), was in turn derived (semi-)automatically from the handannotated Penn Treebank.
  
  
    In CCG, most language-specific aspects of the grammar are specified in the lexicon, in the form of synta
