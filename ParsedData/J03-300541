han the NANTC coefficient (t(87) = 1.97, p &lt; .05; t(87) = 1.81, p &lt; .05).
    For the noun-noun bigrams, the AltaVista coefficient was higher than the NANTC coefficient (t(87) = 1.64, p &lt; .05), but the Google coefficient was not significantly different from the NANTC coefficient.
    For verb-object bigrams, the difference was significant for both search engines (t(87) = 2.74, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 2.38, p &lt; .01).
    In sum, for all three types of bigrams, the correlation coefficients achieved with AltaVista were significantly higher than the ones achieved by either the BNC or the NANTC.
    Google counts outperformed corpus counts for all bigrams with the exception of adjective-noun counts from the BNC and noun-noun counts from the NANTC.
    The bottom panel of Table 11 shows the correlation coefficients obtained by comparing log-transformed judgments with log-transformed Web counts for unseen adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb-object bigrams.
    We observe that the Web counts consistently show
