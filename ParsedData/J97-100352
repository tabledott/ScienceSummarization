s bi and b2, the score's x-axis coordinate falls between token-sequences i and i + 1.
    Rather than plotting a token-sequence number on the x-axis, the token-sequence gap number i is plotted instead. tion version of scoring is the ratio of new words in an interval divided by the length of that interval.
    Tokenization is as described above, eliminating stop words and performing morphological analysis.
    A score is then assigned to a token-sequence gap as follows: the number of never-yet-seen words in the token-sequence to the left of the gap is added to the number of never-yet-seen words in the token-sequence to the right, and this number is divided by the total number of tokens in the two token-sequences, or w * 2.
    Since in these experiments w is set to 20, this yields an interval length of 40, which is close to the parameter 35 suggested as most useful in (Youmans 1991).
    As in the block version of the algorithm, the score is plotted at the token-sequence gap, and scores can range from 0 to 1,
