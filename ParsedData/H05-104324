e.Given word w, label L, relationship type T and neigh borhood label assignment Ak, let NT represent the subsetof w?s neighbors connected to w through a type T rela tionship.
			The feature fT computes the probability that w?s label is L given the labels assigned by Ak to wordsin NT . Using Bayes?s Law and assuming that these la bels are independent given l(w), we have the following formula for fT at iteration m: fT (w,L,Ak,T )(m) = P (l(w) = L)(m)?
			|NT |Y j=1 P (Lj |l(w) = L) P (Lj |l(w) = L) is the probability that word wj has label Lj if wj and w are linked by a relationship of type T and w has label L. We make the simplifying assumption that this probability is constant and depends only of T , L and L?, not of the particular words wj and w. For each tuple (T , L, Lj), L,Lj ? {pos, neg, neutral}, OPINE buildsa probability table using a small set of bootstrapped pos itive, negative and neutral words.
