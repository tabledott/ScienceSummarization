s phase.
    The results of the experiment reported in the last section suggest that syntactic peculiarities of a sublanguage or corpus surface quite rapidly, so that manual additions to the grammar during the training phase are practical.
    However, lexical idiosyncrasies are far less likely to be exhausted during the training phase, suggesting that it will be necessary to develop an automatic method of dealing with them.
    In addition, the current system does not take account of differing frequencies of occurrence of lexical entries; for example, in the LOB corpus the verb believe occurs with a finite sentential complement in 90% of citations, although it is grammatical with at least five further patterns of complementation.
    This type of lexical information, which will very likely vary between sublanguages, should be integrated into the probabilistic model.
    This will be straightforward in terms of the model, since it merely involves associating probabilities with each distinct lexical entry for
