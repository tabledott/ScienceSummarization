ntic relations described above by querying the Web with Google for lexico-syntactic patterns indicative of each relation.
    Our approach has two stages.
    First, we identify pairs of highly associated verbs co-occurring on the Web with sufficient frequency using previous work by Lin and Pantel (2001), as described in Section 4.4.
    Next, for each verb pair, we tested lexico-syntactic patterns, calculating a score for each possible semantic relation as described in Section 4.2.
    Finally, as described in Section 4.3, we compare the strengths of the individual semantic relations and, preferring the most specific and then strongest relations, output a consistent set as the final output.
    As a guide to consistency, we use a simple theory of semantics indicating which semantic relations are subtypes of other ones, and which are compatible and which are mutually exclusive.
    The lexico-syntactic patterns were manually selected by examining pairs of verbs in known semantic relations.
    They were refin
