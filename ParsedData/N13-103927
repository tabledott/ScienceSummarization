in traditional dictionaries.
    We constructed a dictionary by lowercasing the union of the ispell &#8216;American&#8217;, &#8216;British&#8217;, and &#8216;English&#8217; dictionaries, plus the standard Unix words file from Webster&#8217;s Second International dictionary, totalling 260,985 word types.
    After excluding tokens defined by the gold standard as punctuation, URLs, at-mentions, or emoticons,21 22% of DAILY547&#8217;s tokens do not appear in this dictionary.
    Without clusters, they are very difficult to classify (only 79.2% accuracy), but adding clusters generates a 5.7 point improvement&#8212;much larger than the effect on in-dictionary tokens (Table 3).
    Varying the amount of unlabeled data.
    A tagger that only uses word clusters achieves an accuracy of 88.6% on the OCT27 development set.22 We created several clusterings with different numbers of unlabeled tweets, keeping the number of clusters constant at 800.
    As shown in Fig.
