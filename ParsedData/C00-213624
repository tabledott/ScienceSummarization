  There are many directions in which the work reported here needs to be extended: ?
  nsing larger training corpora, in order to find less frequent exanlplcs, and in that way hopefully exceeding the i)erfornlancc of our best hand-trained system ?
  cat)luring the word classes which are gen- erated as a by-product of our pattern dis- covery 1)rocedure (in a manner similar to (Riloff and ,Jones, 1999)) and using them to discover less frequent )atterns in subse- quent iterations - evaluating the effectiveness of the discov- cry procedure on other scenarios.
