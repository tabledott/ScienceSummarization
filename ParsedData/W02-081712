sion on the instances in the disagreement set justifies referring to these as &#8220;hard to tag&#8221;.
    In Open Mind Word Expert, these are the instances that are presented to the users for tagging in the active learning stage.
    Collecting from the general public holds the promise of providing much data at low cost.
    It also makes attending to two aspects of data collection more important: (1) ensuring contribution quality, and (2) making the contribution process engaging to the contributors.
    We have several steps already implemented and have additional steps we propose to ensure quality.
    First, redundant tagging is collected for each item.
    Open Mind Word Expert currently uses the following rules in presenting items to volunteer contributors: Two tags per item.
    Once an item has two tags associated with it, it is not presented for further tagging.
    One tag per item per contributor.
    We allow contributors to submit tagging either anonymously or having logged in.
