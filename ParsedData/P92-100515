tes, but the precise nature of the salience relation and the way it changes during a discourse are not important for the evaluation rules for QLF given here.
    The intuitive motivation for S is that the category in an unresolved QLF expression restricts the set of possible referents for that expression.
    S is discussed further in Section 5.
    We are now in position to present the evaluation rules, which we number Qi, Q2, etc.
    For standard connectives we have the obvious evaluation rules, for example, Two rules applicable to a formula F containing a term with uninstantiated referent and quantifier meta-variables: A is term such that S(C,A).
    Q6 W(F,v) if W(F[Q/_q, where: F is a formula containing the term T=term(I,C,R,_q,_r), and Q is a quantifier such that S(C,Q).
    (The substitutions for the meta-variables _r and _q are to be read as part of the evaluation rule.)
    A rule applicable to a formula F in which a (possibly unscoped) quantified term occurs: We also need a trivial rule for a formu
