on to rewrite the formula for the within-level variance.
    D&#945;o, the observed disagreement for &#945;, is defined as twice the variance within the levels in order to get rid of the factor 2 in the denominator; we also simplify the formula by using the multiplier nikanika for identical categories&#8212;this is allowed because dkk = 0 for all k. We perform the same simplification for the total variance, where nk stands for the total number of times the value k is assigned to any item by any coder.
    The expected disagreement for &#945;, D&#945;e, is twice the total variance.
    Because both expected and observed disagreement are twice the respective variances, the coefficient &#945; retains the same form when expressed with the disagreement values.
    Now that &#945; has been expressed without explicit reference to means, differences, and squares, it can be generalized to a variety of coding schemes in which the labels cannot be interpreted as numerical values: All one has to do is to replace the squa
