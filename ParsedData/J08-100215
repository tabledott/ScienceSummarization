ughter functions represent immediate relations of conjunctive and disjunctive nodes.
    By selecting a conjunctive node as a child of each disjunctive node, we can extract a tree consisting of conjunctive nodes from a feature forest.
    A feature forest. nodes as its daughters.
    The feature forest in Figure 1 represents a set of 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 unpacked trees shown in Figure 2.
    For example, by selecting the left-most conjunctive node at each disjunctive node, we extract an unpacked tree (c1, c2, c4, c6).
    An unpacked tree is represented as a set of conjunctive nodes.
    Generally, a feature forest represents an exponential number of trees with a polynomial number of nodes.
    Thus, complete structures, such as tag sequences and parse trees with ambiguities, can be represented in a tractable form.
    Feature functions are defined over conjunctive nodes.1 Definition 3 (Feature function for feature forests) A feature function for a feature forest is: Hence, together with feature functions, a feature
