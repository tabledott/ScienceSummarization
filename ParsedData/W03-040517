by taking the first 100 as ordered lexically.
    This may have biased the results somewhat towards unreliable web pages, since pages with numeric addresses tend to be newer and more transient.
    We evaluated two guanularities of feature extraction.
    The small feature set uses high precision rules to extract occupation (occ), birthday (brthyr), spouse, birth location (brthloc), and school.
    The large feature set adds higher recall (and therefore noisier) patterns for the previous relationships and as well as parent/child relationships.
    As can be seen from the table, the highest performing system combines proper nouns, relevant words, and the high precision extracted features (nnp+feat+mi and nnp+feat+tfidf).
    The extended features (nnp+feat+extfeat+mi) do not give additional benefit to this combination.
    As can be seen from the table, the large feature set yields better overall performance than the smaller feature set.
    This suggests that the increased coverage outweighs the introduced no
