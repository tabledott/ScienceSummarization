morphological regularities.
    In our approach, we do not require large amounts of annotated text but employ fully automatic statistical learning using a pre-existing general-purpose lexicon mapped to a particular tag set and word-frequency distribution collected from a raw corpus.
    The proposed technique is targeted to the acquisition of both morphological and ending-guessing rules, which then can be applied cascadingly using the most accurate guessing rules first.
    The rule induction process is guided by a thorough guessing-rule evaluation methodology that employs precision, recall, and coverage as evaluation metrics.
    In the rest of the paper we first introduce the kinds of guessing rules to be induced and then present a semi-unsupervised' statistical rule induction technique using data derived from the CELEX lexical database (Burnage 1990).
    Finally we evaluate the induced guessing rules by removing all the hapax words from the lexicon and tagging the Brown Corpus (Francis and Kucera 1982) by
