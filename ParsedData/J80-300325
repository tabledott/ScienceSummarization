epresentation of the world and of the operators.
    This view (as developed in Sacerdoti [1973, 1975], for example) allows plans constructed at one level of detail to be expanded to a lower level through the bodies of their constituent acts.
    As noted earlier, the agent of an action must believe that its precondition is true to believe that his executing the action will succeed.
    For agent A to plan that agent S should perform action ACT, A must achieve that S should believe that the precondition of ACT holds, and S's beliefs should not be inconsistent with A's, i.e. it must be true that BA(KNOW(S,P)), where P is the precondition of ACT.
    We assume that an agent cannot do an action without wanting to do that action.
    Thus a precondition of every action ACT by an agent A is that WA(ACT(A)).
    We are concerned with the model that agents have of each other's plan construction and inference process, and consider these two processes as consisting of chains of plausible inferences operating on goals
