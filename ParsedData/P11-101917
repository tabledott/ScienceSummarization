 correlation of 0.611 between the estimated and the true CLC error counts.
    This suggests that there is room for improvement in the language models we developed to estimate the error-rate.
    In the experiments reported hereafter, we use the ukWaC+CLC LM to calculate the error-rate.
    In order to assess the independent as opposed to the order-dependent additive contribution of each feature type to the overall performance of the system, we run a number of ablation tests.
    An ablation test consists of removing one feature of the system at a time and re-evaluating the model on the test set.
    Table 2 presents Pearson&#8217;s and Spearman&#8217;s correlation between the CLC and our system, when removing one feature at a time.
    All features have a positive effect on performance, while the error-rate has a big impact, as its absence is responsible for a 0.061 decrease of Spearman&#8217;s correlation.
    In addition, the removal of either the word ngrams, the PS rules, or the error-rate estimate contr
