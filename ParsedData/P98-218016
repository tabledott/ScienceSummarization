    An advantage we have over these approaches, however, is the rich structure imposed by the parse, logical form, and word sense disambiguation components of our system.
    The statistics we use in the context of MindNet allow richer metrics because the data themselves are richer.
    Our first foray into the realm of processing free text with our methods has already been accomplished; Table 2 showed that some 58,000 example sentences from LDOCE and AHD3 were processed in the creation of our current MindNet.
