se of classification problems; this work forms the basis for the reranking methods.
    Section 4 describes how these approaches can be generalized to ranking problems.
    We introduce loss functions for boosting and MRF approaches and discuss optimization methods.
    We also derive the efficient algorithm for boosting in this section.
    Section 5 gives experimental results, investigating the performance improvements on parsing, efficiency issues, and the effect of various parameters of the boosting algorithm.
    Section 6 discusses related work in more detail.
    Finally, section 7 gives conclusions.
    The reranking models in this article were originally introduced in Collins (2000).
    In this article we give considerably more detail in terms of the algorithms involved, their justification, and their performance in experiments on natural language parsing.
  
  
    Before discussing the reranking approaches, we describe history-based models (Black et al. 1992).
    They are important for a few reas
