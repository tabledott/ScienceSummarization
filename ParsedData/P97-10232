the basis of distributional properties and linguistic cues (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993), identifying the semantic orientation of words would allow a system to further refine the retrieved semantic similarity relationships, extracting antonyms.
    Unfortunately, dictionaries and similar sources (theusari, WordNet (Miller et al., 1990)) do not include semantic orientation information .2 Explicit links between antonyms and synonyms may also be lacking, particularly when they depend on the domain of discourse; for example, the opposition bear&#8212; bull appears only in stock market reports, where the two words take specialized meanings.
    In this paper, we present and evaluate a method that automatically retrieves semantic orientation information using indirect information collected from a large corpus.
    Because the method relies on the corpus, it extracts domain-dependent information and automatically adapts to a new domain when the corpus is changed.
