d by the windowed schemes are too noisy to make an improvement.
    Initial results from applying these methods to the EMA corpus have been obtained by Wilco ter Stal (1995), and support the conclusion that the dependency model is superior to the adjacency model.
    Lauer and Dras (1994) suggest two improvements to the method used above.
    These are: tion in the probability of categories.
    While these changes are motivated by the dependency model, I have also applied them to the adjacency model for comparison.
    To implement them, equations 1 and 2 must be modified to incorporate a factor of in each term of the sum and the l 1 td1t2iissi entire ratio must be multiplied by two.
    Five training schemes have been applied with these extensions.
    The accuracy results are shown in figure 3.
    For comparison, the untuned accuracy figures are shown with dotted lines.
    A marked improvement is observed for the adjacency model, while the dependency model is only slightly improved.
    To determine the
