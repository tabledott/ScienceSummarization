ity&#8221;.
    He offers an evaluation where an item is said to be noncompositional if it occurs in a dictionary of idioms.
    This produces the unconvincing scores of 15.7% for precision and 13.7% for recall.
    We claim that substitution-based tests are useful in demarcating MWEs from productive word combinations (as attested by Pearce (2001a) in a MWE detection task), but not in distinguishing the different classes of decomposability.
    As observed above, simple decomposable MWEs such as motor car fail the substitution test not because of nondecomposability, but because the expression is institutionalised to the point of blocking alternates.
    Thus, we expect Lin&#8217;s method to return a wide array of both decomposable and non-decomposable MWEs.
    Bannard (2002) focused on distributional techniques for describing the meaning of verb-particle constructions at the level of logical form.
    The semantic similarity between a multiword expression and its head was used as an indicator of decomposabil
