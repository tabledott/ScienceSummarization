ondence).
    Although Figure 2 defines the coefficients simply, the algorithm is not implemented literally from it.
    The algorithm employs a compact representation of the correspondences for efficient operation.
    An arbitrarily large corpus can be accommodated by segmenting it appropriately.
    The algorithm described here is an instance of a general approach to statistical estimation, represented by the EM algorithm [Dempster et al., 1977].
    In contrast to reservations that have been expressed [Gale and Church, 1991a] about using the EM algorithm to provide word correspondences, there have been no indications that prohibitive amounts of memory might be required, or that the approach lacks robustness.
    Unlike the other methods that have been mentioned, the approach has the capability to accommodate more context to improve performance.
  
  
    A sample of the aligned corpus comprising 2,600 alignments was used for testing the algorithm (not all of the alignments contained sentences).
