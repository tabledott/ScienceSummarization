mmatical role is a major determinant of the ranking on the Cf, With SUBJECT &gt; OBJECT(S) &gt; OTHER.
    The effect of factors such as word order (especially fronting), clausal subordination, and lexical semantics, as well as the interaction among these factors are areas of active investigation; Section 9 again provides references to such work.
    In summary, these examples provide support for the claim that there is only a single Cb, that grammatical role affects an entity's being more highly ranked in Cf, and that lower-ranked elements of the Cf cannot be pronominalized unless higher-ranked ones are.
    Kameyama (1985) was the first to argue that grammatical role, rather than thematic role, which Sidner used, affected the Cf ranking.
    Psycholinguistic research since 1986 (Hudson-D'Zmura 1988; Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993) supports the claims that there is a single Cb and that grammatical role plays a determining role in identifying the Cb.
    It furthermore suggests that neither thematic role nor
