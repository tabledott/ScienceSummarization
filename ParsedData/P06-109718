frequently results in poor machine translation performance.
    Finally, we show better MT results by using Fmeasure with a tuned &#945; value.
    The only previous discriminative approach which has been shown to produce translations of similar or better quality to those produced by the symmetrized baseline was (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005).
    They had access to 5000 gold standard word alignments, considerably more than the 100 or 110 gold standard word alignments used here.
    They also invested significant effort in sub-model engineering (producing both sub-models specific to Arabic/English alignment and sub-models which would be useful for other language pairs), while we use sub-models which are simple extensions of Model 4 and language independent.
    The problem of semi-supervised learning is often defined as &#8220;using unlabeled data to help supervised learning&#8221; (Seeger, 2000).
    Most work on semi-supervised learning uses underlying distributions with a relatively small number of paramet
