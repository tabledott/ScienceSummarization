s' 2 B (r) and b (s') 2&#65533; B (r) is equivalent to (for the full details of the derivation, inferred from the definition of G (r) and B (r), please refer to Florian and Ngai (2001)).
    These formulae offer us a method of generating the rules r which are influenced by the modification s' &#8212;&#65533; b (s'): (a) If p (b (s')) = false then decrease good (r), where r is the rule created with predicate p s.t. target T [s'];
  
  
    (a) If p (b (s')) = false then for all the rules r whose predicate is p3 and tr =&#65533; C [s'] decrease bad (r); The algorithm for generating the rules r that need their good counts (formula (3)) or bad counts (formula (4)) increased can be obtained from the formulae (1) (respectively (2)), by switching the states s' and b (s'), and making sure to add all the new possible rules that might be generated (only for (3)).
    Case II: C [s'] =&#65533; C [b (s')] (b does change the classification of sample s').
    In this case, the formula (5) is transformed into: (again, the f
