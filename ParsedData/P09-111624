 refers to phrase clusters of size N. All the clusters are soft clusters created with the web corpus using 3word context windows.
    The bag-of-words features alone have dismal performance.
    This is obviously due to the extreme paucity of training examples.
    In fact, only 12% of the words in the 800 test queries are found in the training examples.
    Using word clusters as features resulted in a big increase in F-score.
    The phrasal cluster features offer another big improvement.
    The best result is achieved with multiple phrasal clusterings.
    Figure 2 compares the performance of our system (the dark bar at 2) with the top tercile systems in KDDCUP 2005.
    The best two systems in the competition (Shen et al., 2005) and (Vogel et al., 2005) resorted to knowledge engineering techniques to bridge the gap between the small set of examples and the new queries.
    They manually constructed a mapping from the query classes to hierarchical directories such as Google Directory3 or Open Directory Pr
