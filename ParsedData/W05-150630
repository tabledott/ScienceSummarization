eam of width 10?4.
			Figure 8(a) shows that the parsing speed of Algorithm 3 im proved dramatically against the other algorithms and isnearly constant in k, which exactly matches the complexity analysis.
			Algorithm 1 (k log k) also significantly out performs the baseline na??ve algorithm (k2 log k).
			We also did a comparison between our Algorithm 3 and the Jime?nez and Marzal algorithm in terms of average 5In beam search, or threshold pruning, each cell in the chart (typically containing all the items corresponding to a span [i, j]) is reduced by discarding all items that are worse than ? times the score of the best item in the cell.
			This ? is known as the beam width.
			6In this type of pruning, also known as histogram pruning, only the ? best items are kept in each cell.
			This ? is called the cell limit.
