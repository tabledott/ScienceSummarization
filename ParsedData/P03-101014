gnments if their SIM has the same value.
    Therefore, SntScore is more appropriate than SIM if we want to compare sentence alignments in different article alignments, because, in general, a sentence alignment in a reliable article alignment is more reliable than one in an unreliable article alignment.
    The next section compares the effectiveness of AVSIM to that of BM25, and that of SntScore to that of SIM.
  
  
    Here, we discuss the results of evaluating article and sentence alignments.
    We first estimate the precision of article alignments by using randomly sampled alignments.
    Next, we sort them in descending order of BM25 and AVSIM to see whether these measures can be used to provide correct alignments with a high ranking.
    Finally, we show that the absolute values of AVSIM correspond well with human judgment.
    Each English article was aligned with a Japanese article with the highest BM25.
    We sampled 100 article alignments from each of 1996-2001 and 19891996.
    We then classifie
