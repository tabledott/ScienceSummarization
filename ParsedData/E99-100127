cations, the names of the 8 planets of our solar system.
    The hypothesis was that even with those reasonably common location names, Named Entity recognition would already dramatically improve.
    This hypothesis was confirmed, as can be seen in Figure 4.
    Inspection of the errors confirms that the system makes most mistakes when there is no internal or external evidence to decide what sort of Named Entity is involved.
    For example, in a reference to &amp;quot;a Hamburg hospital&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hamburg&amp;quot; no longer gets marked up as a location, because the word occurs nowhere else in the text, and that context is not sufficient to assume it indicates a location (cf. a Community Hospital, a Catholic Hospital, an NHS Hospital, a Trust-Controlled Hospital, etc).
    Similarly, in a reference to &amp;quot;the Bonn government&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bonn&amp;quot; is no longer marked up as a location, because of lack of supportive context (cf. the Clinton government, the Labour government, etc).
