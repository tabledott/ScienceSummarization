    Not every sentence is written strongly from a perspective.
    Can computers learn to identify which sentences strongly convey a particular perspective?
    We develop statistical models to capture how perspectives are expressed at the document and sentence levels, and evaluate the proposed models on articles about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
    The results show that the proposed models successfully learn how perspectives are reflected in word usage and can identify the perspective of a document with high accuracy.
