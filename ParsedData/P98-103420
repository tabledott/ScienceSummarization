   For example, neither corpus includes WH-phrases as base NPs.
    When the bracketer correctly recognizes these NPs, they are counted as errors.
    Part-of-speech tagging errors are a second cause.
    Third, many NPs are missed by the bracketer because it lacks the appropriate rule.
    For example, household products business is bracketed as [household/NN products/NNS] [business/NM.
    Fourth, idiomatic and specialized expressions, especially time, date, money, and numeric phrases, also account for a substantial portion of the errors.
    These last two categories of errors can often be detected because they produce either recognizable patterns or unlikely linguistic constructs.
    Consecutive NPs, for example, usually denote bracketing errors, as in [household/NN products/NNS] [business/NM.
    Merging consecutive NPs in the correct contexts would fix many such errors.
    Idiomatic and specialized expressions might be corrected by similarly local repair heuristics.
    Typical examples might include
