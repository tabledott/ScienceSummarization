    We turn now to the question of aligning the individual sentences in a subsection between minor anchors.
    Since the number of sentences in the French corpus differs from the number in the English corpus, it is clear that they cannot be in one-to-one correspondence throughout.
    Visual inspection of the two corpora quickly reveals that although roughly 90% of the English sentences correspond to single French sentences, there are many instances where a single sentence in one corpus is represented by two consecutive sentences in the other.
    Rarer, but still present, are examples of sentences that appear in one corpus but leave no trace in the other.
    If one is moderately well acquainted with both English and French, it is a simple matter to decide how the sentences should be aligned.
    Unfortunately, the sizes of our corpora make it impractical for us to obtain a complete set of alignments by hand.
    Rather, we must necessarily employ some automatic scheme.
