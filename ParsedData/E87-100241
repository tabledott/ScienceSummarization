e of vowels.
    Each of these is known as a vocalism and, as the headings of the columns show, these can serve to distinguish perfect from imperfective, active from passive, and the like.
    Each row of the table is characterized by a particular pattern according to which the vowels and consonants alternate.
    In other words, it is characteristic of a given row that the vowel in a particular position is long or short, or that a consonant is simple or geminate, or that material in one syllable is repeated in the following one.
    McCarthy refers to each of these patterns as a prosodic template, a term which I shall take over.
    Each of them adds a particular semantic component to the basic verb, making it reflexive, causative, or whatever.
    Our problem, will therefore involve designing an abstract device capable of combining components of these three kinds into a single sequence.
    Our solution will take the form of a set of one or more finite-state transducers that will work in parallel like those
