    While research in perceptual dialectology does confirm the link of hella to Northern California (Bucholtz et al., 2007), we caution that our findings are merely suggestive, and a more rigorous analysis must be undertaken before making definitive statements about the regional membership of individual terms.
    We view the geographic topic model as an exploratory tool that may be used to facilitate such investigations.
    Figure 3 shows the regional clustering on the training set obtained by one run of the model.
    Each point represents an author, and the ellipses represent the bivariate Gaussians for each region.
