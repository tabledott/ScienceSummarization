propriate for the comparison, giving a relatively high divergence of 0.3937.
    This augurs well for the combination of standard and triangulated phrase-tables, where diversity is valued.
    The decoding results (shown in Table 3 for fr &#8212;* en) indicate that the two methods have similar efficacy, and that their interpolated combination provides the best overall performance.
  
  
    In this paper we have presented a novel method for obtaining more reliable translation estimates from small datasets.
    The key premise of our work is that multi-parallel data can be usefully exploited for improving the coverage and quality of phrase-based SMT.
    Our triangulation method translates from a source to a target via one or many intermediate languages.
    We present a generative formulation of this process and show how it can be used together with the entries of a standard source-target phrase-table.
    We observe large performance gains when translating with triangulated models trained on small datasets.
