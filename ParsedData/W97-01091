biguity of two possible syntactic structures: adj) VP(VB---buy, NP(NNS&#8212;books, PP(IN=for,NP(NN--children)))) adv) VP(VB=buy, NP(NNS&#8212;books), PP(IN=for,NP(NN=children))).
    It is obvious that without some contextual information we cannot disambiguate such a sentence correctly.
    Consider, however, the next sentence:
  
  
    In this case, we can almost certainly state that the PP is adverbial, i.e. attached to the verb.
    This resolution is based on our life time experience in which we much more often encounter the activity which can be described as &amp;quot;buying things for money&amp;quot; than entities described as &amp;quot;books for money&amp;quot;1 .
    At the moment, we do not have a computer database containing life time experiences, and therefore we have to find another way of how to decide the correct PP attachment.
    One of the solutions lies in the exploration of huge textual corpora, which can partially substitute world knowledge.
    Partially, because we do not know how wide
