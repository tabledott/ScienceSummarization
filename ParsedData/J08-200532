u.
  This is done by setting u to be a set of indicator variables that correspond to the labels assigned to ar- guments.
  Specifically, let uic = [S i = c] be the indicator variable that represents whether 268 Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih Importance of Parsing and Inference in SRL or not the argument type c is assigned to Si, and let pic = score(S i = c).
  Equation (1) can then be written as an ILP cost function as argmax uic?{0,1}:?i?
  c?P picuic subject to ?
  c?P uic = 1 ?i ?
  [1,M] which means that each argument can take only one type.
  Note that this new constraint comes from the variable transformation, and is not one of the constraints used in the filter function F .
  Of the constraints listed earlier, constraints 1 through 3 can be evaluated on a per- argument basis and, for the sake of efficiency, arguments that violate these constraints are eliminated even before being given to the argument classifier.
  Next, we show how to transform the constraints in the filter function into the form of linear
