ults) and hence require additional filtering mechanisms.
    To overcome this problem, we employed one single powerful doubly-anchored hyponym pattern to query the web and extract semantic class instances: CLASS NAME such as CLASS MEMBER and *.
    We hypothesized that a doubly-anchored pattern, which includes both the class name and a class member, would achieve high accuracy because of its specificity.
    To address concerns about coverage, we embedded the search in a bootstrapping process.
    This method produced many correct instances, but despite the highly restrictive nature of the pattern, still produced many incorrect instances.
    This result led us to explore new ways to improve the accuracy of hyponym patterns without requiring additional training resources.
    The main contribution of this work is a novel method for combining hyponym patterns with graph structures that capture two properties associated with pattern extraction: popularity and productivity.
    Intuitively, a candidate word (or
