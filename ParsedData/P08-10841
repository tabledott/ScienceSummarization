s has fascinated linguists, anthropologists and historians (Eco, 1995).
    The study of this connection has made possible major discoveries about human communication: it has revealed the evolution of languages, facilitated the reconstruction of proto-languages, and led to understanding language universals.
    The connection between languages should be a powerful source of information for automatic linguistic analysis as well.
    In this paper we investigate two questions: (i) Can we exploit cross-lingual correspondences to improve unsupervised language learning?
    (ii) Will this joint analysis provide more or less benefit when the languages belong to the same family?
    We study these two questions in the context of unsupervised morphological segmentation, the automatic division of a word into morphemes (the basic units of meaning).
    For example, the English word misunderstanding would be segmented into mis understand - ing.
    This task is an informative testbed for our exploration, as strong corre
