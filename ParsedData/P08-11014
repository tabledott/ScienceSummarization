 restricted by reranking: POS information is used to improve segmentation only for the N segmentor outputs.
    In this paper, we propose a novel joint model for Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging, which does not limiting the interaction between segmentation and POS information in reducing the combined search space.
    Instead, a novel multiple beam search algorithm is used to do decoding efficiently.
    Candidate ranking is based on a discriminative joint model, with features being extracted from segmented words and POS tags simultaneously.
    The training is performed by a single generalized perceptron (Collins, 2002).
    In experiments with the Chinese Treebank data, the joint model gave an error reduction of 14.6% in segmentation accuracy and 12.2% in the overall segmentation and tagging accuracy, compared to the traditional pipeline approach.
    In addition, the overall results are comparable to the best systems in the literature, which exploit knowledge outside the training data, even though
