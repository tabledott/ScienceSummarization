ion can be utilised if present, it is not required, and no other assumptions are made in the general model.
    The algorithm relies on both word internal and contextual clues as relatively independent evidence sources that drive the bootstrapping algorithm.
    The first category refers to the morphological structure of the word and makes use of the paradigm that for certain classes of entities some prefixes and suffixes are good indicators.
    For example, knowing that &amp;quot;Maria&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Marinela&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Maricica&amp;quot; are feminine first names in Romanian, the same classification may be a good guess for &amp;quot;Mariana&amp;quot;, based on common prefix.
    Suffixes are typically even more informative, for example &amp;quot;-escu&amp;quot; is an almost perfect indicator of a last name in Romanian, the same applies to &amp;quot;-wski&amp;quot; in Polish, &amp;quot;-ovic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;-ivic&amp;quot; in SerboCroatian, &amp;quot;-son&amp;quot; in English etc.
