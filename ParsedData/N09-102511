e still local in the sense that no new states need to be added to the decoder.
    This is because the entire source sentence, being fixed, is always available to every feature.
    Soft syntactic constraints Neither of our systems uses source-side syntactic information; hence, both could potentially benefit from soft syntactic constraints as described by Marton and Resnik (2008).
    In brief, these features use the output of an independent syntactic parser on the source sentence, rewarding decoder constituents that match syntactic constituents and punishing decoder constituents that cross syntactic constituents.
    We use separatelytunable features for each syntactic category.
    Structural distortion features Both of our systems have rules with variables that generalize over possible fillers, but neither system&#8217;s basic model conditions a rule application on the size of a filler, making it difficult to distinguish long-distance reorderings from short-distance reorderings.
    To remedy this problem,
