agreement on anaphoric same head and larger situation/unfamiliar definite descriptions, worse agreement on the other classes.
    (In fact, the percentages for idioms and doubts are very low; but these classes are also too small to allow us to draw any conclusions.)
    3.4.1 Distribution.
    One of the most interesting results of this first experiment is that a large proportion of the definite descriptions in our corpus (48.37%, according to our own annotation; more, according to our two annotators) are not related to an antecedent previously introduced in the text.
    Surprising as it may seem, this finding is in fact just a confirmation of the results of other researchers.
    Fraurud (1990) reports that 60.9% of definite descriptions in her corpus of 11 Swedish texts are first-mention, i.e., do not corefer with an entity already evoked in the text;&amp;quot; Gallaway (1996) found a distribution similar to ours in (English) spoken child language. low agreement among annotators.
