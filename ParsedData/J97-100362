d 13.
    There is some contention in the later paragraphs; three readers marked both 16 and 18, two marked 18 alone, and two marked 17 alone.
    The outline in the Introduction gives an idea of what each segment is about.
    Passonneau and Litman (1993) discuss at length considerations about evaluating segmentation algorithms according to reader judgment information.
    As Figure 5 shows, agreement among judges is imperfect, but trends can be discerned.
    In the data of Passonneau and Litman (1993), if four or more out of seven judges mark a boundary, the segmentation is found to be significant using a variation of the Q-test (Cochran 1950).
    However, in later work (Litman and Passonneau 1995), three out of seven judges marking a boundary was considered sufficient to classify that point as a &amp;quot;major&amp;quot; boundary.
    Carletta (1996) and Ros&#233; (1995) point out the importance of taking into account the expected chance agreement among judges when computing whether or not judges agree s
