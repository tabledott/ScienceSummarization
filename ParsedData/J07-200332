French side, and above we have three items with the same category and span, that is, they belong to the same chart cell.
    Any of the twelve combinations of these rules and items can be used to deduce a new item (whose scores are shown in the grid), and all these new items will go into the same chart cell (partially listed on the right).
    The intersection method would compute all twelve items and add them to the new chart cell, where most of them will likely be pruned away.
    In actuality, the grid may be a cube (one dimension for rules and two dimensions for two nonterminals) with up to b3 elements, whereas the target chart cell can hold at most b items (where b is the limit on the size of the cell imposed during pruning).
    Thus the vast majority of computed items are pruned.
    But it is possible to compute only a small corner of the cube and preemptively prune the rest of the items without computing them, a method we refer to as cube pruning.
    The situation pictured in Figure 9a is very simil
