the 'Cat' and 'Semantics' columns of (2) provide the essential link between syntax and semantics.
    The predicates that represent the semantics of a phrase will simply be the union of those representing the constituents.
    The rules that sanction a phrase (e.g.
    (3) below) show which variables from the two parts are to be identified.
    When the entry for John is moved, no interactions are possible because the chart is empty.
    When run is moved, the sequence John ran is considered as a possible phrase on the basis of rule (3).
    With appropriate replacements for variables, this maps onto the subset (4) of the original semantic specification in (1).
    Furthermore it is a complete sentence.
    However, it does not count as an output to the generation process as a whole because it subsumes some but not all of (1).
    It therefore simply becomes a new edge on the agenda.
    The string ran fast constitutes a verb phrase by virtue of rule (5) giving the semantics (6), and the phrase ran quickly wi
