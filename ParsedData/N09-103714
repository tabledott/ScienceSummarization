riod being part of the entity, and the entity not corresponding to a single phrase.
    See Figure 2 for an illustration from the data.
    In this case, we removed the terminating period from the entity, to produce a consistent annotation.
    Overall, we found that 656 entities, out of 55,665 total, could not be aligned to a phrase, or multiple contiguous children of a node.
    We identified and corrected the following sources of inconsistencies: Periods and abbreviations.
    This is the problem described above with the Corp. example.
    We corrected it by removing the sentence terminating final period from the entity annotation.
    Determiners and PPs.
    Noun phrases composed of a nested noun phrase and a prepositional phrase were problematic when they also consisted of a determiner followed by an entity.
    We dealt with this by flattening the nested NP, as illustrated in Figure 3.
    As we discussed in Section 2.1, this tree will then be augmented with an additional node for the entity (see Figur
