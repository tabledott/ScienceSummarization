 its novel use of classes of information in backing off to less specific role probabilities (in contrast to using simple subsets of information, as in Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
    If warranted, we base our decisions on the probability of a role given the verb, the syntactic slot (syntactic argument position), and the noun occurring in that slot.
    For example, the assignment to the first argument of sentence (1) above may be based on Experiencer subject .
    When backing off from this probability, we use statistics over more general classes of information, such as conditioning over the semantic class of the verb instead of the verb itself&#8212;for this example, psychological state verbs.
    Our approach yields a very simple probability model which emphasizes classbased generalizations.
    The first step in our algorithm is to use the verb lexicon to determine the argument slots and the roles available for them.
    In Section 2, we discuss the lexicon we use, and our initial steps of syntactic frame
