    Given such an alignment however, what kinds of rules are we entitled to learn from this instance?
    How do we know when it is valid to extract a particular rule, especially in the presence of numerous crossings in the alignment?
    In this section, we give principled answers to these questions, by constructing a theory that gives formal semantics to word alignments.
    We are going to define a generative process through which a string from a source alphabet is mapped to a rooted tree whose nodes are labeled from a target alphabet.
    Henceforth we will refer to symbols from our source alphabet as source symbols and symbols from our target alphabet as target symbols.
    We define a symbol tree over an alphabet A as a rooted, directed tree, the nodes of which are each labeled with a symbol of A.
    We want to capture the process by which a symbol tree over the target language is derived from a string of source symbols.
    Let us refer to the sy
