or English classification.
    Ultimately, a meta classifier that incorporates features from all lexicons provides the best performance.
    In the future we plan to investigate the construction of web-derived lexicons for languages other than English, which is an active area of research (Mihalcea et al., 2007; Jijkoun and Hofmann, 2009; Rao and Ravichandran, 2009).
    The advantage of the web-derived lexicons studied here is that they do not rely on language specific resources besides unlabeled data and seed lists.
    A primary question is whether such lexicons improve performance over a translate-to-English strategy (Banea et al., 2008).
