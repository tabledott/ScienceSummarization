 than the other.
  
  
    The good results obtained using only shallow linguistic features provide a higher baseline against which it is possible to measure improvements obtained using methods based on deep linguistic processing.
    In the near future, we plan to extend our work in several ways.
    First, we would like to evaluate the contribution of syntactic information to relation extraction from biomedical literature.
    With this aim, we will integrate the output of a parser (possibly trained on a domain-specific resource such the Genia Treebank).
    Second, we plan to test the portability of our model on ACE and MUC data sets.
    Third, we would like to use a named entity recognizer instead of assuming that entities are already extracted or given by a dictionary.
    Our long term goal is to populate databases and ontologies by extracting information from large text collections such as Medline.
