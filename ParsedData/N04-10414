 Of the 65,000 proper name hyponyms we discover, 81.5% are correct.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
    In the next section, we review previous algorithms for extracting semantic classes and hyponym relationships.
    Section 3 describes our algorithm for labeling concepts and for extracting hyponym relationships.
    Experimental results are presented in Section 4 and finally, we conclude with a discussion and future work.
  
  
    There have been several approaches to automatically discovering lexico-semantic information from text (Hearst 1992; Riloff and Shepherd 1997; Riloff and Jones 1999; Berland and Charniak 1999; Pantel and Lin 2002; Fleischman et al. 2003; Girju et al.
    2003).
    One approach constructs automatic thesauri by computing the similarity between words based on their distribution in a corpus (Hindle 1990; Lin 1998).
    The output of these programs is a ranked list of similar words to each word.
    For example, Lin's approach outputs the following top-20 simi
