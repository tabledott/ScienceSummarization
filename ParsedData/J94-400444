([T(W/ W], [T(Z} Z] [r;Qq Q])] [Y-MAX [Y-MAX W [X-MAX XI[ QI Note that the logical argument Z is associated with a :CONFLATED marker in the RLCS of the target language, but not in the RLCS of the source language.
  This forces the target language syntactic structure to suppress the realization of this constituent.
  18 Note that the :CONFLATED marker appears to be in complementary distribution with the ?
  In fact, one might consider the use of the :CONFLATED marker to be unnecessary, since its presence could be implied by the absence of the * marker.
  However, the :CONFLATED marker plays an important role in the lexical-semantic representation: it specifies that the "constant" term (e.g., the KNIFE-WOUND of the stab RLCS) must obligatorily fill the position and, moreover, that this constant must be a legal LCS primitive of the system.
  In addition, there is an inherent asymmetry between the :CONFLATED marker and the * marker: whereas the former always occurs in a leaf node position, the latter may occur in
