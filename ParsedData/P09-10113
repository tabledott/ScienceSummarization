 Robocup sportscasting (Chen and Mooney, 2008).
    Their best approach (KRISPER) obtains 67% F1; our method achieves 76.5%.
    This domain is simplified in that the segmentation is known.
    The second domain is weather forecasts, for which we created a new dataset.
    Here, the full complexity of joint segmentation and alignment arises.
    Nonetheless, we were able to obtain reasonable results on this task.
    The third domain we considered is NFL recaps (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005; Snyder and Barzilay, 2007).
    The language used in this domain is richer by orders of magnitude, and much of it does not reference the world state.
    Nonetheless, taking the first unsupervised approach to this problem, we were able to make substantial progress: We achieve an F1 of 53.2%, which closes over half of the gap between a heuristic baseline (26%) and supervised systems (68%&#8211;80%).
  
  
    Our goal is to learn the correspondence between a text w and the world state s it describes.
    We use the term scena
