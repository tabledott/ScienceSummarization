    Following this intuition, most authors begin by counting the number of times that word types in one half of the bitext co-occur with word types in the other half.
    Different co-occurrence counting methods stem from different models of co-occurrence.
    A model of co-occurrence is a Boolean predicate, which indicates whether a given pair of word tokens co-occur in corresponding regions of the bitext space.
    Different models of co-occurrence are possible, depending on the kind of bitext map that is available, the language-specific information that is available, and the assumptions made about the nature of translational equivalence.
    All the translation models reviewed and introduced in this article can be based on any of the co-occurrence models described by Melamed (1998a).
    For expository purposes, however, I shall assume a boundarybased model of co-occurrence throughout this article.
    A boundary-based model of co-occurrence assumes that both halves of the bitext have been segmented int
