on in ternary rules etc as a sequence of binary operations.
    Grammar rules (i.e., constructions) may contribute semantic information, but we assume that this information obeys all the same constraints as the semantics for a sign, so in effect such a rule is semantically equivalent to having null elements in the grammar.
    The correspondence between the order of the arguments to op and linear order is specified by syntax.
    We use variables and equality statements to achieve the same effect as coindexation in TFSs.
    This raises one problem, which is the need to avoid accidental variable equivalences (e.g., accidentally using x in both the signs for cat and dog when building the logical form of A dog chased a cat).
    We avoid this by adopting a convention that each instance of a lexical sign comes from a set of basic sements that have pairwise distinct variables.
    The equivalent of coindexation within a lexical sign is represented by repeating the same variable but the equivalent of coindexation
