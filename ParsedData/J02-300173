t over the argmax expression: This leaves us with an expression in terms of the prior for frame element groups of a particular target word P({r1...n}  |t), the local probability of a frame element given a constituent&#8217;s features P(ri  |fi, t) on which our previous system was based, and the individual priors for the frame elements chosen P(ri  |t).
    This formulation can be used to assign roles either when the frame element boundaries are known or when they are not, as we will discuss later in this section.
    Calculating empirical FEG priors from the training data is relatively straightforward, but the sparseness of the data presents a problem.
    In fact, 15% of the test sentences had an FEG not seen in the training data for the target word in question.
    Using the empirical value for the FEG prior, these sentences could never be correctly classified.
    For this reason, we introduce a smoothed estimate of the FEG prior consisting of a linear interpolation of the empirical FEG prior and the produ
