m C99 is more accurate than existing algorithms.
    A two-fold increase in accuracy and seven-fold increase in speed was achieved (compare C99(b) with R98).
    If one disregards segmentation accuracy, H94 has the best algorithmic performance (linear).
    C99, K98 and R98 are all polynomial time algorithms.
    The significance of our results has been confirmed by both t-test and KS-test.
  
  
    A segmentation algorithm has two key elements, a, clustering strategy and a similarity measure.
    Our results show divisive clustering (R98) is more precise than sliding window (H94) and lexical chains (K98) for locating topic boundaries.
    Four similarity measures were examined.
    The cosine coefficient (R98(s,&#8222;0) and dot density measure (R98(m,doo ) yield similar results.
    Our spread activation based semantic measure (R98(&#8222;,sa)) improved accuracy.
    This confirms that although Kozima's approach (Kozima, 1993) is computationally expensive, it does produce more precise segmentation.
