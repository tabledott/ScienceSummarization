d form of a word is always an initial or a final substring of that word&#8212;no attention is paid to morphographemic or word-internal changes.
    A word is broken into two parts, one of which becomes the normalized form, if there is evidence that the resulting prefix and suffix belong to a paradigm.
    In particular, both must occur as prefixes and suffixes of other forms.
    The algorithm proceeds in two stages.
    First a data structure, called the trie, is constructed in which information about the occurrences of potential prefixes and suffixes in the text is stored.
    Second, words are split, where the trie provides evidence for doing so, and one of the resulting parts is chosen as the normalization. information with strings of characters.
    It is particularly economical in situations where many of the strings of interest are substrings of others in the set.
    A trie is in fact a tree, with a branch at the root node for every character that begins a string in the set.
    To look up a string, o
