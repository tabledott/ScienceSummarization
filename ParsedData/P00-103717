orpus).
    Because a spell checker is typically applied right after a word is typed, the language model only used left context.
    We show the results in Figure 1, where we used the error model with positional information and with a maximum context window of four, and used the language model to rescore the 5 best word candidates returned by the error model.
    Note that for the case of no language model, the results are lower than the results quoted above (e.g. a 1-best score above of 95.0%, compared to 93.9% in the graph).
    This is because the results on the Brown Corpus are computed per token, whereas above we were computing results per type.
    One question we wanted to ask is whether using a good language model would obviate the need for a good error model.
    In Figure 2, we applied the trigram model to resort the 5-best results of the CG model.
    We see that while a language model improves results, using the better error model (Figure 1) still gives significantly better results.
