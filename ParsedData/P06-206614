    But then, one not only needs to show that a dependency graph can be decomposed into m planar graphs, but also that this decomposition is the one with the smallest number of planes among all possible decompositions.
    Up to now, no tractable algorithm to find the minimal decomposition has been given, so itis not clear how to evaluate the significance of the concept as such.
    The evaluation presented by Yli-Jyr&#228; (2003) makes use of additional constraints that are sufficient to make the decomposition unique.
    The fundamental difference between gap degree and edge degree is that the gap degree measures the number of discontinuities within a subtree, while the edge degree measures the number of intervening constituents spanned by a single edge.
    This difference is illustrated by the graphs displayed in Figure 4.
    Graph 4a has gap degree 2 but edge degree 1: the subtree rooted at node 2 (marked by the solid edges) has two gaps, but each of its edges only spans one connected co
