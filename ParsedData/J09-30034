on question answering (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003; Maybury 2004; Stoyanov, Cardie, and Wiebe 2005) and review mining to extract opinions about companies and products (Morinaga et al. 2002; Nasukawa and Yi 2003) require sentence-level or even phrase-level analysis.
    For example, if a question answering system is to successfully answer questions about people&#8217;s opinions, it must be able not only to pinpoint expressions of positive and negative sentiments, such as we find in sentence (1), but also to determine when an opinion is not being expressed by a word or phrase that typically does evoke one, such as condemned in sentence (2).
    A common approach to sentiment analysis is to use a lexicon with information about which words and phrases are positive and which are negative.
    This lexicon may be manually compiled, as is the case with the General Inquirer (Stone et al. 1966), a resource often used in sentiment analysis.
    Alternatively, the information in the lexicon may be acquired automaticall
