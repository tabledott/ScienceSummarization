e let EE denote E U {&#8364;}): Other families of relations can also be defined by analogy to the formal language case.
    For example, a system of context-free rewriting rules can be used to define a context-free n-relation simply by introducing n-tuples as the terminal symbols of the grammar.
    The standard context-free derivation procedure will produce tree structures with n-tuple leaves, and the relational yield of such a grammar is taken to be the set of n-way concatenations of these leaves.
    Our analysis of phonological rule systems does not depend on expressive power beyond the capacity of the regular relations, however, and we therefore confine our attention to the mathematical and computational properties of these more limited systems.
    The relations we refer to as &amp;quot;regular,&amp;quot; to emphasize the connection to formal language theory, are often known as &amp;quot;rational relations&amp;quot; in the algebraic literature, where they have been extensively studied (e.g.
