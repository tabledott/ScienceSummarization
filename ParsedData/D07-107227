 and X to explain the data, resulting in 8320 effective rules; in contrast, the HDP-PCFG uses only 4 subsymbols for X and 1 forS, resulting in only 68 effective rules.
			If the thresh old is relaxed from 10?6 to 10?3, then only 20 rules are effective, which corresponds exactly to the true grammar.
			3.2 Parsing the Penn Treebank.
			In this section, we show that our variational HDP PCFG can scale up to real-world data sets.
			We ranexperiments on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) por tion of the Penn Treebank.
			We trained on sections 2?21, used section 24 for tuning hyperparameters, and tested on section 22.
			We binarize the trees in the treebank as follows:for each non-terminal node with symbol X , we in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 0.25 subsymbol pos ter ior 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 0.25 subsymbol pos ter ior standard PCFG HDP-PCFG Figure 7: The posteriors over the subsymbols of thestandard PCFG is roughly uniform, whereas the pos teriors of the HDP-PCFG is
