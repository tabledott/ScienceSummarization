    Does it indicate that more than one sense of the verb is involved, or is one sense primary, and the alternations for that class should take precedence over the alternations for the other classes in which the verb is listed?
    The grounds for deciding that a verb belongs in a particular class because of the alternations that it does not take are elusive at best.
  
  
    We augmented the existing database of Levin semantic classes with a set of intersective classes, which were created by grouping together subsets of existing classes with overlapping members.
    All subsets were included which shared a minimum of three members.
    If only one or two verbs were shared between two classes, we assumed this might be due to homophony, an idiosyncrasy involving individual verbs rather than a systematic relationship involving coherent sets of verbs.
    This filter allowed us to reject the potential intersective class that would have resulted from combining the remove verbs with the scribble verbs, for
