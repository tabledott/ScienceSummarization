    The test and training data were obtained as follows.
    A number of verb&#8211;direct object pairs were extracted from a subset of the BNC, using the system of Briscoe and Carroll.
    All those pairs containing a noun not in WordNet were removed, and each verb and argument was lemmatized.
    This resulted in a data set of around 1.3 million (v, n) pairs.
    To form a test set, 3,000 of these pairs were randomly selected such that each selected pair contained a fairly frequent verb.
    (Following Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, only those verbs that occurred between 500 and 5,000 times in the data were considered.)
    Each instance of a selected pair was then deleted from the data to ensure that the test data were unseen.
    The remaining pairs formed the training data.
    To complete the test set, a further fairly frequent verb, v', was randomly chosen for each (v, n) pair.
    The random choice was made according to the verb&#8217;s frequency in the original data set, subject to the condition tha
