at expression's VAL as its TIME.
    In the second stage, each taggable verb in a sentence lacking a time expression is given the TIME of the immediately previous verb in the sentence which has one, under the default assumption that the temporal focus is maintained.
    Of course, rather than blindly propagating time expressions to events based on proximity, we should try to represent relationships expressed by temporal coordinators like &#8220;when&#8221;, &#8220;since&#8221;, &#8220;before&#8221;, as well as explicitly temporally anchored events, like &#8220;ate at 3 pm&#8221;.
    The event-aligner component uses a very simple method, intended to serve as a baseline method, and to gain an understanding of the issues involved.
    In the future, we expect to advance to event-alignment algorithms which rely on a syntactic analysis, which will be compared against this baseline.
    Assessment An example of the chronological tagging of events offered by these two components is shown in Figure 2, along with the
