active learning to a transformation-learning paradigm (Brill, 1995) for any application.
    Since a transformation-based learner does not give a probabilistic output, we are not able to use Lewis &amp; Gale's method for determining uncertainty.
    Our experimental framework thus uses the query by committee paradigm with batch selection: In our experiments, the initial corpus C that we used consisted of sections 15-18 of the Wall Street Journal Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), which is also the training set used by Ramshaw &amp; Marcus (1999).
    The initial t sentences were the first 100 sentences of the training corpus, and x = 50 sentences were picked at each iteration.
    Sets of 50 sentences were selected because it takes approximately 15-30 minutes for humans to annotate them, a reasonable amount of work and time for the annotator to spend before taking a break while the machine selects the next set.
    The parameter m, which denotes the number of models to train, was set at 3, which could be expecte
