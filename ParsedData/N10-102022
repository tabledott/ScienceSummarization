ibb-style estimator (Gibbs).
    Following work from the summarization community (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), we employ Kendall&#8217;s r to measure the similarity of the max-probability permutation to the original order.
    The Kendall r rank correlation coefficient measures the similarity between two permutations based on their agreement in pairwise orderings: where n+ is the number of pairs that share the same order in both permutations, and n_ is the number that do not.
    This statistic ranges between -1 and +1, where -1 indicates inverse order, and +1 indicates identical order.
    A value greater than 0 indicates a positive correlation.
    Predicting post order on open-domain Twitter conversations is a much more difficult task than on topic-focused news data (Barzilay and Lee, 2004).
    We found that a simple bigram model baseline does very poorly at predicting order on Twitter, achieving only a weak positive correlation of r = 0.0358 on our test data as compared with 0.19-0.74 reported by Barzilay an
