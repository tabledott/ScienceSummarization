    Each of the systems represents a The features available to the four taggers in our study.
    Except for MXPOST, all systems use different models (and hence features) for known (k) and unknown (u) words.
    However, Brill's transformation-based learning system (TBL) applies its two models in sequence when faced with unknown words, thus giving the unknown-word tagger access to the features used by the known-word model as well.
    The first five columns in the table show features of the focus word: capitalization (C), hyphen (H), or digit (D) present, and number of suffix (S) or prefix (P) letters of the word.
    Brill's TBL system (for unknown words) also takes into account whether the addition or deletion of a suffix results in a known lexicon entry (indicated by an L).
    The next three columns represent access to the actual word (W) and any range of words to the left (W left) or right (Wright)., The last three columns show access to tag information for the word itself (T) and any range of wor
