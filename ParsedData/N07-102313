 deletions that must operate jointly, as in production S &#8594; hADVP COMMA NP VP, NP VPi (in which the ADVP should not be deleted without the comma).
    Without binary histories, we often observed superfluous punctuation symbols and dangling coordinate conjunctions appearing in our outputs.
    Finally, we label l with an order-v ancestor annotation, e.g., for the VP in Figure 1, l = E for v = 0, l =VP&#710;S for v = 2, and so on.
    We also replace H and modifiers Li and Ri by lexicalized entries, e.g., H =(VP,VBD,fell) and Ri =(PP,IN,from).
    Note that to estimate pl(kil |&#183; &#183; &#183; ), we only lexicalize Li and H, and none of the other conditioning modifiers, since this would, of course, introduce too many conditioning variables (the same goes for pr(kir |&#183; &#183; &#183; )).
    The question of how much sister and vertical (s and v) context is needed for effective sentence compression, and whether to use lexical or POS annotation, will be evaluated in detail in Section 5.
