enizing the text, is usually one of the first necessary processing steps, making tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing possible.
    A variety of methods have recently been developed to perform word segmentation and the results have been published widely.'
    A major difficulty in evaluating segmentation algorithms is that there are no widely-accepted guidelines as to what constitutes a word, and there is therefore no agreement on how to &amp;quot;correctly&amp;quot; segment a text in an unsegmented language.
    It is 1Most published segmentation work has been done for Chinese.
    For a discussion of recent Chinese segmentation work, see Sproat et al. (1996). frequently mentioned in segmentation papers that native speakers of a language do not always agree about the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; segmentation and that the same text could be segmented into several very different (and equally correct) sets of words by different native speakers.
