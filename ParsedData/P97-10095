art-of-speech tags, its morphological features, and a set of collocations.
    In our approach, a local context of a word is defined in terms of the syntactic dependencies between the word and other words in the same sentence.
    A dependency relationship (Hudson, 1984; Mel'euk, 1987) is an asymmetric binary relationship between a word called head (or governor, parent), and another word called modifier (or dependent, daughter).
    Dependency grammars represent sentence structures as a set of dependency relationships.
    Normally the dependency relationships form a tree that connects all the words in a sentence.
    An example dependency structure is shown in (4).
    The local context of a word W is a triple that corresponds to a dependency relationship in which W is the head or the modifier: (type word position) where type is the type of the dependency relationship, such as subj (subject), adjn (adjunct), comp I (first complement), etc.
    ; word is the word related to W via the dependency relationship;
