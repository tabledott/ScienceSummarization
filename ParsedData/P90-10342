ibutional foundation of meaning is not new.
    Harris (1968) makes this &amp;quot;distributional hypothesis&amp;quot; central to his linguistic theory.
    His claim is that: &amp;quot;the meaning of entities, and the meaning of grammatical relations among them, is related to the restriction of combinations of these entities relative to other entities.&amp;quot; (Harris 1968:12).
    Sparck Jones (1986) takes a similar view.
    It is however by no means obvious that the distribution of words will directly provide a useful semantic classification, at least in the absence of considerable human intervention.
    The work that has been done based on Harris' distributional hypothesis (most notably, the work of the associates of the Linguistic String Project (see for example, Hirschman, Grishrnan, and Sager 1975)) unfortunately does not provide a direct answer, since the corpora used have been small (tens of thousands of words rather than millions) and the analysis has typically involved considerable intervention
