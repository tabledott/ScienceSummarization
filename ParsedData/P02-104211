obability mass to dependency structures not licensed by the grammar.
    The parser analyses a sentence in two stages.
    First, in order to limit the number of categories assigned to each word in the sentence, a &#8220;supertagger&#8221; (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999) assigns to each word a small number of possible lexical categories.
    The supertagger (described in Clark (2002)) assigns to each word all categories whose probabilities are within some constant factor, &#946;, of the highest probability category for that word, given the surrounding context.
    Note that the supertagger does not provide a single category sequence for each sentence, and the final sequence returned by the parser (along with the dependencies) is determined by the probability model described in the previous section.
    The supertagger is performing two roles: cutting down the search space explored by the parser, and providing the categorysequence model in equation 8.
    The supertagger consults a &#8220;category dictionary&#8221
