    Training of our machine learning component was done by three-fold cross-validation, randomly splitting the 10,345 pairs of paragraphs into three (almost) equally-sized subsets.
    In each of the three runs, two of these subsets were used for training and one for testing.
    To create a reference standard, the entire collection of 10,345 paragraph pairs was marked for similarity by two reviewers who were given our definition and detailed instructions.
    Each reviewer independently marked each pair of paragraphs as similar or not similar.
    Subsequently, the two reviewers jointly examined cases where there was disagreement, discussed reasons, and reconciled the differences.
    In order to independently validate our definition of similarity, we performed two additional experiments.
    In the first, we asked three additional judges to determine similarity for a random sample of 40 paragraph pairs.
    High agreement between judges would indicate that our definition of similarity
