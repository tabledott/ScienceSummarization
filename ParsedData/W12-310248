atures, the final submission contains 18 feature templates and about 4 million features in total.
    WLV-SHEF (R, S): The systems integrates novel linguistic features from the source and target texts in an attempt to overcome the limitations of existing shallow features for quality estimation.
    These linguistically-informed features include part-of-speech information, phrase constituency, subject-verb agreement and target lexicon analysis, which are extracted using parsers, corpora and auxiliary resources.
    Systems are built using epsilon-SVM regression with parameters optimised using 5-fold crossvalidation on the training set and two different feature sets: &#8220;WLV-SHEF BL&#8221; uses the 17 baseline features plus 70 linguistically inspired features, while &#8220;WLV-SHEF FS&#8221; uses a larger set of 70 linguistic plus 77 shallow features (including the baseline).
    Although results indicate that the models fall slightly below the baseline, further analysis shows that linguistic information is
