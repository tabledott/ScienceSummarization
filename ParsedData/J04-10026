, implicitly encodes some of the metaphors CorMet is intended to find; Peters and Peters (2000) use WordNet to find many artifact/cognition metaphors.
    Also, WordNet enumerates some metaphorical senses of some verbs.

    The article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the mechanisms by which conventional metaphors are detected.

    Section 4 describes how the system&#8217;s performance is evaluated against the Master Metaphor List (Lakoff, Espenson, and Schwartz 1991), and Section 5 covers select related work.

    The precompiled corpora available on-line (Kucera 1992; Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) do not span enough subj
