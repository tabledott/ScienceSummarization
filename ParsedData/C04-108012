ative frequencies of tags for each word from the tagged Treebank to limit allowable word-tag assignments.
			That is, tags that appeared the tag of a particular word less than X% of the time were omitted from the set of possible tags for that word.
			We varied this threshold until accuracy did not significantly change on our set of heldout data.
			The effect of thresholding tags based on relative frequency in the training set is shown for our set of part-of-speech taggers in the curve in Figure 3.
			As shown in Table 1, the elimination of noisy possible part-of-speech assignments raised accuracy back into the realm of previously published results.
