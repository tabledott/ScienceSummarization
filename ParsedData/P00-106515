 are: AGENT, THEME, COTHEME (&amp;quot;... had been abducted with him&amp;quot;) and MANNER.
    Other schemes for choosing values of A, including giving more weight to distributions for which more training data was available, were found to have relatively little effect.
    We attribute this to the fact that the evaluation depends only the the ranking of the probabilities rather than their exact values.
    In the &amp;quot;backoff&amp;quot; combination method, a lattice was constructed over the distributions in Table 2 from more specific conditioning events to less specific, as shown in Figure 3.
    The less specific distributions were used only when no data was present for any more specific distribution.
    As before, probabilities were combined with both linear interpolation and a geometric mean.
    The final system performed at 80.4% accuracy, which can be compared to the 40.9% achieved by always choosing the most probable role for each target word, essentially chance performance on this task.
