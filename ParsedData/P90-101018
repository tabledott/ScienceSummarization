equent cross-speaker references to future events and actions correspond to phases of plan negotiation[PHW82].
  More importantly these references are closely related to the control struc- ture.
  The example above illustrates the clustering of event anaphora t segment boundaries.
  One dis- course participant uses an anaphor to summarize a plan, but when the other participant evaluates this plan there may be a control shift and any reference to the plan will necessarily cross a control boundary.
  The distribution of event anaphora bears this out, since 23/25 references to future actions are within 2 utterances of a segment boundary (See the ex- ample above).
  More significantly every instance of event anaphora crossing a segment boundary occurs when the speaker is talking about future events or actions.
  We also looked at the TODs for instances of anaphora being used to describe a future act in the way that we observed in the ADs.
  However, over the 938 turns in the TODs, there were only 18 instances of e
