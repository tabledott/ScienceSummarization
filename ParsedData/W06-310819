ssification performance on the held-out test corpus.
    This is a strong evidence that the maximum entropy framework is suitable for this task.
    Another advantage of our approach is the generalization capability via the use of word classes or part-of-speech information.
    Furthermore, additional features can be easily integrated into the maximum entropy framework.
    So far, the word classes were not used for the translation experiments.
    As the word classes help for the classification task, we might expect further improvements of the translation results.
    Using partof-speech information instead (or in addition) to the automatically computed word classes might also be beneficial.
    More fine-tuning of the reordering model toward translation quality might also result in improvements.
    As already mentioned in Section 4.3, a richer feature set could be helpful.
