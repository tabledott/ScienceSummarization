graph over trigram types, and edge weights based on distributional similarity, to improve a supervised conditional random field tagger.
    We extend Subramanya et al.&#8217;s intuitions to our bilingual setup.
    Because the information flow in our graph is asymmetric (from English to the foreign language), we use different types of vertices for each language.
    The foreign language vertices (denoted by Vf) correspond to foreign trigram types, exactly as in Subramanya et al. (2010).
    On the English side, however, the vertices (denoted by Ve) correspond to word types.
    Because all English vertices are going to be labeled, we do not need to disambiguate them by embedding them in trigrams.
    Furthermore, we do not connect the English vertices to each other, but only to foreign language vertices.4 The graph vertices are extracted from the different sides of a parallel corpus (De, Df) and an additional unlabeled monolingual foreign corpus Ff, which will be used later for training.
    We use two differ
