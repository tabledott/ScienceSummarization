many opinion expressions are used in multiple domains, which is identical with the conclusion presented by Kobayashi et al. (2007).
    They collected 5,550 opinion expressions from various sources .
    The coverage of the dictionary is high in multiple domains.
    Motivated by those observations, we use a dictionary which contains 8221 opinion expressions to select candidates (Wilson et al., 2005b).
    An assumption we use to filter candidate opinion expressions is that opinion expressions tend to appear closely with product features, which is also used to extract product features by Hu and Liu (2004).
    In our experiments, the tree distance between product feature and opinion expression in a relation should be less than 5 in the phrase dependency parsing tree.
    This section describes our method on extracting relations between opinion expressions and product features using phrase dependency tree.
    Manually built patterns were used in previous works which have an obvious drawback that those pattern
