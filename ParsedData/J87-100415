sing algorithm that is guided by LR parsing tables.
    The major extension is that nodes in the chart contain more information (LR state numbers) than in conventional chart parsing.
    In this paper, however, we describe the algorithm as a generalized LR parsing algorithm only.
    So far, we have focussed on how to accept or reject a sentence.
    In practice, however, the parser must not only accept or reject sentences but also build the syntactic structure(s) of the sentence (parse forest).
    The next section describes how to represent the parse forest and how to build it with our parsing algorithm.
  
  
    Our parsing algorithm is an all-path parsing algorithm; that is, it produces all possible parses in case an input sentence is ambiguous.
    Such all-path parsing is of ten needed in natural language processing to manage temporarily or absolutely ambiguous input sentences.
    The ambiguity (the number of parses) of a sentence may grow exponentially as the length of a sentence grows (Church and Pa
