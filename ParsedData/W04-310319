notating the gene regulation abstracts (sets a&amp;b): suggest, potential, likely, may, at least, in part, possibl, potential, further investigation, unlikely, putative, insights, point toward, promise, propose.
    The automated system then looks for these substrings in a sentence and if found, the sentence is marked as speculative and as definite if not.
    In the table below the scores for the three methods of annotation are listed as rows.
    We give accuracy on the categorization task and precision and recall numbers for finding speculative sentences.
    The format is precision/recall(accuracy), all as percentages.
    The Majority method, annotating every sentence as Again the results are preliminary since the amount of data is small and the feature set we explored was limited to words.
    However, it should be noted that both the substring and the SVM systems performs well suggesting that speculation in abstracts is lexically marked but in a somewhat ambiguous fashion.
    This conclusion is also s
