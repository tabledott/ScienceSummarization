 can be interpreted as an upper bound of our method, is indeed much better, suggesting that if we can somehow improve the candidate generation method to include the answers in the list, we can expect to significantly improve the performance for all the methods.
    This is clearly an interesting topic for further research.
    The relative performance of different methods on this augmented candidate list is roughly the same as on the original candidate list, except that the &#8220;Freq+PhoneticFilter&#8221; is slightly worse than that of the phonetic method alone, though it is still much better than the performance of the frequency correlation alone.
    One possible explanation may be that since these names do not necessarily occur in our comparable corpora, we may not have sufficient frequency observations for some of the names.
    To demonstrate that score propagation can further help transliteration, we use the combination scores in Table 3 as the initial scores, and apply our propagation algorithm to it
