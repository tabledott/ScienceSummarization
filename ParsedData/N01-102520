tart/End, since Maximum Entropy model regards all features as independent and tries to catch the more general feature sets.
    We believe that SVMs perform well regardless of the chunk representation, since SVMs have a high generalization performance and a potential to select the optimal features for the given task.
    By applying weighted voting, we achieve higher accuracy than any of single representation system regardless of the voting weights.
    Furthermore, we achieve higher accuracy by applying Cross validation and VC-bound and Leave-One-Out methods than the baseline method.
    By using VC bound for each weight, we achieve nearly the same accuracy as that of Cross validation.
    This result suggests that the VC bound has a potential to predict the error rate for the &#8220;true&#8221; test data accurately.
    Focusing on the relationship between the accuracy of the test data and the estimated weights, we find that VC bound can predict the accuracy for the test data precisely.
    Even if we have
