2-21 of the CCGbank, which resulted in 8 type-raised categories for NP, and 2 categories each for PP and Sadj NP.
    As well as combinatory rules, the parser also uses a number of lexical rules and rules involving punctuation.
    The set of rules consists of those occurring roughly more than 200 times in sections 02-21 of the CCGbank.
    For example, one rule used by the parser is the following: This rule creates a nominal modifier from an ingform of a verb phrase.
    A set of rules allows the parser to deal with commas (all other punctuation is removed after the supertagging phase).
    For example, one kind of rule treats a comma as a conjunct, which allows the NP object in John likes apples, bananas and pears to have three heads, which can all be direct objects of like.7 The search space explored by the parser is reduced by exploiting the statistical model.
    First, a constituent is only placed in a chart cell if there is not already a constituent with the same head word, same category, and some depe
