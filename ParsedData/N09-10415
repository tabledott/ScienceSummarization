(1).7 In order to discourage redundancy, the words in the selected sentence are updated PDnew (w) a til the summary word limit has been reached.
    Despite its simplicity, SUMBASIC yields 5.3 R-2 without stop words on DUC 2006 (see table 1).8 By comparison, the highest-performing ROUGE system at the DUC 2006 evaluation, SUMFOCUS, was built on top of SUMBASIC and yielded a 6.0, which is not a statistically significant improvement (Vanderwende et al., 2007).9 Intuitively, SUMBASIC is trying to select a summary which has sentences where most words have high likelihood under the document set unigram distribution.
    One conceptual problem with this objective is that it inherently favors repetition of frequent non-stop words despite the &#8216;squaring&#8217; update.
    Ideally, a summarization criterion should be more recall oriented, penalizing summaries which omit moderately frequent document set words and quickly diminishing the reward for repeated use of word.
    Another more subtle shortcoming is the use
