 only 16212 frame elements constituted the answer set.
    In scoring the runs, each frame element (not a null instantiation) returned by a system was counted as an item attempted.
    If the frame element was one that had been identified by the FrameNet taggers, the answer was scored as correct.
    In addition, however, the scoring program required that the frame boundaries identified by the system&#8217;s answer had to overlap with the boundaries identified by FrameNet.
    An additional measure of system performance was the degree of overlap.
    If a system&#8217;s answer coincided exactly to FrameNet&#8217;s start and end position, the system received an overlap score of 1.0.
    If not, the overlap score was the number of characters overlapping divided by the length of the FrameNet start and end positions (i.e., end-start+1)4 The number attempted was the number of nonnull frame elements generated by a system.
    Precision was computed as the number of correct answers divided by the number attempted.
