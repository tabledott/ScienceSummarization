ndorf, 2005; Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007).
    Syntactic complexity is associated with delayed processing time in understanding (Gibson, 1998) and is another factor that can decrease readability.
    Text organization (discourse structure), topic development (entity coherence) and the form of referring expressions also determine readability.
    But we know little about the relative importance of each factor and how they combine in determining perceived text quality.
    In our work we use texts from the Wall Street Journal intended for an educated adult audience to analyze readability factors including vocabulary, syntax, cohesion, entity coherence and discourse.
    We study the association between these features and reader assigned readability ratings, showing that discourse and vocabulary are the factors most strongly linked to text quality.
    In the easier task of text quality ranking, entity coherence and syntax features also become significant and the combination of features allows for ranking predicti
