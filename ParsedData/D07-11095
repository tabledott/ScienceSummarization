bability vector over the successors of synset s in topic k S scalar that, when multiplied by ?s gives the prior for ?k,s ?s normalized vector whose ith entry, when multiplied by S, gives the prior probability for going from s to i ?d multinomial probability vector over the topics that generate document d ? prior for ? z assignment of a word to a topic ? a path assignment through WORDNET ending at a word.?i,j one link in a path ? going from syn set i to synset j.Table 1: A summary of the notation used in the paper.
			Bold vectors correspond to collections of vari ables (i.e. zu refers to a topic of a single word, butz1:D are the topics assignments of words in docu ment 1 through D).
			2.1 A topic model for WSDThe WORDNET-WALK has two important proper ties.
			First, it describes a random process for word generation.
			Thus, it is a distribution over words and thus can be integrated into any generative model of text, such as topic models.
			Second, the synsetthat produces each word is a hidden random vari a
