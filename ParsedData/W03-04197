 participants have attempted to use information other than the available training data.
    This information included gazetteers and unannotated data, and there was one participant who used the output of externally trained named entity recognition systems.
    The most frequently applied technique in the CoNLL-2003 shared task is the Maximum Entropy Model.
    Five systems used this statistical learning method.
    Three systems used Maximum Entropy Models in isolation (Bender et al., 2003; Chieu and Ng, 2003; Curran and Clark, 2003).
    Two more systems used them in combination with other techniques (Florian et al., 2003; Klein et al., 2003).
    Maximum Entropy Models seem to be a good choice for this kind of task: the top three results for English and the top two results for German were obtained by participants who employed them in one way or another.
    Hidden Markov Models were employed by four of the systems that took part in the shared task (Florian et al., 2003; Klein et al., 2003; Mayfield et al.,
