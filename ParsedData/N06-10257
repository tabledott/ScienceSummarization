 2000) and the Alias-I LingPipe Named Entity Recognizer2 is applied to the text in order to identify the noun phrases, which are further taken as referring expressions (REs) to be used for instance generation.
    Therefore, we use automatically extracted noun phrases, rather than assuming perfect NP chunking.
    This is in contrast to other related works in coreference resolution (e.g.
    Luo et al. (2004), Kehler et al.
    (2004)).
    Instances are created following Soon et al. (2001).
    We create a positive training instance from each pair of adjacent coreferent REs.
    Negative instances are obtained by pairing the anaphoric REs with any RE occurring between the anaphor and the antecedent.
    During testing each text is processed from left to right: each RE is paired with any preceding RE from right to left, until a pair labeled as coreferent is output, or the beginning of the document is reached.
    The classifier imposes a partitioning on the available REs by clustering each set of expressions
