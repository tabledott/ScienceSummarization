12; within a tiny fraction of the rate achieved by trained human taggers &#8212; and it's relatively low efficiency are consistent with the priorities laid out in Section 1.2.
    The obvious approach to finding SFs like &amp;quot;V NP to V&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;V to V&amp;quot; is to look for occurrences of just those patterns in the training corpus; but the obvious approach fails to address the attachment problem illustrated by example (1) above.
    The solution is based on the following insights: Rather than take the obvious approach of looking for &amp;quot;V NP to V&amp;quot;, my approach is to wait for clear cases like &amp;quot;V PRONOUN to V&amp;quot;.
    The advantages can be seen by contrasting (3) with (1).
    More generally, the system recognizes linguistic structure using a small finite-state grammar that describes only that fragment of English that is most useful for recognizing SFs.
    The grammar relies exclusively on closed-class lexical items such as pronouns, prepositions, determiners
