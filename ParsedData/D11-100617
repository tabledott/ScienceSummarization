    Let a = {(s(1), t(1)), ... , (s(n), t(n))} be an alignment where s(i) is a word in the source sentence xs (not necessarily the ith word) and t(i) is similarly a word in the target sentence xt (again, not necessarily the ith word).
    The notation (s(i), t(i)) E a indicates two words are the ith aligned pair in a.
    We define the ALIGN function to encode the Direct Correspondence Assumption (DCA) from Hwa et al. (2005): has now been lexicalized and is working in the space of target language sentences.
    Next, the algorithm iterates over the sentences in the parallel corpus.
    It parses the English sentence with an English parser (line 8, again a lexicalized parser).
    It then uses the current target language parameter vector to create a k-best parse list for the target sentence (line 9).
    From this list, it selects the parse whose dependencies align most closely with the English parse via the pre-specified alignment (line 10, also see below for the definition of the ALIGN function).
