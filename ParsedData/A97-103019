ope of NP-heads as the constituents they dominate.
    For example, in Victoria and Albert Museum, the conjunction is within the scope of the lexical head Museum because Museum is a noun that can take PP modification (Museum of Natural History) and hence pre-modification (Natural History Museum).
    Since pre-modifiers can contain conjunctions (Japanis within the scope of the noun, and so the name is not split.
    Although the same relationship holds between the lexical head Laboratories and the conjunction and in IBM and Bell Laboratories, another heuristic takes precedence, one whose condition requires splitting a string if it contains an acronym immediately to the left or to the right of the ambiguous operator.
    It is not possible to determine relative scope strength for all the combinations of different operators.
    Contradictory examples abound: Gates of Microsoft and Gerstner of IBMsuggests stronger scope of and over of, The Department of German Languages and Literature suggests the opposite.
