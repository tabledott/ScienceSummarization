 in Experiment 2 as in Experiment 1, and roughly the same among annotators.
    The average percentage of discourse-new descriptions (larger situation and unfamiliar together) is 46%, against an average of 50% in the first experiment.
    Having split the discourse-new class in two in this experiment, we got an indication of the relative importance of the hearer-old and hearer-new subclasses&#8212; about half of the discourse-new uses fall in each of these classes&#8212;but only very approximate, since the first two annotators classified the majority of these definite descriptions as larger situation, whereas the last annotator classified the majority as unfamiliar.
    As expected, the broader definition of the coreferent class resulted in a larger percentage of definite descriptions being included in this class (an average of 45%), and a smaller percentage being included in the bridging reference class.
    Considering the difference between the relative importance of the same-head anaphora class in the fir
