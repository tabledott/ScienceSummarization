ty, to transform one tree into another.
    However, when training the model, trees for both the source and target languages are provided, in our case from the Chinese and English parsers.
    We began with the tree-to-tree alignment model presented by Gildea (2003).
    The model was extended to handle dependency trees, and to make use of the word-level alignments produced by the baseline MT system.
    The probability assigned by the tree-to-tree alignment model, given the word-level alignment with which the candidate translation was generated, was used as a feature in our rescoring system.
    We trained the parameters of the tree transformation operations on 42,000 sentence pairs of parallel ChineseEnglish data from the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) corpus.
    The lexical translation probabilities Pt were trained using IBM Model 1 on the 30 million word training corpus.
    This was done to overcome the sparseness of the lexical translation probabilities estimated while training the tree-t
