ted, ILP provides a principled way to model dependencies between anaphoricity decisions and coreference decisions.
    In a similar manner, this framework could also be used to capture dependencies among coreference decisions themselves.
    This option &#8212;which we will leave for future work&#8212; would make such an approach akin to yj &#8805; Luo et al. (2004) use Bell trees to represent the search space of the coreference resolution problem (where each leaf is possible partition).
    The problem is thus recast as that of finding the &#8220;best&#8221; path through the tree.
    Given the rapidly growing size of Bell trees, Luo et al. resort to a beam search algorithm and various pruning strategies, potentially resulting in picking a non-optimal solution.
    The results provided by Luo et al. are difficult to compare with ours, since they use a different evaluation metric.
    Another global approach to coreference is the application of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (McCallum and Wellner, 2004).
