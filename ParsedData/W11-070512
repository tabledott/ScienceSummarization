ound in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) are counted as English words.
    We use the standard tagset defined by the Penn Treebank for identifying punctuation.
    We record the occurrence of three standard twitter tags: emoticons, URLs and targets.
    The remaining tokens are either non English words (like coool, zzz etc.) or other symbols.
    In Table 3 we see that 38.3% of the tokens are stop words, 30.1% of the tokens are found in WordNet and 1.2% tokens are negation words.
    11.8% of all the tokens are punctuation marks excluding exclamation marks which make up for 2.8% of all tokens.
    In total, 84.1% of all tokens are tokens that we expect to see in a typical English language text.
    There are 4.2% tags that are specific to Twitter which include emoticons, target, hastags and &#8220;RT&#8221; (retweet).
    The remaining 11.7% tokens are either words that cannot be found in WordNet (like Zzzzz, kewl) or special symbols which do not fall in the category of Twitter tags.
