antially reduces the AER compared to the standard or smoothed model, even without EM re-estimation.
    The combined model produces an additional substantial reduction in alignment error, using a single iteration of EM.
    The ablation experiments show how important the different modifications are to the various models.
    It is interesting to note that the importance of a given modification varies from model to model.
    For example, the re-estimation null-word weight makes essentially no contribution to the smoothed model.
    It can be tuned to reduce the error on the trial data, but the improvement does not carry over to the test data.
    The smoothed model with only the nullword weight and no add-n smoothing has essentially the same error as the standard model; and the smoothed model with add-n smoothing alone has essentially the same error as the smoothed model with both the null-word weight and add-n smoothing.
    On the other hand, the re-estimation null-word weight is crucial to the combined mod
