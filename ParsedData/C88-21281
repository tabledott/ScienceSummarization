rent processing strategies, including parsing models intended to mimic psycholinguistic phenomena.
  This tuning allows the parsing system to operate within the same realm of efficiency as previous architectures for parsing alone, but with much greater flexibility for engaging in other processing regimes.
  1 Introduction the use of a single grammar for both parsing and generation is an idea ~ith a certain elegance, the desirability of which several researchers nave noted.
  Of course, judging the correctness of such a system re- quires a characterization f the meaning of grammars that is indepen- dent of their use by a particular processing, mechanism--that is, the brmalism in which the grammars are expressed must have an abstract ~emantics.
  As a paradigm example of such a formalism, we might take ~ny of the various logic- or unification-based grammar formalisms.
  As described by Pereira and Warren [1983], the parsing of strings ~ccording to the specifications ofa grammar with an independent log- cal sema
