e based translation, distortion is modeled explicitly.
    Models that support non-monotonic decoding generally include a distortion cost, such as |ai &#8722; bi&#8722;1 &#8722; 1 |where ai is the starting position of the foreign phrase fi and bi&#8722;1 is the ending position of phrase fi&#8722;1 (Koehn et al., 2003).
    The intuition behind this model is that since most translation is monotonic, the cost of skipping ahead or back in the source should be proportional to the number of words that are skipped.
    Additionally, a maximum distortion limit is used to restrict the size of the search space.
    In linear word lattices, such as confusion networks, the distance metric used for the distortion penalty and for distortion limits is well defined; however, in a non-linear word lattice, it poses the problem illustrated in Figure 4.
    Assuming the leftto-right decoding strategy described in the previous section, if c is generated by the first target word, the distortion penalty associated with &#8220;skip
