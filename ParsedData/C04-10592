Janiszek, et al 2001) list the following approaches to language model adaptation: ? Linear interpolation of a general and a domain specific model (Seymore, Rosenfeld, 1997).
			Back off of domain specific probabilities with those of a specific model (Besling, Meier, 1995).
			Retrieval of documents pertinent to the new domain and training a language model on-line with those data (Iyer, Ostendorf, 1999, Mahajan et. al. 1999).
			Maximum entropy, minimum discrimination adaptation (Chen, et. al., 1998).
			Adaptation by linear transformation of vectors of bigram counts in a reduced space (DeMori, Federico, 1999).
			Smoothing and adaptation in a dual space via latent semantic analysis, modeling long-term semantic dependencies, and trigger combinations.
			(J. Bellegarda, 2000).
			Our approach can be characterized as unsupervised data augmentation by retrieval of relevant documents from large monolingual corpora, and interpolation of the specific language model, build from the retrieved data, with a background l
