s parameter in the correct direction to move towards ET (and possibly overshoot it).
    A simplified version of the algorithm is given in Figure 5.
    Figure 6 shows graphically how the algorithm works.
    There are two cases.
    In the first case, if we are currently above the goal entropy, then we loosen our thresholds, leading to slower speed and lower entropy.
    We then wish to get as much entropy reduction as possible per time increase; that is, we want the steepest slope possible.
    On the other hand, if we are trying to increase our entropy, we want as much time decrease as possible per entropy increase; that is, we want the flattest slope possible.
    Because of this difference, we need to compute different ratios depending on which side of the goal we are on.
    There are several subtleties when thresholds are set very tightly.
    When we fail to parse a sentence because the thresholds are too tight, we retry the parse with lower thresholds.
    This can lead to conditions that are the opp
