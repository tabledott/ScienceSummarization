 that events can be nominalized and can be referred to pronominally: But virtually every predication that can be made in natural language can be specified as to time and place, be modified adverbially, function as a cause or effect of something else, be the object of a propositional attitude, be nominalized, and be referred to by a pronoun.
    It is therefore convenient to extend Davidson's approach to all predications.
    That is, corresponding to any predication that can be made in natural language, we will say there is an event, or state, or condition, or situation, or *eventuality&amp;quot;, or whatever, in the world that it refers to.
    This approach might be called 'ontological promiscuity&amp;quot;.
    One abandons all ontological scruples.
    Thus we would like to have in our logical notation the possibility of an extra argument in each predication referring to the &amp;quot;condition&amp;quot; that exists when that predication is true.
    However, especially for expository convenience, we woul
