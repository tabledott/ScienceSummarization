context is much more effective than the morphological one, especially with richer dictionaries.
    This seem to indicate that in English the linear context is better at refining the estimations when the ambiguity classes are known, while the morphological context is in charge of adding possible tags when the ambiguity classes are not known.
    Furthermore, the benefit of the morphology-context is bigger for the complete tagset setting, indicating that, while the coarsegrained POS-tags are indicated by word distribution, the finer distinctions are indicated by inflections and orthography.
    The combination of linear and morphology contexts is always beneficial.
    Syntagmatic constraints (e.g., separating be verbs and modals from the rest of the verbs) constantly improve results by about 1%.
    Note that the context-free tagger based on our p(tjw) estimates is quite accurate.
    As with the EM trained models, combining linear and morphological contexts is always beneficial.
    To put these numbers in c
