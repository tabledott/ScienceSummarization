ring model, my model does not need a construct which looks back; it does not need transitions and transition ranking criteria.
    Instead of using the Cb to account for local coherence, in my model this is achieved by comparing the first element of the S-list with the preceding state.
    Strube &amp; Hahn (1996) rank the Cf according to the information status of discourse entities.
    I here generalize these ranking criteria by redefining them in Prince's (1981; 1992) terms.
    I distinguish between three different sets of expressions, hearer-old discourse entities (OLD), mediated discourse entities (MED), and hearer-new discourse entities (NEW).
    These sets consist of the elements of Prince's familiarity scale (Prince, 1981, p.245).
    OLD consists of evoked (E) and unused (U) discourse entities while NEW consists of brand-new (BN) discourse entities.
    MED consists of inferrables (I), containing inferrables (IC) and anchored brand-new (BNA) discourse entities.
    These discourse entities are disc
