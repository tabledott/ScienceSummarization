iscriminant function of JESSCM is g(x, y) = A(x, y)p1(x1, y; 01)&#955;I+1 where A(x, y) = exp(A &#183; &amp; fc(yc, x)).
    Note that both A(x, y) and AI+j are given and fixed during the MDF estimation of joint PM parameters O.
    Therefore, the MDF estimation in JESS-CM can be regarded as a variant of the MML estimation (see Section 2.2), namely, it is MML estimation with a bias, A(x, y), and smooth factors, AI+j.
    MML estimation can be seen as modeling p(x) since it is equivalent to maximizing Em log p(xm) with marginalized hidden variables y, where EYEY p(x, y) = p(x).
    Generally, more data will lead to a more accurate model of p(x).
    With our method, as with modeling p(x) in MML estimation, more unlabeled data is preferable since it may provide more accurate modeling.
    This also means that it provides better &#8216;clusters&#8217; over the output space since Y is used as hidden states in HMMs.
    These are intuitive explanations as to why more unlabeled data in JESS-CM produces better perfo
