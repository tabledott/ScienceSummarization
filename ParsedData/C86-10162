a simple compact system for experimenting with unification-based grammars that would run on machines maller than the Symbolics 3600 for which the original tATI~ implementation at SRI had been created.
  The first version of I)-PATR, initially called }lUG, was written at the Scandinavian Summer Workshop for Computational Linguistics in Helsinki, Finland, at the end of August 1985.
  Although the actual notation for writing rules in D-PATR in some respects differs from the notation in the original PATI?
  system, essentially both systems implement the samegrammar formalism.
  To emphasize this point, the two implementations are now called Z-PATR (Zeta-LiSP PATR) and D PATR (Interlisp-D PATR).
  A number of innovations that came in with l) PATR (HUG) have since migrated to Z-PATR.
  A case in point is the method for minimizing copying in unification that is discussed in the section on parsing and unification.
  Other implementation differences remain--for example, in the parsing algorithm and in the treatment of
