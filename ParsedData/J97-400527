ight distribution.
    If we identify the features of a configuration with local trees&#8212;equivalently, with applications of rewrite rules&#8212;the random field model is almost identical to the model we considered in the previous section.
    There are two important differences.
    First, we no longer require weights to sum to one for rules with the same left-hand side.
    Second, the model does not require features to be identified with rewrite rules.
    We use the grammar to define the set of configurations S2 = L(G), but in defining a probability distribution over L(G), we can choose features of dags however we wish.
    Let us consider an example.
    Let us continue to assume grammar G2 generating the language in Figure 7, and let us continue to assume the empirical distribution in (1).
    But now rather than taking rule applications to be features, let us adopt the two features in Figure 10.
    For purpose of illustration, take feature 1 to have weight )(31 = v--2- and feature 2 to have weight
