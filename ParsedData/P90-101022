 there is such a discrep- ancy, the interruption is a necessary contribution to a collaborative plan, not a distraction from the joint activity.

  We also investigate whether control is shared equally between participants and what percentage of con- trol shifts are represented by abdications, inter- rupts, and summaries for each dialogue type.
  Three things are striking about this data.
  As we predi
