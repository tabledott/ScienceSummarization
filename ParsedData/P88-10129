    Syntactic Ambiguity: Some of the most common types of syntactic ambiguity, including prepositional phrase and other attachment ambiguities and very compound nominal ambiguities, can be converted into constrained coreference problems (see Bear and Hobbs, 1988).
    For example, in (2) the first argument of after is taken to be an existentially quantified variable which is equal to either the compressor or the alarm.
    The logical form would thus include (3 ... e, c, y, a, ...)... A a f ter(y, a) A y E {c, e) That is, however a f ter(y, a) is proved or assumed, y must be equal to either the compressor c or the disengaging e. This kind of ambiguity is often solved as a byproduct of the resolution of metonymy or of the merging of redundancies.
    Metonymy: Predicates impose constraints on their arguments that are often violated.
    When they are violated, the arguments must be coerced into something related which satisfies t
