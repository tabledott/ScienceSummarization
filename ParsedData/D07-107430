 articles contained 5,812 such surface forms.
  551 of them referenced non-existing articles (for example, the filmography section of a director contained linked mentions of all his movies although many of them did not have an associated Wikipedia page).
  Also, 130 of the surface forms were not used in other Wikipedia articles and therefore both the baseline and the proposed system could not hypothesize a disambiguation for them.
  The accuracy on the re- maining 5,131 surface forms was 86.2% for the baseline system and 88.3% for the proposed sys- tem.
  A McNemar test showed that the difference is not significant, the main cause being that the ma- jority of the test surface forms were unambiguous.
  When restricting the test set only to the 1,668 am- biguous surface forms, the difference in accuracy between the two systems is significant at p = 0.01.
  An error analysis showed that the Wikipedia set used as gold standard contained relatively many surface forms with erroneous or out-of-date links, many of th
