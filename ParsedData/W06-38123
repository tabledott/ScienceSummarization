    In this section, the Chinese Whispers (CW) algorithm is outlined.
    After recalling important concepts from Graph Theory (cf.
    Bollob&#225;s 1998), we describe two views on the algorithm.
    The Workshop on TextGraphs, at HLT-NAACL 2006, pages 73&#8211;80, New York City, June 2006. c&#65533;2006 Association for Computational Linguistics second view is used to relate CW to another graph clustering algorithm, namely MCL (van Dongen, 2000).
    We use the following notation throughout this paper: Let G=(V,E) be a weighted graph with nodes (vi)EV and weighted edges (vi, vj, wij) EE with weight wij.
    If (vi, vj, wij)EE implies (vj, vi, wij)EE, then the graph is undirected.
    If all weights are 1, G is called unweighted.
    The degree of a node is the number of edges a node takes part in.
    The neighborhood of a node v is defined by the set of all nodes v&#8217; such that (v,v&#8217;,w)EE or (v&#8217;,v,w)EE; it consists of all nodes that are connecte
