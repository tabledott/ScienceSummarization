 press] for a discussion of this approach).
    We know of course that other information has a bearing on the attachment decision.
    For example, we have observed that if the noun phrase object includes a superlative adjective as a premodifier, then noun attachment is certain (for a small sample of 16 cases).
    We could easily take this into account by setting the prior odds ratio to heavily favor noun attachment: let's suppose that if there is a superlative in the object noun phrase, then noun attachment is say 1000 times more probable than verb attachment; otherwise, they are equally probable.
    Then following Mosteller and Wallace (1964), we assume that Final attachment odds = log ,(initial odds) + LA.
    In case there is no superlative in the object, the initial log odds will be zero (verb and noun attachment are equally probable), and the final odds will equal our LA score.
    If there is a superlative, Final attachment odds = log 2 LA(v, , n, p). and similarly for verbs.
    When f (n,p) is zero
