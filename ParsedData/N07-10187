 distribution over trees defined by a PCFG.
			This means that the posterior distribution on ? given a set of parse trees, P(?|t, ?), is also a Dirichlet distribution.
			Applying Bayes?
			rule, PG(?|t, ?) ?
			PG(t|?)
			PD(?|?)
			( ? r?R ?fr(t)r )( ? r?R ??r?1r ) = ? r?R ?fr(t)+?r?1r which is a Dirichlet distribution with parameters f(t) + ?, where f(t) is the vector of production counts in t indexed by r ? R. We can thus write: PG(?|t, ?) = PD(?|f(t) + ?)which makes it clear that the production counts com bine directly with the parameters of the prior.
			2.4 Markov chain Monte Carlo.
			Having defined a prior on ?, the posterior distribu tion over t and ? is fully determined by a corpusw.
			Unfortunately, computing the posterior probabil ity of even a single choice of t and ? is intractable,as evaluating the normalizing constant for this dis tribution requires summing over all possible parsesfor the entire corpus and all sets of production probabilities.
			Nonetheless, it is possible to define al gori
