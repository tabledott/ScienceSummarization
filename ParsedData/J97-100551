s that all boundaries occurring prior to Cj have been assigned.
    If a new FICU is not initiated in Pi+i, values for all three features are NA.
    The NP features reflect Passonneau's hypotheses that adjacent utterances are more likely to contain expressions that corefer, or that are inferentially linked, if they occur within the same segment; and that a definite pronoun is more likely than a full NP to refer to an entity that was mentioned in the current segment, if not in the previous utterance.
    These hypotheses are inspired by centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995), psycholinguistic research (Marslen-Wilson, Levy, and Tyler 1982; Levy 1984), and pilot studies on data from corpora (Passonneau 1993) or published excerpts (Grosz 1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986).
    Unlike the cue and pause features, the NP features were thus not directly based on simplifications of existing results.
    Cue-prosody, which encodes a combination of prosodic and cue word features, was motivated by an analysis of
