or each data set, we compute the correlation between the vector of MUC-RC scores over the resolution classes and the average vector of MUC-RC scores for the remaining five data sets.
    Table 5 contains the results, which show high correlations (over .90) for all six data sets.
    These results indicate that the relative performance of the resolution classes is consistent across corpora.
    Next, we hypothesize that the distribution of resolution classes in a corpus explains (at least partially) why performance varies so much from corpus to corpus.
    To explore this issue, we create a sure to predict the performance on new data sets.
    The CPP measure uses the empirical performance of each resolution class observed on previous data sets and forms a predicton based on the make-up of resolution classes in a new corpus.
    The distribution of resolution classes for a new corpus can be easily determined because the classes can be recognized superficially by looking only at the strings that represent each
