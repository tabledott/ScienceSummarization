s about the assembly of a plastic water pump [Coh84].
    This covers only a subset of the above types.
    Obviously it would be instructive to conduct a similar analysis on other textual types.
  
  
    When embarking on such a comparison, it would be convenient to assume that the inputs to the algorithms are identical and compare their outputs.
    Unfortunately since researchers do not even agree on which phenomena can be explained syntactically and which semantically, the boundaries between two modules are rarely the same in NL systems.
    In this case the BFP centering algorithm and Hobbs algorithm both make ASSUMPTIONS about other system components.
    These are, in some sense, a further specification of the operation of the algorithms that must be made in order to hand-simulate the algorithms.
    There are two major sets of assumptions, based on discourse segmentation and syntactic representation.
    We attempt to make these explicit for each algorithm and pinpoint where the algorithms might beha
