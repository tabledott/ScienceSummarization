rds for each of the five categories.
    The top 45 words3 from each ranked list are shown in Figure 2.
    While the ranked lists are far from perfect, one can see that there are many category members near the top of each list.
    It is also apparent that a few additional heuristics could be used to remove many of the extraneous words.
    For example, our number processor failed to remove numbers with commas (e.g., 2,000).
    And the military category contains several ordinal numbers (e.g., 10th 3rd 1st) that could be easily identified and removed.
    But the key question is whether the ranked list contains many true category members.
    Since this is a subjective question, we set up an experiment involving human judges.
    For each category, we selected the top 200 words from its ranked list and presented them to a user.
    We presented the words in random order so that the user had no idea how our system had ranked the words.
    This was done to minimize contextual effects (e.g., seeing five catego
