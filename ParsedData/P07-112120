ection 4).
    Second, we compared the performance of A-WASP with and without language modeling for the MRL (Section 5).
    Table 2 shows the results.
    It is found that conjunct regrouping improves recall (p &lt; 0.01 based on the paired t-test), and the use of two-level rules in the maximum-entropy model improves precision and recall (p &lt; 0.05).
    Type checking also significantly improves precision and recall.
    A major advantage of A-WASP over SCISSOR and Z&amp;C is that it does not require any prior knowledge of the NL syntax.
    Figure 9 shows the performance of A-WASP on the multilingual GEOQUERY data set.
    The 250-example data set is a subset of the larger GEOQUERY corpus.
    All English questions in this data set were manually translated into Spanish, Japanese and Turkish, while the corresponding Prolog queries remain unchanged.
    Figure 9 shows that A-WASP performed comparably for all NLs.
    In contrast, SCISSOR cannot be used directly on the nonEnglish data, because syntactic anno
