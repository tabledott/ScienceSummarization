., 2005) several variants of the orientation model have been tried.
    It turned out that for different tasks, different models show the best performance.
    Here, we let the maximum entropy training decide which features are important and which features can be neglected.
    We will see that additional features do not hurt performance and can be safely added to the model.
    The remaining part is structured as follows: first we will describe the related work in Section 2 and give a brief description of the baseline system in Section 3.
    Then, we will present the discriminative reordering model in Section 4.
    Afterwards, we will evaluate the performance of this new model in Section 5.
    This evaluation consists of two parts: first we will evaluate the prediction capabilities of the model on a word-aligned corpus and second we will show improved translation quality compared to the baseline system.
    Finally, we will conclude in Section 6.
