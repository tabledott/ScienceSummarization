asured by the number of sentences.
    The accuracy A means the accuracy of the entire dependency relations.
    Since Japanese is a headfinal language, the second chunk from the end of a sentence always modifies the last chunk.
    The accuracy B is calculated by excluding this dependency relation.
    Hereafter, we use the accuracy A, if it is not explicitly specified, since this measure is usually used in other literature.
    Table3 shows the accuracy when only static features are used.
    Generally, the results with dynamic feature set is better than the results without them.
    The results with dynamic features constantly outperform that with static features only.
    In most of cases, the improvements is significant.
    In the experiments, we restrict the features only from the chunks that appear between two chunks being in consideration, however, dynamic features could be also taken from the chunks that appear not between the two chunks.
    For example, we could also take into consideration the ch
