d COMLEX Syntax dictionaries, and also against a manual analysis of the corpus data for seven of the verbs.
    The process of evaluating the performance of the system relative to the dictionaries could, in principle, be reduced to automated report of precision of correct subcategorization classes to all classes found) of correct classes found in the dictionary entry).
    However, since there are disagreements between the dictionaries and there are classes found in the corpus data that are not contained in either dictionary, we report results relative both to a manually merged entry from ANLT and COMLEX, and also, for seven of the verbs, to a manual analysis of the actual corpus data.
    The latter analysis is necessary because precision and recall measures against the merged entry will still tend to yield inaccurate results as the system cannot acquire classes not exemplified in the data, and may acquire classes incorrectly absent from the dictionaries.
    We illustrate these problems with reference to th
