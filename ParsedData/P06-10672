    For example, in Spanish and Arabic adjectives are mainly noun post-modifiers, whereas in English adjectives are noun pre-modifiers.
    Therefore, when translating between Spanish and English, words must usually be reordered.
    Existing statistical machine translation decoders have mostly relied on language models to select the proper word order among many possible choices when translating between two languages.
    In this paper, we argue that a language model is not sufficient to adequately address this issue, especially when translating between languages that have very different word orders as suggested by our experimental results in Section 5.
    We propose a new distortion model that can be used as an additional component in SMT decoders.
    This new model leads to significant improvements in MT quality as measured by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).
    The experimental results we report in this paper are for Arabic-English machine translation of news stories.
    We also present a novel method for
