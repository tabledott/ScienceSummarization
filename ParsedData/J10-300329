ring distributional similarity in a single corpus can certainly be more complex than simple phrases used by Pas&#184;ca and Dienes.
    Lin and Pantel (2001) discuss how to measure distributional similarity over dependency tree paths in order to induce generalized paraphrase templates such as:2 Whereas single links between nodes in a dependency tree represent direct semantic relationships, a sequence of links, or a path, can be understood to represent an indirect relationship.
    Here, a path is named by concatenating the dependency relationships and lexical items along the way but excluding the lexical items at the end.
    In this way, a path can actually be thought of as a pattern with variables at either end.
    Consider the first dependency tree in Figure 2.
    One dependency path that we could extract would be between the node John and the node problem.
    We start at John and see that the first item in the tree is the dependency relation subject that connects a noun to a verb and so we append that
