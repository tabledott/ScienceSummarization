.83 for the 13-tag MapTask coding scheme (Carletta et al. 1997), K = 0.8 for the 42-tag SwitchboardDAMSL scheme (Stolcke et al.
    2000), K = 0.90 for the smaller 20-tag subset of the CSTAR scheme used by Doran et al. (2001).
    All of these tests were based on the same two assumptions: that every unit (utterance) is assigned to exactly one category (dialogue act), and that these categories are distinct.
    Therefore, again, unweighted measures, and in particular K, tend to be used for measuring inter-coder agreement.
    However, these assumptions have been challenged based on the observation that utterances tend to have more than one function at the dialogue act level (Traum and Hinkelman 1992; Allen and Core 1997; Bunt 2000); for a useful survey, see Popescu-Belis (2005).
    An assertion performed in answer to a question, for instance, typically performs at least two functions at different levels: asserting some information&#8212;the dialogue act that we called Statement in Section 2.3, operating at wh
