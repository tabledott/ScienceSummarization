but there is extensive ongoing research on automated topic classification (Lewis and Hayes 1994).
    Most classification work focuses on identifying main topic(s), as opposed to TextTiling's method of finding both globally distributed main topics and locally occurring subtopics; nevertheless, variations on some existing algorithms should be applicable to subtopic classification.
    The next section argues for the need for algorithms that can detect multi-paragraph subtopic structure (referred to here interchangeably as passages and subtopic segments), and discusses application areas that should benefit from such structure.
    Section 3 describes in more detail what is meant in this article by &amp;quot;subtopic&amp;quot; and presents a description of the discourse model that underlies this work.
    Section 4 introduces the general framework of using lexical co-occurrence information for detecting subtopic shift, and describes other related work in empirical discourse analysis.
