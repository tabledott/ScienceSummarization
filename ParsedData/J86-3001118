eneral intuitions about &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; correspond most closely to DP/DSPs, rather than to syntactic or attentional concepts.
    Finally, the theory suggests that the same intentional structure can give rise to different attentional structures through different discourses.
    The different attentional structures will be manifest in part because different referring expressions will be valid, and in part because different cue phrases and other indicators will be necessary, optional, or redundant.
