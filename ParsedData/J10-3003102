he pivot method by leveraging five other sources in addition to the bilingual parallel corpus itself: (1) a corpus of Web queries similar to the phrase, (2) definitions from the Encarta dictionary, (3) a monolingual parallel corpus, (4) a monolingual comparable corpus, and (5) an automatically constructed thesaurus.
    Phrasal paraphrase pairs are extracted separately from all six models and then combined in a log-linear paraphrasing-as-translation model proposed by Madnani et al. (2007).
    A manual inspection reveals that using multiple sources of information yields paraphrases with much higher accuracy.
    We believe that such exploitation of multiple types of resources and their combinations is an important development.
    Zhao et al. (2009) further increase the utility of this combination approach by incorporating application specific constraints on the pivoted paraphrases.
    For example, if the output paraphrases need to be simplified versions of the input sentences, then only those phrasal paraph
