inding the scope of negations is not a trivial task.
    The higher PCS for the clinical subcorpus follows a trend that applies also to the results of the system.
    The fact that, despite a very low PCS, precision, recall and F1 are relatively high indicates that these measures are in themselves not reliable to evaluate the performance of the system.
    The upper-bound results of the metalearner system assuming gold standard identification of negation signals are shown in Table 5.
    The results of the metalearner system are presented in Table 6.
    Results with gold-standard negation signals are especially better for the clinical subcorpus because except for lack, negative and not, all negation signals score a PCS higher than 90 %.
    Thus, in the clinical subcorpus, if the negation signals are identified, their scope will be correctly found.
    This does not apply to the abstracts and papers subcorpus.
    In terms of PCS, results are considerably higher than baseline results, whereas in terms of pre
