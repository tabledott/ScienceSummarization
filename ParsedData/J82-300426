n (19a), the total number of parse trees is the product of the number of ways of parsing the subject times the number of ways of parsing the predicate.
    Both the subject and the predicate produce a Catalan number of parses, and hence the result is the product of two Catalan numbers, which was verified by EQSP (Martin, Church, and Patil 1981, p. 53).
    This result can be formalized in terms of the power series: 10 This can be implemented efficiently, given an appropriate representation of sets of trees.
    Kenneth Church and Ramesh Patil Coping with Syntactic Ambiguity The power series says that the ambiguity of a particular sentence is the product of Cati and Cat, where i is the number of PPs before &amp;quot;is&amp;quot; and j is the number after &amp;quot;is.&amp;quot; This could be incorporated in the table lookup parser as an instruction to &amp;quot;multiply&amp;quot; the ith entry in the table by the jth entry.
    Multiplication is a cross-product operation; L x R generates the set of binary tree
