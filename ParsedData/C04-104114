stimation.
			Whilst training theparser, the supertagger can be thought of as supply ing a number of plausible but incorrect categoriesfor each word; these, together with the correct cat egories, determine the parts of the parse space that are used in the estimation process.
			We would like to keep the packed charts as small as possible, but not lose accuracy in the resulting parser.
			Section 4.2discusses the use of various settings on the supertag ger.
			The next section describes how normal-form constraints can further reduce the derivation space.
			4.1 Normal-Form Constraints.
			As well as the supertagger, we use two additional strategies for reducing the derivation space.
			Thefirst, following Hockenmaier (2003), is to only al low categories to combine if the combination hasbeen seen in sections 2-21 of CCGbank.
			For exam ple, NP/NP could combine with NP/NP accordingto CCG?s combinatory rules (by forward composi tion), but since this particular combination does not appear in CCGbank the parser do
