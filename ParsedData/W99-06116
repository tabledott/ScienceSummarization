ation, the distance metric, and the clustering algorithm in turn.
    Given an input text, we first use the Empire noun phrase finder (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) to locate all noun phrases in the text.
    Note that Empire identifies only base noun phrases, i.e. simple noun phrases that contain no other smaller noun phrases within them.
    For example, Chief Financial Officer of Prime Corp. is too complex to be a base noun phrase.
    It contains two base noun phrases: Chief Financial Officer and Prime Corp. Each noun phrase in the input text is then represented as a set of 11 features as shown in Table 1.

    All feature values are automatically generated and, therefore, are not always perfect.
    In particular, we use very simple heuristics to approximate the behavior of more complex feature value computations: Individual Words.
