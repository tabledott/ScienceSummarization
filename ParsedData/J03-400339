the number of words in the string.
    In practice, pruning strategies (methods that discard lower-probability constituents in the chart) can improve efficiency a great deal.
    The appendices of Collins (1999) give a precise description of the parsing algorithms, an analysis of their computational complexity, and also a description of the pruning methods that are employed.
    See Eisner and Satta (1999) for an O(n4) algorithm for lexicalized grammars that could be applied to the models in this paper.
    Eisner and Satta (1999) also describe an O(n3) algorithm for a restricted class of lexicalized grammars; it is an open question whether this restricted class includes the models in this article.
  
  
    The parser was trained on sections 2&#8211;21 of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) (approximately 40,000 sentences) and tested on section 23 (2,416 sentences).
    We use the PARSEVAL measures (Black et al. 1991) to compare performance: number
