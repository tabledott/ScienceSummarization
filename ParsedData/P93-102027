nts are correlated with subsequent pauses.
    We use a simplification of these results to develop a baseline algorithm for identifying boundaries in our corpus using pauses.
    The input to our pause segmentation algorithm is a sequential list of all prosodic phrases constituting a given narrative, with pauses (and their durations) noted.
    The output is a set of boundaries B, represented as ordered pairs of adjacent phrases (Pn,Pn+1), such that there is a pause between Pn and P+1.
    Unlike Grosz and Hirschberg, we do not currently take phrase duration into account.
    In addition, since our segmentation task is not hierarchical, we do not note whether phrases begin, end, suspend, or resume segments.
    Figure 2 shows boundaries (PAUSE) assigned by the algorithm.
    Table 3 shows the average performance of the pause algorithm for statistically validated boundaries.
