ow appropriate it is to use one noun (or its distribution) in place of the other.
    If we are using the distribution of one noun in place of the distribution the other noun, we can consider the precision and recall of the prediction made.
    Precision tells us how much of what has been predicted is correct whilst recall tells us how much of what is required has been predicted.
    In order to calculate precision and recall, we first need to consider for each noun n which verb co-occurrences will be predicted by it and, conversely, required in a description of it.
    We will refer to these verbs as the features of n, F (n): where D(n,v), is the degree of association between noun n and verb v. Possible association functions will be defined in the context of each model described below.
    If we are considering the ability of noun A to predict noun B then it follows that the set of True Positives is TP = F (A) n F(B) and precision and recall can be defined as: Precision and recall both lie in the range [0,1]
