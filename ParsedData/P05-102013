    Specifically, we define our partition-based features in terms of the features in the Ng and Cardie (N&amp;C) feature set (see Section 3.1) as follows.
    First, let us assume that is the -th nominal feature in N&amp;C&#8217;s feature set and is the -th possible value of .
    Next, for each and , we create two partitionbased features, and would denote the probability that two NPs residing in the same cluster have incompatible gender values.
    Intuitively, a good NP partition would have a low probability value for this feature.
    So, having these partition-based features can potentially help us distinguish good and bad candidate partitions.
    Method-based features, on the other hand, are used to encode the identity of the coreference system that generated the candidate partition under consideration.
    Specifically, we have one method-based feature representing each pre-selected coreference system.
    The feature value is 1 if the corresponding coreference system generated the candidate partit
