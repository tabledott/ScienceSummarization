s they are added together.
    We therefore reintroduce a backward pass that lets us avoid &#8853; and &#8855; when computing ti (so they are needed only to construct Ti).
    This speedup also works for cyclic graphs and for any V .
    Write wjk as (pjk, vjk), and let w1jk = (p1jk, v1 jk) denote the weight of the edge from j to k.19 Then it can be shown that w0n = (p0n, Ej,k p0jv1jkpkn).
    The forward and backward probabilities, p0j and pkn, can be computed using single-source algebraic path for the simpler semiring (R, +, x, &#8727;)&#8212;or equivalently, by solving a sparse linear system of equations over R, a much-studied problem at O(n) space, O(nm) time, and faster approximations (Greenbaum, 1997).
    Here, the forward and backward probabilities can be computed in time only O(m + n log n) (Fredman and Tar an, 1987). k-best variants are also possible.
  
  
    We have exhibited a training algorithm for parameterized finite-state machines.
    Some specific consequences that we believe to be novel a
