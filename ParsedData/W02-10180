  A Phrase-Based Joint Probability Model For Statistical Machine Translation
  
    We present a joint probability model for statistical machine translation, which automatically learns word and phrase equivalents from bilingual corpora.
    Translations produced with parameters estimated using the joint model are more accurate than translations produced using IBM Model 4.
    1 Motivation Most of the noisy-channel-based models used in statistical machine translation (MT) (Brown et al., 1993) are conditional probability models.
    In the noisy-channel framework, each source sentence e in a parallel corpus is assumed to &#8220;generate&#8221; a target sentence f by means of a stochastic process, whose parameters are estimated using traditional EM techniques (Dempster et al., 1977).
    The generative model explains how source words are mapped into target words and how target words are re-ordered to yield well-formed target sentences.
    A variety of methods are used to account for the re-ordering stage: word
