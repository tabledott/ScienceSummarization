e pre-head, and the post-head that is most similar to the pre-head is searched for (Nagao et al. 1983) (see the upper part of Figure 1).
    In English, conversely, the phrase following the conjunction is the posthead, and the pre-head is searched for in the same way (Agarwal and Boggess 1992).
    However, two conjoined heads are sometimes far apart in a long sentence, making this simple method clearly inadequate.
    Human beings can recognize conjunctive structures because of a certain, but sometimes subtle, similarity that exists between conjuncts.
    Not only the conjoined heads, but also other components in conjuncts, have some similarity, and furthermore, the pre- and post-conjuncts have a structural parallelism.
    A computational method needs to recognize this subtle similarity in order to detect the correct conjunctive structures.
    In this investigation, we have developed an algorithm for calculating a similarity measure between two arbitrary series of words from the left and the right of a con
