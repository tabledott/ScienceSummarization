for building bilingual dictionaries using simple heuristic rules includes Kirschner (1982) for English/Czech dictionaries and Chen (1998) for Chinese/English proper names.
    Tiedemann (1999) improves on these alignment seedings by learning all-or-nothing rules for detecting Swedish/English cognates.
    Hajie et al. (2000) has studied the exploitation of language similarity for use in machine translation in the case of the very closely related languages (Czech/Slovak).
    Covington (1998) uses an algorithm based on heuristic orthographic changes to find cognate words for purposes of historical comparison.
    Perhaps the most comprehensive study of word alignment via string transduction methods was pioneered by Knight and Graehl (1998).
    While restricted to single language transliteration, it very effectively used intermediary phonological models to bridge direct lexical borrowing across distant languages.
  
  
    The experiments reported in this paper extend prior research in a number of directions.
