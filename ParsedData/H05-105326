er work to ascertain the best method for quanti fying ?substantial change?.
			We also intend to exploit the automatic rankingto obtain information on sense frequency distribu tions (rather than just predominant senses) given the genre as well as the domain of the text.
			We plan to combine this with local context, using collocates of neighbours in the thesaurus, for contextual WSD.
			Acknowledgements We would like to thank Siddharth Patwardhan and Ted Pedersen for making the WN Similarity package available, Rada Mihalceaand Tim Chklovski for making the Open Mind software avail able to us and Julie Weeds for the thesaurus software.
			The work was funded by EU-2001-34460 project MEANING, UK EPSRC project ?Ranking Word Sense for Word Sense Disambiguation?
			and the UK Royal Society.
