			As shown in Tab.
			2, PWKP contains more than 108k sentence pairs.
			The sentences from Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia are considered as ?complex?
			and ?simple?
			respectively.
			Both the average sentence length and average token length in Simple Wikipedia are shorter than those inWikipedia, which is in compliance with the pur pose of Simple Wikipedia.

			We first per form 1 to 1 mapping with sentence-level TF*IDF and then combine the pairs with the same complex sentence and adjacent simple sentences.
	
	
			We apply the following simplification operations to the parse tree of a complex sentence: splitting, 1354dropping, reordering and substitution.
			In this sec tion, we use a running example to illustrate thisproces
