ed, acyclic, graph structures (dags).3 Dags can be thought of as similar to the reentrant f-structures of LFG or functional structures of FUG, and we will use the bracketed notation associated with these formalisms for them.
    For example. the following is a dag (D0) in this notation, with reentrancy indicated with coindexing boxes: Dags come in two varieties, complex (like the one above) and atomic (like the dags h and c in the example).
    Complex dags can be viewed as partial functions from labels to dag values, and the notation D(l) will therefore denote the value associated with the label / in the dag D. In the same spirit. we can refer to the domain of a dag (dorn(D)).
    A dag with an empty domain is often called an empty dag or variable.
    A path in a dag is a sequence of label names (notated, e.g.. (d e I)), which can be used to pick out a particular subpart of the dag by repeated application (in this case, the dag (g : hi).
    We will extend the notation D(p) in the obvious way to include the
