equent ones in the original main experiment.
    Results for these verbs in the main experiment were an average Yield of 3 and an average Precision of 45.19%.
    In contrast, the extended experiments on these verbs achieved a 6.5 Yield and 59.95% Precision (average values).
    These results are indeed promising, and the substantial growth in Yield clearly indicates that the TE/ASE algorithms can be further improved.
    We thus suggest that the feasibility of our approach displays the inherent scalability of the TE/ASE process, and its potential to acquire a large entailment relation KB using a full scale lexicon.
    A further improvement direction relates to template ranking and filtering.
    While in this paper we considered anchor sets to have equal weights, we are also carrying out experiments with weights based on cross-correlation between anchor sets.
  
  
    We have described a scalable Web-based approach for entailment relation acquisition which requires only a standard phrasal lexicon as input.
