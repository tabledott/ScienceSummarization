han log-likelihood, but the difference between frequency and the t-test is at best marginally significant.
    In the case of the AdjN data ( , ), we find that at a confidence level of 99% ( ).
    Thus, there should be at most 320 TPs among the AdjN candidates with Compared to the 737 TPs identified in the AdjN data with , our decision to exclude the hapaxlegomena was well justified.
    The proportion of TPs in the PNV sample (
  
  
    We have shown that simple -best approaches are not suitable for a qualitative evaluation of lexical association measures, mainly for the following reasons: the instability of precision values obtained from the first few percent of the data in the SLs; the lack of significant differences between the AMs after approx.
    50% of the data in the SLs have been examined; and the lack of significant differences between the measures except for certain specific values of .
    We have also shown that the evaluation results and the ranking of AMs differ depending on the kind of coll
