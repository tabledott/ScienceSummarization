serve as a logical point of departure.
    Each grid cell thus corresponds to a string from a set of categories reflecting whether the entity in question is a subject (S), object (O), or neither (X).
    Entities absent from a sentence are signaled by gaps (&#8211;).
    Grammatical role information can be extracted from the output of a broad-coverage dependency parser (Lin 2001; Briscoe and Carroll 2002) or any state-of-the art statistical parser (Collins 1997; Charniak 2000).
    We discuss how this information was computed for our experiments in Section 3.3.
    Table 1 illustrates a fragment of an entity grid constructed for the text in Table 2.
    Because the text contains six sentences, the grid columns are of length six.
    Consider for instance the grid column for the entity trial, [O &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; X].
    It records that trial is present in sentences 1 and 6 (as O and X, respectively) but is absent from the rest of the sentences.
    Also note that the grid in Table 1 takes corefe
