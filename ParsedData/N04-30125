ssifies relations in WordNet as having direction, and then establishes the relatedness between two concepts A and B by finding a path that is neither too long nor that changes direction too often.
    The lesk and vector measures incorporate information from WordNet glosses.
    The lesk measure finds overlaps between the glosses of concepts A and B, as well as concepts that are directly linked to A and B.
    The vector measure creates a co&#8211;occurrence matrix for each word used in the WordNet glosses from a given corpus, and then represents each gloss/concept with a vector that is the average of these co&#8211;occurrence vectors.
  
  
    WordNet::Similarity can be utilized via a command line interface provided by the utility program similarity.pl.
    This allows a user to run the measures interactively.
    In addition, there is a web interface that is based on this utility.
    WordNet::Similarity can also be embedded within Perl programs by including it as a module and calling its methods.
