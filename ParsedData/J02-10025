eval, it can be acceptable for boundaries to be off by a few sentences&#8212; a condition called a near miss&#8212;but for news boundary detection, accurate placement is crucial.
    For this reason, some researchers prefer not to measure the segmentation algorithm directly, but consider its impact on the end application (Manning 1998; Kan, Klavans, and McKeown 1998).
    Our approach to these two difficulties is to evaluate algorithms on real segmentations using a &#8220;gold standard&#8221; and to develop an evaluation algorithm that suits all applications reasonably well.
    Precision and recall are standard evaluation measures for information retrieval tasks and are often applied to evaluation of text segmentation algorithms as well.
    Precision is the percentage of boundaries identified by an algorithm that are indeed true boundaries; recall is the percentage of true boundaries that are identified by the algorithm.
    However, precision and recall are problematic for two reasons.
    The first is tha
