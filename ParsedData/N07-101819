oorly on such tasks.We have applied the Bayesian MCMC methods de scribed here to such problems and obtain resultsvery similar to those produced using IO.
			We be lieve that the primary reason why both IO and the Bayesian methods perform so poorly on this task is that simple PCFGs are not accurate models of English syntactic structure.
			We know that PCFGs ? = (0.1, 1.0) ? = (0.5, 1.0) ? = (1.0, 1.0) Binomial parameter ?1 P(?1|?)
