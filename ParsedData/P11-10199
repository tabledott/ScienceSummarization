 experiments reported here we use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995) through the SVMlight package (Joachims, 1999).
    Using the dataset described in Section 2, a number of linguistic features are automatically extracted and their contribution to overall performance is investigated.
    SVMs have been extensively used for learning classification, regression and ranking functions.
    In its basic form, a binary SVM classifier learns a linear threshold function that discriminates data points of two categories.
    By using a different loss function, the e-insensitive loss function (Smola, 1996), SVMs can also perform regression.
    SVMs in regression mode estimate a function that outputs a real number based on the training data.
    In both cases, the model generalises by computing a hyperplane that has the largest (soft-)margin.
    In rank preference SVMs, the goal is to learn a ranking function which outputs a score for each data point, from which a global ordering of the data is constructed.
