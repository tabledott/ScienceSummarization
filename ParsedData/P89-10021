at a single uniform architecture, appropriately parameterized, might be used for both natural-language processes.
    In particular, we developed an architecture inspired by the Earley deduction work of Pereira and Warren (1983) but which generalized that work allowing for its use in both a parsing and generation mode merely by setting the values of a small number of parameters.
    As a method for generating natural-language expressions, the Earley deduction method is reasonably successful along certain dimensions.
    It is quite simple, general in its applicability to a range of unification-based and logic grammar formalisms, and uniform, in that it places only one restriction (discussed below) on the form of the linguistic analyses allowed by the grammars used in generation.
    In particular, generation from grammars with recursions whose well-foundedness relies on lexical information will terminate; top-down generation regimes such as those of Wedekind (1988) or Dymetman and Isabelle (1988) lack this pr
