on achieved (2% for AIM, BASIS, and TEXTUAL sentences, 5% for CONTRAST sentences, and 6% for BACKGROUND sentences).
    No direct comparison with Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen&#8217;s results is possible as different data sets are used and as Kupiec et al.&#8217;s relevant sentences do not directly map into one of our categories.
    Assuming, however, that their relevant sentences are probably most comparable to our AIM sentences, our precision and recall of 44% and 65% compare favorably to theirs (42% and 42%).
    Table 9 shows a confusion matrix between one annotator and the system.
    The system is likely to confuse AIM and OWN sentences (e.g., 100 out of 172 sentences incorrectly classified as AIM by the system turned out to be OWN sentences).
    It also shows a tendency to confuse OTHER and OWN sentences.
    The system also fails to distinguish categories involving other people&#8217;s work (e.g.
    OTHER, BASIS, and CONTRAST).
    Overall, these tendencies mirror human errors, as can be seen from a c
