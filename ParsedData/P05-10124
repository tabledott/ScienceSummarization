e online large-margin learning algorithms of Crammer and Singer (2003) and Crammer et al. (2003).
    Unlike the SVM parser of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) and Ratnaparkhi&#8217;s parser, our parsers are trained to maximize the accuracy of the overall tree.
    Our approach is related to those of Collins and Roark (2004) and Taskar et al. (2004) for phrase structure parsing.
    Collins and Roark (2004) presented a linear parsing model trained with an averaged perceptron algorithm.
    However, to use parse features with sufficient history, their parsing algorithm must prune heuristically most of the possible parses.
    Taskar et al. (2004) formulate the parsing problem in the large-margin structured classification setting (Taskar et al., 2003), but are limited to parsing sentences of 15 words or less due to computation time.
    Though these approaches represent good first steps towards discriminatively-trained parsers, they have not yet been able to display the benefits of discriminative training that have
