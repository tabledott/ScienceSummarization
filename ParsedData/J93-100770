 as a perfectly balanced corpus is very difficult to compile.
    A sample of the 1987 DJ text is certainly not a good sample of general English; however, a balanced sample, such as the Brown Corpus, may also be a poor sample.
    It is doubtful that even a balanced corpus contains enough data on all possible domains, and the very effort of artificially balancing the corpus might also bias the results.
    Corpus-based techniques are still rarely used in the fields of linguistics, lexicography, and computational linguistics, and the main thrust of the work presented here is to promote its use for any text based application.
    In this section we discuss several uses of Xtract.
    Language generation is a novel application for Corpus-Based Computational Linguistics (Boguraev 1989).
    In Smadja (1991) we show how collocations enhance the task of lexical selection in language generation.
    Previous language generation works did not use collocations mainly because they did not have the information in compil
