n step grows a hypothesis by the phrase-pair hy&#711;u Sh&#175;al&#180;ong, with Sharoni: where a &#8226; in the coverage vector indicates the source word at this position is &#8220;covered&#8221; (for simplicity we omit here the ending position of the last phrase which is needed for distortion costs), and where w and w + c are the weights of the two hypotheses, respectively, with c being the cost of the phrase-pair.
    Similarly, the decoding problem with SCFGs can also be cast as a deductive (parsing) system (Shieber et al., 1995).
    Basically, we parse the input string using the source projection of the SCFG while building the corresponding subtranslations in parallel.
    A possible deduction of the above example is notated: where the subscripts denote indices in the input sentence just as in CKY parsing, w1, w2 are the scores of the two antecedent items, and t1 and t2 are the corresponding subtranslations.
    The resulting translation t2t1 is the inverted concatenation as specified by the target-side
