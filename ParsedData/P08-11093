y a small set of orthographic features, their CRF error rate drops considerably more to 4.3%, and their out-of-vocabulary error rate drops by more than half.
    This is further supported by Johnson (2001), who saw no parsing gains when switching from generative to discriminative training, and by Petrov et al. (2007) who saw only small gains of around 0.7% for their final model when switching training methods.
    In this work, we provide just such a framework for training a feature-rich discriminative parser.
    Unlike previous work, we do not restrict ourselves to short sentences, but we do provide results both for training and testing on sentences of length &lt; 15 (WSJ15) and for training and testing on sentences of length &lt; 40, allowing previous WSJ15 results to be put in context with respect to most modern parsing literature.
    Our model is a conditional random field based model.
    For a rule application, we allow arbitrary features to be defined over the rule categories, span and split point in
