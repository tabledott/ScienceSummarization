  46 For example, say the key generates the equivalence class S= { A B C D and the response is simply &lt;A-B&gt; .
  The relative partition p(S) is then {A B} {C} and {D} .
  c(S) is the minimal number of "correct" links necessary to generate the equivalenc e class S. It is clear that c(S) is one less than the cardinality of S, i .e .
  , c(S) = (ISI -1) ?
  m(S) is the number of "missing" links in the response relative to the key set S .
  As noted above, this is the number of links necessary to fully reunite any components o f the p(S) partition.
  We note that this is simply one fewer than the number of element s in the partition, that is , m(S) = (Ip(S)I ?
  1 ) Looking in isolation at a single equivalence class in the key, the recall error for that clas s is just the number of missing links divided by the minimal number of correct links, i .e .
  , m(S) c(S) Recall in turn i s _ ISI ?
  1 To see how this works in practice, consider the second problematic example noted b y Sundheim et al .
