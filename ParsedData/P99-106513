so included the person, gender, and number values were tested without yielding any further improvement, presumably because the damage from sparse data outweighed the value of the additional information present.
    An entirely different approach, rather than searching by hand for effective tagsets, would be to use clustering to derive them automatically.
    We explored two different methods, bottom-up and topdown, for automatically deriving POS tag sets based on counts of governing and dependent tags extracted from the parse trees that the parser constructs from the training data.
    Neither tested approach resulted in any improvement in parsing performance compared to the hand-designed &amp;quot;two letter&amp;quot; tagset, but the implementations of each were still only preliminary, and a clustered tagset more adroitly derived might do better.
    One final issue regarding POS tags was how to deal with the ambiguity between possible tags, both in training and test.
    In the training data, there was a ch
