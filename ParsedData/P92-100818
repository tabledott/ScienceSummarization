ot;&lt;flight&gt; earliest flight&amp;quot;) repairs, and their associated false positives (&amp;quot;u s air five one one,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;a flight on flight number five one one,&amp;quot; respectively).
    In examining the Mi I M1 repair pattern, we found that the strongest distinguishing cue between the repairs (N = 20) and the false positives (N = 20) was the interval between the offset of the first word and the onset of the second.
    False positives had a mean gap of 42 msec (s.d.
    = 55.8) as opposed to 380 msec (s.d.
    = 200.4) for repairs.
    A second difference found between the two groups was that, in the case of repairs, there was a statistically reliable reduction in duration for the second occurrence of M1, with a mean difference of 53.4 msec.
    However because false positives showed no reliable difference for word duration, this was a much less useful predictor than gap duration.
    FO of the matched words was not helpful in separating repairs from false positives; both groups sho
