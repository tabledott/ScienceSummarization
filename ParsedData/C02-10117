			Translation candidate collection 3.2 Translation Selection --.
			EM-NBC-Ensemble We view the translation selection problem as that of classification and employ EM-NBC-Ensemble to perform the task.
			For the ease of explanation, we first describe the algorithm of using only EM-NBC and next extend it to that of using EM-NBC-Ensemble.
			Basic Algorithm Let e~ denote the Base NP to be translated and C~ the set of its translation candidates (phrases).
			Suppose that kC =|~| . Let c~ represent a random variable on C~ . Let E denote a set of words in English, and C a set of words in Chinese.
			Suppose that nCmE == ||and|| . Let e represent a random variable on E and c a random variable
