 are both c by the general definition of 6*.
    If a and b are in E and u and v are in E*, then, using the definition of 6* and the definition just given for 6 of the Cartesian product machine, we have Thus, 6* ((q , q2), x,y) contains a final state if and only if both 51 (ch, x) and 6(q2,Y) contain final states, so T accepts exactly the strings in L1 x L2.
    0 Note that L x L is not the same as Id(L), because only the former can map one member of L onto a different one.
    If L contains the single-character strings a and b, then Id(L) only contains the pairs (a, a) and (b, b) while L x L also contains (a, b) and (b, a).
    A similar construction is used to prove that regular relations are closed under the composition operator discussed in Section 2.
    A pair of strings (x, y) belongs to the relation R1 0 R2 if and only if for some intermediate string z, (x, z) E R1 and (z, y) E R2.
    If T(R1) = (E, Qi, 61) and T(R2) = (E) (227 q2, F2, 82), the composition R1 oR2 is accepted by the composite fst wher
