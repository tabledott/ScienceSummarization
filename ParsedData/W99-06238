his is the parse that is closest to the centroid of the observed parses under the similarity metric.
    The probabilistic version of this procedure is straightforward: We once again assume independence among our various member parsers.
    Furthermore, we know one of the original parses will be the hypothesized parse, so the direct method of determining which one is best is to compute the probability of each of the candidate parses using the probabilistic model we developed in Section 2.1.
    We model each parse as the decisions made to create it, and model those decisions as independent events.
    Each decision determines the inclusion or exclusion of a candidate constituent.
    The set of candidate constituents comes from the union of all the constituents suggested by the member parsers.
    This is summarized in Equation 5.
    The computation of Pfr1(c)1Mi M k (C)) has been sketched before in Equations 1 through 4.
    In this case we are interested in finding' the maximum probability parse, ri, and M
