rd sense disambiguation might best be improved by combining the output of a number of such classifiers into an ensemble.
    This paper begins with an introduction to the Naive Bayesian classifier.
    The features used to represent the context in which ambiguous words occur are presented, followed by the method for selecting the classifiers to include in the ensemble.
    Then, the line and interesi data is described.
    Experimental results disambiguating these words with an ensemble of Naive Bayesian classifiers are shown to rival previously published results.
    This paper closes with a discussion of the choices made in formulating this methodology and plans for future work.
  
  
    A Naive Bayesian classifier assumes that all the feature variables representing a problem are conditionally independent given the value of a classification variable.
    In word sense disambiguation, the context in which an ambiguous word occurs is represented by the feature variables (F1, F2, , Fn) and the sense of the am
