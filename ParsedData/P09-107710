ns between words.
    Marcu and Echihabi (2001) considered only nouns, verbs and and other cue phrases in word pairs.
    They found that even with millions of training examples, prediction results using all words were superior to those based on only pairs of non-function words.
    However, since the learning curve is steeper when function words were removed, they hypothesize that using only non-function words will outperform using all words once enough training data is available.
    In a similar vein, Lapata and Lascarides (2004) used pairings of only verbs, nouns and adjectives for predicting which temporal connective is most suitable to express the relation between two given text spans.
    Verb pairs turned out to be one of the best features, but no useful information was obtained using nouns and adjectives.
    Blair-Goldensohn et al. (2007) proposed several refinements of the word pair model.
    They show that (i) stemming, (ii) using a small fixed vocabulary size consisting of only the most frequent
