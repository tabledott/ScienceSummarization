course.
    The global ranking of an antecedent candidate is a function of the scores that it receives from each of the constraint source modules.
    Our algorithm also uses a mixed evaluation strategy.
    We have taken inspiration from the discussions of scoring procedures in the works cited above, but we have avoided constraint sources involving complex inferencing mechanisms and real-world knowledge, typically required for evaluating the semantic/pragmatic suitability of antecedent candidates or for determining details of discourse structure.
    In general, it seems to us that reliable large scale modelling of real-world and contextual factors is beyond the capabilities of current computational systems.
    Even constructing a comprehensive, computationally viable system of semantic selection restrictions and an associated type hierarchy for a natural language is an exceedingly difficult problem, which, to our knowledge, has yet to be solved.
    Moreover, our experiments with statistically based lexica
