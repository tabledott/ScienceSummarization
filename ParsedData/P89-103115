t on the position of that pronoun in the sentence.
    In the centering framework, no matter what criteria one uses to order the forward-centers list, pronouns take the most salient entities as antecedents, irrespective of that pronoun's position.
    Hobbs ordering of entities from a previous utterance varies from BFP in that possessors come before case-marked objects and indirect objects, and there may be some other differences as well but none of them were relevant to the analysis that follows.
    The effects ot some of the assumptions are measurable and we will attempt to specify exactly what these effects are, however some are not, e.g. we cannot measure the effect of Hobbs' syntax assumption since it is difficult to say how likely one is to get the wrong parse.
    We adopt the set collection assumption for both algorithms as well as the ability to recover the identity of speakers and hearers in dialogue.
    The texts on which the algorithms are analysed are the first chapter of Arthur Hailey's novel
