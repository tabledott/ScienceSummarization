oston?&#8221;).
    Answers to these questions were then automatically generated both by look-up in the 2,000,000 extracted concept-instance pairs and by TextMap, a state of the art web-based Question Answering system which ranked among the top 10 systems in the TREC 11 Question Answering track (Hermjakob et al., 2002).
    Although both systems supply multiple possible answers for a question, evaluations were conducted on only one answer.4 For TextMap, this answer is just the output with highest confidence, i.e., the system&#8217;s first answer.
    For the extracted instances, the answer was that concept-instance pair that appeared most frequently in the list of extracted examples.
    If all pairs appear with equal frequency, a selection is made at random.
    Answers for both systems are then classified by hand into three categories based upon their information content.
