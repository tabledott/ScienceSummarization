ch semantic vector, nw, and the semantic vectors from 200 randomly chosen words.
    By this means we obtain w's correlation mean (p,w) and standard deviation (cru,).
    If v is one of w's variants, then we define the NCS between nw and Itv to be By considering NCSs for all word pairs coupled under a particular rule, we can determine semantic-based probabilities that indicate which PPMVs are legitimate.
    We expect random NCSs to be normally-distributed according to .A.r(0,1).
    Given that a particular ruleset contains nR PPMVs, we can therefore approximate the number (nT), mean (AT) and standard deviation (o-T) of true correlations.
    If we define (I, z(t, a) to be iy e&#8212;( .x)2dx, then we can compute the probability that the particular correlation is legitimate: It is possible that a rule can be hypothesized at the trie stage that is true under only certain conditions.
    A prime example of such a rule is (&amp;quot;es&amp;quot;, NULL).
    Observe from Table 1 that the word &amp;quot;cares&amp;
