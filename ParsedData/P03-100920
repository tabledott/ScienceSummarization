onspire Verbs&#8217;).
    3) Problems in SCF acquisition: These were not numerous but occurred e.g. when the system could not distinguish between different control (e.g. subject/object equi/raising) constructions (B3).
  
  
    This paper has presented a novel approach to automatic semantic classification of verbs.
    This involved applying the NN and IB methods to cluster polysemic SCF distributions extracted from corpus data using Briscoe and Carroll&#8217;s (1997) system.
    A principled evaluation scheme was introduced which enabled us to investigate the effect of polysemy on the resulting classification.
    Our investigation revealed that polysemy has a considerable impact on the clusters formed: polysemic verbs with a clear predominant sense and those with similar regular polysemy are frequently classified together.
    Homonymic verbs or verbs with strong irregular polysemy tend to resist any classification.
    While it is clear that evaluation should account for these cases rather than ignore th
