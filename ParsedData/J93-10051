    An analysis where the prepositional phrase [pp with the telescope] is part of the object noun phrase has the semantics &amp;quot;the man who had the telescope&amp;quot;; an analysis where the PP has a higher attachment (perhaps as daughter of VP) is associated with a semantics where the seeing is achieved by means of a telescope.
    The existence of such ambiguity raises problems for language models.
    It looks like it might require extremely complex computation to determine what attaches to what.
    Indeed, one recent proposal suggests that resolving attachment ambiguity requires the construction of a discourse model in which the entities referred to in a text are represented and reasoned about (Altmann and Steedman 1988).
    We take this argument to show that reasoning essentially involving reference in a discourse model is implicated in resolving attachment ambiguities in a certain class of cases.
    If this phenomenon is typical, there is little hope in the near ter
