ld be able to use to disambiguate.
    Finally, in another class of cases, of which the most prominent is probably the RP/IN/RB ambiguity of words like up, out, and on, the linguistic distinctions, while having a sound empirical basis (e.g., see Baker (1995: 198-201), are quite subtle, and often require semantic intuitions.
    There are not good syntactic cues for the correct tag (and furthermore, human taggers not infrequently make errors).
    Within this classification, the greatest hopes for tagging improvement appear to come from minimizing errors in the second and third classes of this classification.
    In the following sections we discuss how we include additional knowledge sources to help in the assignment of tags to forms of verbs, capitalized unknown words, particle words, and in the overall accuracy of part of speech assignments.
  
  
    The accuracy of the baseline model is markedly lower for unknown words than for previously seen ones.
    This is also the case for all other taggers, and ref
