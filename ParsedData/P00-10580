  Statistical Parsing With An Automatically-Extracted Tree Adjoining Grammar
  
    We discuss the advantages of lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar as an alternative to lexicalized PCFG for statistical parsing, describing the induction of a probabilistic LTAG model from the Penn Treebank and evaluating its parsing performance.
    We find that this induction method is an improvement over the EM-based method of (Hwa, 1998), and that the induced model yields results comparable to lexicalized PCFG.
  
  
    Why use tree-adjoining grammar for statistical parsing?
    Given that statistical natural language processing is concerned with the probable rather than the possible, it is not because TAG can describe constructions like arbitrarily large Dutch verb clusters.
    Rather, what makes TAG useful for statistical parsing are the structural descriptions it assigns to breadand-butter sentences.
    The approach of Chelba and Jelinek (1998) to language modeling is illustrative: even though the probability estimate
