ng (1) the mention itself, such as the number of words and whether it is a pronoun, and (2) properties of the potential antecedent set, such as the number of preceding mentions and whether there is a previous mention with a matching string.
  
  
    This section provides the performance of the pairwise coreference classifier, both when used alone (COREF-PAIRWISE) and when used in a cascade where the anaphoricity classifier acts as a filter on which mentions should be resolved (AC-CASCADE).
    In both systems, antecedents are determined in the manner described in section 2.
    To demonstrate the inherent limitations of cascading, we also give results for an oracle system, ORACLE-LINK, which assumes perfect linkage.
    That is, it always picks the correct antecedent for an anaphor.
    Its only errors are due to being unable to resolve mentions which were marked as nonanaphoric (by the imperfect anaphoricity classifier) when in fact they were anaphoric.
    We evaluate these systems on the datasets from the
