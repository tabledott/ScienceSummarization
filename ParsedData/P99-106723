s an extension from the monolingual to the bilingual case of the well-established methods for semantic or syntactic word clustering as proposed by Schiitze (1993), Grefenstette (1994), Ruge (1995), Rapp (1996), Lin (1998), and others.
    Some of these authors perform a shallow or full syntactical analysis before constructing the cooccurrence vectors.
    Others reduce the size of the co-occurrence matrices by performing a singular value decomposition.
    However, in yet unpublished work we found that at least for the computation of synonyms and related words neither syntactical analysis nor singular value decomposition lead to significantly better results than the approach described here when applied to the monolingual case (see also Grefenstette, 1993), so we did not try to include these methods in our system.
    Nevertheless, both methods are of technical value since they lead to a reduction in the size of the co-occurrence matrices.
    Future work has to approach the difficult problem of ambiguity reso
