4(e, f).
    If e has length 1 and f has length in, there are /m different connections that can be drawn between them because each of the m French words can be connected to any of the 1 English words.
    Since an alignment is determined by the connections that it contains, and since a subset of the possible connections can be chosen in 2&amp;quot; ways, there are 2&amp;quot; alignments in A(e, f).
  
  
    In this section, we develop a series of five translation models together with the algorithms necessary to estimate their parameters.
    Each model gives a prescription for computing the conditional probability Pr(f le), which we call the likelihood of the translation (f, e).
    This likelihood is a function of a large number of free parameters that we must estimate in a process that we call training.
    The likelihood of a set of translations is the product of the likelihoods of its members.
    In broad outline, our plan is to guess values for these parameters and then to apply the EM algorithm (Baum
