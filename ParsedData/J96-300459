y if these names are otherwise common as single-hanzi words.
    For example, the Wang, Li, and Chang system fails on the sequence tffplgfe nian2 nei4 sa3 in (k) since nian2 is a possible, but rare, family name, which also happens to be written the same as the very common word meaning 'year.'
    Our system fails in (a) because of shenl, a rare family name; the system identifies it as a family name, whereas it should be analyzed as part of the given name.
    Finally, the statistical method fails to correctly group hanzi in cases where the individual hanzi comprising the name are listed in the dictionary as being relatively high-frequency single-hanzi words.
    An example is in (i), where the system fails to group 144A lin2yang2gang3 as a name, because all three hanzi can in principle be separate words (4:* lin2 'wood'; yang2 'ocean'; gang3 'harbor').
    In many cases these failures in recall would be fixed by having better estimates of the actual probabilities of single-hanzi words, since our estimates are
