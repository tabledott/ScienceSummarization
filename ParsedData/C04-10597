			2.2 Bag-of-words Query Models.
			Different query models are designed to guide the data augmentation efficiently.
			We first define ?bag-of-words?
			models, based on different levels of knowledge collected from the hypotheses of the statistical machine translation engine.
			2.2.1 First-best Hypothesis as a Query Model The first-best hypothesis is the Viterbi path in the search space returned from the statistical machine translation decoder.
			It is the optimal hypothesis the statistical machine translation system can generate using the given translation and language model, and restricted by the applied pruning strategy.
			Ignoring word order, the hypothesis is converted into a bag-of-words representation, which is then used as a query: }|),{(),,( 1211 TiiilT VwfwwwwQ ?== L where iw is a word in the vocabulary 1TV of the Top 1 hypothesis.
			if is the frequency of iw ?s occurrence in the hypothesis.
			The first-best hypothesis is the actual translation we want to improve, and usually it captures enou
