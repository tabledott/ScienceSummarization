sting a high degree of complementarity.
    For example, a 19% improvement in BLEU score (for MT04 under MADA with 100% training) (from 37.1 in D2 to 44.3) was found from an oracle combination created by selecting for each input sentence the output with the highest sentence-level BLEU score.
  
  
    We plan to study additional variants that these results suggest may be helpful.
    In particular, we plan to include more syntactic knowledge and investigate combination techniques at the sentence and subsentence levels.
