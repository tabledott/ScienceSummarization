 methods for discounting chance agreement we discuss in this article attempt to overcome the limitations of S&#8217;s strong uniformity assumption using an idea first proposed by Scott (1955): Use the actual behavior of the coders to estimate the prior distribution of the categories.
    As noted earlier, Scott based his characterization of &#960; on the assumption that random assignment of categories to items, by any coder, is governed by the distribution of items among categories in the actual world.
    The best estimate of this distribution is &#710;P(k), the observed proportion of items assigned to category k by both coders.
    &#710;P(k), the observed proportion of items assigned to category k by both coders, is the total number of assignments to k by both coders nk, divided by the overall number of assignments, which for the two-coder case is twice the number of items i: Given the assumption that coders act independently, expected agreement is computed as follows.
    It is easy to show that for any s
