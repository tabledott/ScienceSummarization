o the primary component of the DSP of some embedded discourse segment.
    Third, the supports relation is not implication.
    The OCP is not intended to believe that the q; imply p, but rather to believe that the q, in conjunction with other facts and rules that the ICP assumes the OCP has available or can obtain and thus come to believe are sufficient for the OCP to conclude p. Fourth, the DP/DSP may only be completely determined at the end of the discourse (segment), as we discussed in Section 4.
    Finally, to determine how the discourse segments corresponding to the q; are related to the one corresponding to p, the OCP only has to believe that the ICP believes a supports relationship holds.
    Hence, for the purpose of recognizing the discourse structure, it would be sufficient for the third clause to be Believe(OCP, Believe(ICP, Supports (p, q,A...Aqn))) However, the DP of a belief-case discourse is not merely to get the OCP to believe p, but to get the OCP to believe p by virtue of believing the qi.
