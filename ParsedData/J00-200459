An approximate coverage measure can be based on the number of different words in the corpus.
    For lexicons extracted from corpora, perfect coverage implies at least one entry containing each word in the corpus.
    One-sided variants, which consider only source words, have also been used (Gale and Church 1991).
    Table 5 shows both the marginal (one-sided) and the combined coverage at each of the three cutoff points.
    It also shows the absolute number of (non-NULL) entries in each of the three lexicons.
    Of course, the size of automatically induced lexicons depends on the size of the training bitext.
    Table 5 shows that, given a sufficiently large bitext, the method can automatically construct translation lexicons with as many entries as published bilingual dictionaries.
    The next task was to measure accuracy.
    It would have taken too long to evaluate every lexicon entry manually.
    Instead, I took five random samples (with replacement) of 100 entries each from each of the three lexicons
