des primitives (e.g., 3, CA &#8712; V) as well as sets and tuples formed from other values (e.g., 3, {3, 4, 7}, (CA, {5}) &#8712; V).
    Let P be a set of predicates (e.g., state, count &#8712; P), which are just symbols.
    A world w is mapping from each predicate p &#8712; P to a set of tuples; for example, w(state) = {(CA), (OR),... }.
    Conceptually, a world is a relational database where each predicate is a relation (possibly infinite).
    Define a special predicate &#248; with w(&#248;) = V. We represent functions by a set of inputoutput pairs, e.g., w(count) = {(S, n) : n = |S|}.
    As another example, w(average) = {(S, &#175;x) : We write a DCS tree z as hp; r1 : c1; ... ; rm : cmi.
    Figure 2(a) shows an example of a DCS tree.
    Although a DCS tree is a logical form, note that it looks like a syntactic dependency tree with predicates in place of words.
    It is this transparency between syntax and semantics provided by DCS which leads to a simple and streamlined compositional semantics sui
