    More interestingly, most of the best systems used some strategy to mitigate parsing errors.
    In the top three systems in the closed challenge, two (che and ciaramita) used parser combination through voting and/or stacking of different models (see the D Comb. column).
    Samuelsson et al. (2008) perform a MST inference with the bag of all dependencies output by the individual MALT parser variants.
    Johansson and Nugues (2008) use a single parsing model, but this model is extended with second-order features.
    The PA Arch. and PA Inference columns summarize the architectures and inference strategies used for the identification and classification of predicates and arguments.
    The columns indicate that most systems modeled the SRL problem as a token-by-token classification problem (&#8220;class&#8221; in the table) with a corresponding greedy inference strategy.
    Some systems (e.g., yuret, sa
