l approaches.
    These results could be improved by manual filtering the patterns identified by the algorithm.
    The learning algorithm presented in Section 3 includes a mechanism for comparing two extraction patterns using information about lexical similarity derived from WordNet.
    This approach is not restricted to this application and could be applied to other language processing tasks such as question answering, paraphrase identification and generation or as a variant of the vector space model commonly used in Information Retrieval.
    In addition, Sudo et al. (2003) proposed representations for IE patterns which extends the SVO representation used here and, while they did not appear to significantly improve IE, it is expected that it will be straightforward to extend the vector space model to those pattern representations.
    One of the reasons for the success of the approach described here is the appropriateness of WordNet which is constructed on paradigmatic principles, listing the words which
