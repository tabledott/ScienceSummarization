hm, since the latter cannot assign the Cb(Ui+i).
    Also, error chains are sometimes shorter in the FunC analyses.
    Example (9) illustrates how the local restrictions as defined by the original centering model and the BFP algorithm result in errors and lead to rather lengthy error chains (see Table 15 for the corresponding centering analysis).
    The discourse entity SENTENCE, which is cospecified by the pronoun er, in (9b), is the Cb(9b).
    Therefore, it is the most preferred antecedent for the pronoun ihn in (9c), which causes a strategic error.
    This error, in turn, is the reason for a consequent error in (9d), because there are no semantic cues that enforce the correct interpretation, i.e., the coreferentiality between ihn and Giuliani.
    The possible interruption of the error chain, indicated by the alternative interpretation in (9c), is ruled out, however, by the preference for RETAIN over ROUGH-SHIFT transitions (cf.
    Rule 2'). a.
