 that are recoverable from knowledge of discourse relations like contrast and consequence).
    We present a new cloze task that requires narrative knowledge to solve, the narrative cloze.
    The narrative cloze is a sequence of narrative events in a document from which one event has been removed.
    The task is to predict the missing verb and typed dependency.
    Take this example text about American football with McCann as the protagonist: These clauses are represented in the narrative model as five events: (threw subject), (pulled object), (told object), (start subject), (completed subject).

    Removing a single such pair to be filled in automatically allows us to evaluate a system&#8217;s knowledge of narrative relations and coherence.
    We do not claim this cloze task to be solvable even by humans, but rather assert it as a comparative m
