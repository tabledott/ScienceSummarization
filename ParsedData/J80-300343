    Since questions are treated as requests to inform, most of them are handled in a similar manner to the requests above.
    4.4a-h can all be understood as questions about the departure time of some train.
    An interesting example of an indirect INFORM is 4.5a for it is very similar to 4.5b-c which both seem to only be requests.
    The interpretation of 4.5a as an indirect INFORM follows from the fact that inference chains which would make it a REQUEST are all inhibited by the heuristics.
    In Example 8, the possible body-action inference from (2) to REQUEST(A,S,INFORMIF(S,A,KNOW(S,P))) is downgraded because the embedded inference to (3) is possible.
    The interesting case is the embedded know-negative inference which is also possible from (3).
    It implies that BsWA(&#8212;KNOW(S,P)), or equivalently But such a goal is highly unlikely.
    A is attempting to achieve the goal &#8212;Bs(P) by having S recognize that A wants P to be true!
    As a result, no speech act interpretation is possible fro
