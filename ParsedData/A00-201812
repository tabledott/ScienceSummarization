hat less difficulty with sparse data.
    We make one more point on the connection of Equation 7 to a maximum entropy formulation.
    Suppose we were, in fact, going to compute a true maximum entropy model based upon the features used in Equation 7, Ii (t,1), f2(t,1,1p), f3(t,1,lp) .
    ...
    This requires finding the appropriate Ais for Equation 3, which is accomplished using an algorithm such as iterative scaling [II] in which values for the Ai are initially &amp;quot;guessed&amp;quot; and then modified until they converge on stable values.
    With no prior knowledge of values for the Ai one traditionally starts with Ai = 0, this being a neutral assumption that the feature has neither a positive nor negative impact on the probability in question.
    With some prior knowledge, non-zero values can greatly speed up this process because fewer iterations are required for convergence.
    We comment on this because in our example we can substantially speed up the process by choosing values picked so that, w
