at can generate a sentence pair (E, F) can be assumed to have the same probability.
    Under these conditions, the evidence that a sentence pair (E, F) contributes to fact that are generated by the same cept is given by the number of alignments that can be built between (E, F) that have a concept that is linked to phrasein sentence E and phrase sentence F divided by the total number of alignments that can be built between the two sentences.
    Both these numbers can be easily approximated.
    Given a sentence E ofwords, there are ways in which thewords can be partitioned into sets/concepts, where is the ling number of second kind.
    There are also ways in which the words a sentence F can be partitioned into nonempty sets.
    Given that any words in E can be mapped to any words in F, it follows that there are alignments that can be built between two sentences (E, F) of lengthsand , respectively.
    When a concept generates two phrases of lengthand, respectively, there are only and words left to link.
