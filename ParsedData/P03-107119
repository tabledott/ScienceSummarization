ve noticed that some topic boundaries are preceded (within some window) by numerous gaps.
    However, we found little correlation between pauses and topic boundaries.
    Overlaps: we also analyzed the distribution of overlapping speech by counting the average overlap rate within some window.
    We noticed that, many times, the beginning of segments are characterized by having little overlapping speech.
    Speaker change: we sometimes noticed a correlation between topic boundaries and sudden changes in speaker activity.
    For example, in Figure 2, it is clear that the contribution of individual speakers to the discussion can greatly change from one discourse unit to the next.
    We try to capture significant changes in speakership by measuring the dissimilarity between two analysis windows.
    For each potential boundary, we count for each speaker i the number of words that are uttered before (LZ) and after (RZ) the potential boundary (we limit our analysis to a window of fixed size).
    The two distr
