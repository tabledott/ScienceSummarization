    Testset II consists of another randomly extracted 32 sentence pairs from the same domain, prepared in the same way.
    Fig.
    5 shows evaluation results for a sentence condensation run that uses manually selected f-structures for the original sentences as input to the transfer component.
    These results demonstrate how the condenstation system performs under the optimal circumstances when the parse chosen as input is the best available.
    Fig.
    6 applies the same evaluation data and metrics to a sentence condensation experiment that performs transfer from packed fstructures, i.e. transfer is performed on all parses for an ambiguous sentence instead of on a single manually selected parse.
    Alternatively, a single input parse could be selected by stochastic models such as the one described in Riezler et al. (2002).
    A separate phase of parse disambiguation, and perhaps the effects of any errors that this might introduce, can be avoided by transferring from all parses for
