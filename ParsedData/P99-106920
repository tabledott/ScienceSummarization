    The superior performance of both estimators on the Verbmobil corpus probably reflects the fact that the non-rule features were designed to match both the grammar and content of that corpus.
    The pseudolikelihood estimator performed better than the correct-parses estimator on both corpora under both evaluation metrics.
    There seems to be substantial over learning in all these models; we routinely improved performance by discarding features.
    With a small number of features the correct-parses estimator typically scores better than the pseudo-likelihood estimator on the correct-parses evaluation metric, but the pseudo-likelihood estimator always scores better on the pseudo-likelihood evaluation metric.
  
  
    This paper described a log-linear model for SUBGs and evaluated two estimators for such models.
    Because estimators that can estimate rule features for SUBGs can also estimate other kinds of features, there is no particular reason to limit attention to rule features in a SUBG.
