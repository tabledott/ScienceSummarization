erest, we can avoid sampling it directly by marginalizing it out, yielding a collapsed sampler.
    We utilize variable blocking by jointly sampling multiple segmentation and alignment decisions.
    We also collapse our Gibbs sampler in the standard way, by using predictive posteriors marginalized over all possible draws from the Dirichlet processes (resulting in Chinese Restaurant Processes).
    Resampling For each bilingual phrase, we resample each word in the phrase in turn.
    For word w in language E, we consider at once all possible segmentations, and for each segmentation all possible alignments.
    We keep fixed the previously sampled segmentation decisions for all other words in the phrase as well as sampled alignments involving morphemes in other words.
    We are thus considering at once: all possible segmentations of w along with all possible alignments involving morphemes in w with some subset of previously sampled languageF morphemes.3 The sampling formulas are easily derived as products of
