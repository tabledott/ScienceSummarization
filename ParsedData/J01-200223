not match the test case, and returning the most frequent class at the last node.
    The case representation uses exactly the same features as the memory-based learner.
  
  
    In order to test the potential of system combination, we obviously need systems to combine, i.e., a number of different taggers.
    As we are primarily interested in the combination of classifiers trained on the same data sets, we are in fact looking for data sets (in this case, tagged corpora) and systems that can automatically generate a tagger on the basis of those data sets.
    For the current experiments, we have selected three tagged corpora and four tagger generators.
    Before giving a detailed description of each of these, we first describe how the ingredients are used in the experiments.
    Each corpus is used in the same way to test tagger and combiner performance.
    First of all, it is split into a 90% training set and a 10% test set.
    We can evaluate the base taggers by using the whole training set to train the
