tate-of-the-art Collins and Duffy?s convolution tree kernel.
		It also shows that our tree kernel achieves much bet ter performance than the state-of-the-art linear kernels . Finally, it shows that feature-based and tree kernel-based methods much complement each other and the composite kernel can well integrate both flat and structured features.
