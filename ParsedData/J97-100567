sion is very low, and the fallout and error rate are both poor.
    For NP, recall and precision are not as different, precision is higher than PAUSE and CUE, and fallout and error rate are both relatively low.
    These results, as well as the improved performance of the additive algorithms, suggest that performance can be improved by considering more features.
    The algorithms presented in Section 4.3 indeed use more features, as shown in Figure 6.
    A second dimension to consider in comparing performance is that humans and NP assign boundaries based on a global criterion, in contrast to PAUSE and CUE.
    Our subjects typically use a relatively gross level of speaker intention.
    By default, NP assumes that the current segment continues, and assigns a boundary under relatively narrow criteria.
    However, PAUSE and CUE rely on cues that are relevant at the local as well as the global level, and consequently assign boundaries more often.
    This leads to a preponderance of cases where PAUSE and CUE
