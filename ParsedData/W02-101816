 of operations that modify locally the aligment/translation built until a given time.
    These operations replace the English side of an alignment with phrases of different probabilities, merge and break existing concepts, and swap words across concepts.
    The probability p(E) is computed using a simple trigram language model that was trained using the CMU Language Modeling Toolkit (Clarkson and Rosenfeld, 1997).
    The language model is estimated at the word (not phrase) level.
    Figure 3 shows the steps taken by our decoder in order to find the translation of sentence &#8220;je vais me arr&#710;eter l`a .&#8221; Each intermediate translation in Figure 3 is preceded by its probability and succeded by the operation that changes it to yield a translation of higher probability.
    5 Evaluation To evaluate our system, we trained both Giza (IBM Model 4) (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999) and our joint probability model on a French-English parallel corpus of 100,000 sentence pairs from the Hansard corpus.
