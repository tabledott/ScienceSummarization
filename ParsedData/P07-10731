    In this paper, we introduce a supervised learning approach to RE that requires only a handful of training examples and uses the web as a corpus.
    Given a few pairs of well-known entities that clearly exhibit or do not exhibit a particular relation, such as CorpAcquired(Google, YouTube) and not(CorpAcquired(Yahoo, Microsoft)), a search engine is used to find sentences on the web that mention both of the entities in each of the pairs.
    Although not all of the sentences for positive pairs will state the desired relationship, many of them will.
    Presumably, none of the sentences for negative pairs state the targeted relation.
    Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a machine learning framework that exploits this sort of weak supervision, in which a positive bag is a set of instances which is guaranteed to contain at least one positive example, and a negative bag is a set of instances all of which are negative.
    MIL was originally introduced to solve a problem in biochemistry
