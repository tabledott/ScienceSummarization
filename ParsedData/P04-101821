vtest set.
    The result is summarized in Table 4.
    The last column lists the number of features.
    The second row is the full mention-pair model, the third through seventh row correspond to models by removing the syntactic features (i.e., POS tags and apposition features), count features, distance features, mention type and level information, and pair of mention-spelling features.
    If a basic feature is removed, conjunction features using that basic feature are also removed.
    It is striking that the smallest system consisting of only features (string and substring match, acronym, edit distance and number of different capitalized words) can get as much as ACE-value.
    Table 4 shows clearly that these lexical features and the distance features are the most important.
    Sometimes the ACE-value increases after removing a set of features, but the ECM-F measure tracks nicely the trend that the more features there are, the better the performance is.
    This is because the ACE-value is a weighted me
