ces spanned by the lexical chain and the intention differed by more than two.
    In these cases, verification of the possible correspondence must be accomplished through the use of other textual information such as semantics or pragmatics.
    Cue words would be interesting to address, since such information seems to be more computationally accessible than underlying intentions.
    It would be useful to automate this tool and run a large corpus of text through it.
    We suspect that the chain-forming parameter settings (regarding transitivity and distances between words) will be shown to vary slightly according to author's style and the type of text.
    As it is impossible to do a complete and error-free lexical analysis of large text examples in a limited time-frame, automation is desirable.
    It could help shed some light on possible unfortunate chain linkages.
    Do they become problematic, and if so, when does this tend to happen?
