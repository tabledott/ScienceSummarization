e a better indication of the quality of the resulting annotation than simple percent agreement, and moreover, the detailed calculations leading to the coefficients can be very revealing as to where the disagreements are located and what their sources may be.
    A rigorous methodology for reliability testing does not, in our opinion, exclude the use of expert coders, and here we feel there may be a motivated difference between the fields of content analysis and CL.
    There is a clear tradeoff between the complexity of the judgments that coders are required to make and the reliability of such judgments, and we should strive to devise annotation schemes that are not only reliable enough to be replicated, but also sophisticated enough to be useful (cf.
    Krippendorff 2004a, pages 213&#8211;214).
    In content analysis, conclusions are drawn directly from annotated corpora, so the emphasis is more on replicability; whereas in CL, corpora constitute a resource which is used by other processes, so the emphasis
