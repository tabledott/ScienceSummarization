dea that paraphrases will tend to take the same values as arguments (Shinyama et al., 2002; Lin and Pantel, 2001).
    More specifically, we take a pair of lattices from different corpora, look back at the sentence clusters from which the two lattices were derived, and compare the slot values of those cross-corpus sentence pairs that appear in articles written on the same day on the same topic; we pair the lattices if the degree of matching is over a threshold tuned on held-out data.
    For example, suppose we have two (linearized) lattices slot1 bombed slot2 and slot3 was bombed by slot4 drawn from different corpora.
    If in the first lattice&#8217;s sentence cluster we have the sentence &#8220;the plane bombed the town&#8221;, and in the second lattice&#8217;s sentence cluster we have a sentence written on the same day reading &#8220;the town was bombed by the plane&#8221;, then the corresponding lattices may well be paraphrases, where slot1 is identified with slot4 and slot2 with slot3.
