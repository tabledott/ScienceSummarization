    A template defines a specific type of event (e.g., a bombing) with a set of semantic roles (or slots) for the typical entities involved in such an event (e.g., perpetrator, target, instrument).
    In contrast to work in relation discovery that focuses on learning atomic facts (Banko et al., 2007a; Carlson et al., 2010), templates can extract a richer representation of a particular domain.
    However, unlike relation discovery, most template-based IE approaches assume foreknowledge of the domain&#8217;s templates.
    Very little work addresses how to learn the template structure itself.
    Our goal in this paper is to perform the standard template filling task, but to first automatically induce the templates from an unlabeled corpus.
    There are many ways to represent events, ranging from role-based representations such as frames (Baker et al., 1998) to sequential events in scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977) and narrative schemas (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009; Kasch and Oates, 2010).
