ongl-guo2 (middle country) 'China' there are two syllables, and at the same time two morphemes.
    Of course, since the number of attested (phonemic) Mandarin syllables (roughly 1400, including tonal distinctions) is far smaller than the number of morphemes, it follows that a given syllable could in principle be written with any of several different hanzi, depending upon which morpheme is intended: the syllable zhongl could be PP 'middle,' M 'clock,' 4 'end,' or 2', 'loyal.'
