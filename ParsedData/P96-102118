daries as a preprocessing stage.5 Whenever the segmentation preprocessor prematurely commits to an inappropriate segmentation, difficulties are created for later stages.
    This problem is particularly acute for translation, since the decision as to whether to regard a sequence as a single unit depends on whether its components can be translated compositionally.
    This in turn often depends on what the target language is.
    In other words, the Chinese cannot be appropriately segmented except with respect to the target language of translation&#8212;a task-driven definition of correct segmentation.
    The algorithm is given below.
    A few remarks about the notation used: cs,.t denotes the subsequence of Chinese tokens cs+1, cs+2, , ct. We use E(s..t) to denote the set of English words that are translations the Chinese word created by taking all tokens in c, t together.
    E(s, t) denotes the set of English words that are translations of any of the Chinese words anywhere within e, ..t. Note also that we
