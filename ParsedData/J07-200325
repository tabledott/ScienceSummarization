iously enumerated, the next cell must be one of the cells (shaded gray) adjacent to the previously enumerated ones and we need not consider the others (shaded white).
    In this way, if we only want to compute the first few elements of MERGEPRODUCTS(G), we can do so by performing a small number of products and discarding the rest of the grid.
    Figure 6 shows the pseudocode for MERGEPRODUCTS.7 In lines 2&#8211;5, a priority queue is initialized with the best element from each L E G, where L ranges over tuples of lists, and 1 stands for a vector whose elements all have the value 1 (the dimensionality of the vector should be evident from the context).
    The rest of the function creates the virtual list: To enumerate the next element of the list, we first insert the elements adjacent to the previously enumerated element, if any (lines 9&#8211;13, where bi stands for the vector whose ith element is 1 and is zero elsewhere), and then enumerate the best element in the priority queue, if any (lines 14&#8211;18)
