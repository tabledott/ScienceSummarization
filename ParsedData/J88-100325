y.
    Second, a larger sample would reveal both (a) low-frequency ambiguities and (b) many long spans, as discussed below.
    Greene and Rubin (1971) developed TAGGIT for tagging the Brown Corpus.
    The palette of 86 tags that TAGGIT uses has, with some modifications, also been used in both CLAWS and VOLSUNGA.
    The rationale underlying the choice of tags is described on pages 3-21 of Greene and Rubin (1971).
    Francis and Kucera (1982) report that this algorithm correctly tagged approximately 77% of the million words in the Brown Corpus (the tagging was then completed by human post-editors).
    Although this accuracy is substantially lower than that reported by Klein and Simmons, it should be remembered that Greene and Rubin were the first to attempt so large and varied a sample.
    TAGGIT divides the task of category assignment into initial (potentially ambiguous) tagging, and disambiguation.
    Tagging is carried out as follows: first, the program consults an exception dictionary of about 3,000
