 usefully subdivide the space of possible rules when the tag set is this small, it is still possible to apply a similar optimization by sorting the entire list of candidate rules on the basis of their positive scores, and then processing the candidate rules (which means determining their negative scores and thus their net scores) in order of decreasing positive scores.
    By keeping track of the rule with maximum benefit seen so far, one can be certain of having found one of the globally best rules when one reaches candidate rules in the sorted list whose positive score is not greater than the net score of the best rule so far.
    In earlier work on transformational part-of-speech tagging (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994), we noted that it is possible to greatly speed up the learning process by constructing a full, bidirectional index linking each candidate rule to those locations in the corpus at which it applies and each location in the corpus to those candidate rules that apply there.
    Such an index allows t
