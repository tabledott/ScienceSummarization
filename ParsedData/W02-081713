ntributors are not shown any items already tagged by contributors (anonymous or not) from the same IP address.
    Logged in contributors are not shown items they have already tagged.
    Second, inaccurate sessions will be discarded.
    This can be accomplished in two ways, roughly by checking agreement and precision: Using redundancy of tags collected for each item, any given session (a tagging done all in one sitting) will be checked for agreement with tagging of the same items collected outside of this session.
    If necessary, the precision of a given contributor with respect to a preexisting gold standard (such as SemCor or Senseval training data) can be estimated directly by presenting the contributor with examples from the gold standard.
    This will be implemented if there are indications of need for this in the pilot; it will help screen out contributors who, for example, always select the first sense (and are in high agreement with other contributors who do the same).
    In all, automatic asses
