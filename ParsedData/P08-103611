ly simplistic model is the presence of opinions about an item in general without referring to any particular aspect.
    For example, &#8220;this product is the worst I have ever purchased&#8221; is a good predictor of low ratings for every aspect.
    In such cases, non-aspect &#8216;background&#8217; words will appear to be the most predictive.
    Therefore, the use of the aspect sentiment classifiers based only on the words assigned to the corresponding topics is problematic.
    Such a model will not be able to discover coherent topics associated with each aspect, because in many cases the most predictive fragments for each aspect rating will not be the ones where this aspect is discussed.
    Our proposal is to estimate the distribution of possible values of an aspect rating on the basis of the overall sentiment rating and to use the words assigned to the corresponding topic to compute corrections for this aspect.
    An aspect rating is typically correlated to the overall sentiment rating5 and the frag
