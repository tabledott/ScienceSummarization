particular meaning.
  Parsing, on the other hand, is usu- ally thought of as proceeding bottom-up in an effort to determine what properties hold of a given expression.
  As we have mentioned, however, both of these processes can be seen as variants of a single method for extracting certain goal theorems from the deductive closure of some given premises under the rules or constraints of the grammar.
  The various processes differ as to what the premises are and which goal theorems are of interest.
  In generation~ for instance, the premises are the lexical items of the language and goal theorems are of the form "expression a is a sentence with meaning M" for some given M. In parsing, the premises are the words a of the sentence to be parsed and goal theorems are of the form "expression a is a sentence (with properties P)".
  In this case, a is given a priori.
  This deductive view of language processing clearly presupposes an axiomatic approach to language description.
