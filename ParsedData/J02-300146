    The lattice is used to select a subset of the available distributions to combine.
    The less-specific distributions were used only when no data were present for any more-specific distribution.
    Thus, the distributions selected are arranged in a cut across the lattice representing the most-specific distributions for which data are available.
    The selected probabilities were combined with both linear interpolation and a geometric mean, with results shown in Table 5.
    The final row of the table represents the baseline Lattice organization of the distributions from Table 3, with more-specific distributions toward the top. of always selecting the most common role of the target word for all its constituents, that is, using only P(r I t).
    Although this lattice is reminiscent of techniques of backing off to less specific distributions commonly used in n-gram language modeling, it differs in that we use the lattice only to select distributions for which the conditioning event has bee
