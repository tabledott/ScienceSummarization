 to be learned.
    That transformation is applied to the right-linear structures, and then learning proceeds on the corpus of improved sentence bracketings.
    The following procedure is carried out repeatedly on the training corpus until no more transformations can be found whose application reduces the error in parsing the training corpus: 4.
    Go to 1.

    After a set of transformations has been learned, it can be used to effectively parse fresh text.
    To parse fresh text, the text is first naively parsed and then every transformation is applied, in order, to the naively parsed text.
    One nice feature of this method is that different measures of bracketing success can be used: learning can proceed in such a way as to try to optimize any specified measure of success.
    The measure we have chosen for our experiments is the same measure described in (PS92), which is one of the measures that arose out of a parser evaluation workshop (ea91).
    The measure is the per
