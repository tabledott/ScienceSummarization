    This framework defines a kernel between input objects by applying convolution &#8220;sub-kernels&#8221; that are the kernels for the decompositions (parts) of the objects. previous work from the viewpoint of feature exploration.
    We conclude our work and indicate the future work in Section 6.
  
  
    Many techniques on relation extraction, such as rule-based (MUC, 1987-1998; Miller et al., 2000), feature-based (Kambhatla 2004; Zhou et al., 2005) and kernel-based (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), have been proposed in the literature.
    Rule-based methods for this task employ a number of linguistic rules to capture various relation patterns.
    Miller et al. (2000) addressed the task from the syntactic parsing viewpoint and integrated various tasks such as POS tagging, NE tagging, syntactic parsing, template extraction and relation extraction using a generative model.
