o choose for each utterance one of the Statement tags (or possibly none), one of the Influencing-Addressee-Future-Action tags, and so forth&#8212;and agreement was evaluated separately for each dimension using (unweighted) K. Core and Allen found values of K ranging from 0.76 for answer to 0.42 for agreement to 0.15 for Committing-Speaker-Future-Action.
    Using different coding instructions and on a different corpus, Di Eugenio et al. observed higher agreement, ranging from K = 0.93 (for other-forward-function) to 0.54 (for the tag agreement).
    These relatively low levels of agreement led many researchers to return to &#8220;flat&#8221; tagsets for dialogue acts, incorporating however in their schemes some of the insights motivating the work on schemes such as DAMSL.
    The best known example of this type of approach is the development of the SWITCHBOARD-DAMSL tagset by Jurafsky, Shriberg, and Biasca (1997), which incorporates many ideas from the &#8220;multi-dimensional&#8221; theories of dialogue acts
