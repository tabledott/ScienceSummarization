  We see these results as an indication that shallow discourse processing with a well-designed set of surface-based indicators is possible.
    The metadiscourse features, one focus of our work, currently depend on manual resources.
    The experiments reported here explore whether metadiscourse information is useful for the automatic determination of rhetorical status (as opposed to more shallow features), and this is clearly the case.
    The next step, however, should be the automatic creation of such resources.
    For the task of dialogue act disambiguation, Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker (1999) suggest a method of automatically finding cue phrases for disambiguation.
    It may be possible to apply this or a similar method to our data and to compare the performance of automatically gained resources with manual ones.
    Further work can be done on the semantic verb clusters described in section 4.2.
