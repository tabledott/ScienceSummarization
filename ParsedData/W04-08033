   The FrameNet project has just released a major revision (FrameNet 1.1) to its database, with 487 frames using 696 distinctly-named frame elements (although it is not guaranteed that frame elements with the same name have the same meaning).
    This release includes 132,968 annotated sentences (mostly taken from the British National Corpus).
    The Senseval-3 task used 8,002 of these sentences selected randomly from 40 frames (also selected randomly) having at least 370 annotations (out of the 100 frames having the most annotations).1 Participants were provided with a training set that identified, for each of the 40 frames, the lexical unit identification number (which equates to a file name) and a sentence identification name.
    They were also provided with the answers, i.e., the frame element names and their beginning and ending positions.
    Since the training set was much larger than the test set, participants were required to use the FrameNet 1.1 dataset to obtain the full sentence, its target word
