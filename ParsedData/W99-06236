red such that the constituents require estimated probabilities strictly larger than 0.5 to be accepted, there is not enough probability mass remaining on crossing brackets for them to be included in the hypothesis.
    In general, the lemma of the previous section does not ensure that all the productions in the combined parse are found in the grammars of the member parsers.
    There is a guarantee of no crossing brackets but there is no guarantee that a constituent in the tree has the same children as it had in any of the three original parses.
    One can trivially create situations in which strictly binary-branching trees are combined to create a tree with only the root node and the terminal nodes, a completely flat structure.
    This drastic tree manipulation is not appropriate for situations in which we want to assign particular structures to sentences.
    For example, we may have semantic information (e.g. database query operations) associated with the productions in a grammar.
    If the parse contai
