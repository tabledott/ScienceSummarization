ws; indeed, according to our results, a breaking news article would feature a higher percentage of motion verbs rather than verbs of communication.
    Verbs are an important factor in providing an event profile, which in turn might be used in categorizing articles into different genres.
    Turning to the literature in genre classification, Biber (1989) outlines five dimensions which can be used to characterize genre.
    Properties for distinguishing dimensions include verbal features such as tense, agentless passives and infinitives.
    Biber also refers to three verb classes: private, public, and suasive verbs.
    Karlgren and Cutting (1994) take a computationally tractable set of these properties and use them to compute a score to recognize text genre using discriminant analysis.
    The only verbal feature used in their study is present-tense verb count.
    As Karlgren and Cutting show, their techniques are effective in genre categorization, but they do not claim to show how genres differ.
