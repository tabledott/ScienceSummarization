what is the existence of error and inconsistency in the treebank tagging.
    Some tags seem to have been relatively easy for the human treebank taggers, and have few errors.
    Other tags have explicit caveats that, however welljustified, proved difficult to remember for the taggers&#8212;for instance, there are 37 instances of a PP being tagged with LGS (logical subject) in spite of the guidelines specifically saying, '[LGS] attaches to the NP object of by and not to the PP node itself.'
    (Bies et al., 1995) Each mistagging in the test corpus can cause up to two spurious errors, one in precision and one in recall.
    Still another source of difficulty comes when the guidelines are vague or silent on a specific issue.
    To return to logical subjects, it is clear that `the loss' is a logical subject in 'The company was hurt by the loss', but what about in 'The company was unperturbed by the loss'?
    In addition, a number of the function tags are authorised for 'metaphorical use', but what exactly con
