he utility of combining knowledge sources.
    We then present two methods for enhancing performance: error analysis, and machine learning (Section 4.3).8 Here we use the 10 narratives previously used for testing as training data.
    The resulting algorithms are then tested on 5 new narratives.
    By using enriched linguistic information and by allowing more complex interactions among linguistic devices, both methods achieve results that approach human performance.
    4.1.1 Algorithm Input and Output.
    Each algorithm is designed to replicate the subjects' segmentation task (break up a narrative into contiguous segments, with segment breaks falling between prosodic phrases).
    The input to each algorithm is a set of potential boundary sites, coded with respect to a wide variety of linguistic features.
    The output is a classification of each potential boundary site as either boundary or nonboundary.
    In the target output, we classify a potential boundary site as boundary if it was identified as su
