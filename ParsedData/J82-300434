biguous&amp;quot; generalization; given a Catalan grammar, chart parsers will eventually enumerate all possible values of i, j, and k. Thus far, most of our derivations have been justified in terms of successive approximation.
    It is also possible to derive some interesting (and well-known) results directly from the grammar itself.
    Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that we choose to analyze adjuncts with a right branching grammar.14 (By convention, terminal symbols appear in lower case.)
    First we translate the grammar into an equation in the usual way.
    That is, ADJS is modeled as a parallel combination of two subgrammars, adj ADJS and A.
    (A, the empty string, is modeled as 1 because it is the 14 A similar analysis of adjuncts is adopted in Kaplan and Bresnan 1981.
    This analysis can also be defended on performance grounds as an efficiency approximation.
    (This approximation is in the spirit of pseudo-attachment (Church 1980).)
    We can simplify (31b) so the right hand side is exp
