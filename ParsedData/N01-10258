 a chunk.
    O Current token is outside of any chunk.
    B Current token is the beginning of a chunk which immediately follows another chunk.
    Tjong Kim Sang calls this method as IOB1 representation, and introduces three alternative versions &#8212; IOB2,IOE1 and IOE2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999).
    IOB2 A B tag is given for every token which exists at the beginning of a chunk.
    Other tokens are the same as IOB1.
    This method has been used for the Japanese named entity extraction task, and requires the following five tags for representing proper chunks(Uchimoto et al., 2000) 1.
    1Originally, Uchimoto uses C/E/U/O/S representation.
    However we rename them as B/I/O/E/S for our purpose, since B Current token is the start of a chunk consisting of more than one token.
    E Current token is the end of a chunk consisting of more than one token.
    I Current token is a middle of a chunk consisting of more than two tokens.
    S Current token is a chunk consisting of only one token.
    O C
