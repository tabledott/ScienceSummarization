acking off takes place - from Awnlwi, w2....tun_i) to P(wn1w2, w3....tun_i) to P(wnlw3, w4....wn_i) and so on.
    There is no such sequence in the PP-attachment problem, and because of this there are four possible triples when backing off from quadruples ((v, nl, p), (v,p, n2), (nl,p, n2) and (v, nl, n2)) and six possible pairs when backing off from triples ((v,p), (nl,p), (p, n2), (v, n1), (v, n2) and (nl, n2)).
    A key observation in choosing between these tuples is that the preposition is particularly important to the attachment decision.
    For this reason only tuples which contained the preposition were used in backed off estimates - this reduces the problem to a choice between 3 triples and 3 pairs at each respective stage.
    Section 6.2 describes experiments which show that tuples containing the preposition are much better indicators of attachment.
    The following method of combining the counts was found to work best in practice: Note that this method effectively gives more weight to tuples wit
