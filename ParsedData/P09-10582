sed on a word-based Markov model and a character-based maximum entropy model that can be completed in a reasonable time.
    However, this training method is limited by the generatively-trained Markov model in which informative features are hard to exploit.
    In this paper, we overcome such limitations concerning both efficiency and effectiveness.
    We propose a new framework for training the wordcharacter hybrid model based on the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer, 2004; Crammer et al., 2005; McDonald, 2006).
    We describe k-best decoding for our hybrid model and design its loss function and the features appropriate for our task.
    In our word-character hybrid model, allowing the model to learn the characteristics of both known and unknown words is crucial to achieve optimal performance.
    Here, we describe our strategies that yield good balance for learning these two characteristics.
    We propose an errordriven policy that delivers this balance by acquiring examples of unknown wor
