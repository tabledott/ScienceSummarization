e assign each document in that tuple to a new singledocument tuple.
    By doing this, every document in S has its own distribution over topics, independent of any other documents.
    Ideally, the &#8220;glue&#8221; documents in g will be sufficient to align the topics across languages, and will cause comparable documents in S to have similar distributions over topics even though they are modeled independently.
