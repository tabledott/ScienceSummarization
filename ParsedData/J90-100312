ixed by dividing f (x, y) by w &#8212; 1 (which has the consequence of subtracting log2 (w &#8212; 1) = 2 from our association ratio scores).

When /(x, y) is large, the association ratio produces very credible results not unlike those reported in Palermo and Jenkins (1964), as illustrated in Table 3.
    In contrast, when /(x, y) = 0, the pairs are less interesting.
    (As a very rough rule of thumb, we have observed that pairs with /(x, y) &gt; 3 tend to be interesting, and pairs with smaller /(x, y) are generally not.
    One can make this statement precise by calibrating the measure with subjective measures.
    Alternatively, one could make estimates of the variance and then make statements about confidence levels, e.g. with 95% confidence, P(x, y) &gt;
