ally in its decision-making.
    However, some local contexts hardly provide any constraint on the meaning of a word.
    For example, the object of &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; can practically be anything.
    This type of contexts should be filtered out or discounted in decision-making.
    Our assumption that similar words appear in identical context does not always hold.
    For example, where PER refers to proper names recognized as persons.
    None of these is similar to the &amp;quot;body part&amp;quot; meaning of &amp;quot;heart&amp;quot;.
    In fact, &amp;quot;heart&amp;quot; is the only body part that beats.
  
  
    We have presented a new algorithm for word sense disambiguation.
    Unlike most previous corpusbased WSD algorithm where separate classifiers are trained for different words, we use the same local context database and a concept hierarchy as the knowledge sources for disambiguating all words.
    This allows our algorithm to deal with infrequent words or unknown proper nouns.
