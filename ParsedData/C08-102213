have a more lin guistically grounded explanation.From the table, the frequency effect appears evi dent: in almost every case, the three most frequentwrong choices are the three most frequent prepo sitions, to, of, and in, although interestingly not inthat order, in usually being the first choice.
			Conversely, the less frequent prepositions are less of ten suggested as the classifier?s choice.
			This effectprecludes the possibility at the moment of draw ing any linguistic conclusions.
			These may only be gleaned by looking at the errors for the three more frequent prepositions.
			We see for example that there seems to be a strong relation between of and for, the cause of which is not immediately clear: perhaps they both often occur within noun phrases(e.g. book of recipes, book for recipes).
			More pre dictable is the confusion between to and from, andbetween locative prepositions such as to and at, al though the effect is less strong for other potentially confusable pairs such as in and at or on.
