    By applying a maximum-likelihood approach to the joint probability of a parallel corpus we obtained an optimization criterion for bilingual word classes which is very similar to the one used in monolingual maximum-likelihood word clustering.
    For optimization we used the exchange algorithm.
    The obtained word classes give a low translation lexicon perplexity and improve the quality of staProceedings of EACL '99 tistical machine translation.
    We expect improvements in translation quality by allowing that words occur in more than one class and by performing a hierarchical clustering.
