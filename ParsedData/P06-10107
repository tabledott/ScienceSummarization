    Armed with the English and Chinese candidate lists, we then consider the pairing of every English candidate with every Chinese candidate.
    Obviously it would be impractical to do this for all of the candidates generated for, say, an entire year: we consider as plausible pairings those candidates that occur within a day of each other in the two corpora.
    We adopt a source-channel model for scoring English-Chinese transliteration pairs.
    In general, we seek to estimate P(elc), where e is a word in Roman script, and c is a word in Chinese script.
    Since Chinese transliteration is mostly based on pronunciation, we estimate P(e&#8242;|c&#8242;), where e&#8242; is the pronunciation of e and c&#8242; is the pronunciation of c. Again f
