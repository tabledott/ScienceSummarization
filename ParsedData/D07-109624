antly head-initial or head-final).
			This is followed by the average numberof HEAD=0 dependencies per sentence and the per centage of non-projective arcs and sentences.
			The last two rows show whether punctuation tokens are attached as dependents of other tokens (A=Always,S=Sometimes) and specify the number of depen dency labels that exist for punctuation tokens.
			Note that punctuation is defined as any token belonging to the UTF-8 category of punctuation.

			For the domain adaptation sets, the percentage of new words is computed with regard to the training set (Penn Treebank).
