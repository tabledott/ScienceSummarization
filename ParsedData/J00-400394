    Vieira and Poesio Processing Definite Descriptions Sidner's Theory of Definite Anaphora Cornprehension.
    In her dissertation, Sidner (1979) proposed a complete theory of definite NP resolution, including detailed algorithms for resolving pronouns, anaphoric definite descriptions, and bridging descriptions.
    She also proposed methods for resolving larger situation uses; the one class her methods do not handle are those definite descriptions that, following Hawkins, we have called unfamiliar uses.
    The main contribution of Sidner's dissertation is her theory of focus and its role in resolving definite NPs; to this day, her focus-tracking algorithms are arguably the most detailed account of the phenomenon.
    The main problem with Sidner's work from our perspective is that her algorithms rely heavily on the availability of a semantic network and causal reasoner; furthermore, some of the inference mechanisms are left relatively underspecified (this latter problem was
