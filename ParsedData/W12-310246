rmine a subset of relevant features.
    The final submission used these relevant features to train an SVM system whose parameters were optimized with respect to the final evaluation metrics.
    UEDIN (R, S): The system uses the baseline features along with some additional features: binary features for named entities in source using Stanford NER Tagger; binary indicators for occurrence of quotes or parenthetical segments, words in upper case and numbers; geometric mean of target word probabilities and probability of worst scoring word under a Discriminative Word Lexicon Model; Sparse Neural Network directly mapping from source to target (using the vector space model) with source and target side either filtered to relevant words or hashed to reduce dimensionality; number of times at least a 3-gram is seen normalized by sentence length; and Levenshtein distance of either source or translation to closest entry of the SMT training corpus on word or character level.
