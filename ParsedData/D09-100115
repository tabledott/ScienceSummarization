formulas in our MLN, we should emphasize that they should not be confused with the atoms and formulas in the QLFs, which are represented by reified constants and variables.
    To model distributions over lambda forms, we introduce the predicates Form(p, f!) and ArgForm(p, i, f!
    ), where p is a part, i is the index of an argument, and f is a QLF subformula.
    Form(p, f) is true iff part p has core form f, and ArgForm(p, i, f) is true iff the ith argument in p has form f.3 The &#8220;f!&#8221; notation signifies that each part or argument can have only one form.
    To model distributions over arguments, we introduce three more predicates: ArgType(p, i, a!) signifies that the ith argument of p is assigned to argument type a; Arg(p, i, p&#8242;) signifies that the ith argument of p is p&#8242;; Number(p, a, n) signifies that there are n arguments of p that are assigned to type a.
    The truth value of Number(p, a, n) is determined by the ArgType atoms.
