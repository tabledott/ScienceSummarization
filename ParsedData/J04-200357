been examined: (1) Using the full 58,000 sentences comprising the bilingual training corpus, (2) restricting the corpus to 5,000 sentences, and (3) using only a conventional dictionary.
    For each of these setups, a relative improvement in terms of subjective sentence error rate between 13% and 15% as compared to the baseline could be obtained using combinations of the methods described in this article.
    The amount of bilingual training data could be reduced to less than 10% of the original corpus, while losing only 1.6% in accuracy as measured by the subjective sentence error rate.
    A relative improvement of 16.5% in terms of subjective sentence error rate could also be achieved on the Nespole! task.
