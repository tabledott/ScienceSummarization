erving at the learning curve, further improvement will be possible if we increase the size of the training data.
    Table 4 shows the relationship between the dimension of the kernel function and the parsing accuracy under the condition k = 5.
    As a result, the case of d = 4 gives the best accuracy.
    We could not carry out the training in realistic time for the case of d = 1.
    This result supports our intuition that we need a combination of at least two features.
    In other words, it will be hard to confirm a dependency relation with only the features of the modifier or the modfiee.
    It is natural that a dependency relation is decided by at least the information from both of two chunks.
    In addition, further improvement has been possible by considering combinations of three or more features.
    Sekine (Sekine et al., 2000) gives an interesting report about the relationship between the beam width and the parsing accuracy.
    Generally, high parsing accuracy is expected when a large beam wid
