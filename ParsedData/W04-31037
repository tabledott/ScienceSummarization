e biologists present expressed this sort of information need.
    On the other hand, one of the authors has also encountered the opposite need: &#8220;I am looking for definite statements about transcription factors that interact with NF Kappa B.&#8221; Both these information needs would be easier to fulfill if automated annotation of speculative passages was possible.
    In the context of information extraction, a similar situation exists.
    For example, extracting tables of protein-protein interactions would benefit from knowing which interactions were speculative and which were definite.
    In the context of knowledge discovery (KR), speculation might play a number of roles.
    One possibility would be to use current speculative statements about a topic of interest as a seed for the automated knowledge discovery process.
    For example, terms could be extracted from speculative fragments and used to guide the initial steps of the knowledge discovery process.
