e same datasets).
    Similarly, when SRL features are added to the baseline system, we register an increase in the accuracy rate for pronouns, ranging from 0.7% in BNEWS and NWIRE up to 4.2% in the MERGED dataset (+26 correctly resolved pronouns out of 620).
    If semantics helps for pronouns and common nouns, it does not affect performance on proper names, where features such as string matching and alias suffice.
    This suggests that semantics plays a role in pronoun and common noun resolution, where surface features cannot account for complex preferences and semantic knowledge is required.
    The best accuracy improvement on pronoun resolution is obtained on the MERGED dataset.
    This is due to making more data available to the classifier, as the SRL features are very sparse and inherently suffer from data fragmentation.
    Using a larger dataset highlights the importance of SRL, whose features are never removed in any feature selection process8.
    The accuracy on common nouns shows that features
