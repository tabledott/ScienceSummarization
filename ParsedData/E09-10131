 all possible senses of an ambiguous word.
    It is related to, but distinct from, word sense disambiguation (WSD) where the senses are assumed to be known and the aim is to identify the intended meaning of the ambiguous word in context.
    Although the bulk of previous work has been devoted to the disambiguation problem1, there are good reasons to believe that sense induction may be able to overcome some of the issues associated with WSD.
    Since most disambiguation methods assign senses according to, and with the aid of, dictionaries or other lexical resources, it is difficult to adapt them to new domains or to languages where such resources are scarce.
    A related problem concerns the granularity of the sense distinctions which is fixed, and may not be entirely suitable for different applications.
    In contrast, when sense distinctions are inferred directly from the data, they are more likely to represent the task and domain at hand.
    There is little risk that an important sense will be left out
