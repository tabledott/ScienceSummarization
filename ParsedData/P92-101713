riately so that the valid spans and their split points are efficiently enumerated.
  
  
    The following experiments, although preliminary, give some support to our earlier suggested advantages of the inside-outside algorithm for partially bracketed corpora.
    The first experiment involves an artificial example used by Lan i and Young (1990) in a previous evaluation of the inside-outside algorithm.
    In this case, training on a bracketed corpus can lead to a good solution while no reasonable solution is found training on raw text only.
    The second experiment uses a naturally occurring corpus and its partially bracketed version provided by the Penn Treebank (Brill et al., 1990).
    We compare the bracketings assigned by grammars inferred from raw and from bracketed training material with the Penn Treebank bracketings of a separate test set.
    To evaluate objectively the accuracy of the analyses yielded by a grammar G, we use a Viterbi-style parser to find the most likely analysis of each test sente
