 off must themselves be very frequent in the language.
    In such a framework, if we try to annotate categories with any detailed lexical information, many sentences either entirely fail to parse, or have only extremely weird parses.
    The resulting battle against sparsity means that we can only afford to make a few distinctions which have major distributional impact.
    Even with the individual-lexeme annotations in this section, the grammar still has only 9255 states compared to the 7619 of the baseline model.
    6 Annotations Already in the Treebank At this point, one might wonder as to the wisdom of stripping off all treebank functional tags, only to heuristically add other such markings back in to the grammar.
    By and large, the treebank out-of-the tags, such as have negative utility.
    Recall that the raw treebank gramwith no annotation or markovization, had an of 72.62% on our development set.
    With the functional annotation left in, this drops to 71.49%.
