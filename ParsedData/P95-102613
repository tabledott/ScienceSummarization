al decision list for plant is given below.
    Note that the original seed words are no longer at the top of the list.
    They have been displaced by more broadly applicable collocations that better partition the newly learned classes.
    In cases where there are multiple seeds, it is even possible for an original seed for SENSE-A to become an indicator for SENSE-B if the collocate is more compatible with this second class.
    Thus the noise introduced by a few irrelevant or misleading seed words is not fatal.
    It may be corrected if the majority of the seeds forms a coherent collocation space.
    When this decision list is applied to a new test sentence, ... the loss of animal and plant species through extinction ... , the highest ranking collocation found in the target context (species) is used to classify the example as SENSE-A (a living plant).
    If available, information from other occurrences of &amp;quot;plant&amp;quot; in the discourse may override this classification, as described in Section
