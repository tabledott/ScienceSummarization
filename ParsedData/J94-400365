which words that are syntactically related to an ambiguous word are used to indicate its most probable sense.
    Statistical data on the co-occurrence of syntactically related words with each of the alternative senses reflect semantic and lexical preferences and constraints of these senses.
    In addition, these statistics may provide information about the topics of discourse that are typical for each sense.
    Ideally, the syntactic relations between words should be identified using a syntactic parser, in both the training and the disambiguation phases.
    Since robust syntactic parsers are not widely available, and those that exist are not always accurate, it is possible to use various approximations to identify relevant syntactic relations between words.
    Hearst (1991) uses a stochastic part of speech tagger and a simple scheme for partial parsing of short phrases.
    The structures achieved by this analysis are used to identify approximated syntactic relations between words.
