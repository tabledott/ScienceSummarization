    As mentioned for the complex nominal and coordinated conjunction axioms, any proof that uses these axioms should be penalized and ranked lower than those that do not.
    Note that for this axiom to be effective, an axiom linking the heads of the apposition is built: all x8 x9 x10 x11 x12 (mother nn(x8) &amp; of in(x8,x9) &amp; forest nn(x9) big nn(x10) &amp; basin nn(x11) &amp; nn nnc(x12,x10,x11) &amp; s pos(x8,x12) &amp; tall jj(x8) &amp; redwood nn(x8))
  
  
    The search strategy used is the Set of Support Strategy, which partitions the axioms used during the course of a proof into those that have support and those that are considered auxiliary (Wos 1988).
    The axioms with support are placed in the Set of Support (SOS) list and are intended to guide the proof.
    The auxiliary axioms are placed in the Usable list and are used to help the SOS infer new clauses.
    This strategy restricts the search such that a new clause is inferred if and only
