  Unsupervised Learning Of Disambiguation Rules For Part Of Speech Tagging
  
    In this paper we describe an unsupervised learning algorithm for automatically training a rule-based part of speech tagger without using a manually tagged corpus.
    We compare this algorithm to the Baum-Welch algorithm, used for unsupervised training of stochastic taggers.
    Next, we show a method for combining unsupervised and supervised rule-based training algorithms to create a highly accurate tagger using only a small amount of manually tagged text.
  
  
    There has recently been a great deal of work exploring methods for automatically training part of speech taggers, as an alternative to laboriously hand-crafting rules for tagging, as was done in the past [Klein and Simmons, 1963; Harris, 1962].
    Almost all of the work in the area of automatically trained taggers has explored Markov-model based part of speech tagging [Jelinek, 1985; Church, 1988; Derose, 1988; DeMarcken, 1990; Cutting et al., 1992; Kupiec, 1992;
