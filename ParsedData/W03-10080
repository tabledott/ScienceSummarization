  Identifying Semantic Roles Using Combinatory Categorial Grammar
  
    We present a system for automatically identifying PropBank-style semantic roles based on the output of a statistical parser for Combinatory Categorial Grammar.
    This system performs at least as well as a system based on a traditional Treebank parser, and outperforms it on core argument roles.
  
  
    Correctly identifying the semantic roles of sentence constituents is a crucial part of interpreting text, and in addition to forming an important part of the information extraction problem, can serve as an intermediate step in machine translation or automatic summarization.
    Even for a single predicate, semantic arguments can have multiple syntactic realizations, as shown by the following paraphrases: Recently, attention has turned to creating corpora annotated with argument structures.
    The PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) and the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) projects both document the variation in syntactic realization of
