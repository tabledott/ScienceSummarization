tain nodes have been packed into one packed node.
    Although these two nodes have the same category name (e.g., NP), they may have different attribute values.
    When a certain test in the Lisp function refers to an attribute of the packed node, its value may not be uniquely determined.
    In this case, the parser can no longer treat the packed node as one node, and the parser will unpack the packed node into two individual nodes again.
    The question, then, is how often this unpacking needs to take place in practice.
    The more frequently it takes place, the less significant it is to do local ambiguity packing.
    However, most of sentence ambiguity comes from such phenomena as PP-attachment and conjunction scoping, and it is unlikely to require unpacking in these cases.
    For instance, consider the noun phrase: a man in the park with a telescope, which is locally ambiguous (whether telescope modifies man or park).
    Two NP nodes (one for each interpretation) will be packed into one node, but it
