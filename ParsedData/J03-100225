preceding target word C(eaj&#8722;1): p(aj  |aj&#8722;1,I,C(eaj&#8722;1)).
    Similarly, we can include dependencies on source and target word classes in Models 4 and 5 (Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer 1993).
    The categorization of the words into classes (here: 50 classes) is performed automatically by using the statistical learning procedure described in Kneser and Ney (1993).
    2.3.3 Overview of Models.
    The main differences among the statistical alignment models lie in the alignment model they employ (zero-order or first-order), the fertility model they employ, and the presence or absence of deficiency.
    In addition, the models differ with regard to the efficiency of the E-step in the EM algorithm (Section 3.1).
    Table 1 offers an overview of the properties of the various alignment models.
