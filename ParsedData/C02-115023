.We note that the average numbers of labels out put by the coarse and fine classifiers are 1.54 and 2.05 resp., (using the feature set RelWord and 5,500 training examples), which shows the decision model is accurate as well as efficient.
			Comparison of the hierarchical and the flat classifier The flat classifier consists of one classifier which isalmost the same as the fine classifier in the hierar chical case, except that its initial confusion set is the whole set of fine classes.
			Our original hope was that the hierarchical classifier would have a better performance, given that its fine classifier only needs to deal with a smaller confusion set.
			However, it turns out that there is a tradeoff between this factor and the inaccuracy, albeit small, of the coarse levelprediction.
			As the results show, there is no perfor mance advantage for using a level of coarse classes, and the semantically appealing coarse classes do not contribute to better performance.
