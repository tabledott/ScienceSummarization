end these rules further.
    The numerical case is identified using two rules: the num subtype is added if any argument in a GR is assigned the lexical category N/N[num], and if any of the arguments in an ncmod is POS tagged CD. prt is added to an ncmod if the modifiee has a POS tag beginning V and if the modifier has POS tag RP.
    We are not advocating that any of these post-processing rules should form part of a parser.
    It would be preferable to have the required information in the treebank from which the grammar is extracted, so that it could be integrated into the parser in a principled way.
    However, in order that the parser evaluation be as fair and informative as possible, it is important that the parser output conform as closely to the gold standard as possible.
    Thus it is appropriate to use any general transformation rules, as long as they are simple and not specific to the test set, to achieve this.
    The final columns of Table 16 show the accuracy of the transformed gold-standard CCG
