o communicated and in what order cannot simply be derived from general principles.
    We have also argued that in many existing text planning systems, such DCK has been encoded implicitly.
    In the interest of efficiency, modularity and portability we have decided to represent DCK explicitly in Joyce.
    We have developed a &amp;quot;schema language&amp;quot; for easy representation of DCK, called DICKENS (DomaIn Communication Knowledge ENcoding Schemas).
    The schemas are similar in form to those used by McKeown.
    Basically, schemas can be seen as a description of text structure.
    The system, however, interprets each schema as a list of instructions.
    The instructions can be calls to other schemas, recursive calls to the same schema, or they can be one of a set of special commands provided by the schema language.
    One special command produces a specific proposition and sends it to the sentence planner.
    Other special commands support conditional branching and iteration.
