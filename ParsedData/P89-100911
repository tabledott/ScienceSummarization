stinguish one of these en- tities, zl, from all the others.
  Suppose, also, that the domain includes a number of attributes (a I, a~, and so on), and that each attribute has a number of permissible values {v,,t, v,,2, and so on}; and that each entity is described by a set of attribute- value pairs.
  In order to distinguish z~ from the other entities in U, we need to find some set of attribute-value pairs which are together true of zl, but of no other entity in U.
  This set of attribute- value pairs constitutes a distinguishing descriptior, of xl with respect to the ,~ontext U.
  A mini- mal distinguishing description is then a set of such attribute-value pairs, where the cardinality of that set is such that there are no other sets of attribute- value pairs of lesser cardinality which are sufficient to distinguish the intended referent.
  We find a minimal distinguishing description by observing that different attribute-value pairs differ in the effectiveness with which they distin- guish an entity from a s
