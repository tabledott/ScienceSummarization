ed on the subjectivity-annotated corpus described in Section 4.1.
    While the highest precision for the subjective classification is obtained with the rule-based classifier, the overall best result of 67.85 F-measure is due to the machine learning approach.
    This result is consistent with the annotation studies, showing that the corpus projections preserve subjectivity more reliably than the lexicon translations.
    Finally, neither one of the classifiers relies on language-specific information, but rather on knowledge obtained through projections from English.
    A similar method can therefore be used to derive tools for subjectivity analysis in other languages.
