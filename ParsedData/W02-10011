porated in the model.However, recent theoretical and experimental re sults in (Laerty et al 2001) have highlighted problems with the parameter estimation method for ME models.
			In response to these problems, they describe alternative parameter estimation methods based on Conditional Markov RandomFields (CRFs).
			(Laerty et al 2001) give experimental results suggesting that CRFs can per form signi cantly better than ME models.In this paper we describe parameter estima tion algorithms which are natural alternatives toCRFs.
			The algorithms are based on the percep tron algorithm (Rosenblatt 58), and the voted or averaged versions of the perceptron described in (Freund  Schapire 99).
			These algorithms have been shown by (Freund  Schapire 99) to be competitive with modern learning algorithms such as support vector machines; however, theyhave previously been applied mainly to classi cation tasks, and it is not entirely clear how the algorithms can be carried across to NLP tasks such as tagging or parsing.This
