y only nondeterministic transducers.
    If for every regular relation there is a deterministic acceptor, then the standard technique (Hoperoft and Ullman 1979) of interchanging its final and nonfinal states could be used to produce an fst accepting the complement relation, which would therefore be regular.
    Closure under intersection and relative difference, however, are crucial for our treatment of two-level rule systems in Section 7.
    But these properties are required only for the same-length regular relations, and it turns out that this subclass is closed in the necessary ways.
    The same-length relations contain only string-pairs (x, y) such that the length of x is the same as the length of y.
    It may seem obvious that the relevant closure properties do hold for this subclass, but for the sake of completeness we sketch the technical details of the constructions by which they can be established.
    We make use of some auxiliary definitions regarding the path-language of a transducer.
