l rather than swapping configuration (the configuration of sin escalas and Boston around flights:los vuelos in Figure 6), the construction is the same, except for the following differences: Other states are the same as for the first case.
    The resulting states and transitions are shown in Figure 10.
    After the construction described above is applied to the entire set of aligned hitexts in the training set, the counts for transitions are treated as event observation counts of a statistical dependency transduction model with the parameters described in Section 3.1.
    More specifically, the negated logs of these parameters are used as the weights for transducer transitions.
    In the translation application, source word w and target word v are generalized so they can be short substrings (compounds) of the source and target strings.
    Examples of such multiword pairs are show me:muestreme and nonstop:sin escalas in Figure 6.
    The cost for such pairings still uses the same 0 statistic, now taking the
