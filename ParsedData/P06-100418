t of a sub-topic.
    We define a segment to be a sub-topic that signals a prominent shift in subject matter.
    Disregarding this sub-topic change would impair the high-level understanding of the structure and the content of the lecture.
    As part of our human segmentation analysis, we asked three annotators to segment the Physics lecture corpus.
    These annotators had taken the class in the past and were familiar with the subject matter under consideration.
    We wrote a detailed instruction manual for the task, with annotation guidelines for the most part following the model used by Gruenstein et al. (2005).
    The annotators were instructed to segment at a level of granularity that would identify most of the prominent topical transitions necessary for a summary of the lecture.
    The annotators used the NOMOS annotation software toolkit, developed for meeting segmentation (Gruenstein et al., 2005).
    They were provided with recorded audio of the lectures and the corresponding text transcriptions
