    Of course, this assumption over-simplistically Wu Bilingual Parsing blends syntactic and semantic notions.
    That semantic frames for different languages share common core arguments is more plausible than that syntactic frames do.
    In effect we are relying on the tendency of syntactic arguments to correlate closely with semantics.
    If in particular cases this assumption does not hold, however, the damage is not too great&#8212;the model will simply drop the offending word matchings (dropping as few as possible).
    In experiments with the minimal bracketing transduction grammar, the large majority of errors in word alignment were caused by two outside factors.
    First, word matchings can be overlooked simply due to deficiencies in our translation lexicon.
    This accounted for approximately 42% of the errors.
    Second, sentences containing nonliteral translations obviously cannot be aligned down to the word level.
    This accounted for another approximate 50% of the errors.
