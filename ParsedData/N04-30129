set based on whatever corpus has been used to compute information content.
    Note that these values are pre&#8211;computed, so these methods are simply reading from an information content file.
    DepthFinder.pm provides methods that read values that have been pre&#8211;computed by the wnDepths.pl utility.
    This program finds the depth of every synset in WordNet, and also shows the is&#8211;a hierarchy in which a synset occurs.
    If a synset has multiple parents, then each possible depth and home hierarchy is returned.
    The depth of a synset is returned by getDepthOfSynset() and getTaxonomyDepth() provides the maximum depth for a given is&#8211;a hierarchy.
    LCSFinder.pm provides methods that find the least common subsumer of two concepts using three different criteria.
    These are necessary since there is multiple inheritance of concepts in WordNet, and different LCS can be selected for a pair of concepts if one or both of them have multiple parents in an is&#8211;a hiearchy. getLCSbyIC() cho
