    2 &#215; 109 words), 82.84% for a large corpus (approx.
    1 x 1011 words).
    Without a corpus nor a thesaurus (but with glosses in a dictionary), we obtained accuracy that is comparable to Turney and Littman&#8217;s with a medium-sized corpus.
    When we enhance the lexical network with corpus and thesaurus, our result is comparable to Turney and Littman&#8217;s with a large corpus.
    We examine how accurately our prediction method for Q works by comparing Table 1 above and Table 2 below.
    Our method predicts good Q quite well especially for 14 seed words.
    For small numbers of seed words, our method using magnetization tends to predict a little larger value.
    We also display the figure of magnetization and accuracy in Figure 1.
    We can see that the sharp change of magnetization occurs at around Q = 1.0 (phrase transition).
    At almost the same point, the classification accuracy reaches the peak.
