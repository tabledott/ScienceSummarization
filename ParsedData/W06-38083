    The semi-supervised rating-inference problem is formalized as follows.
    There are n review documents x1 ... xn, each represented by some standard feature representation (e.g., word-presence vectors).
    Without loss of generality, let the first l &lt; n documents be labeled with ratings y1 ... yl E C. The remaining documents are unlabeled.
    In our experiments, the unlabeled documents are also the test documents, a setting known as transduction.
    The set of numerical ratings are C = {c1, ... , cC}, with c1 &lt; ... &lt; cC E R. For example, a one-star to four-star movie rating system has C = {0, 1, 2, 3}.
    We seek a function f : x H R that gives a continuous rating f(x) to a document x.
    Classification is done by mapping f(x) to the nearest discrete rating in C. Note this is ordina
