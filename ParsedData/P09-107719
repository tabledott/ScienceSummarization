Percent-Arg2Money would have a count of 2.

    Numbers and percentages often appear in financial texts but would be less frequent in other genres.
    WSJ-LM: This feature represents the extent to which the words in the text spans are typical of each relation.
    For each sense, we created unigram and bigram language models over the implicit examples in the training set.
    We compute each example&#8217;s probability according to each of these language models.
    The features are the ranks of the spans&#8217; likelihoods according to the various language models.
    For example, if of the unigram models, the most likely relation to generate this example was Contingency, then the example would include the feature ContingencyUnigram1.
    If the third most likely relation according to the bigram models was Expansion, then it would include the feature ExpansionBigram3.
