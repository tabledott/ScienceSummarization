ection and implicit representation of collocational constraints between adjacent words.
    In addition, in the absence of external lexical constraints the language model prefers words more typical of and common in the domain, rather than generic or overly specialized or formal alternatives.
    The result is text that is more fluent and closely simulates the style of the training corpus in this respect.
    Note for example the choice of obtain in the second example of the previous section in favor of the more formal procure.
    Many times, however, the statistical model does not finish the job.
    A bigram model will happily select a sentence like I only hires men who is good pilots.

    Or consider They planned increase in production, where the model drops an article because planned increase is such a frequent bigram.
