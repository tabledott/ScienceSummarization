    In addition to handling the scoping of quantifiers relative to each other, the algorithm we present also allows quantifiers to be scoped within or outside of opaque arguments of higher-order predicates.
    For instance, the algorithm generates two readings for the sentence Everyone isn't here. corresponding to the two relative scopings of the universal quantifier and the negation.
  
  
    In the discussion below, we assume that parsing has made explicit the predicate-argument relations and the relations of grammatical subordination in the form of a logical encoding in an input language.
    A well-formed formula (wff) in the input language is a predicate or other operator applied to one or more arguments.
    An argument can be a constant or variable, another wff, or what we will call a complex term.
    A complex term is an ordered triple consisting of a quantifier, a variable, and a wff (called the restriction), which represents the predication that is grammatically subordinate
