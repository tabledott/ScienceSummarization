			Tagging Accuracy To our surprise, we found initial tag accuracies of all methods using the full lexicon extracted from the Penn Treebank to be significantly lower than previously reported.
			We discovered this was due to several factors.
			One issue we noticed which impacted tagging accuracy was that of a frequently occurring word (a) The/VB Lyneses/NNP ,/, of/IN Powder/NNP Springs/NNP ,/, Ga./NNP ,/, have/VBP filed/VBN suit/NN in/IN Georgia/NNP state/NN court/NN against/IN Stuart/NNP James/NNP ,/, *-1/-NONE- alleging/VBG fraud/NN ./.
			(b) Last/JJ week/NN CBS/NNP Inc./NNP cancelled/VBD ``/`` The/NNP People/NNP Next/NNP Door/NNP ./.
			''/'' (c) a/SYM -/: Discounted/VBN rate/NN ./.

			Since we are not starting out with any known estimates for probabilities of tags given a word, the learner considers this tag to be just as likely as the word?s other, more probable,
