tained by considering each subset of the total number of NPs as potential antecedents are discussed in Section 5.2.
    4.1.3 Segmentation.
    The set of potential antecedents of anaphoric expressions is also restricted by the fact that antecedents tend to have a limited &amp;quot;life span&amp;quot;&#8212;i.e., they only serve as antecedents for anaphoric expressions within pragmatically determined segments of the whole text (see, for example, Reichman [1985], Grosz and Sidner [1986] and Fox [1987]).
    In our corpus we found that about 10% of direct anaphoric definite descriptions have more than one possible antecedent if segmentation is not taken into account (Vieira and Poesio 1996).
    In (8), for example, the antecedent of the housej mentioned in sentence 50 is not the house mentioned earlier in sentences 2 and 19, but another (nonrnobile) house implicitly introduced in sentence 49 by the reference to the yard. lurched two feet off its foundation during last week's earthquake.
