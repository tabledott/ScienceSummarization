    Each element in the dominance set represents a dominance relationship between the edus involved.
    Figure 4 shows the dominance set for our example DS-LST.
    We say that edu 2 is dominated by edu 1 (shortly written ), and edu 3 is dominated by edu 2 Our discourse parsing model uses the dominan ( ). ce set of a DS-LST as the conditioning parameter in equation (3).
    The discourse parsing model we propose uses the dominance set to compute the probability of a discourse parse tree according to formula (4).
  
  
    the structure probabilities and the relation probabilities associated with a tuple in a discourse tree.
    The projection functions and ensure that, for each tuple , only the information in relevant to is to be conditioned upon.
    In the case of (the probability of the structure ), we filter out the lexical heads and keep only the syntactic labels; also, we filter out all the elements of which do not have at least one edu inside the span of .
    In our running example, for instance, f
