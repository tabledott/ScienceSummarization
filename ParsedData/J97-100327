uggests discovering a text's structure by dividing it up into sentences and seeing how much word-overlap appears among the sentences.
    The overlap forms a kind of infrastructure; fully connected graphs might indicate dense discussions of a topic, while long spindly chains of connectivity might indicate a sequential account.
    The central idea is that of defining the structure of a text as a function of the connectivity patterns of the terms that comprise it, in contrast with segmentation guided primarily by fine-grained discourse cues such as register change and cue words.
    Many researchers, (e.g., Halliday and Hasan [1976], Tannen [1989], and Walker [1992]), have noted that term repetition is a strong cohesion indicator.
    Phillips (1985) suggests performing &amp;quot;an analysis of the distribution of the selected text elements relative to each other in some suitable text interval ... for whatever patterns of association they may contract with each other as a function of repeated co-occurrence&amp
