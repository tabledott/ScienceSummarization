5, similarity between nouns is derived fromtheir co-occurrences with verbs in the direct object position.
			In Section 6, similarity between verbs is derived from their subjects and objects.
			The k nearest neighbours of a target word w are the k words for which similarity with w is greatest.
			Our use of the term similarity measure encompasses measures which should strictly bereferred to as distance, divergence or dissimilar ity measures.
			An increase in distance correlates with a decrease in similarity.
			However, eithertype of measure can be used to find the k near est neighbours of a target word.Table 1 lists ten distributional similarity mea sures.
			The cosine measure (Salton and McGill, 1983) returns the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
			The Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence measure (Rao, 1983) and the ?-skew divergence measure (Lee, 1999) are based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence measure.
			The KL divergence,or relative entropy, D(p||q), between two prob ability distribution fun
