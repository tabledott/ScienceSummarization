that there is no edge (i, j)k0 in the graph.
    We can easily rectify this by inserting a second root node, say 00, and including the weights k000wk0 0i.
    To ensure that only valid dependency graphs get a weight greater than zero, we can set k hiwk0 Now, consider the NP-complete 3D-matching problem (3DM).
    As input we are given three sets of size m, call them A, B and C, and a set S C_ A x B x C. The 3DM problem asks if there is a set S0 C_ S such that |S0 |= m and for any two tuples (a, b, c), (a0, b0, c0) E S0 it is the case that a =&#65533; a0, b =&#65533; b0, and c =&#65533;c0.
    2McDonald and Pereira (2006) define this as a second-order Markov assumption.
    This is simply a difference in terminology and does not represent any meaningful distinction.
    We can reduce the 3D-matching problem to the first-order vertical Markov parsing problem by constructing a graph G = (V, E), such that L = AUBUC,V = {00,0} U A U B U C and E = {(i, j)k  |i, j E V, k E L}.
    The set E contains multiple edges b
