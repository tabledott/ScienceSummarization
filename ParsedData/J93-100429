d the corresponding English sentences, which should hopefully get us back to where we started.
    The 43 paragraphs included all sentences in which this process could not be completed around the loop.
    This relatively small group of paragraphs (23% of all paragraphs) contained a relatively large fraction of the program's errors (82%).
    Thus, there seems to be some verification that this trilingual criterion does in fact succeed in distinguishing more difficult paragraphs from less difficult ones.
    There are three pairs of languages: English-German, English-French, and FrenchGerman.
    We will report on just the first two.
    (The third pair is probably dependent on the first two.)
    Errors are reported with respect to the judge's responses.
    That is, for each of the &amp;quot;matches&amp;quot; that the primary judge found, we report the program as correct if it found the &amp;quot;match&amp;quot; and incorrect if it didn't.
    This procedure is better than comparing on the basis of alignment
