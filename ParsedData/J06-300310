example, dog and wolf have a relatively high degree of attributional similarity.
    The amount of relational similarity between two pairs of words, A:B and C:D, depends on the degree of correspondence between the relations between A and B and the relations between C and D. A measure of relational similarity is a function that maps two pairs, A:B and C:D, to a real number, simr(A:B,C:D) E R. The more correspondence there is between the relations of A:B and C:D, the greater their relational similarity.
    For example, dog:bark and cat:meow have a relatively high degree of relational similarity.
    Cognitive scientists distinguish words that are semantically associated (bee&#8211;honey) from words that are semantically similar (deer&#8211;pony), although they recognize that some words are both associated and similar (doctor&#8211;nurse) (Chiarello et al. 1990).
    Both of these are types of attributional similarity, since they are based on correspondence between attributes (e.g., bees and honey are both foun
