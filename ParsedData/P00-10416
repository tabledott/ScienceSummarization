een estimated from a suitable document/summary corpus, the model can be used to compute selection scores for candidate summary terms, given the terms occurring in a particular source document.
    Specific subsets of terms, representing the core summary content of an article, can then be compared for suitability in generating a summary.
    This can be done at two levels (1) likelihood of the length of resulting summaries, given the source document, and (2) likelihood of forming a coherently ordered summary from the content selected.
    The length of the summary can also be learned as a function of the source document.
    The simplest model for document length is a fixed length based on document genre.
    For the discussions in this paper, this will be the model chosen.
    Figure 2 shows the distribution of headline length.
    As can be seen, a Gaussian distribution could also model the likely lengths quite accurately.
    Finally, to simplify parameter estimation for the content selection model, we can
