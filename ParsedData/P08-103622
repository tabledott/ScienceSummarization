tice though, that the 3rd local topic induced for the rating rooms is slightly narrow.
    This can be explained by the fact that the aspect rooms is a central aspect of hotel reviews.
    A very significant fraction of text in every review can be thought of as a part of the aspect rooms.
    These portions of reviews discuss different coherent sub-aspects related to the aspect rooms, e.g., the previously discovered topic noise.
