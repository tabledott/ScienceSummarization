ures such as [VP [V] [NP]], [VP [V delivers ] [NP]] and [VP [V] [NP [DT] [N]]] are valid features, but these fragments (and many others) are not generated by a complete production, i.e.
    VP &#8212;* V NP PP.
    As a consequence they would not be included in the parse-tree kernel of the sentence.
    In this section we compare standard features with the kernel based representation in order to derive useful indications for their use: First, PAK estimates a similarity between two argument structures (i.e., PAF or SCF) by counting the number of sub-structures that are in common.
    As an example, the similarity between the two structures in Figure 2, F&#8221;delivers&#8221;,Arg0 and F&#8221;delivers&#8221;,Arg1, is equal to 1 since they have in common only the [V delivers] substructure.
    Such low value depends on the fact that different arguments tend to appear in different structures.
    On the contrary, if two structures differ only for a few nodes (especially terminals or near terminal nodes) the simi
