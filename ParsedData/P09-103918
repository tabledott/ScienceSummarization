iables and constraints are defined A crucial fact about dependency grammars is that words have preferences about the number and arrangement of arguments an d modifiers they accept.
    Therefore, it is desirable to include features that indicate, for a candidate arborescence, how many outgoing arcs depart from each vertex; denote these quantities by vi , Pa&#8712;&#948;+(i) za, for each i &#8712; V .
    We call vi the valency of the ith vertex.
    We add valency indicators zval ik , ff(vi = k) for i &#8712; V and k = 0,... , n &#8722; 1.
    This way, we are able to penalize candidate dependency trees that assign unusual valencies to some of their vertices, by specifying a individual cost for each possible value of valency.
    The following O(|V |2) constraints encode the agreement between valency indicators and the other variables: For most languages, dependency parse trees tend to be nearly projective (cf.
    Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).
    We wish to make our model capable of learning to prefer &#8220;n
