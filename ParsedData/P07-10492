t, both learning and parsing are fast.
    The parser is incremental, using a new link representation for syntactic structure.
    Incremental parsing was chosen because it considerably restricts the search space for both learning and parsing.
    The representation the parser uses is designed for incremental parsing and allows a prefix of an utterance to be parsed before the full utterance has been read (see section 3).
    The representation the parser outputs can be converted into bracketing, thus allowing evaluation of the parser on standard treebanks.
    To achieve completely unsupervised parsing, standard unsupervised parsers, working from partof-speech sequences, need first to induce the partsof-speech for the plain text they need to parse.
    There are several algorithms for doing so (Sch&#168;utze, 1995; Clark, 2000), which cluster words into classes based on the most frequent neighbors of each word.
    This step becomes superfluous in the algorithm I present here: the algorithm collects lists of
