he automatic construction of deeper semantic relationships among words appearing in collocational systems.
    We illustrate the approach for the acquisition of lexical information for several classes of nominals, and how such techniques can fine-tune the lexical structures acquired from an initial seeding of a machine-readable dictionary.
    In addition to conventional lexical semantic relations, we show how information concerning lexical presuppositions and preference relations (Wilks 1978) can also be acquired from corpora, when analyzed with the appropriate semantic tools.
    Finally, we discuss the potential that corpus studies have for enriching the data set for theoretical linguistic research, as well as helping to confirm or disconfirm linguistic hypotheses.
    The aim of our research is to discover what kinds of knowledge can be reliably acquired through the use of these methods, exploiting, as they do, general linguistic knowledge rather than domain knowledge.
    In this respect, our program is
