formation easily obtained in &#8220;Pro&#8221; and &#8220;Con&#8221; HTML tables and lists, and from one high-precision linguistic pattern, to automatically construct a large corpus of positive and negative sentences.
    They then use this corpus to train a naive Bayes sentence classifier.
    In contrast to our work, sentiment classification in all of this research is restricted to identifying only positive and negative sentences (excluding our both and neutral categories).
    In addition, only one sentiment is assigned per sentence; our system assigns contextual polarity to individual expressions, which would allow for a sentence to be assigned to multiple sentiment categories.
    As we saw when exploring the contextual polarity annotations, it is not uncommon for sentences to contain more than one sentiment expression.
    Classifying the sentiment of documents is a very different task than recognizing the contextual polarity of words and phrases.
    However, some researchers have reported findings abo
