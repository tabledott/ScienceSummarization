    As shown in Table 4, SIMR's bitext map was never off by more than 185 characters from any of the 7,123 segment boundaries.
    185 characters is about 1.5 times the length of an average sentence (Melamed 1996a).
    The input to word_align is the output of char_align and Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993) have reported that word_align cannot escape from char_align's worst errors.
    An independent implementation of char_align (Michel Simard, personal communication) erred by more than one thousand characters on the same bitext.
    The Spanish/English and Korean/English bitexts were hand-aligned when SIMR was being ported to these language pairs.6 The Spanish/English bitexts were drawn from the Sun Solaris AnswerBooks and hand-aligned by Philip Resnik.
    The Korean/ English bitexts were provided by MIT's Lincoln Laboratories and hand-aligned by Young-Suk Lee.
    Table 3 shows that SIMR's performance on Spanish/English and Korean/English bitexts is no worse than its performance on French/English bitexts.
