odules, one has a QA system because finding the answer to a question Q amounts to selecting the sub-string SA of highest score.
    Although this view is not made explicit by QA researchers, it is implicitly present in all systems we are aware of.
    In its simplest form, if one accepts a whole sentence as an answer (SA = S), one can assess the likelihood that a sentence S contains the answer to a question Q by measuring the cosine similarity between Q and S. However, as research in QA demonstrates, word-overlap is not a good enough metric for determining whether a sentence contains the answer to a question.
    Consider, for example, the question &#8220;Who is the leader of France?&#8221; The sentence &#8220;Henri Hadjenberg, who is the leader of France&#8217;s Jewish community, endorsed confronting the specter of the Vichy past&#8221; overlaps with all question terms, but it does not contain the correct answer; while the sentence &#8220;Bush later met with French President Jacques Chirac&#8221; does not ov
