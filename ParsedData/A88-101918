  The other lexical probability estimates follow the same pattern.
    The contextual probability, the probability of observing part of speech X given the following two parts of speech Y and Z, is estimated by dividing the trigram frequency XYZ by the bigram frequency YZ.
    Thus, for example, the probability of observing a verb before an article and a noun is estimated to be the ratio of the freq(VB, AT, NN) over the freq(AT, NN) or 3412/53091 = 0.064.
    The probability of observing a noun in the same context is estimated as the ratio of freq(NN, AT, NN) over 53091 or 629/53091 = 0.01.
    The other contextual probability estimates follow the same pattern.
    A search is performed in order to find the assignment of part of speech tags to words that optimizes the product of the lexical and contextual probabilities.
    Conceptually, the search enumerates all possible assignments of parts of speech to input words.
    In this case, there are four input words, three of which are two ways ambiguous, producin
