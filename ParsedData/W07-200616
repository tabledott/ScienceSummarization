			It is commonly agreed that Word Sense Disambiguation needs emerge and show its usefulness in end to-end applications: after decades of research in the field it is still unclear whether WSD can provide a relevant contribution to real-world applications, such as Information Retrieval, Question Answering,etc. In previous Senseval evaluation exercises, state of-the-art systems achieved performance far below70% and even the agreement between human annotators was discouraging.
			As a result of the discus sion at the Senseval-3 workshop in 2004, one of the aims of SemEval-2007 was to tackle the problems at the roots of WSD.
			In this task, we dealt with the granularity issue which is a major obstacle to bothsystem and human annotators.
