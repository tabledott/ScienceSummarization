we would test this with independently sourced parallel texts.
    The previous experiments used an ad-hoc choice of &#8216;intermediate&#8217; language/s for triangulation, and we now examine which languages are most effective.
    Figure 4 shows the efficacy of the remaining nine languages when translating fr &#8212;* en.
    Minimum error-rate training was not used for this experiment, or the next shown in Figure 5, in order to highlight the effect of the changing translation estimates.
    Romance languages (es, it, pt) give the best results, both on their own and when used together with the standard phrase-table (using uniform interpolation); Germanic languages (de, nl, da, sv) are a distant second, with the less related Greek and Finnish the least useful.
    Interpolation yields an improvement for all &#8216;intermediate&#8217; languages, even Finnish, which has a very low score when used alone.
    The same experiment was repeated for en &#8212;* de translation with similar trends, except that the Germ
