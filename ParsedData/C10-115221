			For decoding, we construct the decoding tree(Fig.
			6) similarly to the construction of the training tree.
			The decoding tree does not have mp op erations and there can be more than one sub nodes attached to a single ro res.
			The root contains the parse tree of the complex sentence.
			Due to space limitations, we cannot provide all the details of the decoder.We calculate the inside probability and out side probability for each node in the decoding tree.
