(Chall and Dale, 1995) and the Fry Short Passage measure (Fry, 1990).
    All of these use some type of word list to estimate semantic difficulty: Lexile (version 1.0) uses the Carroll-Davies-Richman corpus of 86,741 types (Carroll et al., 1971); Dale-Chall uses the Dale 3000 word list; and Fry's Short Passage Measure uses Dale &amp; O'Rourke's &#8216;The Living Word Vocabulary&#8217; of 43,000 types (Dale and O'Rourke, 1981).
    Each of these word lists may be thought of as a simplified language model.
    The model we present below may be thought of as a generalization of the vocabulary-based approach, in which we build multiple language models - in this study, one for each grade - that capture more fine-grained information about vocabulary usage.
    To our knowledge, the only previous work which has considered a language modeling approach to readability is a preliminary study by Si and Callan (2001).
    Their work was limited to a single subject domain - science - and three broad ranges of difficulty.
