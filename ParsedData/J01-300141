ong.
    This situation is represented by the tree at the bottom left of Figure 4.
    The sense course(2) is not rejected at this point since it may be found to be acceptable in the configuration of senses of another sense of run.
    The algorithm now assumes that run(2) is the correct sense.
    This implies that course(1) is the correct sense as it complies with the inanimate restriction that that verb sense places on the direct object.
    As well as complying with the restriction imposed by run(2), course(1) also complies with the one imposed by hilly(1), since nonmovable solid is subsumed by inanimate.
    Therefore, assuming that the senses run(2) and course(1) are being used does not lead to any restrictions being broken and the algorithm marks these as correct.
    Before leaving this example it is worth discussing a few additional points.
    The sense course(2) is marked as incorrect because there is no sense of run with which an interpretation of the sentence can be constructed using course(2).
