 0.5, inducing 1000 or fewer features (down to a gain threshold of 5.0) each round of 10 iterations of L-BFGS.
    Candidate conjunctions are limited to the 1000 atomic and existing features with highest gain.
    Performance results for each of the entity classes can be found in Figure 1.
    The model achieved an overall F1 of 84.04% on the English test set using 6423 features.
    (Using a set of fixed conjunction patterns instead of feature induction results in F1 73.34%, with about 1 million features; trialand-error tuning the fixed patterns would likely improve this.)
    Accuracy gains are expected from experimentation with the induction parameters and improved WebListing.
