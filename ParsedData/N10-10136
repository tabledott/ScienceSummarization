rototype vector for each word from its occurrences.
    This paper presents a multi-prototype vector space model for lexical semantics with a single parameter K (the number of clusters) that generalizes both prototype (K = 1) and exemplar (K = N, the total number of instances) methods.
    Such models have been widely studied in the Psychology literature (Griffiths et al., 2007; Love et al., 2004; Rosseel, 2002).
    By employing multiple prototypes per word, vector space models can account for homonymy, polysemy and thematic variation in word usage.
    Furthermore, such approaches require only O(K2) comparisons for computing similarity, yielding potential computational savings over the exemplar approach when K &#171; N, while reaping many of the same benefits.
    Previous work on lexical semantic relatedness has focused on two approaches: (1) mining monolingual or bilingual dictionaries or other pre-existing resources to construct networks of related words (Agirre and Edmond, 2006; Ramage et al., 2009), an
