 recent approaches that were pro posed in the context of the PASCAL RTE workshop, i.e. using the OTTER theorem prover (Akhmatova, 2005; Fowler et al, 2005), using EPILOG (Bayer et al., 2005), or abduction (Raina et al, 2005).
			None of these systems, however, incorporate model building as a central part of the inference mechanism.
			We have shown that solely relying on theorem proving is normally insufficient due to low recall, and that using model builders is a promising way to approximate entailment.Results of other approaches to determining tex tual entailment indicate that it is an extremely hard 634 task.
			The aforementioned RTE workshop revealed that participating systems reached accuracy figuresranging between 0.50 and 0.59 and cws scores between 0.50 and 0.69 (Dagan et al, 2005).
			Com paring this with our own results (accuracy 0.61 and cws 0.65) shows how well our systems performs onthe same data set.
			This is partly due to our hy brid approach which is more robust across different datasets.
