ge number of resources and QA-specific techniques.
    We believe that our work will lead to a better understanding of the similarities and differences between the approaches that make up today&#8217;s QA research landscape.
    We also hope that our paper will reduce the high barrier to entry that is explained by the complexity of current QA systems and increase the number of researchers working in this field: because our QA system uses only publicly available software components (an IR engine; a parser; and a statistical MT system), it can be easily reproduced by other researchers.
    However, one has to recognize that the reliance of our system on publicly available components is not ideal.
    The generative story that our noisy-channel employs is rudimentary; we have chosen it only because we wanted to exploit to the best extent possible existing software components (GIZA).
    The empirical results we obtained are extremely encouraging: our noisy-channel system is already outperforming a state-of-the-a
