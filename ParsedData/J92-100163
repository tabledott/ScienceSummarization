ormation retrieval.
    However, having access to sense tags allows for easy improvement by more knowledge-intensive methods.
    Although this theory is still untested, there is some preliminary evidence that word sense tagging can improve information retrieval system performance (Krovetz 1989).
    To date we have been unable to get a meaningful quantitative assessment of the accuracy of the system's sense tagging.
    We made an unsuccessful attempt at evaluating the accuracy of sense-tagging over a corpus.
    First, we discovered that a human &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; had great difficulty identifying each sense, and that this task was far more tedious than manual part-of-speech tagging or bracketing.
    Second, we questioned what we would learn from the evaluation of these partial results, and have since turned our attention back to evaluating the system with respect to some task, such as information retrieval.
    Improving the quality of our sense tagging requires a fair amount of straightforward but
