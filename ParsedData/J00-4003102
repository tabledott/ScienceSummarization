 and positional features.
    Their overall recall and precision figures are 66.56% and 72.18%.
    Considering only definite NPs whose referent is an organization (that is the only distinction available in their report), recall is 35.19% and precision 50% (measured on 54 instances).
    Their training and test texts were newspaper articles about joint ventures, and they claim that because each article always talked about more than one organization, finding the antecedents of organizational anaphora was not straightforward.
    In Burger and Connolly (1992) a Bayesian network is used to resolve anaphora by probabilistically combining linguistic evidence.
    Their sources of evidence are ccommand (syntactic constraints), semantic agreement (gender, person, and number plus a term subsumption hierarchy), discourse focus, discourse structure, recency, and centering.
    Their methods are described and exemplified but not evaluated.
    A Bayesian framework is also proposed by Cho and Maida (1992) for the identif
