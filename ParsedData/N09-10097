ssing dependencies. yleft(0) is taken to be empty, and yright(0) contains the sentence&#8217;s single head.
    Let y(i) denote the subtree rooted at position i.
    The probability P(y(i) I xi, &#952;) of generating this subtree, given its head word xi, is defined recursively, as described in Fig.
    1 (Eq.
    2).
    The probability of the entire tree is given by p(x, y &#952;) = P(y(0) 1$, &#952;).
    The &#952; are the multinomial distributions 0s(&#183; , &#183;,&#183;) and 0c(&#183; 1 &#183;, &#183;).
    To follow the general setting of Eq.
    1, we index these distributions as 01, ..., 0K.
    Headden et al. (2009) extended DMV so that the distributions &#952;e condition on the valence as well, with smoothing, and showed significant improvements for short sentences.
    Our experiments found that these improvements do not hold on longer sentences.
    Here we experiment only with DMV, but note that our techniques are also applicable to richer probabilistic grammars like that of Headden et al. Klei
