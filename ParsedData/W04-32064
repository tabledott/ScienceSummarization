ahoo bought Overture&#8221; and &#8220;Yahoo acquired Overture&#8221; share the anchors {X=Yahoo, Y=Overture}, suggesting that the templates &#8216;X buy Y&#8217; and &#8216;X acquire Y&#8217; paraphrase each other.
    Algorithms for paraphrase acquisition address two problems: (a) finding matching anchors and (b) identifying template structure, as reviewed in the next two subsections.
    The prominent approach for paraphrase learning searches sentences that share common sets of multiple anchors, assuming they describe roughly the same fact or event.
    To facilitate finding many matching sentences, highly redundant comparable corpora have been used.
    These include multiple translations of the same text (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) and corresponding articles from multiple news sources (Shinyama et al., 2002; Pang et al., 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2003).
    While facilitating accuracy, we assume that comparable corpora cannot be a sole resource due to their limited availability.
