thor identification task, for example, the training set consists of several documents written by each of the two (or more) authors.
    The resulting discriminator is then tested on documents whose authorship is disputed.
    In the information retrieval application, the training set consists of a set of one or more relevant documents and a set of zero or more irrelevant documents.
    The resulting discriminator is then applied to all documents in the library in order to separate the more relevant ones from the less relevant ones.
    There is an embarrassing wealth of information in the collection of documents that could be used as the basis for discrimination.

    In other words, one assumes that there are two (or more) sources of word probabilities, rel and irrel, in the IR application, and
