omy as proposed in (Resnik 1996), such as WordNet, or from the classes extracted from a word clustering algorithm such as CBC (Pantel and Lin 2002).
    For example, given the relation &#8220;X is charged by Y&#8221;, its relational selection preferences from WordNet could be {social group, organism, state...} for X and {authority, state, section...} for Y.
    Below we propose joint and independent models, based on a corpus analysis, for automatically determining relational selectional preferences.
    Model 1: Joint Relational Model (JRM) Our joint model uses a corpus analysis to learn SPs for binary semantic relations by considering their arguments jointly, as in example (2).
    Given a large corpus of English text, we first find the occurrences of each semantic relation p. For each instance &#9001;x, p, y&#9002;, we retrieve the sets C(x) and C(y) of the semantic classes that x and y belong to and accumulate the frequencies of the triples &#9001;c(x), p, c(y)&#9002;, where c(x) &#8712; C(x) and c(y) &#87
