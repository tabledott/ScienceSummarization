en 1979].
    In some cases, the texts are represented as vectors of sparse n-grams of word occurrences and learning is applied over those vectors [Schapire and Singer 1999].
    But since our definition of similarity is oriented to the small-segment goal, we make more fine-grained distinctions.
    Thus, a set of passages that would probably go into the same class by standard IR criteria would be further separated by our methods.
    Second, we have developed a method that functions over pairs of small units of text, so the size of the input text to be compared is different.
    This differs from document-to-document or query-to-document comparison.
    A closely related problem is that of matching a query to the relevant segment from a longer document [Callan 1994; Kaszkiel and Zobel 1998], which primarily involves determining which segment of a longer document is relevant to a query, whereas our focus is on which segments are similar to each other.
    In both cases, we have less data to compare, and thus
