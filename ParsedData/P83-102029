 PP node which dominates both &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; and the NP &amp;quot;the house&amp;quot;, but that &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; is reanalyzed into the idiomatic verb.
    For &amp;quot;of&amp;quot; to be dominated by a verb node, given that it is already dominated by the PP node, either the PP node must be dominated by the verb or the verb by the PP node, if the dominance relations are to be consistent.
    But it makes no sense for the PP node to have a standard referent where it immediately dominates only a verb and an NP, but no preposition.
    And if the verb dominates the PP, then the verb also dominates the NP which serves as the object of the VP, which is impossible.
    In this sense, D-theory is clearly more restrictive than the theory of [Lasnik and Kupin 771, at least as interpreted by (Chomsky Si), where reanalysis is done by adding an additional monostring to the existing Restricted Phrase Marker and eliminating others.
    In this case, the domination relations implied by the new analysis need n
