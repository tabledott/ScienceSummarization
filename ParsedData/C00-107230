 only uni- gram topic signatures fin" evaluation.
  The result is shown in Figure 2 and TaMe 3.
  We find that the topic signature method outperforms the other two methods and the tfidfmethod performs poorly.
  Among 40 possibh,, test points fl)r four topics with 10% SUmlnary length increment (0% means se- lect at least one sentence) as shown in Table 3, the topic signature method beats the baseline method 34 times.
  This result is really encouraging and in- dicates that the topic signature method is a worthy addition to a variety of text summarization methods.
  6.2 Enriching Topic Signatures Using Existing Ontologies We have shown in the previous sections that topic signatures can be used to al)I)roximate topic iden- tification at the lexieal level.
  Although the au- tomatically acquired signature terms for a specific topic seem to 1)e bound by unknown relationships as shown in Table 2, it is hard to image how we can enrich the inherent fiat structure of tol)ie signatures as defined in Equation 1 to a con
