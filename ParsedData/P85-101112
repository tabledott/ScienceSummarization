write the constraint as ($~, where $ denotes the null set.
  We will alE.~ allow for the possibility that for a node at least one adjoining is obligatory, of course, from the set of all ixxmible auxiliary trees adjoiuable at that node.
  Hence, a TAG with Meal constraints i defined as follows.
  G = (I, A) is a TAG with local constraints dr for each node, n. in each tree t, be speeify one (and only one) of the following constraints.
  S, Ioetive Adjoinin~ ~.qA:) Only u specified subset of the set of all auxiliary trees are adjoinable at u. SA is w-linen aa (C), where C is u subset of the set of all auxiliary trees adjoisable at n. If C equals the set of all auxiliary t rm adjoinable at n, then we do not explkitly state this at the node n. 2.
  Null Adjoining; (NA:) No  auxiliary tree ia adjoinable at the ,,ode N. NA will be written u (~).
  Obli~atin~ Adjoining; {OA:) At least one (out of all the auxiliary trees adjoissble at a) must be adjoined at n. OA is written as (OA).
  or as O(C) where C is a subeet of
