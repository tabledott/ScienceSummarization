reebank, those of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000), use statistical models for disambigua tion that make crucial use of dependency relations.
			Moreover, the deterministic dependency parser of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), when trained on the Penn Treebank, gives a dependency accuracy that is almost as good as that of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000).
			The parser described in this paper is similar to that of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) in that it uses a deterministic parsing algorithm in combination with a classifier induced from a treebank.
			However, there are also important differences between the twoapproaches.
			First of all, whereas Yamada and Matsumoto employs a strict bottom-up algorithm (es sentially shift-reduce parsing) with multiple passes over the input, the present parser uses the algorithmproposed in Nivre (2003), which combines bottom up and top-down processing in a single pass in order to achieve incrementality.
			This also means that the time complexity of the algorithm used here is
