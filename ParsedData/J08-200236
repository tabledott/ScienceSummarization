    This indicates it may be useful to use the path relative to expected to find arguments for widen.
    In general, to identify certain arguments of predicates embedded in auxiliary and infinitival VPs we expect it to be helpful to take the path from the maximum extended projection of the predicate&#8212;the highest VP in the chain of VPs dominating the predicate.
    We introduce a new path feature, PROJECTED PATH, which takes the path from the maximal extended projection to an argument node.
    This feature applies only when the argument is not dominated by the maximal projection (e.g., direct objects).
    These features also handle other cases of discontinuous and nonlocal dependencies, such as those arising due to control verbs.
    The performance gain from these new features was notable, especially in identification.
    The performance on ALL arguments for the model using only the features in Figure 3, and the model using the additional features as well, are shown in Figure 5.
