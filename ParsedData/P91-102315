 two sentences were defined to &amp;quot;match&amp;quot; if they shared a common clause.
    (In a few cases, a pair of sentences shared only a phrase or a word, rather than a clause; these sentences did not count as a &amp;quot;match&amp;quot; for the purposes of this experiment.)
    After checking the primary judge with the other two judges, it was decided that the primary judge's results were sufficiently reliable that they could be used as a standard for evaluating the program.
    The primary judge made only two mistakes on the 43 hard paragraphs (one French mistake and one German mistake), whereas the program made 44 errors on the same materials.
    Since the primary judge's error rate is so much lower than that of the program, it was decided that we needn't be concerned with the primary judge's error rate.
    If the program and the judge disagree, we can assume that the program is probably wrong.
    The 43 &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; paragraphs were selected by looking for sentences that mapped to som
