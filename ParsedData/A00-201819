ot;, and statistics were collected on the resulting parses.
    Without these enhancements Char97 performs at the 86.6% level for sentences of length &lt; 40.
    In this section we evaluate the effects of the various changes we have made by running various versions of our current program.
    To avoid repeated evaluations based upon the testing corpus, here our evaluation is based upon sentences of length &lt; 40 from the development corpus.
    We note here that this corpus is somewhat more difficult than the &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; test corpus.
    For example, the final version of our system achieves an average precision/recall of 90.1% on the test corpus but an average precision/recall of only 89.7% on the development corpus.
    This is indicated in Figure 2, where the model labeled &amp;quot;Best&amp;quot; has precision of 89.8% and recall of 89.6% for an average of 89.7%, 0.4% lower than the results on the official test corpus.
    This is in accord with our experience that developmentcorpus resu
