m also allows unification of values that have not -yet been assigned.
    A third way to .view these structures is to think of them as partial functions that assign values to attributes [Sag et.al., Si].
  
  
    Several related grammar formalisms (UG, LFG, PATHII, and GPS() now exist that are based on a very similar conception of features and use unification as their basic operation.
    Because feature matrices (lattice nodes) are sets of attribute-value pairs, unification is closely related to the operation of forming a union of two sets.
    However, while the latter always yields something&#8212;at least the null set, unification is an operation that may fail or succeed.
    When it fails, no result. is produced and the operands remain unchanged; when it succeeds, the operands are permanently altered in the process.
    They become the same object.
    This is an important characteristic.
    The result of unifying three or more graphs in pairs with one another does not depend on the order in which the
