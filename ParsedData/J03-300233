milarities of structure exist.
    We present here a generic score of translational similarity that is based upon any word-to-word translation lexicon (hand-crafted or automatically generated, or a combination, and possibly highly noisy).
    The technique is shown to perform competitively to the structure-based approach of STRAND on the task of identifying EnglishFrench document translations.
    We define a cross-language similarity score, tsim, for two texts by starting with a generative, symmetric word-to-word model of parallel texts (Melamed&#8217;s [2000] Method A).
    Let a link be a pair (x, y) in which x is a word in language L1 and y is a word in L2.
    The model consists of a bilingual dictionary that gives a probability distribution p over all possible link types.
    Within a particular link, one of the words may be NULL, but not both.
    In the generative process, a sequence of independent link tokens is sampled from the distribution.
    The model does not account for word order.
