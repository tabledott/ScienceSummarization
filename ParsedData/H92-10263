N where "P(w~) is the set of all parses produced by the grammar for the sentence w~.
  Many aspects of the input sentence that might be relevant o the decision-making process participate in the probabilistic model, provid- ing a very rich if not the richest model of context ever attempted in a probabilistic parsing model.
  In this paper, we will motivate and define the HBG model, describe the task domain, give an overview of the grammar, describe the proposed HBG model, and present he results of experiments comparing HBG with an existing state-of-the-art model.
  Mot ivat ion  fo r  H is tory -based Grammars One goal of a parser is to produce a grammatical  inter- pretation of a sentence which represents the syntactic and semantic intent of the sentence.
  To achieve this goal, the parser must have a mechanism for estimating the coherence of an interpretation, both in isolation and in context.
  Probabilistic language models provide such a mechanism.
  A probabilistic language model attempts to estimate the
