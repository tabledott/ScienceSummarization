s the function symbol p&#945; as well as the child semantic categories Mb and Mc.
    Next, we generate the hybrid sequence of child nodes w1 Mb w2 Mc, which consists of NL words and semantic categories.
    After that, two child MR productions mb and mc are generated.
    These two productions will in turn generate other hybrid sequences and productions, recursively.
    This process produces a hybrid tree T, whose nodes are either NL words or MR productions.
    Given this tree, we can recover a NL sentence w by recording the NL words visited in depth-first traversal order and can recover an MR structure m by following a tree-specific traversal order, defined by the hybrid-patterns we introduce below.
    Figure 3 gives a partial hybrid tree for the training example from Section 3.
    Note that the leaves of a hybrid tree are always NL tokens.
    With several independence assumptions, the probability of generating (w, m, T) is defined as: where &#8220;arg&#8221; refers to the position of the child semanti
