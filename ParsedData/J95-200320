nked element of Cf (Un) that is realized in Un+i is the Cb (U0+1).
    Because Cf (U0)is only partially ordered, some elements may, from Cf (Un) information alone, be equally likely to be Cb (U0+1).
    In such cases, additional criteria are needed for deciding which single entity is the Cb(Un+i ).
    Some recent psycholinguistic evidence suggests that the syntactic role in Un+i may determine this choice (Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993).
    In the remainder of the paper we will use a notation such that the elements of Cf are ranked in the order in which they are listed.'
    In particular, for presentational 4 U need not be a full clause.
    We use U here to stress again that it is the utterance, not the string of words.
    5 In the original manuscript, we defined realize in terms of situation semantics (Barwise and Perry 1983) and said the relation held &amp;quot;if either c is an element of the situation described by the utterance U or c is directly realized by some subpart of U.&amp;quot; We discuss t
