nal probability distributions.
    Note that the language model generates the source string X.
    Thus the weights of the TAG rules condition on the words in X, but do not generate them.
    There are three different schema defining the initial trees of the TAG.
    These correspond to analyzing a source word as not beginning a repair (e.g., a1 and a3 in Figure 3), analyzing a source word as beginning a repair (e.g., a2), and generating an interregnum (e.g., a5).
    Auxiliary trees generate the paired reparandum/repair words of a repair.
    There are five different schema defining the auxiliary trees corresponding to the five different values that Ti can take.
    Note that the nonterminal Rm,r expanded by the auxiliary trees is annotated with the last reparandum and repair words M&#57739;i&#8722;1 and R&#57739;i&#8722;1 respectively, which makes it possible to condition the rule&#8217;s weight on these words.
    Auxiliary trees of the form (01) generate reparandum words that are copies of the correspondi
