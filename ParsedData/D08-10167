d to cross if one of k, E is strictly between i and j while the other is strictly outside that range.)
    EXACTLY1.
    A family of O(n) hard global constraints, indexed by 1 &lt; j &lt; n. EXACTLY1j requires that j have exactly one parent, i.e., exactly one of the Lij variables must be true.
    Note that EXACTLY1 is implied by TREE or PTREE.
    ATMOST1.
    A weaker version.
    ATMOST1j requires j to have one or zero parents.
    NAND.
    A family of hard binary constraints.
    NANDij,kt requires that Lij and Lkt may not both be true.
    We will be interested in certain subfamilies.
    NOT2.
    Shorthand for the family of O(n3) binary constraints {NANDij,kj}.
    These are collectively equivalent to ATMOST1, but expressed via a larger number of simpler constraints, which can make the BP approximation less effective (footnote 30).
    NO2CYCLE.
    Shorthand for the family of O(n2) binary constraints {NANDij,ji}.
    A soft factor Fm acts as a soft constraint that prefers some parses to others.
