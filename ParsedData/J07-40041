 chart, in combination with the parallel implementation, allows us to solve one of the largest-scale estimation problems in the statistical parsing literature in under three hours.
    A key component of the parsing system, for both training and testing, is a Maximum Entropy supertagger which assigns CCG lexical categories to words in a sentence.
    The supertagger makes the discriminative training feasible, and also leads to a highly efficient parser.
    Surprisingly, given CCG&#8217;s &#8220;spurious ambiguity,&#8221; the parsing speeds are significantly higher than those reported for comparable parsers in the literature.
    We also extend the existing parsing techniques for CCG by developing a new model and efficient parsing algorithm which exploits all derivations, including CCG&#8217;s nonstandard derivations.
    This model and parsing algorithm, when combined with normal-form constraints, give state-of-the-art accuracy for the recovery of predicate&#8211;argument dependencies from CCGbank.
