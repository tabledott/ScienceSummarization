l of alignment is to identify matching sentences between the languages.
    Alignment is the first stage in extracting structural information and statistical parameters from bilingual corpora.
    The problem is made more difficult because a sentence in one language may correspond to multiple sentences in the other; worse yet, sometimes several sentences' content is distributed across multiple translated sentences.
    Approaches to alignment fall into two main classes: lexical and statistical.
    Lexically-based techniques use extensive online bilingual lexicons to match sentences.
    In contrast, statistical techniques require almost no prior knowledge and are based solely on the lengths of sentences.
    The empirical results to date suggest that statistical methods yield performance superior to that of currently available lexical techniques.
    However, as far as we know, the literature on automatic alignment has been restricted to alphabetic Indo-European languages.
    This methodological flaw weaken
