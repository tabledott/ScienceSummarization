As discussed in previous work, there are strong dependencies among the labels of the semantic argument nodes of a verb.
    A drawback of local models is that, when they decide the label of a parse tree node, they cannot use information about the labels and features of other nodes in the tree.
    Furthermore, these dependencies are highly nonlocal.
    For instance, to avoid repeating argument labels in a frame, we need to add a dependency from each node label to the labels of all other nodes.
    A factorized sequence model that assumes a finite Markov horizon, such as a chain Conditional Random Field (Lafferty et al., 2001), would not be able to encode such dependencies.
    The need for Re-ranking For argument identification, the number of possible assignments for a parse tree with n nodes is 2n.
    This number can run into the hundreds of billions for a normal-sized tree.
    For argument labeling, the number of possible assignments is Pt&#65533; 201, if m is the number of arguments of a verb (typically
