on style leads to a very large number of grammar rules.
    Second, we assess the extent of the coverage problem by looking at rule frequencies in training data.
    Third, we conduct experiments to assess the impact of the coverage problem on accuracy.
    Fourth, we discuss how breaking rules down may improve estimation as well as coverage. the Penn Treebank annotation style has already been discussed, in section 7.3.
    The flatness of the trees leads to a very large (and constantly growing) number of rules, primarily because the number of adjuncts to a head is potentially unlimited: For example, there can be any number of PP adjuncts to a head verb.
    A binary-branching (Chomsky adjunction) grammar can generate an unlimited number of adjuncts with very few rules.
    For example, the following grammar generates any sequence VP &#8594; V In contrast, the Penn Treebank style would create a new rule for each number of PPs seen in training data.
    The grammar would be and so on Other adverbial adjuncts,
