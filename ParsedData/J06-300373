 The predicted class of the testing pair is the class of the single nearest neighbor in the training set.
    As the measure of nearness, we use LRA to calculate the relational similarity between the testing pair and the training pairs.
    The single nearest neighbor algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm (i.e., it requires a training set of labeled object property obj prop sunken ship H underwent M part part printer tray H is part of M possessor posr national debt M has H property prop blue book His M product prod plum tree H produces M source src olive oil M is the source of H stative st sleeping dog H is in a state of M whole whl daisy chain M is part of H
