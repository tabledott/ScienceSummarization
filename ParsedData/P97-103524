 is an example of such a subdialogue with Agent A.
    As in the initial estimation of a performance function, our analysis requires experimental data, namely a set of values for and c, and the application of the Z score normalization function to this data.
    However, the values for rc and ci are now calculated at the subdialogue rather than the whole dialogue level.
    In addition, only data from comparable strategies can be used to calculate the mean and standard deviation for normalization.
    Informally, a comparable strategy is one which applies in the same state and has the same effects.
    For example, to calculate for Agent A over the subdialogues that repair depart-city, P(A) and P(E) are computed using only the subpart of Table 3 concerned with depart-city.
    For Agent A, P(A) = .78, P(E) = .265, and frc = .70.
    Then, this value of is is normalized using data from comparable subdialogues with both Agent A and Agent B.
    Based on the data in Tables 3 and 4, the mean is .515 and a is .261,
