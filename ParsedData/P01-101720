odels depends critically on which of these explanations is correct: if (1) we should collect more data, if (2) we should just live with the tandem grammar-trigram models, and if (3) we should create better parsers.
    Based upon a few observations on sentences from the development corpus for which the trigram model gave higher probabilities we hypothesized that reason (3), bungled parses, is primary.
    To test this we performed the following experiment.
    We divide the sentences from the test corpus into two groups, ones for which the trigram model performs better, and the ones for which the grammar model does better.
    We then collect labeled precision and recall statistics (the standard parsing performance measures) separately for each group.
    If our hypothesis is correct we expect the &#8220;grammar higher&#8221; group to have more accurate parses than the trigram-higher group as the poor parse would cause poor grammar perplexity for the sentence, which would then be worse than the trigram perple
