    Clustering has most often been applied in natural language processing as a method for inducing syntactic or semantically related groupings of words (e.g., (Rosenfeld, Huang, and Schneider, 1969), (Kiss, 1973), (Ritter and Kohonen, 1989), (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, 1993), (Schiitze, 1993), (Resnik, 1995a)).
    An early application of clustering to word&#8212;sense disambiguation is described in (Schiitze, 1992).
    There words are represented in terms of the cooccurrence statistics of four letter sequences.
    This representation uses 97 features to characterize a word, where each feature is a linear combination of letter four-grams formulated by a singular value decomposition of a 5000 by 5000 matrix of letter fourgram co-occurrence frequencies.
    The weight associated with each feature reflects all usages of the word in the sample.
    A context vector is formed for each occurrence of an ambiguous word by summing the vectors of the contextual words (the number of contextual words considered in the
