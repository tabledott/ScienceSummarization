    We propose an alternative measure, the association ratio, for measuring word association norms, based on the information theoretic concept of mutual information.
    The proposed measure is more objective and less costly than the subjective method employed in [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)].
    The association ratio can be scaled up to provide robust estimates of word association norms for a large portion of the language.
    Using the association ratio measure, the five most associated words are (in order): &amp;quot;dentists,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;nurses,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;treating,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;treat,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hospitals.&amp;quot; What is &amp;quot;mutual information&amp;quot;?
    According to [Fano (1961), p. 28], if two points (words), x and y, have probabilities P(x) and P(y), then their mutual information, /(x ,y), is defined to be
