    In the common Document Understanding Conference (DUC) formulation of the task, a system takes as input a document set as well as a short description of desired summary focus and outputs a word length limited summary.1 To avoid the problem of generating cogent sentences, many systems opt for an extractive approach, selecting sentences from the document set which best reflect its core content.2 There are several approaches to modeling document content: simple word frequency-based methods (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005), graph-based approaches (Radev, 2004; Wan and Yang, 2006), as well as more linguistically motivated techniques (Mckeown et al., 1999; Leskovec et al., 2005; Harabagiu et al., 2007).
    Another strand of work (Barzilay and Lee, 2004; Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2006; Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008), has explored the use of structured probabilistic topic models to represent document content.
    However, little has been done to directly compare the benefit of complex content model
