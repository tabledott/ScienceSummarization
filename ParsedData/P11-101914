ough the CLC contains information about the linguistic errors committed (see Section 2), we try to extract an error-rate in a way that doesn&#8217;t require manually tagged data.
    However, we also use an error-rate calculated from the CLC error tags to obtain an upper bound for the performance of an automated error estimator (true CLC error-rate).
    In order to estimate the error-rate, we build a trigram language model (LM) using ukWaC (ukWaC LM) (Ferraresi et al., 2008), a large corpus of English containing more than 2 billion tokens.
    Next, we extend our language model with trigrams extracted from a subset of the texts contained in the CLC (CLC LM).
    As the CLC contains texts produced by second language learners, we only extract frequently occurring trigrams from highly ranked scripts to avoid introducing erroneous ones to our language model.
    A word trigram in test data is counted as an error if it is not found in the language model.
    We compute presence/absence efficiently using a Bloom f
