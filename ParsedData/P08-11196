semantic class induction have also been developed specifically for learning from the web.
    (Pas&#184;ca, 2004) uses Hearst&#8217;s patterns (Hearst, 1992) to learn semantic class instances and class groups by acquiring contexts around the pattern.
    Pasca also developed a second technique (Pas&#184;ca, 2007b) that creates context vectors for a group of seed instances by searching web query logs, and uses them to learn similar instances.
    The work most closely related to ours is Hearst&#8217;s early work on hyponym learning (Hearst, 1992) and more recent work that has followed up on her idea.
    Hearst&#8217;s system exploited patterns that explicitly identify a hyponym relation between a semantic class and a word (e.g., &#8220;such authors as Shakespeare&#8221;).
    We will refer to these as hyponym patterns.
    Pasca&#8217;s previously mentioned system (Pas&#184;ca, 2004) applies hyponym patterns to the web and acquires contexts around them.
    The KnowItAll system (Etzioni et al., 2005) also use
