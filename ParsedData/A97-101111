VOC).
    The following rule establishes a dependency relation of a verb and its object complement, if the object already exists.
    The rule says that a dependency relation (o-compl) should be added but the syntactic functions should not be disambiguated (INDEX).
    The object complement OPCOMPL-0 is linked to the verb readings having the subcategorisation SVOC.
    The relation of the object complement and its head is such that the noun phrase to the left of the object complement is an object (CM) that has established a dependency relation (object) to the verb.
    Naturally, the dependency relations may also be followed downwards (DOWN).
    But it is also possible to declare the last item in a chain of the links (e.g. the verb chain would have been wanted) using the keywords TOP and BOTTOM.
  
  
    We pursue the following strategy for linking and disambiguation. in the new dependency grammar.
    In practice, these rules are most likely to cause errors, apart from their linguistic interpretation often
