 form q0ld[ffie6f#].
    We generate a random sample (z1, &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; , zN) and define: As we generate the sample we update the array C[i, mI = Ek (zk)= m 1;(4) .
    We estimate qo1c[ffte6f#] as the average value of ftae6f# in the sample, namely, (1/N)5r(i,6).
    This permits us to compute F;(6) and F;(6).
    The resulting Newton iteration is: The estimation procedure is: procedure Adjust Weights (ai, , an) begin until the field converges do
  
  
    This work has greatly profited from the comments, criticism, and suggestions of a number of people, including Yoav Freund, John Lafferty, Stanley Peters, Hans Uszkoreit, and members of the audience at talks I gave at Saarbrucken and Tubingen.
    Michael Miller and Kevin Mark introduced me to random fields as a way of dealing with context-sensitivities in language, planting the idea that led (much later) to this paper.
    Finally, I would especially like to thank Marc Light and Stefan Riezler for extended discussions of the issues addressed here an
