 particular hypothesis.
    For example, suppose that we were concerned that strong enough shouldn't be considered a collocation.
    A ttest could be used to compare the hypothesis that strong enough appears too often to be a fluke against the null hypothesis that the observations can be attributed to chance.
    The t-score compares the two hypotheses, by taking the difference of the means of the two probability distributions, and normalizing appropriately by the variances, so that the result can be interpreted as a number of standard deviations.
    Theoretically, if the t-score is larger than 1.65 standard deviations, then we ought to believe that the co-occurrences are significant and we can reject the null hypothesis with 95% confidence, though in practice we might look for a t-score of 2 or more standard deviations, since t-scores are often inflated (due to certain violations of the assumptions behind the model).
    See Dunning (this issue) for a critique of the assumption that the probabilities are n
