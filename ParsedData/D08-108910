e word based orientation model presented above, except that it analyzes adjacent phrases rather than specificword alignments to determine orientations.
			Specif ically, orientation is set to oi = M if an adjacent phrase pair lies at (s?1,u?1) in the alignmentgrid.
			It is set to S if an adjacent phrase pair cov ers (s?1,v+1) (as shown in Fig.
			2(b)), and is set to D otherwise.Hierarchical orientation model: This model analyzes alignments beyond adjacent phrases.
			Specifically, orientation is set to oi = M if the phrase extract algorithm is able to extract a phrase pair at (s?1,u?1) given no constraint on maximum phrase length.
			Orientation is S if the same is true at (s?1,v+1), and orientation is D otherwise.Table 1 displays overall class distributions according to the three models.
			It appears clearly that occurrences of M and S are too sparsely seen in the word based model, which assigns more than 80% of its 2http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.AdvancedFeatures 850 word phrase hier.
