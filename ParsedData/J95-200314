re not equivalent with respect to their effect on coherence.
    We conjecture that this is so because they engender different inferences on the part of a hearer or reader.
    In the most pronounced cases, the wrong choice will mislead a hearer and force backtracking to a correct interpretation.'
    The following variations of a discourse sequence illustrate this problem and provide additional evidence for our conjecture.
    By using a pronoun to refer to Tony in utterance (e) the speaker may confuse the hearer.
    Through utterance (d) Terry has been the center of attention, and hence is the most likely referent of &amp;quot;he&amp;quot; in utterance (e).
    It is only when one gets to the word &amp;quot;sick&amp;quot; that it is clear that it must be Tony and not Terry who is sick, and hence that the pronoun in utterance (e) refers to Tony not Terry.
    A much more natural sequence results if &amp;quot;Tony&amp;quot; is used, as the sequence (4a)-(4e) illustrates.
    We conjecture that the form of ex
