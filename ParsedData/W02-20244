t data files contain 218737, 40656 and 74189 lines respectively.
    The performance in this task is measured with F,3=1 rate which is equal to (32+1)*precision*recall / ('32*precision+recall) with 3=1 (van Rijsbergen, 1975).
    Precision is the percentage of named entities found by the learning system that are correct.
    Recall is the percentage of named entities present in the corpus that are found by the system.
    A named entity is correct only if it is an exact match of the corresponding entity in the data file.
  
  
    Twelve systems have participated in this shared task.
    The results for the test sets for Spanish and Dutch can be found in Table 1.
    A baseline rate was computed for both sets.
    It was produced by a system which only identified entities which had a unique class in the training data.
    If a phrase was part of more than one entity, the system would select the longest one.
    All systems that participated in the shared task have outperformed the baseline system.
