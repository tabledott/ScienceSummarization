citation indexing, but such information is rarely found in abstracts.
    We empirically found that the rhetorical status of information occurring in author abstracts is very limited and consists mostly of information about the goal of the paper and specifics of the solution.
    Details of the analysis we conducted on this topic are given in section 3.2.2.
    We thus decided to augment our corpus with an independent set of human judgments of relevance.
    We wanted to replace the vague definition of relevance often used in sentence extraction experiments with a more operational definition based on rhetorical status.
    For instance, a sentence is considered relevant only if it describes the research goal or states a difference with a rival approach.
    More details of the instructions we used to make the relevance decisions are given in section 3.
    Thus, we have two parallel human annotations in our corpus: rhetorical annotation and relevance selection.
    In both tasks, each sentence in the articles
