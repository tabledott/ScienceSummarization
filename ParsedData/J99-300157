ion pairs with respect to the &amp;quot;costs&amp;quot; they imply.
    The cost-based evaluation of different Cf orderings refers to evaluation criteria that form an intrinsic part of the centering model.
    Transition pairs hold for three immediately successive utterances.
    We distinguish between two types of transition pairs, cheap ones and expensive ones. immediately preceding utterance, i.e., Cb(U) Cp(1-11-1)&#8226; In particular, chains of the RETAIN transition in passages where the Cb does not change (passages with constant theme) show that the grammatical ordering constraints for the forward-looking centers are not appropriate.
    5.2.6 Results (Costs of Transition Types).
    The numbers of centering transition pairs generated by the different approaches are shown in Table 19.
    In general, the functional approach reveals the best results, while the naive and the grammatical approaches work reasonably well for the literary text, but exhibit a remarkably poorer performance for the texts from th
