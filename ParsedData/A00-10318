 predefined maximum length.
    The term suffix as used here means &amp;quot;final sequence of characters of a word&amp;quot; which is not necessarily a linguistically meaningful suffix.
    Probabilities are smoothed by successive abstraction.
    This calculates the probability of a tag t given the last m letters i of an n letter word: P(t1/7&#8222;,+1,,..ln).
    The sequence of increasingly more general contexts omits more and more characters of the suffix, such that P(tlin-m+2, &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; P(tlin_m+3, ,i), , P(t) are used for smoothing.
    The recursion formula is set A = A2 = A3 = 0 foreach trigram t1,t2,t3 with f (ti,t2,t3) &gt;0 depending on the maximum of the following three values: for i = m ... 0, using the maximum likelihood estimates P from frequencies in the lexicon, weights Oi and the initialization For the Markov model, we need the inverse conditional probabilities P(1,2_1+1, ... /Tilt) which are obtained by Bayesian inversion.
