plied to German and Dutch and evaluated on its ability to find prefixes, suffixes, and circumfixes in these languages.
    To our knowledge, this serves as the first evaluation of complete regular morphological induction of German or Dutch (although researchers such as Nakisa and Hahn (1996) have evaluated induction algorithms on morphological sub-problems in German).
  
  
    Previous morphology induction approaches have fallen into three categories.
    These categories differ depending on whether human input is provided and on whether the goal is to obtain affixes or complete morphological analysis.
    We here briefly describe work in each category.
    Some researchers begin with some initial humanlabeled source from which they induce other morphological components.
    In particular, Xu and Croft (1998) use word context derived from a corpus to refine Porter stemmer output.
    Gaussier (1999) induces derivational morphology using an inflectional lexicon which includes part of speech information.
