 the target partition, K is the hypothe sized partition and h(k) is the size of cluster k. Q2(C,K) = 1 n ?|C| c=1 log (h(c)+|C|?1 |C|?1 ) Q0(C,K) We believe that V-measure provides two significantadvantages over Q0 that make it a more useful diag nostic tool.
			First, Q0 does not explicitly calculate the degree of completeness of the clustering solution.
			The cost term captures some of this information, since a partition with fewer clusters is likely to be more complete than a clustering solution with more clusters.
			However, Q0 does not explicitly address the interaction between the conditional entropy and the cost of representing the model.
			While this is an application of the minimum description length (MDL) principle (Rissanen, 1978; Rissanen, 1989), it does not provide an intuitive manner for assessingour two competing criteria of homogeneity and com pleteness.
			That is, at what point does an increase inconditional entropy (homogeneity) justify a reduc tion in the number of clusters (completenes
