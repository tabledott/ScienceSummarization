s, feature matrices, and feature variables because they require some nonobvious extensions to the treatment we provide for ordinary rules with unanalyzable symbols.
    On the other hand, we have nothing to say about the many other notational devices that phonologists have proposed for collapsing rules.
    These abbreviatory conventions are either already subsumed by the general regular languages we allow as rule components or can be translated in obvious ways to simply ordered rules or batch rules.
  
  
    We now come to the central problem of proving that an arbitrary rule in our formalism denotes a regular string relation and is thus accepted by an equivalent finite-state transducer.
    A rule has the general form where 0, '0, A, and p are arbitrary regular expressions.
    The mode of application of the rule is governed by additional parametric specifications, including for example whether the rule applies from left to right or right to left, and whether it is obligatory or optional.
