ence of the correlated verb class increases.
    A r value of 0 would show that the two variables' values are independent of each other.
    Results show a significant positive correlation between the synsets.
    The range of correlation is from .850 between the communication verb synset (give, get, inform, ...) and the act verb synset (have, relate, give, ...) to .238 between the think verb synset (plan, study, give, ...) and the change state verb synset (fall, come, close, ..) These correlations show that frequent synsets do not behave independently of each other and thus confirm that the WordNet results are not an effective way to achieve document discrimination.
    Although the WordNet results were not discriminatory, we were still convinced that our initial hypothesis on the role of verbs in determining event profile was worth pursuing.
    We believe that these results are a by-product of lexical ambiguity and of the richness of the WordNet hierarchy.
    We thus decided to pursue a new approach to te
