ically derive with our SRL system (Moschitti et al., 2005) (Section 3).
    Our experiments using SVMs and the above kernels and data (Section 4) shows the following: (a) our approach reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on question classification.
    (b) PB predicative structures are not effective for question classification but show promising results for answer classification on a corpus of answers to TREC-QA 2001 description questions.
    We created such dataset by using YourQA (Quarteroni and Manandhar, 2006), our basic Webbased QA system1.
    (c) The answer classifier increases the ranking accuracy of our QA system by about 25%.
    Our results show that PAS and syntactic parsing are promising methods to address tasks affected by data sparseness like question/answer categorization.
  
  
    Traditionally, information retrieval techniques are based on the bag-of-words (BOW) approach augmented by language modeling (Allan et al., 2002).
    When the task requires the use of more complex semantics, the abov
