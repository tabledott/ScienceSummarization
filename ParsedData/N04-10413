    In this paper, we propose an algorithm for automatically inducing names for semantic classes and for finding instance/concept (is-a) relationships.
    Using concept signatures (templates describing the prototypical syntactic behavior of instances of a concept), we extract concept names by searching for simple syntactic patterns such as &amp;quot;concept apposition-of instance&amp;quot;.
    Searching concept signatures is more robust than searching the syntactic features of individual instances since many instances suffer from sparse features or multiple senses.
    Once labels are assigned to concepts, we can extract a hyponym relationship between each instance of a concept and its label.
    For example, once our system labels list (C) as color, we may extract relationships such as: pink is a color, red is a color, turquoise is a color, etc.
    Our results show that of the 159,000 hyponyms we extract using this simple method, 68% are correct.
