 which are related anaphorically.
    Therefore, the syntactic category of do is S[dcl]\NP, not (S[dcl]\NP)/VP.
    In the second example, *?
    * indicates a semantic argument of expected that we do not reflect in the syntactic category.
    The successive steps have the following more detailed character: preprocessTree: Correct tagging errors, ensure the constituent structure conforms to the CCG analysis.
    Eliminate quotes.
    Create copies of coordinated argument clusters that correspond to the CCG analysis. determineConstituentTypes: For each node, determine its constituent type (head, complement, adjunct, conjunction, a constituent that is coindexed with a *RNR* trace, spurious null element, or argument cluster). makeBinary: Binarize the tree. percolateTraces: Determine the CCG category of *T* and *RNR* traces in complement position, and percolate them up to the appropriate level in the tree. assignCategories: Assign CCG categories to nodes in the tree, starting at the root node.
    Nodes that are
