whether this benefit is complementary to the benefit from features which have traditionally been of use in word level systems, such as syntactic context features, topic features, and so on.
    To test this, we constructed a maxent classifier which locally classifies single words, without modeling the entity type sequences .4 These local classifiers map a feature representation of each word position to entity types, such as PERSON.5 We present a hill-climb over feature sets for the English development set data in table 2.
    First, we tried only the local word as a feature; the result was that each word was assigned its most common class in the training data.
    The overall F-score was 52.29%, well below the official CoNLL baseline of 71.18%.6 We next added -gram features; specifically, we framed each word with special start and end symbols, and then added every contiguous substring to the feature list.
    Note that this subsumes the entire-word features.
    Using the substring features alone scored 73.10
