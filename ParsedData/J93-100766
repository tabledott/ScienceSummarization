ice were being sold for 10.&amp;quot; More formally, if we compare the columns in Figure 14, we see that the numbers are much higher for DJ than for the other two corpora.
    This is not due to a size/frequency factor, since &amp;quot;price&amp;quot; occurs about 10,000 times in both NYT and DJ, whereas it only occurs 4,500 times in AP.
    It rather says that the distribution of collocates around &amp;quot;price&amp;quot; has a much higher variance in DJ than in the other corpora.
    DJ has much bigger weights because it is focused; the stories are almost all about Wall Street.
    In contrast, NYT contains a large number of stories with &amp;quot;price,&amp;quot; but they have various origins.
    &amp;quot;Price&amp;quot; has 4,627 collocates in NYT, whereas it only has 2,830 in DJ.
    Let us call Ocorpus the variety of a given corpus.
    One way to measure the variety is to use the information theory measure of entropy for a given language model.
    Entropy is defined (Shannon 1948) as: where p(w) is
