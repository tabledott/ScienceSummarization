  Is Knowledge-Free Induction Of Multiword Unit Dictionary Headwords A Solved Problem?
  
    We seek a knowledge-free method for inducing multiword units from text corpora for use as machine-readable dictionary headwords.
    We provide two major evaluations of nine existing collocation-finders and illustrate the continuing need for improvement.
    We use Latent Semantic Analysis to make modest gains in performance, but we show the significant challenges encountered in trying this approach.
  
  
    A multiword unit (MWU) is a connected collocation: a sequence of neighboring words &#8220;whose exact and unambiguous meaning or connotation cannot be derived from the meaning or connotation of its components&#8221; (Choueka, 1988).
    In other words, MWUs are typically non-compositional at some linguistic level.
    For example, phonological non-compositionality has been observed (Finke &amp; Weibel, 1997; Gregory, et al, 1999) where words like &#8220;got&#8221; [gat] and &#8220;to&#8221; [tu] change phoneti
