n Table 6; item by item distributions are provided in Appendix A, and raw counts are available from the authors.
    Note that aggregate means are shown for illustration purposes only-all machine learning experiments are performed on the individual normalized frequencies for each verb, as given in Appendix A.
    The observed distributions of each feature are indeed roughly as expected according to the description in Section 2.
    Unergatives show a very low relative frequency of the TRANS feature, followed by unaccusatives, then object-drop verbs.
    Unaccusative verbs show a high frequency of the CAUS feature and a low frequency of the ANIM feature compared to the other classes.
    Somewhat unexpectedly, object-drop verbs exhibit a non-zero mean CAUS value (almost half the verbs have a CAUS value greater than zero), leading to a three-way causative distinction among the verb classes.
    We suspect that the approximation that we used for causative use-the overlap between subjects 6 For this last set of h
