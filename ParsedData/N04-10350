  What's In A Translation Rule?
  
    We propose a theory that gives formal semantics to word-level alignments defined over parallel corpora.
    We use our theory to introduce a linear algorithm that can be used to derive from word-aligned, parallel corpora the minimal set of syntactically motivated transformation rules that explain human translation data.
  
  
    In a very interesting study of syntax in statistical machine translation, Fox (2002) looks at how well proposed translation models fit actual translation data.
    One such model embodies a restricted, linguistically-motivated notion of word re-ordering.
    Given an English parse tree, children at any node may be reordered prior to translation.
    Nodes are processed independently.
    Previous to Fox (2002), it had been observed that this model would prohibit certain re-orderings in certain language pairs (such as subjectVP(verb-object) into verb-subject-object), but Fox carried out the first careful empirical study, showing that many other
