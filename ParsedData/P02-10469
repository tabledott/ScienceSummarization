    We first derive an expression for the precision of F in terms of G. Note that the second line is derived from the first by rule independence.
    To compute the expression on the righthand side of the last line, we require P(Y |G), P(Y ), P(G|F), and P(G).
    The first value, the precision of G, is assumed known.
    The second value, P(Y ), is also assumed known; it can at any rate be estimated from a small amount of labeled data.
    The last two values, P(G|F) and P(G), can be computed from unlabeled data.
    Thus, given the precision of an arbitrary rule G, we can compute the precision of any otherview rule F. Then we can compute the precision of rules based on the same view as G by using the precision of some other-view rule F. Hence we can compute the precision of every rule given the precision of any one.
    The empirical investigations described here and below use the data set of (Collins and Singer, 1999).
