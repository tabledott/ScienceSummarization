o that parse tree.
    The probability of the parse tree is the sum of the probabilities of the derivations.
    Given our example, there are two different ways to generate the parse tree each with probability t, so that the parse tree has probability t .
    This parse tree is most probable.
    Bod (1993c) shows how to approximate this most probable parse using a Monte Carlo algorithm.
    The algorithm randomly samples possible derivations, then finds the tree with the most sampled derivations.
    Bod shows that the most probable parse yields better performance than the most probable derivation on the exact match criterion.
    Khalil Sima'an (1996) implemented a version of the DOP model, which parses efficiently by limiting the number of trees used and by using an efficient most probable derivation model.
    His experiments differed from ours and Bod's in many ways, including his use of a different version of the ATIS corpus; the use of word strings, rather than part of speech strings; and the fact that
