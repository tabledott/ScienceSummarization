Croft (1994) developed an association thesaurus for matching semantically related words.
    Xu and Croft (1996) offered a trainable method call local context analysis (LCA) which replaces each query term with frequently cooccurring words.
    Roughly speaking, LCA computes a word co-occurrence matrix C for a training corpus.
    A threshold is then applied such that large values in C are replaced by 1 and other values become 0.
    Each row C, can be considered as a feature vector for word i.
    The meaning of a text is approximated by the sum of the word feature vectors.
    Similarity between two texts is estimated by the distance between the corresponding feature vectors (Ponte and Croft, 1997, for details).
    LSA is a classification approach to query expansion.
    The method is similar to LCA in that the &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; of a word w is represented by its relation to other words.
    The primary distinction is, LSA applies principle components analysis to a word similarity matrix to identif
