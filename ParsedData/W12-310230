    Quality estimation aims to provide a quality indicator for machine translated sentences at various granularity levels.
    It differs from MT evaluation, because quality estimation techniques do not rely on reference translations.
    Instead, quality estimation is generally addressed using machine learning techniques to predict quality scores.
    Potential applications of quality estimation include: This shared-task provides a first common ground for development and comparison of quality estimation systems, focusing on sentence-level estimation.
    It provides training and test datasets, along with evaluation metrics
