ake into account additional information both for the content selection and for the surface realization strategy.
    We will briefly discuss the use of two additional sources of information: (i) part of speech (POS) information, and (ii) positional information.
    POS information can be used both in content selection &#8211; to learn which word-senses are more likely to be part of a headline &#8211; and in surface realization.
    Training a POS model for both these tasks requires far less data than training a lexical model, since the number of POS tags is much smaller.
    We used a mixture model (McLachlan and Basford, 1988) &#8211; combining the lexical and the POS probabilities &#8211; for both the content selection and the linearization tasks.
    Another indicator of salience is positional information, which has often been cited as one of the most important cues for summarization by exthe evaluation, but which are semantically equivalent, together with some &#8220;equally good&#8221; generated headline
