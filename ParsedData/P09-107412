ring algorithm (Vilain et al., 1995) computes the F1 score (harmonic mean) of precision and recall based on the identifcation of unique coreference links.
    We use the official MUC scorer implementation for the two MUC corpora and an equivalent implementation for ACE.
    The B3 algorithm (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) computes a precision and recall score for each CE: where RCe is the coreference chain to which ce is assigned in the response (i.e. the system-generated output) and KCe is the coreference chain that contains ce in the key (i.e. the gold standard).
    Precision and recall for a set of documents are computed as the mean over all CEs in the documents and the F1 score of precision and recall is reported.
    B3 Complications.
    Unlike the MUC score, which counts links between CEs, B3 presumes that the gold standard and the system response are clusterings over the same set of CEs.
    This, of course, is not the case when the system automatically identifies the CEs, so the scoring algorithm requires
