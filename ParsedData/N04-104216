uracy on H).
    The results we obtained with the HMM model use a second order model for transitions, and a first order for observations.
    The results on SVM is obtained from (Han et al., 2003) by computing F1 measures from the precision and recall numbers they report.
    Table 2 shows the results on dataset R. SVM results are not available for these datasets.
    From Table (1, 2), one can see that CRF performs significantly better than HMMs, which again supports the previous findings (Lafferty et al., 2001; Pinto et al., 2003).
    CRFs also perform significantly better than SVMbased approach, yielding new state of the art performance on this task.
    CRFs increase the performance on nearly all the fields.
    The overall word accuracy is improved from 92.9% to 98.3%, which corresponds to a 78% error rate reduction.
    However, as we can see word accuracy can be misleading since HMM model even has a higher word accuracy than SVM, although it performs much worse than SVM in most individual fields excep
