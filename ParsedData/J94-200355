 when no empathy relation is clearly indicated and no topic has been clearly established that it is difficult for a 211 Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 2 hearer to determine the empathy relation that the speaker intends.
  Previous Cbs and current Cps can be high on the empathy scale, and yet the discourse ntity realized as the grammatical TOPIC does not necessarily coincide with the discourse ntity realized as the EMPATHY LOCUS.
  A simple sentence to show this point is given in example 25 below: Example 25 Taroo wa Ziroo ni hon o yonde-kuremasita.
  Taroo  TOP/SUBJ Ziroo OBJ2 book OBJ read-gave Taroo gave Ziroo a //avor off reading a book.
  EMPATHY = OBJ2 = ZIROO In example 25, Taroo is the TOPIC while Ziroo is the EMPATHY LOCUS.
  Similarly, a zero does not have to be realized as the EMPATHY LOCUS.
  In 26b the zero in the subject position realizes the Cb and refers to Taroo.
  Example 26 a. Taroo wa syukudai o zenbu yari-oemasita.
