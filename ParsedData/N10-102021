generates the word I with high probability, whereas the likely response state Question generates you, followed by Response which again generates I. Qualitative evaluations are both time-consuming and subjective.
    The above visualization is useful for understanding the Twitter domain, but it is of little use when comparing model variants or selecting parameters.
    Therefore, we also propose a novel quantitative evaluation that measures the intrinsic quality of a conversation model by its ability to predict the ordering of posts in a conversation.
    This measures the model&#8217;s predictive power, while requiring no tagged data, and no commitment to an existing tag inventory.
    Our test set consists of 1,000 randomly selected conversations not found in the training data.
    For each conversation in the test set, we generate all n! permutations of the posts.
    The probability of each permutation is then evaluated as if it were an unseen conversation, using either the forward algorithm (EM) or the Ch
