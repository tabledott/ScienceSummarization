    This is the root of the verb meaning &amp;quot;write&amp;quot;.
    By replacing these three letters with other appropriately chosen I take it as my task to describe how the members of a paradigm like the one in Table I might be generated and recognized effectively and efficiently, and in such a way as to capture and profit from the principal linguistic generalizations inherent in it.
    Now this is a slightly artificial problem because the forms given in Table I are not in fact words, but only verb stems.
    To get the verb forms that would be found in Arabic text, we should have to expand the table very considerably to show the inflected sequences of three consonants, we would obtain corresponding paradigms for other roots.
    With some notable exceptions, the columns of the table contain stems with the same sequenc
