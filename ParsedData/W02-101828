ranged in a sequence that would yield the original sentence pair.
    However, the same sentence pair cannot be generated using the concepts (&#8220;a b&#8221; : &#8220;y&#8221;) and (&#8220;c&#8221; : &#8220;y&#8221;) because the sequence &#8220;x y&#8221; cannot be recreated from the two phrases &#8220;y&#8221; and &#8220;y&#8221;.
    Similarly, the pair cannot be generated using concepts (&#8220;a c&#8221; : &#8220;x&#8221;) and (&#8220;b&#8221; : &#8220;y&#8221;) because the sequence &#8220;a b c&#8221; cannot be created by catenating the phrases &#8220;a c&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221;.
    We say that a set of concepts can be linearized into a sentence pair (E, F) if E and F can be obtained by permuting the phrasesandthat characterize all concepts .
    We denote this property using the predicate .
    Under this model, the probability of a given sentence pair (E, F) can then be obtained by summing up over all possible ways of generating bags of concepts that can be linearized to (E, F).
    Although Mode
