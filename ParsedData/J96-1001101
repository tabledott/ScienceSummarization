etrieval of multilingual documents given a phrase in one language, summarization in one language of texts in another, and multilingual generation.
    Finally, we have carried out three evaluations of the system on three separate years of the Hansards corpus.
    These evaluations indicate that Champollion has a high rate of accuracy: in the best case, 78% of the French translations of valid English collocations were judged to be good.
    This is a good score in comparison with evaluations carried out on full machine translation systems.
    We conjecture that by using statistical techniques to translate a particular type of construction, known to be easily observable in language, we can achieve better results than by applying the same technique to all constructions uniformly.
    Our work is part of a paradigm of research that focuses on the development of tools using statistical analysis of text corpora.
    This line of research aims at producing tools that satisfactorily handle relatively simple tasks.
