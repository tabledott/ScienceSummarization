he training of the SVMTool took more than a day.
			Therefore it was not possible to optimize the parameters systematically.
			We tookstandard features from a 5 word window and M4LRL training without optimization of the regular ization parameter C. In a second experiment, our tagger was also evaluated on the Czech Academic corpus 1.0(Hladk?a et al, 2007) and compared to the TnT tag ger.
			5.1 Tiger Corpus.
			The German Tiger treebank (Brants et al, 2002) contains over 888,000 tokens.
			It is annotated with POS tags from the coarse-grained STTS tagsetand with additional features encoding informa tion about number, gender, case, person, degree,tense, and mood.
			After deleting problematic sentences (e.g. with an incomplete annotation) and automatically correcting some easily detectable er rors, 885,707 tokens were left.
			The first 80% were used as training data, the first half of the rest as development data, and the last 10% as test data.
			Some of the 54 STTS labels were mapped to new labels with dots
