gns the system entities with the reference entities so that the number of common mentions is maximized.
    Each system entity is constrained to align with at most one reference entity, and vice versa.
    For example, suppose that a reference document contains three entities: while a system outputs four entities: , then the best alignment (from reference to system) would be , and other entities are not aligned.
    The number of common mentions of the best alignment is (i.e., The system is first developed and tested using the ACE data.
    The ACE coreference system is trained with documents (about words) of ACE 2002 training data.
    A separate documents ( words) is used as the development-test (Devtest) set.
    In 2002, NIST released two test sets in February (Feb02) and September (Sep02), respectively.
    Statistics of the three test sets is summarized in Table 2.
    We will report coreference results on the true mentions of the three test sets.
    For tests on the MUC data, we report both F-measure
