ies for the three test sets are shown in Figure 7; precision ranges from 21.1% to 52.6%.
    Figure 8 shows the ranking of the true translations among all the candidates for all 19 cases for the purpose of a translator-aid.
    Most of the correct translations can be found among the top 20 candidates.
    The previous two evaluations show that the precision of best-candidate translation using our algorithm is around 30% on average.
    While it is far from ideal, this is the first result of terminology translation from non-parallel corpora.
    Meanwhile, we have found that the correct translation is often among the top 20 candidates.
    This leads us to conjecture that the output from this algorithm can be used as a translator-aid.
    To evaluate this, we again chose the nineteen English/Japanese terms from the WSJ/Nikkei non-parallel corpus as a test set.
    We chose three evaluators who are all native Chinese speakers with bilingual knowledge in English and Chinese.
    Chinese speakers are able to reco
