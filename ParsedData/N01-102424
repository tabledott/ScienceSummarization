    Figure 4 demonstrates this property in greater detail.
    The words conveyed in Figure 4 are all words from the corpus that have potential relationships between variants of the word &#8220;abuse.&#8221; Links between two words, such as &#8220;abuse&#8221; and &#8220;Abuse,&#8221; are labeled with a weight which is the semantic correlation derived by LSA.
    Solid lines represent valid relationships with Prsem&gt;0.85 and dashed lines indicate relationships with lower-thanthreshold scores.
    The absence of a link suggests that either the potential relationship was never identified or discarded at an earlier stage.
    Self loops are assumed for each node since clearly each word should be related morphologically to itself.
    Since there are seven words that are valid morphological relationships of &#8220;abuse,&#8221; we would like to see a complete graph containing 21 solid edges.
    Yet, only eight connections can be found by semantics alone (Abuse&lt;abuse, abusers&lt;abusing, etc.).
    However,
