  An Improved Error Model For Noisy Channel Spelling Correction
  
    The noisy channel model has been applied to a wide range of problems, including spelling correction.
    These models consist of two components: a source model and a channel model.
    Very little research has gone into improving the channel model for spelling correction.
    This paper describes a new channel model for spelling correction, based on generic string to string edits.
    Using this model gives significant performance improvements compared to previously proposed models.
  
  
    The noisy channel model (Shannon 1948) has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including spelling correction.
    These models consist of two components: a source model and a channel model.
    For many applications, people have devoted considerable energy to improving both components, with resulting improvements in overall system accuracy.
    However, relatively little research has gone into improving the channel model for spelli
