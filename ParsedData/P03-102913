ew text, we added another filtering criterion based on the number of nodes in a pattern candidate; the maximum number of nodes is 8.
    Since all the slot-fillers in the extraction task of our experiment are assumed to be instances of the 150 classes in the extended Named Entity hierarchy (Sekine et al., 2002), further filtering was done by requiring a pattern candidate to contain at least one Named Entity class.
  
  
    The experiment of this study is focused on comparing the performance of the earlier extraction pattern models to the proposed Subtree Model (SUBT).
    The compared models are the direct predicate-argument model (PA)9, and the Chain model (CH) in (Sudo et al., 2001).
    The task for this experiment is entity extraction, which is to identify all the entities participating in relevant events in a set of given Japanese texts.
    Note that all NEs in the test documents were identified manually, so that the task can measure only how well extraction patterns can distinguish the participating e
