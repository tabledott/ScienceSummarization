 flow of commodities through each arc, we are led to the following constraints in addition to Eqs.
    4&#8211;5 (we denote U , [0, 1], and B , {0, 1} = U &#8745; Z): These constraints project an outer bound of the arborescence polytope, i.e., Furthermore, the integer points of &#65533;Z(x) are precisely the incidence vectors of dependency trees in Y(x); these are obtained by replacing Eq.
    9 by za &#8712; B, a &#8712; A.
    (11) Given our polyhedral representation of (an outer bound of) the arborescence polytope, we can now formulate dependency parsing with an arcfactored model as an ILP.
    By storing the arclocal feature vectors into the columns of a matrix F(x) , [fa(x)]aEA, and defining the score vector s , F(x)Tw (each entry is an arc score) the inference problem can be written as where A is a sparse constraint matrix (with O(|A|) non-zero elements), and b is the constraint vector; A and b encode the constraints (4&#8211;9).
    This is an ILP with O(|A|) variables and constraints (hence, quadratic
