rates a phrase alignment.
    In (Koehn et al., 2003), various aspects of phrase-based systems are compared, e.g. the phrase extraction method, the underlying word alignment model, or the maximum phrase length.
    (Tomas and Casacuberta, 2003) describes a linear interpolation of a phrase-based and an alignment template-based approach.
  
  
    We described a phrase-based translation approach.
    The basic idea of this approach is to remember all bilingual phrases that have been seen in the word-aligned training corpus.
    As refinements of the baseline model, we described two simple heuristics: the word penalty feature and the phrase penalty feature.
    Additionally, we presented a single-word based lexicon with two smoothing methods.
    The model scaling factors were optimized with respect to the mWER on the development corpus.
    We described a highly efficient monotone search algorithm.
    The worst-case complexity of this algorithm is linear in the sentence length.
    This leads to an impressive
