in English, it is disambiguated by a method extended from (Fung et al. 1999).
    This initial step is based on the same &#8220;find-topic-extract-sentence&#8221; principle as in earlier works.
    The aim of this step is to roughly match the Chinese-English documents pairs that have the same topic, in order to extract parallel sentences from them.
    Similar to previous work, comparability is defined by cosine similarity between document vectors.
    Both the glossed Chinese document and English are represented in word vectors, with term weights.
    We evaluated different combinations of term weighting of each word in the corpus: term frequency (tf); inverse document frequency (idf); tf.idf; and the product of a function of tf and idf.
    The &#8221;documents&#8221; here are sentences.
    We find that using idf alone gives the best sentence pair rank.
    This is probably due to the fact that frequencies of bilingual word pairs are not comparable in a very-non-parallel corpus.
