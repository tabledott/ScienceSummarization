ties include all available probabilistic information (subject to assumptions implicit in the SCFG formalism) available from an input prefix, whereas the usual inside probabilities do not take into account the nonterminal prior probabilities that result from the top-down relation to the start state.
    Using top-down constraints does not necessarily mean sacrificing robustness, as discussed in Section 5.4.
    On the contrary, by using Earley-style parsing with a set of carefully designed and estimated &amp;quot;fault-tolerant&amp;quot; top-level productions, it should be possible to use probabilities to better advantage in robust parsing.
    This approach is a subject of ongoing work, in the context of tight-coupling SCFGs with speech decoders (Jurafsky, Wooters, Segal, Stolcke, Fosler, Tajchman, and Morgan 1995).
    One of the major alternative context-free parsing paradigms besides Earley's algorithm is LR parsing (Aho and Ullman 1972).
