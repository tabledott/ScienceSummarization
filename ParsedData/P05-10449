aper, each model is a weighted finite-state automaton (WFSA) where states correspond to POS tags.
    The parameter vector B E Rn specifies a weight for each of the n transitions in the automaton. y is a hidden path through the automaton (determining a POS sequence), and x is the string it emits. u(x, y  |0) is defined by applying exp to the total weight of all transitions in y.
    This is an example of Eqs.
    4 and 6 where fj(x, y) is the number of times the path y takes the jth transition.
    The partition function Z( 0) of the WFSA is found by adding up the u-scores of all paths through the WFSA.
    For a k-state WFSA, this equates to solving a linear system of k equations in k variables (Tarjan, 1981).
    But if the WFSA contains cycles this infinite sum may diverge.
    Alternatives to exact com2These are exemplified by CRFs (Lafferty et al., 2001), which can be viewed alternately as undirected dynamic graphical models with a chain topology, as log-linear models over entire sequences with local fea
