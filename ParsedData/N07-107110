estimate the above frequencies using: these classes co-occurring even though they would form a valid relational selectional preference.
    To alleviate this problem, we propose a second model that is less strict by considering the arguments of the binary semantic relations independently, as in example (3).
    Similarly to JRM, we extract each instance p, of each semantic relation p and retrieve the set of semantic classes C(x) and C(y) that x and y belong to, accumulating the frequencies of the triples p, and p, where tic class given the relation p, according to Equations 3.3. where p, denotes the frequency of observing cy d c(y) in our equations.
    The intersection of the two sets of SPs forms the candidate inferential SPs for the inference pi =&gt; pj: (Law Enforcement Agent, *) (*, Person) We use the same minimum, maximum, and average ranking strategies as in JIM.
    Whereas in Section 3.1 we learned selectional preferences for the arguments of a relation p, in this section we learn selectional prefer
