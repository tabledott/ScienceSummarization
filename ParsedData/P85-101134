  From G we cam obtain GI u follows.
  For each initial tree a, mmociate with the root the quadruple (q0, q, q, qr) where qe is the initial state of the ~qni~ state automaton M, and ~ E QF.
  For each auxiliary tree # of G, associate with the root the quadruple (ql,q~,qa,q4), where q,ql,q=,ch,q4 a~e some variables which will later be given values from Q.
  Let X be some node in some elementary tree cL Let (ql,q=,o.s,q4) be ~umociaU~l with X.
  Then, we have to consider the fol~)~iag cues Cans I" X hi- two chUdreu Y and Z.
  The left child y is the ancestor of the foot node of a.
  Then zuoeiste with V the quadruple ( p, q~, o..I, q ), and ( q, r, r, s ) with Z, and ~ssociate with X: the constraint that only throe trees whoue root has the quadruple ( qt, P, s, q4 ), among Shone which were allowed in the orism~ grmmmus, may be adjoined at this node.
  If qt pd p, or q4 ~,i s , then the constraint associated with X must be made obligatory.
