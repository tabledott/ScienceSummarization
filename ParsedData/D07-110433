anynatural language tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging and information extraction, has shown that feature engineering plays a critical role in these approaches.
			However, in machine translation most fea tures can still be traced back to the IBM Models of 15 years ago (Lopez, 2007b).
			Recently, Lopez and Resnik (2006) showed that most of the features used in standard phrase-based models do not help very much.
			Our algorithms enable us to look up phrasepairs in context, which will allow us to compute interesting contextual features that can be used in discriminative learning algorithms to improve transla tion accuracy.
			Essentially, we can use the training data itself as an indirect representation of whateverfeatures we might want to compute.
			This is not pos sible with table-based architectures.Most of the data structures and algorithms discussed in this paper are widely used in bioinformatics, including suffix arrays, prefix trees, and suf fix links (Gusfield, 1997).
