tion 6.
    As a result of this process, we have the original text, with each word augmented with values for all the features in Figure 2.
    These values represent a complete morphological disambiguation.
    Furthermore, these features contain enough information about the presence of clitics and affixes to perform tokenization, for any reasonable tokenization scheme.
    Finally, we can determine the POS tag, for any morphologically motivated POS tagset.
    Thus, we have performed tokenization, traditional POS tagging, and full morphological disambiguation in one fell swoop.
  
  
    Our work is inspired by Haji&#711;c (2000), who convincingly shows that for five Eastern European languages with complex inflection plus English, using a morphological analyzer3 improves performance of a tagger.
    He concludes that for highly inflectional languages &#8220;the use of an independent morphological dictionary is the preferred choice [over] more annotated data&#8221;.
    Haji&#711;c (2000) uses a general expon
