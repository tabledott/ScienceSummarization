 Wikipedia features rank high, indicating again that it provides a valid knowledge base.
  
  
    The results are somehow surprising, as one would not expect a community-generated categorization to be almost as informative as a well structured lexical taxonomy such as WordNet.
    Nevertheless Wikipedia offers promising results, which we expect to improve as well as the encyclopedia goes under further development.
    In this paper we investigated the effects of using different semantic knowledge sources within a machine learning based coreference resolution system.
    This involved mining the WordNet taxonomy and the Wikipedia encyclopedic knowledge base, as well as including semantic parsing information, in order to induce semantic features for coreference learning.
    Empirical results show that coreference resolution benefits from semantics.
    The generated model is able to learn selectional preferences in cases where surface morpho-syntactic features do not suffice, i.e. pronoun and common name reso
