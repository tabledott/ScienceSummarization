xperimental pproach adopted, this risk of error is taken into account and kept under control, as each rule is tested separately against the corpus, and it is the test of the number of cases to which it applies which decides whether it gets into LEXTER or not.
  The principle is not to include rules of analysis which are too strict; it is preferable to drop a rule which is productive in many cases (as for the rule A + LE, LA or LES = frontier) if the number of residual cases of erroneous analysis is too high.
  This principle, called "of relative strictness", is justified in that it will be easier for the te~ninologist toeliminate certain likely units than to find real terminological units that escaped etection by LEXTER 6) Re ferences [Benveniste 1966] Benveniste Emile (1966) "Formes nouvelles de la composition nominale", in Probldmes de linguistique gdn~rale, Tome 2, PP 163-176, Gallimard, Paris [Bourigault 1992a] Bouriganlt  Didier (1992) "LEXTER, vers un outil liguistique daide b. lacquisition des connaiss
