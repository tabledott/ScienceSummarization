umber of l-errors with MEMMs amounts to 416, which is 70% of total errors, and is even larger than that of naive HMMs (306).
    This result supports our claim that MEMMs is not sufficient to be applied to Japanese morphological analysis where the length bias is inevitable.
    Asahara et al. extended the original HMMs by 1) position-wise grouping of POS tags, 2) word-level statistics, and 3) smoothing of word and POS level statistics (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2000).
    All of these techniques are designed to capture hierarchical structures of POS tagsets.
    For instance, in the position-wise grouping, optimal levels of POS hierarchies are changed according to the contexts.
    Best hierarchies for each context are selected by handcrafted rules or automatic error-driven procedures.
    CRFs can realize such extensions naturally and straightforwardly.
    In CRFs, position-wise grouping and word-POS smoothing are simply integrated into a design of feature functions.
    Parameters &#955;k for each feature are
