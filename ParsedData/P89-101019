mmon uses of common words were not), or on small corpora of only a million words or so, which are reliably informative for only the most common uses of the few most frequent words of English.
    (A million-word corpus such as the Brown Corpus is reliable, roughly, for only some uses of only some of the forms of around 4000 dictionary entries.
    But standard dictionaries typically contain twenty times this number of entries.)
    The computational tools available for studying machine-readable corpora are at present still rather primitive.
    There are concordancing programs (see Figure 1 at the end of this paper), which are basically KWIC (key word in context [Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger (1988), p. 122]) indexes with additional features such as the ability to extend the context, sort leftwards as well as rightwards, and so on.
    There is very little interactive software.
    In a typical situation in the lexicography of the 1980s, a lexicographer is given the concordances for a word, marks up the prin
