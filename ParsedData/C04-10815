process, but an integral part of segmentation.
			Newly detected words are re-incorporated into our word lexicon,and used to improve segmentation.
			Improved seg mentation can then be further used to improve new word detection.
			Comparing Chinese word segmentation accuracyacross systems can be difficult because many re search papers use different data sets and different ground-rules.
			Some published results claim 98% or99% segmentation precision and recall, but these ei ther count only the words that occur in the lexicon, or use unrealistically simple data, lexicons that haveextremely small (or artificially non-existant) outof-vocabulary rates, short sentences or many numbers.
			A recent Chinese word segmentation competition (Sproat and Emerson, 2003) has made compar isons easier.
			The competition provided four datasets with significantly different segmentation guidelines, and consistent train-test splits.
			The performance ofparticipating system varies significantly across different datasets.
