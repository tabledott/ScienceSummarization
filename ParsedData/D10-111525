s of American adult, American menu, etc., summed to construct the American N centroid).
    We looked at the nearest neighbors of these centroids in semantic space among the 41K items (adjectives, nouns and ANs) in our extended vocabulary (here and in all experiments below, similarity is quantified by the cosine of the angle between two vectors).
    As illustrated for a random sample of 9 centroids in Table 1 (but applying to the remaining 27 adjectives as well), centroids are positioned in intuitively reasonable areas of the space, typically near the adjective itself or the corresponding noun (the noun green near green N), prototypical ANs for that adjective (black face), elements related to the definition of the adjective (mental activity, historical event, green colour, quick and little cost for easy N), and so on.
