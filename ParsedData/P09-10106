p d to a sequence of actions a&#65533; = (a0, ... , a,1).
    Actions are predicted and executed sequentially.2 An action a = (c, R, W') encompasses a command c, the command&#8217;s parameters R, and the words W' specifying c and R. Elements of R refer to objects available in the environment state, as described below.
    Some parameters can also refer to words in document d. Additionally, to account for words that do not describe any actions, c can be a null command.
    The Environment The environment state &#163; specifies the set of objects available for interaction, and their properties.
    In Figure 2, &#163; is shown on the right.
    The environment state &#163; changes in response to the execution of command c with parameters R according to a transition distribution p(&#163;'J&#163;, c, R).
    This distribution is a priori unknown to the learner.
    As we will see in Section 5, our approach avoids having to directly estimate this distribution.
    State To predict actions sequentially, we need to
