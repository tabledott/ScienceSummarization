  We call this the recoverable semantic content, since it con- sists of just that information the hearer should be able to derive from the corresponding utter- ance, even if that information is not stated explic- itly: in particular, elided elements and instances of oae-anaphora are represented in the deep seman- tic structure by their more semantically complete counterparts, as we will see below.
  From the deep semantic structure, a surface semantic structure is then constructed.
  Unlike the deep semantic structure, this closely matches the syntactic structure of the resulting noun phrase, and is suitable for passing directly to a PAT
