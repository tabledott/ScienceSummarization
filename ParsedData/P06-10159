ces containing the two terms x and y.
    The sentences are then generalized into a set of new sentences Sx,y by replacing all terminological expressions by a terminological label, TR.
    For example: Term generalization is useful for small corpora to ease data sparseness.
    Generalized patterns are naturally less precise, but this is ameliorated by our filtering step described in Section 3.3.
    As in the original algorithm, all substrings linking terms x and y are then extracted from Sx,y, and overall frequencies are computed to form P. In (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002), a frequency threshold on the patterns in P is set to select the final patterns.
    However, low frequency patterns may in fact be very good.
    In this paper, instead of frequency, we propose a novel measure of pattern reliability, r,, which is described in detail in Section 3.2.
    Espresso ranks all patterns in P according to reliability rt and discards all but the top-k, where k is set to the number of patterns from the previous ite
