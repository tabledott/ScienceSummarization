es that broadcast the same message to their neighbors.
    It can be viewed as a simulation of an agent-based social network; for an overview of this field, see (Amblard 2002).
    The algorithm is outlined in figure 1: initialize: forall vi in V: class(vi)=i; while changes: forall v in V, randomized order: class(v)=highest ranked class in neighborhood of v; Intuitively, the algorithm works as follows in a bottom-up fashion: First, all nodes get different classes.
    Then the nodes are processed for a small number of iterations and inherit the strongest class in the local neighborhood.
    This is the class whose sum of edge weights to the current node is maximal.
    In case of multiple strongest classes, one is chosen randomly.
    Regions of the same class stabilize during the iteration and grow until they reach the border of a stable region of another class.
    Note that classes are updated immediately: a node can obtain classes from the neighborhood that were introduced there in the same iteration.
