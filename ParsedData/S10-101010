    As with the time expressions results, the sample size for Spanish is small, but note again the higher f-measure for event extents in Spanish.
    Table 6 shows the results for all relation tasks, with the Spanish systems in the first two rows and the English systems in the last six rows.
    Recall that for Spanish the training and test sets only contained data for tasks C and D. Interestingly, the version of the TIPSem systems that were applied to the Spanish data did much better on task C compared to its English cousins, but much worse on task D, which is rather puzzling.
    Such a difference in performance of the systems could be due to differences in annotation accurateness, or it could be due to some particularities of how the two languages express certain temporal aspects, or perhaps the one corpus is more homogeneous than the other.
    Again, there are not enough data points, but the issue deserves further attention.
    For each task, the test data provided the event pairs or event-timex pa
