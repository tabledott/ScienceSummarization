s.
    Third, additional work is needed to design kernels suitable to learn the deep semantic contained in FrameNet as it seems not sensible to both PAF and SCF information.
    Finally, an analysis of SVMs using polynomial kernels over standard features has explained why they largely outperform linear classifiers based-on standard features.
    In the future we plan to design other structures and combine them with SCF, PAF and standard features.
    In this vision the learning will be carried out on a set of structural features instead of a set of flat features.
    Other studies may relate to the use of SCF to generate verb clusters.
