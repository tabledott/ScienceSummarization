er option would have been to guess at various DepBank analyses, which would have made the the evaluation even more biased against the CCG parser.
    One advantage of this approach is that, by comparing the transformed goldstandard CCG dependencies with the gold-standard GRs, we can measure how close the CCG representation is to the GRs.
    This provides some indication of how difficult it is to perform the transformation, and also provides an upper bound on the accuracy of the parser on DepBank.
    This method would be useful when converting the output of the Collins parser into an alternative representation (Kaplan et al. 2004): Applying the transformation to the gold-standard Penn Treebank trees and comparing with DepBank would provide an upper bound on the performance of the Collins parser and give some indication of the effectiveness of the transformation. argument slot.
    For many of the CCG dependencies, the mapping into GRs is straightforward.
    For example, the first two rows of Table 14 show t
