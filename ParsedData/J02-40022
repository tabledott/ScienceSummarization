nd classifies it into a fixed set of seven rhetorical categories.
    The output of this extraction and classification system can be viewed as a single-document summary in its own right; alternatively, it provides starting material for the generation of task-oriented and user-tailored summaries designed to give users an overview of a scientific field.
  
  
    Summarization systems are often two-phased, consisting of a content selection step followed by a regeneration step.
    In the first step, text fragments (sentences or clauses) are assigned a score that reflects how important or contentful they are.
    The highestranking material can then be extracted and displayed verbatim as &#8220;extracts&#8221; (Luhn 1958; Edmundson 1969; Paice 1990; Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen 1995).
    Extracts are often useful in an information retrieval environment since they give users an idea as to what the source document is about (Tombros and Sanderson 1998; Mani et al. 1999), but they are texts of relatively low quality.
