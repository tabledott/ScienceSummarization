corpus, and we have developed tagging guidelines (Elhadad et al., 2005) to define a comprehensive tag set, and assist human taggers achieve high agreement.
    The results discussed above should be taken as rough approximations of the real performance of the systems, until they can be re-evaluated on such a large scale corpus with a standard tag set.
    Arabic is a language with morphology quite similar to Hebrew.
    Theoretically, there might be 330,000 possible morphological tags, but in practice, Habash and Rambow (2005) extracted 2,200 different tags from their corpus, with an average number of 2 possible tags per word.
    As reported by Habash and Rambow, the first work on Arabic tagging which used a corpus for training and evaluation was the work of Diab et al. (2004).
    Habash and Rambow were the first to use a morphological analyzer as part of their tagger.
    They developed a supervised morphological disambiguator, based on training corpora of two sets of 120K words, which combines several clas
