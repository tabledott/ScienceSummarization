silisk (Bootstrapping Approach to SemantIc Lexicon Induction using Semantic Knowledge) is a weakly supervised bootstrapping algorithm that automatically generates semantic lexicons.
    Figure 1 shows the high-level view of Basilisk&#8217;s bootstrapping process.
    The input to Basilisk is an unannotated text corpus and a few manually defined seed words for each semantic category.
    Before bootstrapping begins, we run an extraction pattern learner over the corpus which generates patterns to extract every noun phrase in the corpus.
    The bootstrapping process begins by selecting a subset of the extraction patterns that tend to extract the seed words.
    We call this the pattern pool.
    The nouns extracted by these patterns become candidates for the lexicon and are placed in a candidate word pool.
    Basilisk scores each candidate word by gathering all patterns that extract it and measuring how strongly those contexts are associated with words that belong to the semantic category.
