ject; see Levin [1985, 1989]), consider the grammatical alternations in the example sentences below (cf.
    Dowty 1991).
    These three pairs show how the semantics of transitive motion verbs (e.g. run into) is similar in some respects to reciprocal verbs such as meet.
    The important difference, however, is that the reciprocal interpretation requires that both subject and object be animate or moving; hence 12b is ill-formed.
    (cf.
    Levin 1989; Dowty 1991).
    Another example of how diathesis reveals the underlying semantic differences between verbs is illustrated in Examples 13 and 14 below.
    A construction called the conative (see Hale and Keyser [1986] and Levin [1985]) involves adding the preposition at to the verb, changing the verb meaning to an action directed toward an object. a. Mary cut the bread. b. Mary cut at the bread. a. Mary broke the bread. b.
    *Mary broke at the bread.
    What these data indicate is that the conative is possible only with verbs of a particular semantic clas
