			A subset of 560 dependency structures of thePARC 700 Dependency Bank following (Ka plan et al, 2004)The results are given in Table 7.
			The parenttransformed grammars perform best in both architectures.
			In all cases, there is a marked improvement (2.07-6.36%) in the f-structures after LDD res olution.
			We achieve between 73.78% and 80.97% preds-only and 83.79% to 87.04% all GFs f-score, depending on gold-standard.
			We achieve between77.68% and 80.24% against the PARC 700 follow ing the experiments in (Kaplan et al, 2004).
			For details on how we map the f-structures produced by our parsers to a format similar to that of the PARC 700 Dependency Bank, see (Burke et al, 2004).
			Table 8 shows the evaluation result brokendown by individual GF (preds-only) for the inte grated model PA-PCFG against the
