solutions outlined above are not attractive.
    All of those solutions provide the learner with additional specific knowledge of English, whereas the goal for the machine learning effort should be to replace specific knowledge with general knowledge about the types of regularities to be found in natural language.
    There is one approach to the lexical ambiguity problem that does not require giving the learner additional specific knowledge.
    The problem is as follows: words that occur frequently as, say, nouns are likely to have a different error rate from unambiguous verbs.
    If it were known which words occur primarily as verbs and which occur primarily as nouns then separate error rate estimates could be made for each.
    This would reduce the rate of false positive errors even without any further information about which particular occurrences are nominal and which are verbal.
    One way to distinguish primarily nominal words from primarily verbal words is by the relative frequencies of their vari
