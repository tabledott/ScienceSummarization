s constructed.
    This capability is obviously of crucial importance if the model is to be applied in the construction of computer systems which can enter into actual dialogs.
    The Dynamic Discourse Model, therefore, must construct the semantic interpretation of a discourse on a clause by clause basis, from left to right, yielding intermediate semantic representations of unfinished constituents, as well as setting the semantic parameters whose values influence the interpretation of subsequent constituents.
    A syntactic/semantic system of this sort may very well be fromulated as an Augmented Transition Network grammar (Woods, 1970), a non-deterministic parsing system specified by a set of transition networks which may call each other recursively.
    Every Speech Event type, DU type and dcu type is associated with a transition network specifying its internal structure.
    As a transition network processes the consecutive constituents of a discourse segment, it builds up, step by step, a representation
