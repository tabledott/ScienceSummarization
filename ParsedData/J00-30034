nance (Linell 1990) might be measured more accurately using DA distributions than with simpler techniques, and could serve as an indicator of the type or genre of discourse at hand.
    In all these cases, DA labels would enrich the available input for higher-level processing of the spoken words.
    Another important role of DA information could be feedback to lower-level processing.
    For example, a speech recognizer could be constrained by expectations of likely DAs in a given context, constraining the potential recognition hypotheses so as to improve accuracy.
    The 42 dialogue act labels.
    DA frequencies are given as percentages of the total number of utterances in the overall corpus.
    The goal of this article is twofold: On the one hand, we aim to present a comprehensive framework for modeling and automatic classification of DAs, founded on well-known statistical methods.
    In doing so, we will pull together previous approaches as well as new ideas.
    For example, our model draws on the us
