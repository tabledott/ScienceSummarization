ns may not impact the overall score if they are left as singletons, which are discarded by our post-processing step.
    Therefore, our mention detection algorithm focuses on attaining high recall rather than high precision.
    We achieve our goal based on the list of sieves sorted by recall (from highest to lowest).
    Each sieve uses syntactic parse trees, identified named entity mentions, and a few manually written patterns based on heuristics and OntoNotes specifications (Hovy et al., 2006; Pradhan et al., 2007).
    In the first and highest recall sieve, we mark all noun phrase (NP), possessive pronoun, and named entity mentions in each sentence as candidate mentions.
    In the following sieves, we remove from this set all mentions that match any of the exclusion rules below: of 8 words, e.g., there, ltd., hmm.
    Note that the above rules extract both mentions in appositive and copulative relations, e.g., [[Yongkang Zhou], the general manager] or [Mr. Savoca] had been [a consultant... ].
