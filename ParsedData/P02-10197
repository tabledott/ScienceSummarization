word, and run the Brill and Moore training algorithm over that.
    For PH, we need word pronunciations for the correct words and the misspellings.
    As the misspellings are certainly not in the dictionary we need a letterto-phone converter that generates possible pronunciations for them.
    The next section describes our letter-to-phone model.
  
  
    There has been a lot of research on machine learning methods for letter-to-phone conversion.
    High accuracy is achieved, for example, by using neural networks (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987), decision trees (Jiang et al., 1997), and N-grams (Fisher, 1999).
    We use a modified version of the method proposed by Fisher, incorporating several extensions resulting in substantial gains in performance.
    In this section we first describe how we do alignment at the phone level, then describe Fisher&#8217;s model, and finally present our extensions and the resulting letterto-phone conversion accuracy.
