the target semantics z. An exhaustive setof lexical entries is then generated by taking all categories generated by the GENLEX rules, and pair ing themwith all possible sub-strings of the sentencex.
			Note that our lexicon can contain multi-word en tries, where a multi-word string such as New Yorkcan be paired with a CCG category.
			The final out 3For example, features which count the number of lexical entries of a particular type, or features that count the number of applications of a particular CCG combinator.4In our experiments we use a parsing algorithm that is simi lar to a CKY-style parser with dynamic programming.
			Dynamic programming is used but each entry in the chart maintains a full semantic expression, preventing a polynomial-time algorithm; beam search is used to make the approach tractable.
			5This problem is compounded by the fact that the lexicon is unknown, so that many of the possible hidden derivations involve completely spurious lexical entries.
