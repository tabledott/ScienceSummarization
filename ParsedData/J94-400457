on of the last two cases could be viewed as an appeal to a constraint that is analogous to the 0-criterion in syntax.
  Essentially, this constraint states that all arguments and modifiers must be licensed (see Chomsky 1986a; Abney 1989) in order to appear either in the syntactic structure or in the conceptual structure.
  In the context of conceptual structure, a logical modifier may license the realization of a logical head in an internal argument position, but not in an adjunct position, since the modifier elation is already satisfied by virtue of the relation between the head and the modifier.
  Similarly, a logical argument may license the realization of a logical head in a syntactic adjunct position, but not in an internal argument position, since the head-argument relation is already satisfied by virtue of the relation between the head and the argument.
  Having eliminated the meaningless possibilities, we are left with the promotional nd demotional cases presented above.
