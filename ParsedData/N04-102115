one) or 1 &#8722; P(ATi is left-monotone).
    The right-continuous model computes the total probability of all ATs being right continuous: where the lower left corner of the AT touches the upper right corner of the previous AT and the first word in the current AT immediately follows the last word in the previous AT.
    The total probability is the product over all alignment templates i, either P(ATi is right-continuous) or 1 &#8722; P(ATi is right-continuous).
    In both models, the probabilities P have been estimated from the full training data (train).
  
  
    By shallow syntax, we mean the output of the part-ofspeech tagger and chunkers.
    We hope that such features can combine the strengths of tag- and chunk-based translation systems (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2003) with our baseline system.
    This feature uses Chinese POS tag sequences as surrogates for Chinese words to model movement.
    Chinese words are too sparse to model movement, but an attempt to model movement using Chinese POS may be more
