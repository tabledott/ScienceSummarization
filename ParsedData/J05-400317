 the Arabic word at in Figure 4) is indicative of non-parallelism.
    Most likely, these connections were produced because of a lack of better alternatives.
    Another aspect of interest is the presence of long contiguous connected spans, which we define as pairs of bilingual substrings in which the words in one substring are connected only to words in the other substring.
    Such a span may contain a few words without any connection (a small percentage of the length of the span), but no word with a connection outside the span.
    Examples of such spans can be seen in Figure 3: the English strings after saudi mediation failed or to the international court ofjustice together with their Arabic counterparts.
    Long contiguous connected spans are indicative of parallelism, since they suggest that the two sentences have long phrases in common.
    And, in contrast, long substrings whose words are all unconnected are indicative of non-parallelism.
    To summarize, our classifier uses the following features,
