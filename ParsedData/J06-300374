nce between a pair and its potential neighbors, and LRA is itself determined in an unsupervised fashion (i.e., LRA does not need labeled data).
    Each SAT question has five choices, so answering 374 SAT questions required calculating 374 x 5 x 16 = 29,920 cosines.
    The factor of 16 comes from the alternate pairs, step 11 in LRA.
    With the noun-modifier pairs, using leave-one-out cross-validation, each test pair has 599 choices, so an exhaustive application of LRA would require calculating 600 x 599 x 16 = 5,750,400 cosines.
    To reduce the amount of computation required, we first find the 30 nearest neighbors for each pair, ignoring the alternate pairs (600 x 599 = 359,400 cosines), and then apply the full LRA, including the alternates, to just those 30 neighbors (600 x 30 x 16 = 288, 000 cosines), which requires calculating only 359,400 + 288, 000 = 647,400 cosines.
    There are 600 word pairs in the input set for LRA.
    In step 2, introducing alternate pairs multiplies the number of pairs by fo
