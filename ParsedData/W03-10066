represent surface syntax aspects of the input parse tree.
    This should not be taken to mean that deep syntax features are not important.
    For example, in their inclusion of voice, Gildea and Palmer (2002) note that this deep syntax feature plays an important role in connecting semantic role with surface grammatical function.
    Aside from voice, we posit that other deep linguistic features may be useful to predict semantic role.
    In this work, we explore the use of more general, deeper syntax features.
    We also experiment with semantic features derived from the PropBank.
    Our methodology is as follows.
    The first stage entails generating features representing different levels of linguistic analysis.
    This is done by first automatically extracting several kinds of TAG from the PropBank.
    This may in itself generate useful features because TAG structures typically relate closely syntactic arguments with their corresponding predicate.
    Beyond this, our TAG extraction procedure produce
