he outputs are selected.5 The superiority of the third method over the second method is a natural consequence of the consistent use of both in the estimation (as the objective function) and in the parsing (as the score of a parse).
    Parsing performance on section 23 of the WSJ corpus using a PCFG-LA model is shown in Table 2.
    We used the instance of the four compared in the second experiment that gave the best results on the development set.
    Several previously reported results on the same test set are also listed in Table 2.
    Our result is lower than the state-of-the-art lexicalized PCFG parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 1999), but comparable to the unlexicalized PCFG parser of Klein and Manning (2003).
    Klein and Manning&#8217;s PCFG is annotated by many linguistically motivated features that they found using extensive manual feature selection.
    In contrast, our method induces all parameters automatically, except that manually written head-rules are used in binarization.
    Thus, our met
