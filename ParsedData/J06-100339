ences between the versions of WordNet used in the experiments (Resnik), and differences in the corpora used to obtain the frequency data (Jiang and Conrath, Lin).
  Also, the coefficients reported by Resnik and Lin are actually based on only 28 out of the 30 Miller?Charles pairs because of a noun missing from an earlier version of WordNet.
  Jarmasz and Szpakowicz (2003) repeated the experiment, obtaining similar results to ours in some cases and markedly different results in others; in their experiment, the correlations obtained with their measure that uses the hierarchy of Roget?s Thesaurus exceeded those of all the WordNet measures.
