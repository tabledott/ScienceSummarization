rmation and greatly improves upon the monolingual baselines, but falls short of the &#8220;No LP&#8221; model by 2.5% on an average.
    The &#8220;No LP&#8221; model does not outperform direct projection for German and Greek, but performs better for six out of eight languages.
    Overall, it gives improvements ranging from 1.1% for German to 14.7% for Italian, for an average improvement of 8.3% over the unsupervised feature-HMM model.
    For comparison, the completely unsupervised feature-HMM baseline accuracy on the universal POS tags for English is 79.4%, and goes up to 88.7% with a treebank dictionary.
    Our full model (&#8220;With LP&#8221;) outperforms the unsupervised baselines and the &#8220;No LP&#8221; setting for all languages.
    It falls short of the &#8220;Projection&#8221; baseline for German, but is statistically indistinguishable in terms of accuracy.
    As indicated by bolding, for seven out of eight languages the improvements of the &#8220;With LP&#8221; setting are statistically sign
