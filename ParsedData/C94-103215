 speech assignment taking into account he entire sentence.
  Therefore, we can formalize the unknown word problem as (letermin- ing the span of an unknown word, assigning its part of speech, and estimating its probability given its part of speech.
  Let us call a computational model that determines the probability of any word hypothesis given its lexi- cal form and its part of speech the "word model".
  The word model must account for morphology and word for- marion to estimate the part of speech and tile probabil- ity of a word hypothesis.
  For tile first approxinmtion, we used the character trigram of each part of sl)eech as the word model.
  Let C = cic~.., c,~ denote the sequence of n charac- ters that constitute word zv whose part of speech is t. We approximate the probability of the word given part of speech P(wlt ) by tile trigram probabilities, p(,,,Iz) = P,(C) - -  f,(~,l#, #)~,(~1#, &lt;) u IX P,(~,lc+-=, ~ -~)r,(#1c.._l, ..,) i=3 (9) where special symbol "#" indicates ttle word boundary marker.
