re shown in Table 6.
    In both tables, the following results are reported: Lattice/HGMBR with default parameters (&#8722;5,1.5, 2, 3, 4) computed using corpus statistics (Tromble et al., 2008), Lattice/HGMBR with parameters derived from MERT both without/with the baseline model cost feature (mert&#8722;b, mert+b).
    For multi-language systems, we only show the # of language-pairs with gains/no-changes/drops for each MBR variant with respect to the MAP translation.
    We observed in the NIST systems that MERT resulted in short translations relative to MAP on the unseen test set.
    To prevent this behavior, we modify the MERT error criterion to include a sentence-level brevity scorer with parameter &#945;: BLEU+brevity(&#945;).
    This brevity scorer penalizes each candidate translation that is shorter than the average length over its reference translations, using a penalty term which is linear in the difference between either length.
    We tune &#945; on the development set so that the brevity score o
