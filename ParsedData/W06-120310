the dimensionality from 1000 to 100, resulting in 100 dimensional &#8220;meaning&#8221;-vectors for each word.
    In our experiments, MWEs were assigned meaningvectors as a whole, using the same proceedure.
    For meaning similarity we adopt the standard measure of cosine of the angle between two vectors (the normalized correlation coefficient) as a metric (Sch&#168;utze, 1998; Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).
    On this metric, two expressions are taken to be unrelated if their meaning vectors are orthogonal (the cosine is 0) and synonymous if their vectors are parallel (the cosine is 1).
    Figure 1 illustrates such a vector space in two dimensions.
    Note that the meaning vector for L&#168;offel &#8216;spoon&#8217; is quite similar to that for essen &#8216;to eat&#8217; but distant from sterben &#8216;to die&#8217;, while the meaning vector for the MWE den L&#168;offel abgeben is close to that for sterben.
    Indeed den L&#168;offel abgeben, like to kick the bucket, is a noncompositional idiom m
