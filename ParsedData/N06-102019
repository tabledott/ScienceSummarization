bout the hardest things in parsing, and we have no grip on exactly what it takes to help parse them.
    Conversely, everyone expected improvements on unknown words, as the self-training should drastically reduce the number of them.
    It is also the case that we thought PP attachment might be improved because of the increased coverage of prepositionnoun and preposition-verb combinations that work such as (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) show to be so important.
    Currently, our best conjecture is that unknowns are not improved because the words that are unknown in the WSJ are not significantly represented in the LA Times we used for self-training.
    CCs are difficult for parsers because each conjunct has only one secure boundary.
    This is particularly the case with longer conjunctions, those of VPs and Ss.
    One thing we know is that self-training always improves performance of the parsing model when used as a language model.
    We think CC improvement is connected with this fact and our earlier point tha
