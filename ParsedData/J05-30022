rmation for applications such as summarization and question answering (Mani and Bloedorn 1997; Radev and McKeown 1998; Radev, Prager, and Samn 2000; Clarke, Cormack, and Lynam 2001; Dumais et al. 2002; Chu-Carroll et al.

    Clearly, it would be highly desirable to have a mechanism that could identify common information among multiple related documents and fuse it into a coherent text.
    In this article, we present a method for sentence fusion that exploits redundancy to achieve this task in the context of multidocument summarization.
    A straightforward approach for approximating sentence fusion can be found in the use of sentence extraction for multidocument summarization (Carbonell and Goldstein 1998; Radev, Jing, and Budzikowska 2000; Marcu and Gerber 2001; Lin and Hovy 2002).
    Once a system finds a set of sentences that convey similar information (e.g., by clustering), one of these sentences is selected to represent the set.
    This is a robust approach that is always guaranteed to out
