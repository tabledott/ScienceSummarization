    Recall and precision curves of N-gram co-occurrence statistics versus human assessment for DUC 2001 multi-document task.
    Dark (black) solid lines are for average of all summary sizes, light (red) solid lines are for 50-word summaries, dashed (green) lines are for 100-word summaries, dash-dot lines (blue) are for 200-word summaries, and dotted (magenta) lines are for 400-word summaries. ent summary sizes.
    Both of them exclude stopwords.
    We use z-test in all the significance tests with &#10065; level at 0.10, 0.05, 0.25, 0.01, and 0.005.
    From Figures 3 and 4, we can see Ngram(1,1) and Ngram(2,2) reside on the upper right corner of the recall and precision graphs.
    Ngram(1,1) has the best overall behavior.
    These graphs confirm Ngram(1,1) (simple unigram) is a good automatic scoring metric with good statistical significance prediction power.
