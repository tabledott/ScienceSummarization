 non-production features, there is no motivation for restricting features to be of the production type.
    Linguistically there is no particular reason for assuming that productions are the best features to use in a stochastic language model.
    For example, the adjunct attachment ambiguity in (1) results in alternative syntactic structures which use the same productions the same number of times in each derivation, so a model with only production features would necessarily assign them the same likelihood.
    Thus models that use production features alone predict that there should not be a systematic preference for one of these analyses over the other, contrary to standard psycholinguistic results.
    There are many different ways of choosing features for a SUBG, and each of these choices makes an empirical claim about possible distributions of sentences.
    Specifying the features of a SUBG is as much an empirical matter as specifying the grammar itself.
    For any given UBG there are a large (usually i
