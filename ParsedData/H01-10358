agset granularity of English, direct projection of core POS tags onto French achieves only 76% ac- curacy using EGYPT?s automatic word alignments (as shown in Table 1).
  Part of this deficiency is due to word-alignment error; when word alignments were manually corrected, direct projection core-tag accuracy increased to 85%.
  Also, standard bigram taggers trained on the automatically projected data achieve only modest success at generalization (86% when reapplied to the noisy train- ing data).
  More highly lexicalized learning algorithms exhibit even greater potential for overmodeling the specific projection errors of this data.
  Thus our research has focused on noise-robust techniques for distilling a conservative but effective tagger from this challenging raw projection data.
  
  
  One motivating empirical observation is that words in French, English and Czech have a strong tendency to exhibit only a single core POS tag (e.g. "
  or # ), and very rarely have more than 2.
  
  Thus we employ an ag- Eval
