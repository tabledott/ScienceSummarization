un phrases to refer to 'abstract objects' related to the real object.
    In both approaches noun phrases in intensional contexts refer to senses or abstract objects, while other noun phrases refer to actual entities, and so it is necessary to specify which predicates are intensional.
    In a Montagovian approach, 'the Evening Star' would be taken to refer to the intension of the Evening Star, .not its eztenaion in the real world, and noun phrases would always be taken to refer to intensions, although for nonintensional predicates there would be meaning postulates that make this equivalent to reference to extensions.
    Thus, in all these approaches intensional and extensional predicates must be distinguished explicitly, and noun phrases in intensional contexts are systematically interpreted metonymically.
    It would be easy enough in our framework to implement these approaches.
    We can define a function a of three arguments - the actual entity, the cognizer, and the condition used to describe the enti
