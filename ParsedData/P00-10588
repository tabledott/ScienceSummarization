enough to parse the whole corpus and obtain a maximum-likelihood estimate by EM.
    Another approach, taken in (Magerman, 1995) and others for lexicalized PCFGs and (Neumann, 1998; Xia, 1999; Chen and VijayShanker, 2000) for LTAGs, is to use heuristics to reconstruct the derivations, and directly estimate the PTAG parameters from the reconstructed derivations.
    We take this approach as well.
    (One could imagine combining the two approaches, using heuristics to extract a grammar but EM to estimate its parameters.)
  
  
    In a lexicalized TAG, because each composition brings together two lexical items, every composition probability involves a bilexical dependency.
    Given a CFG and headpercolation scheme, an equivalent TAG can be constructed whose derivations mirror the dependency analysis implicit in the headpercolation scheme.
    Furthermore, there are some dependency analyses encodable by TAGs that are not encodable by a simple head-percolation scheme.
    For example, for the sentence &amp;quot
