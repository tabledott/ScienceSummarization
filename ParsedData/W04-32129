ing classified) constituents respectively using Cold Standard Treebank parses.
    It is clear that the syntactic frame feature results in the most improvement (more than 1.7%) over the baseline, with the head of the PP parent feature being a close second.
    It is also worth noting that although the feature combining position and voice results in an improvement when the constituents are known, it actually results in a small loss when the constituents are unknown.
    This indicates that the slight change in the classification task (for classification of unknown constituents, an additional category NULL is added) could change the feature performance.
    The last three features are from (Pradhan et al., 2004), and they also result in an improvement in performance.
    Rapid progress has been made in semantic role labeling since the Propbank annotation became first available in 2002.
    The progress can be attributed to better modeling techniques, more relevant features and in a small measure, cleaner annota
