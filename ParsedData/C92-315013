  1992 This is why it is necessary to work on a test corpus of sufficient volume to be representative of possible cases of analysis and parsing, and to produce a sufficiently fast working software to make this experimental pproach worthwhile.
  For this, a test corpus of 2 5000 pages (arround 1 200000 words) was used, gathered from 1 700 texts, in which the scientific officers of the Research Development Division of Electricit6 de France describe in a short paper (1 or 2 pages) each of their medium term research projects.
