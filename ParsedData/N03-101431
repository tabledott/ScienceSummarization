 word model by adding the head child to the set of structurally local nodes top .
    This addition does not result in an improvement, suggesting that the induced history representations can identify the significance of the head child without the need for additional bias.
    The degradation appears to be caused by increased problems with overtraining, due to the large number of additional weights.
  
  
    Most previous work on statistical parsing has used a history-based probability model with a hand-crafted set of features to represent the derivation history (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).
    Ratnaparkhi (1999) defines a very general set of features for the histories of a shift-reduce parsing model, but the results are not as good as models which use a more linguistically informed set of features for a top-down parsing model (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).
    In addition to the method proposed in this paper, another alternative to choosing a finite set of features is to use kernel m
