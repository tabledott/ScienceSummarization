ne, Champollion will print for all words in the selected translation except the first one their distance from the first word.
    In our example, the second word (langues) appears in most cases one word before officielles, to form the compound langues officielles.
    Note that this information is added during postprocessing after the translation has been selected, and takes very little time to compute because of the indexing.
    In this case, it took a few seconds to compute this information. guage that satisfy the following two conditions: Words that pass these tests are collected in a set S. from which the final translation will eventually be produced.
    When given official languages as input (see Figure 2), this step produces a set S with the following eleven words: suivantes, doug, deposer, suprematie, lewis, petitions, honneur, programme, mixte, officielles, and langues.
    The Dice threshold Td (currently set at 0.10) is the major criterion that Champollion uses to decide which words or partial col
