t; any disk drive of the appropriate type will do.
    Handling noun phrases in these contexts requires careful integration of the interaction between semantics and reference resolution, because semantics knows about the verbs that create non-specific contexts, and reference resolution knows what to do with noun phrases in these contexts.
    For these verbs a constraint is associated with the semantics rule for the semantic role object2 which states that the filler for the object2 must be non-specific.4 This constraint is passed to reference resolution, which represents a non-specific noun phrase as having a variable in the place of the pointer, for example, id(motor,X).
    Non-specific semantic roles can be illustrated using the object2 semantic role in wait&amp;quot;for&amp;quot;part (awp).
    The part that is being awaited is nonspecific, i.e., can be any part of the appropriate type.
    This tells reference resolution not to find a specific referent, so the referent argument of the id relationship is
