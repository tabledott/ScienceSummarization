h use identical features, though are obviously trained on different data.
    The online learning algorithms themselves are intuitive and easy to implement.
    The efficient O(n3) parsing algorithm of Eisner allows the system to search the entire space of dependency trees while parsing thousands of sentences in a few minutes, which is crucial for discriminative training.
    We compare the speed of our model to a standard lexicalized phrase structure parser in Section 3.1 and show a significant improvement in parsing times on the testing data.
    The major limiting factor of the system is its restriction to features over single dependency attachments.
    Often, when determining the next dependent for a word, it would be useful to know previous attachment decisions and incorporate these into the features.
    It is fairly straightforward to modify the parsing algorithm to store previous attachments.
    However, any modification would result in an asymptotic increase in parsing complexity.
