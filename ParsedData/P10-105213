aptations, including (i) approximating the second order term in (10), (ii) performing updates in block, where a block contains the |Y  |&#215; |Y + 1 |features &#957;y1,y,x and &#955;y,x for a fixed test x on the observation sequence and (iii) approximating the Hessian for a block by its diagonal terms.
    (ii) is specially critical, as repeatedly cycling over individual features to perform the update (10) is only possible with restricted sets of features.
    The block update schemes uses the fact that all features within a block appear in the same set of sequences, which means that most of the computations needed to perform theses updates can be shared within the block.
    One advantage of the resulting algorithm, termed BCD in the following, is that the update of &#952;k only involves carrying out the forward-backward recursions for the set of sequences that contain symbols x such that at least one {fk(y', y, x)}(y y1)EY 2 is non null, which can be much smaller than the whole training set.
