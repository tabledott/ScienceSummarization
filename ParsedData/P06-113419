    Second, the number of distributionally similar words considered in the first stage of the algorithm can vary, and might therefore influence the $In other words, this fraction represents the probability of making the correct subjective label assignment by chance. output of the algorithm.
    We experiment with two different values, namely 100 and 160 top-ranked distributionally similar words.
    Table 2 shows the break-even points for the four different settings that were evaluated,9 with results that are almost double compared to the informed baseline.
    As it turns out, for weaker versions of the algorithm (i.e., similarity-all), the size of the set of distributionally similar words can significantly impact the performance of the algorithm.
    However, for the already improved similarity-selected algorithm version, this parameter does not seem to have influence, as similar results
