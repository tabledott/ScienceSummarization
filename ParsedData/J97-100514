    The modalities of the corpora investigated include dialogic or monologic, written, spontaneous or read, and the genres also vary.
    Quantitative evaluations of subjects' annotations using notions of agreement, interrater reliability, and/or significance show that good results can be difficult to achieve.
    As discussed in Section 3, our initial aim was to explore basic issues about segmentation, thus we used naive subjects on a highly unstructured task.
    Our corpus consists of transcripts of spontaneous spoken monologues, produced by 20 different speakers.
    We use an informal notion of communicative intention as the segmentation criterion, motivated by Grosz and Sidner (1986) and Polanyi (1988), who argue that defining a segment as having a coherent goal is more general than establishing a repertoire of specific types
