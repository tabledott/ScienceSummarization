    This will build alongside the general guidelines of Coecke et al. (2010) and concrete insights from the work of Widdows (2005).
    It is not yet entirely clear how existing set-theoretic approaches, for example that of discourse representation and generalised quantifiers, apply to our setting.
    Preliminary work on integration of the two has been presented by Preller (2007) and more recently also by Preller and Sadrzadeh ( 2009).
    As mentioned by one of the reviewers, our pregroup approach to grammar flattens the sentence representation, in that the verb is applied to its subject and object at the same time; whereas in other approaches such as CCG, it is first applied to the object to produce a verb phrase,
