001) evaluated their paraphrases with a different set of criteria (they asked judges whether to judge paraphrases based on &#8220;approximate conceptual equivalence&#8221;).
    Furthermore, their evaluation was carried out only by substituting the paraphrase in for the phrase with the identical context, and not in for arbitrary occurrences of the original phrase, as we have done.
    Lin and Pantel (2001) use a standard (nonparallel) monolingual corpus to generate paraphrases, based on dependancy graphs and distributional similarity.
    One strong disadvantage of this method is that their paraphrases can also have opposite meanings.
    Ibrahim et al. (2003) combine the two approaches: aligned monolingual corpora and parsing.
    They evaluated their system with human judges who were asked whether the paraphrases were &#8220;roughly interchangeable given the genre&#8221;, scored an average of 41% on a set of 130 paraphrases, with the judges all agreeing 75% of the time, and a correlation of 0.66.
