strate the success of the space insertion method by showing its application to English text.
    The first part of Table 2 shows the original text, with spaces in the proper places.
    The second shows the text with spaces removed, used as input to the segmentation procedure.
    The third shows the output of the PPM-based method described above, while the fourth shows, for comparison, the output of a word-based method for predicting the position of spaces, USeg (Ponte and Croft 1996).
    For this experiment (first reported by Teahan et al. [19981), PPM was trained on the million-word Brown corpus (Kucera and Francis 1967).
    USeg was trained on a far larger corpus containing 1 Gb of data from the Tipster collection (Broglio, Callan, and Croft 1994).
    Both were tested on the same 500 Kb extract from the Wall Street Journal.
    The recall and precision for PPM were both 99.52%, while the corresponding figures for Useg were 93.56% and 90.03%, respectively.
    This result is particularly noteworthy beca
