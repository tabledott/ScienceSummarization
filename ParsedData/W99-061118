at link can never be undone.
    We are considering three possible ways to make the algorithm less aggressively greedy.
    First, for each NP3, instead of considering every previous noun phrase, the algorithm could stop on finding the first compatible antecedent.
    Second, for each NPJ, the algorithm could rank all possible antecedents and then choose the best one and link only to that one.
    Lastly, the algorithm could rank all possible coreference links (all pairs of noun phrases in the document) and then proceed through them in ranked order, thus progressing from the links it is most confident about to those it is less certain of.
    Future work will include a more detailed error analysis.
  
  
    Existing systems for noun phrase coreference resolution can be broadly characterized as learning and non-learning approaches.
    All previous attempts to view coreference as a learning problem treat coreference resolution as a classification task: the algorithms classify a pair of noun phrases as corefer
