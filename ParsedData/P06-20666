h endpoints i and j) is the set [i, j] := {kEV I i &lt; k and k &lt; j }.
    Definition 3 A dependency graph is projective, if the yields of its nodes are intervals.
    Since projectivity requires each node to dominate a continuous substring of the sentence, it corresponds to a ban on discontinuous constituents in phrase structure representations.
    Projectivity is an interesting constraint on dependency structures both from a theoretical and a practical perspective.
    Dependency grammars that only allow projective structures are closely related to context-free grammars (Gaifman, 1965; Obre&#184;bski and Grali&#180;nski, 2004); among other things, they have the same (weak) expressivity.
    The projectivity constraint also leads to favourable parsing complexities: chart-based parsing of projective dependency grammars can be done in cubic time (Eisner, 1996); hard-wiring projectivity into a deterministic dependency parser leads to linear-time parsing in the worst case (Nivre, 2003).
