ould be split and were split correctly correct non: words that should not be split and were not wrong not: words that should be split but were not wrong faulty split: words that should be split, were split, but wrongly (either too much or too little) wrong split: words that should not be split, but were precision: (correct split) / (correct split + wrong faulty split + wrong superfluous split) recall: (correct split) / (correct split + wrong faulty split + wrong not split) accuracy: (correct) / (correct + wrong) To briefly review the methods: raw: unprocessed data with no splits eager: biggest split, i.e., the split into as many parts as possible.
    If multiple biggest splits are possible, the one with the highest frequency score is taken. frequency based: split into most frequent words, as described in Section 4 using parallel: split guided by splitting knowledge from a parallel corpus, as described in Section 5 using parallel and POS: as previous, with an additional restriction on the POS of split parts,
