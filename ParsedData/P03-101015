d the samples into four categories: &#8220;A&#8221;, &#8220;B&#8221;, &#8220;C&#8221;, and &#8220;D&#8221;.
    &#8220;A&#8221; means that there was more than 50% to 60% overlap in the content of articles.
    &#8220;B&#8221; means more than 20% to 30% and less than 50% to 60% overlap.
    &#8220;D&#8221; means that there was no overlap at all.
    &#8220;C&#8221; means that alignment was not included in &#8220;A&#8221;,&#8220;B&#8221; or &#8220;D&#8221;.
    We regard alignments that were judged to be A or B to be suitable for NLP because of their relatively large overlap.
    The results of evaluations are in Table 1.8 Here, &#8220;ratio&#8221; means the ratio of the number of articles judged to correspond to the respective category against the total number of articles.
    For example, 0.59 in line &#8220;A&#8221; of 1996-2001 means that 59 out of 100 samples were evaluated as A.
    &#8220;Lower&#8221; and &#8220;upper&#8221; mean the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for ratio.
