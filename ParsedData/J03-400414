    Let Cn be the set of ncs that include n as a direct member: Cn = {nc &#8712; NC|n &#8712; nc}.
    Let nc' be a hypernym of nc on P (i.e. nc' &#8712; {P|nc &#8712; nc'}) and let nsnc' = {ns &#8712; nc'} (i.e., the set of nouns senses at and beneath nc' in the hyponym hierarchy).
    Then the estimate p(n) is obtained using the estimates for the hypernym classes on P for all the Cn that n belongs to: The probability at any particular nc' is divided by nsnc' to give the estimate for each p(ns) under that nc'.
    The probability estimates for the {nc &#8712; P} ( p(nc|vc,gr) or p(nc|ac,gr)) are obtained from the tuples from the data of nouns co-occurring with verbs (or adjectives) belonging to the conditioning vc (or ac) in the specified grammatical relationship (&lt; n, v,gr &gt;).
    The frequency credit for a tuple is divided by |Cn |for any n, and by the number of synsets of v, Cv (or Ca if the gr is adjective-noun): A hypernym nc' includes the frequency credit attributed to all its hyponyms ({nc &#871
