moothing.
    We correlated the re-created counts for the seen bigrams with their actual BNC and NANTC frequencies.
    The correlation coefficients are reported in Tables 8 and 9.
    We found that the correlation between recreated counts and corpus counts was significant for all three types of bigrams, for both corpora.
    This demonstrates that the smoothing technique we employed generates realistic corpus counts, in the sense that the re-created counts are correlated with the actual counts.
    However, the correlation coefficients obtained using Web counts were always substantially higher than those obtained using smoothed counts.
    These differences were significant for the BNC counts for AltaVista (t(87) = 8.38, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 5.00, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 5.03, p &lt; .01) and Google (t(87) = 8.35, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 5.00, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 5.03, p &lt; .01).
    They were also significant for the NANTC counts for AltaVista (t(87) = 4.12, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 3.72, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 6.58, p &l
