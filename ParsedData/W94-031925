cessary for systems that attempt to simultaneously perform both lexical choice and surface generation, which none of the examined systems do.
    Perhaps more interestingly, four of the five systems do not allow backtracking, and the fifth, FUF, allows backtracking but does not seem to use it much (if at all) during surface generation (backtracking is used in FUF during sentence planning).
    This is interesting, since backtracking is usually regarded as an essential component of unification-based generation approaches; it is certainly used in the semantic-headdriven algorithm, and in the TEXT generator [McKeown, 1985].
    From a psycholinguistic perspective, many people have argued that human language production is incremental (see the summary in [Levelt, 1989, pages 24-27]), which means that of necessity it cannot include much backtracking.
    The garden-path phenomena shows that there are limits to how much syntactic backtracking people people perform during language understanding.
    This evidence is
