extual entailment &#8211; recognizing that the meaning of one text is entailed, i.e. can be inferred, by another1.
    In the recent years, this task has raised great interest since applied semantic inference concerns many practical Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE), Summarization, Machine Translation and Paraphrasing, and certain types of queries in Information Retrieval (IR).
    More specifically, the RTE challenges have aimed to focus research and evaluation on this common underlying semantic inference task and separate it from other problems that different NLP applications need to handle.
    For example, in addition to textual entailment, QA systems need to handle issues such as answer retrieval and question type recognition.
    By separating out the general problem of textual entailment from these task-specific problems, progress on semantic inference for many application areas can be promoted.
    Hopefully, research on textua
