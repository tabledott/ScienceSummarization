  The assu lnpt ion  of independence is often used in fornlnlas to determine the statistical signifi- cance of the difference d = .~:1 - x2.
  But how accurate is this assumption?
  One nfight expect sonic positive correlation from both results com- ing from the same test set;.
  One may also expect some positive correlation when either both tech- niques are just variations of each other 1 or both techniques are trained on the same set of train- ing data (and so are missing the same examples relative to the test set).
  This assumption was tested during some experiments for finding granunatical relations (subject, object, various types of nxodifiers, etc.).
  The metric used was the fraction of the relations of interest in the test set that were re- called (tbund) by some technique.
  The relations of interest were w~rious ubsets of the 748 rela- tion instances in that test set.
  An example sub- set is all the modifier elations.
  Another subset is just that of
