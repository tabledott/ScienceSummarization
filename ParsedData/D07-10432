 from perfect an incorrect clustering solution is a more difficult task (Oakes, 1998) and proposed approaches often lack rigor (Meila, 2007).
			In this paper, we describe a new entropy-based external cluster evaluation measure, V-MEASURE1 , designed to address the problem of quantifying such imperfection.
			Like all external measures, V-measurecompares a target clustering ? e.g., a manually an notated representative subset of the available data ?against an automatically generated clustering to de termine now similar the two are.
			We introduce twocomplementary concepts, completeness and homo geneity, to capture desirable properties in clustering tasks.
			In Section 2, we describe V-measure and how itis calculated in terms of homogeneity and complete ness.
			We describe several popular external cluster evaluation measures and draw some comparisons to V-measure in Section 3.
			In Section 4, we discusshow some desirable properties for clustering are satisfied by V-measure vs. other measures.
