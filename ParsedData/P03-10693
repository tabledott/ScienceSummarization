sentences are selected from different documents and must be somehow ordered so as to produce a coherent summary (Barzilay et al., 2002).
    Answering a question may also involve the extraction, potentially summarization, and ordering of information across multiple information sources.
    Barzilay et al. (2002) address the problem of information ordering in multidocument summarization and show that naive ordering algorithms such as majority ordering (selects most frequent orders across input documents) and chronological ordering (orders facts according to publication date) do not always yield coherent summaries although the latter produces good results when the information is eventbased.
    Barzilay et al. further conduct a study where subjects are asked to produce a coherent text from the output of a multidocument summarizer.
    Their results reveal that although the generated orders differ from subject to subject, topically related sentences always appear together.
    Based on the human study they propo
