t, the disambiguation of unknown tokens.
    Table 2 compares the performance of our system on the setup of Cohen and Smith (2007) to the best results reported by them for the same tasks.
    We first note that the accuracy results of our system are overall higher on their setup, on all measures, indicating that theirs may be an easier dataset.
    Secondly, for all our models we provide better fine- and coarse-grained POS-tagging accuracy, and all pruned models outperform the Oracle results reported by them.12 In terms of syntactic disambiguation, even the simplest grammar pruned with HSPELL outperforms their non-Oracle results.
    Without HSPELL-pruning, our simpler grammars are somewhat lagging behind, but as the grammars improve the gap is bridged.
    The addition of vertical markovization enables non-pruned models to outperform all previously reported re12Cohen and Smith (2007) make use of a parameter (&#945;) which is tuned separately for each of the tasks.
    This essentially means that their model
