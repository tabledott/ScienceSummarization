the encoding of natural- language rammars.
			The first one is the sorting of fimctors according to their own syntactic category.
			This move might be described alternat ively as defining the type of a constituent as being defined by both a set of syntactic (and semantic) 189 attributes and a function from categories to categories.
			This function is also expressed as the value of an attribute.
			For a basic category the value of the function attribute is NIL.
			The following graph is a simplified example of a functor category (prenominal djective in a language with case and number agreement within the NP).
