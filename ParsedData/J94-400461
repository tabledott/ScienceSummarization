 ment or means modifier" (Jackendoff 1990, p. 214).
  This characterization is essentially equivalent to that of the soler-usually example (i.e., promotional divergence) given earlier.
  24 5.3 Lexical Selection: Full Coverage Constraint Because of the compositional nature of the LCS representation, the current framework automatically imposes a full coverage constraint during the lexical selection process.
  Formally, this constraint is defined as follows: (34) Full coverage constraint: A RLCS R matches a CLCS C if and only if R fully covers C. where R fully covers C under the following conditions: (35) A RLCS R fully covers a CLCS C if and only if: (a) there is no portion of R that does not match C; 24 Jackendoffs approach to handling the way construction has been criticized by Marantz (1992) for its use of arbitrary exceptions to the "usual mappings."
  Marantz takes issue with the characterization f such cases as an idiosyncratic relation between syntax and semantics and proposes, instead, that the concept
