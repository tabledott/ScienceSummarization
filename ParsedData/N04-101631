s to comparisons with state-of-the-art models.
    We found that in all but one case, web-based models fail to significantly outperform the state of the art.
    The exception was compound noun interpretation, for which the Altavista model was significantly better than the Lauer&#8217;s (1995) model.
    For three tasks (candidate selection for MT, adjective ordering, and compound noun bracketing), we found that the performance of the web-based models was not significantly different from the performance of the best models reported in the literature.
    Note that for all the tasks we investigated, the best performance in the literature was obtained by supervised models that have access not only to simple bigram or trigram frequencies, but also to linguistic information such as part-of-speech tags, semantic restrictions, or context (or a thesaurus, in the case of Lauer&#8217;s models).
    When unsupervised web-based models are compared against supervised methods that employ a wide variety of features, we obse
