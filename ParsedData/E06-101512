he predicate and its arguments, were proposed.
    For example, the Parse Tree Path of the pair (brought, ARG1) in the syntactic tree of Figure 4 is V T VP 1 NP.
    It encodes the dependency between the predicate and the argument as a sequence of nonterminal labels linked by direction symbols (up or down).
    An alternative tree kernel representation, proposed in (Moschitti, 2004), is the selection of the minimal tree subset that includes a predicate with only one of its arguments.
    For example, in Figure 4, the substructures inside the three frames are the semantic/syntactic structures associated with the three arguments of the verb to bring, i.e.
    SARG0, SARG1 and SARGM.
    Given a feature representation of predicate ar2Namely, they are Phrase Type, Parse Tree Path, Predicate Word, Head Word, Governing Category, Position and Voice. guments, we can build an individual ONE-vs-ALL (OVA) classifier Ci for each argument i.
    As a final decision of the multiclassifier, we select the argument type ARGt
