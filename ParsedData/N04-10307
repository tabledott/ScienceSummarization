ng n binary classifiers for a n-class problem.Since the training time taken by SVMs scales exponen tially with the number of examples, and about 80% of the nodes in a syntactic tree have NULL argument labels, we found it efficient to divide the training process into two stages, while maintaining the same accuracy: 1.
			Filter out the nodes that have a very high probabil-.
			ity of being NULL.
			A binary NULL vs NON-NULL classifier is trained on the entire dataset.
			A sigmoid function is fitted to the raw scores to convert the scores to probabilities as described by (Platt, 2000).
			2.
			The remaining training data is used to train OVA.
			classifiers, one of which is the NULL-NON-NULL classifier.With this strategy only one classifier (NULL vs NON NULL) has to be trained on all of the data.
			The remaining OVA classifiers are trained on the nodes passed by thefilter (approximately 20% of the total), resulting in a con siderable savings in training time.
			In the testing stage, we do not perform any fi
