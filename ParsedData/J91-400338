    Similarly, the verb veto normally selects for an object that is a legislative bill or a suggestion.
    Syntactically, these may simply be additional subcategorizations, but how are these examples related semantically to the normal interpretations?
    I suggest that these are cases of semantic type coercion (cf.
    Pustejovsky 1989a), where the verb has coerced the meaning of a term phrase into a different semantic type.
    Briefly, type coercion can be defined as follows:17
  
  
    As these examples illustrate, the syntactic argument to a verb is not always the same logical argument in the semantic relation.
    Although superficially similar to cases of general metonymy (cf.
    Lakoff and Johnson 1982; Nunberg 1978), there is an interesting systematicity to such shifts in meaning that we will try to characterize below as logical metonymy.
    The sentences in 34 illustrate the
