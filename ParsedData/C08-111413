			To answer the SAT question, we use PairClass to estimate the probability that each testing example is positive, and we guess the testing example with the highest probability.
			Learning from a trainingset with only one positive example and one nega tive example is difficult, since the learned model can be highly unstable.
			To increase the stability, we repeat the learning process 10 times, using adifferent randomly chosen negative training exam ple each time.
			For each testing word pair, the 10 probability estimates are averaged together.
			This is
