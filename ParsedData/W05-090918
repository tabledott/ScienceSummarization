 we have human assessments* Finally we average the R values of all the systems for each of the two language data sets to arrive at the overall average correlation for the Chinese dataset and the Arabic dataset* This number ranges between -1*0 (completely negatively correlated) to +1*0 (completely positively correlated)* We compare the correlation between human assessments and METEOR Scores produced above with that between human assessments and precision, recall and Fmean scores to show the advantage of the various components in the METEOR scoring function* Finally we run METEOR using different mapping modules, and compute the correlation as described above for each configuration to show the effect of each unigram mapping mechanism* We computed sentence by sentence correlation between METEOR Scores and human assessments (average of adequacy and fluency scores) for each translation for every system* Tables 2 and 3 show the Pearson R correlation values for each system, as well as the average correlation value pe
