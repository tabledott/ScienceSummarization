 difference between contiguous phrase based models and hierarchical phrase-based models is the number of rules that potentially apply to an input sentence.
			To make this concrete, on our data, with an average of 29 words per sentence, there were on average 133 contiguous phrases of length 5 orless that applied.
			By comparison, there were on av erage 7557 hierarchical phrases containing up to 5words.
			These patterns are obviously highly overlap ping and we employ an algorithm to exploit this fact.We first describe a baseline algorithm used for con tiguous phrases (?5.4.1).
			We then introduce some improvements (?5.4.2) and describe a data structureused by the algorithm (?5.4.3).
			Finally, we dis cuss some special cases for discontiguous phrases (?5.4.4).
			5.4.1 The Zhang-Vogel AlgorithmZhang and Vogel (2005) present a clever algorithm for contiguous phrase searches in a suffix ar ray.
			It exploits the fact that for eachm-length source phrase that we want to look up, we will also want to look up it
