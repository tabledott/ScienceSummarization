s: common noun/proper noun constructions (CN/PN) and appositions (APOS).
    Mann (2002) notes that concept-instance relationships are often expressed by a syntactic pattern in which a proper noun follows immediately after a common noun.
    Such patterns (e.g.
    &#8220;president George Bush&#8221;) are very productive and occur 40 times more often than patterns employed by Hearst (1992).
    Table 1 shows the regular expression used to extract such patterns along with examples of extracted patterns.
  
  
    In addition to the CN/PN pattern of Mann (2002), we extracted syntactic appositions (APOS).
    This pattern detects phrases such as &#8220;Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft,&#8221;.
    Table 2 shows the regular expression used to extract appositions and examples of extracted patterns.
    These regular expressions are not meant to be exhaustive of all possible varieties of patterns construed as CN/PN or APOS.
    They are &#8220;quick and dirty&#8221; implementations meant to extract a large proport
