 to express strong sentiments, so that it might suffice to simply produce a list of such words by introspection and rely on them alone to classify the texts.
    To test this latter hypothesis, we asked two graduate students in computer science to (independently) choose good indicator words for positive and negative sentiments in movie reviews.
    Their selections, shown in Figure 1, seem intuitively plausible.
    We then converted their responses into simple decision procedures that essentially count the number of the proposed positive and negative words in a given document.
    We applied these procedures to uniformlydistributed data, so that the random-choice baseline result would be 50%.
    As shown in Figure 1, the accuracy &#8212; percentage of documents classified correctly &#8212; for the human-based classifiers were 58% and 64%, respectively.4 Note that the tie rates &#8212; percentage of documents where the two sentiments were rated equally likely &#8212; are quite highs (we chose a tie breaking
