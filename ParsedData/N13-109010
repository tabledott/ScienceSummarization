ies of the RNN vectors and the new vectors, and restricted the test set and word vectors to those.
    This resulted in a 36k word vocabulary, and a test set with 6632 questions.
    Turian&#8217;s Collobert and Weston based vectors do poorly on this task, whereas the Hierarchical Log-Bilinear Model vectors of (Mnih and Hinton, 2009) do essentially as well as the RNN vectors.
    These representations were trained on 37M words of data and this may indicate a greater robustness of the HLBL method.
    We conducted similar experiments with the semantic test set.
    For each target word pair in a relation category, the model measures its relational similarity to each of the prototypical word pairs, and then uses the average as the final score.
    The results are evaluated using the two standard metrics defined in the task, Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient p and MaxDiff accuracy.
    In both cases, larger values are better.
    To compare to previous systems, we report the average over all 69 relat
