Lauer heuristic (Lauer 1995) which looks for consecutive pairs of nouns that are neither preceded nor succeeded by a noun after each sentence was syntactically parsed with Charniak parser (Charniak 2001) (for XWN we used the gold parse trees).
    Moreover, they were provided with the sentence in which the pairs occurred along with their corresponding WordNet senses.
    Whenever the annotators found an example encoding a semantic relation other than those provided or they didn&#8217;t know what interpretation to give, they had to tag it as &#8220;OTHERS&#8221;.
    Besides the type of relation, the annotators were asked to provide information about the order of the modifier and the head nouns in the syntactic constructions if applicable.
