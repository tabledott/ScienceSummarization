sting results were observed.
    For example, a negative atom nai +- kerare-ga (`to be free from vignetting&#8217;) was acquired in the digital camera domain.
    Even the evaluator who was familiar with digital cameras did not know the term kerare (&#8216;vignetting&#8217;), but after looking up the dictionary she labeled it as negative.
    Our learning method could pick up such technical terms and labeled them appropriately.
    Also, there were discoveries in the error analysis.
    An evaluator assigned positive to aru +- kamera-ga (`to have camera&#8217;) in the mobile phone domain, but the acquired polar atom had the negative polarity.
    This was actually an insight from the recent opinions that many users want phones without camera functions11.
  
  
    We proposed an unsupervised method to acquire polar atoms for domain-oriented SA, and demonstrated its high performance.
    The lexicon can be expanded automatically by using unannotated corpora, and tuning of the threshold values is not required.
