    These last two variations are labeled MFRGLSYS and MSPGLSYS.
    We restricted our experiments to disambiguation of nouns, for which there were 1071 instances in 5V2-AW not marked &amp;quot;unassignable&amp;quot; by SENSEVAL'S human annotators.
    Nouns were identified on the basis of human-assigned partof-speech tags where available (BC, WSJ and 5V2-AW) and using the Brill tagger elsewhere (Brill, 1993).
    The choice of 5V2-AW as our gold standard corpus determined our choice of sense inventory: SENSEVAL-2 produced a gold standard for the English &amp;quot;all words&amp;quot; task using a pre-release of WordNet 1.7 (Fellbaum, 1998), and we restricted our attention to the noun taxonomy.
    Because the algorithm for disambiguating noun groupings returns a confidence value for every sense of a word, some threshold or other criterion is needed to decide which sense or senses to actually assign.
    We simply assign the sense tag that scored the maximum confidence level, or all such tag
