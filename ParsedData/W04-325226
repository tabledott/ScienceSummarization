    After the ranking algorithm is run on the graph, sentences are sorted in reversed order of their score, and the top ranked sentences are selected for inclusion in the summary.
    Figure 3 shows a text sample, and the associated weighted graph constructed for this text.
    The figure also shows sample weights attached to the edges connected to vertex 94, and the final TextRank score computed for each sentence.
    The sentences with the highest rank are selected for inclusion in the abstract.
    For this sample article, the sentences with id-s 9, 15, 16, 18 are extracted, resulting in a summary of about 100 words, which according to automatic evaluation measures, is ranked the second among summaries produced by 15 other systems (see Section 4.2 for evaluation methodology).
    We evaluate the TextRank sentence extraction algorithm on a single-document summarization task, using 567 news articles provided during the Document Understanding Evaluations 2002 (DUC, 2002).
    For each article, Text
