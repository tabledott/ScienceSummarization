	Stochastic Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammars
	
			Although stochastic techniques applied to syntax mod- eling have recently regained popularity, current lazl- guage models uffer from obvious inherent inadequacies.
			Early proposals uch as Markov Models, N-gram mod- els (Pratt, 1942; Shannon, 1948; Shannon, 1951) and tlidden Markov Models were very quickly shown to be linguistically not appropriate for natural language (e.g. Chomsky (1964, pages 13-18)) since they are unable to capture long distance dependencies or to describe hier- archically the syntax of natural anguages.
			Stochastic context-free granunar (Booth, 1969) is a hierarchical model more appropriate for natural languages, however none of such proposals (Lari and Young, 1990; Jelinek, Lafferty, and Mercer, 1990) perform as well as the sim- pler Markov Models because of the difficulty of captur- ing lexical information.
			The parameters of a stochas- tic context-free grammar do not correspond irectly to a distribution over words since distri
