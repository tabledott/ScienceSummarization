ide a French sentence into short segments that can be translated sequentially.
    Alignment of a French-English sentence pair.
    The subscripts give the position of each word in its sentence.
    Here al -= 1, a2 = 2, a3 = a4 = 3, a5 = 4, and a6 = 5.
    When presented with a French sentence F, Candide's task is to find the English sentence E which is most likely given F: Candide estimates p(E)&#8212;the probability that a string E of English words is a wellformed English sentence&#8212;using a parametric model of the English language, commonly referred to as a language model.
    The system estimates p(FIE)&#8212;the probability that a French sentence F is a translation of E&#8212;using a parametric model of the process of English-to-French translation known as a translation model.
    These two models, plus a search strategy for finding the E that maximizes (30) for some F, comprise the engine of the translation system.
    We now briefly describe the translation model for the probability P(FIE); a more
