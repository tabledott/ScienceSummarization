e established for rankings produced by the f-structure based automatic evaluation and a manual evaluation of generated strings.
  
  
    In this section, each of the system components will be described in more detail.
    In this project, a broad-coverage LFG grammar and parser for English was employed (see Riezler et al. (2002)).
    The parser produces a set of context-free constituent (c-)structures and associated functional (f-)structures for each input sentence, represented in packed form (see Maxwell and Kaplan (1989)).
    For sentence condensation we are only interested in the predicate-argument structures encoded in f-structures.
    For example, Fig.
    1 shows an f-structure manually selected out of the 40 f-structures for the sentence: A prototype is ready for testing, and Leary hopes to set requirements for a full system by the end of the year.
    The transfer component for the sentence condensation system is based on a component previously used in a machine translation system (see Frank (1999
