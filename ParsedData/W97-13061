    Pronoun resolution is one of the 'classic' computational linguistics problems.
    It is also widely considered to be inherently an A.I. complete' task-meaning that resolution of pronouns requires full world knowledge and inference.
    CogNIAC is a pronoun resolution engine designed around the assumption that there is a sub-class of anaphora that does not require general purpose reasoning.
    The kinds of information CogNIAC does require includes: sentence detection, part-of-speech tagging, simple noun phrase recognition, basic semantic category information like, gender, number, and in one configuration, partial parse trees.
    What distinguishes CogNIAC from algorithms that use similar sorts of information is that it will not resolve a pronoun in circumstances of ambiguity.
    Crucially, ambiguity is a function of how much knowledge an understander has.
    Since CogNIAC does not have as rich a represen
