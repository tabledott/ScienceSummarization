    In particular, we wanted to understand whether the classification disagreements reflected disagreements about the final semantic interpretation.
    Another difference between this new experiment and the first one is that we structured the task of deciding on a classification for a definite description around a series of questions originating a decision tree, rather than giving our subjects an explicit preference ranking.
    A third aspect of the first experiment we wanted to study more carefully was the distribution of definite descriptions, in particular, the characteristics of the large number of definite descriptions in the larger situation/unfamiliar class.
    Finally, we chose truly naive subjects to perform the classification task.
    In order to get a better idea of the extent of agreement among annotators about the semantic interpretation of definite descriptions, we asked our subjects to indicate the antecedent in the text for the definite descriptions they classified as anaphoric or associa
