ow introduce a construction that will be used to establish several hardness results for the computational problems discussed in this paper.
    Recall that a Hamiltonian path in a directed graph G is a directed path that visits all of the nodes of G exactly once. we add an edge (i, j)1 to Ex.
    We set w1&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; = 1 if there is an edge from i to j in G, or else if i or j is the root node 0, and w1&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; = 0 otherwise.
    Furthermore, we set 0(i) = 1 for each i E Vx.
    This construction can be clearly carried out in log-space.
    Note that each T E T (G(0) x ) must be a monadic tree with weight equal to either 0 or 1.
    It is not difficult to see that if w(T) = 1, then when we remove the root node 0 from T we obtain a Hamiltonian path in G. Conversely, each Hamiltonian path in G can be extended to a spanning tree T E T (G(&#65533;) x ) with w(T) = 1, by adding the root node 0.
    Using the above observations, it can be shown that the solution of the argmax problem for
