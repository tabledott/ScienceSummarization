 of the p outputs at each final state of T. T, is subsequential by construction, hence the component fi is subsequential.
    Then the previous theorem implies that each component fi has bounded variation, and by definition of do&#176;, f has also bounded variation.
    Conversely, if the first condition holds, a fortiori eachfi has bounded variation.
    This combined with the second condition implies that eachfi is subsequential.
    A transducer T realizing f can be obtained by taking the union of p subsequential transducers realizing each component j.
    Thus, in view of the theorem 2,f is p-subsequential.
    One can also give a characterization of p-subsequential transducers irrespective of the choice of their components.
    Let dp be the semimetric defined by: Let f be a rational function mapping E* to (6,*)P.f is p-subsequential iff it has bounded variation (using the semimetric dip on (A*)P).
    According to the previous theorem the condition is sufficient since: Conversely if f is p-subsequential
