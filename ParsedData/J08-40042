    During this period, however, a number of questions have also been raised about K and similar coefficients&#8212;some already in Carletta&#8217;s own work (Carletta et al. 1997)&#8212;ranging from simple questions about the way the coefficient is computed (e.g., whether it is really applicable when more than two coders are used), to debates about which levels of agreement can be considered &#8216;acceptable&#8217; (Di Eugenio 2000; Craggs and McGee Wood 2005), to the realization that K is not appropriate for all types of agreement (Poesio and Vieira 1998; Marcu, Romera, and Amorrortu 1999; Di Eugenio 2000; Stevenson and Gaizauskas 2000).
    Di Eugenio raised the issue of the effect of skewed distributions on the value of K and pointed out that the original x developed by Cohen is based on very different assumptions about coder bias from the K of Siegel and Castellan (1988), which is typically used in
