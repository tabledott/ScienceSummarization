e above regardless of which element is chosen as semantic head.
    In a rule for relative clause introduction such as the following (in highly abbreviated form) nbar/N --&gt; nbar/N, sbar/N. we can (and must) choose the nominal as semantic head to effect termination.
    However, there are other problematic cases, such as verb-movement analyses of verb-second languages.
    We discuss this topic further in Section 4.3.
    To make the description more explicit, we will develop a Prolog implementation of the algorithm for DCGs, along the way introducing some niceties of the algorithm previously glossed over.
    As before, a term of the form node(Cat, PO-P) represents a phrase with the syntactic and semantic information given by Cat starting at position PO and ending at position P in the string being generated.
    As usual for DCGs, a string position is represented by the list of string elements after the position.
    The generation process starts with a goal category and attempts to generate an appropriate
