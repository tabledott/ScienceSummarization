ariables have already been identified&#8212;a timeconsuming process involving considerable linguistic expertise.
    We view our work as complementary to this tradition: we work directly from raw text, identifying both the relevant features and coherent linguistic communities.
    An active recent literature concerns geotagged information on the web, such as search queries (Backstrom et al., 2008) and tagged images (Crandall et al., 2009).
    This research identifies the geographic distribution of individual queries and tags, but does not attempt to induce any structural organization of either the text or geographical space, which is the focus of our research.
    More relevant is the work of Mei et al. (2006), in which the distribution over latent topics in blog posts is conditioned on the geographical location of the author.
    This is somewhat similar to the supervised LDA model that we consider, but their approach assumes that a partitioning of geographical space into regions is already given.
