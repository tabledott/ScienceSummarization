een co-indexedmaterial occurring in the automatically generated fstructures from sections 02-21 of the Penn-II tree bank.
			We extract 26 unique TOPIC, 60 TOPIC-RELand 13 FOCUS path types (with a total of 14,911 token occurrences), each with an associated probability.
			We distinguish between two types of TOPIC REL paths, those that occur in wh-less constructions, and all other types (c.f Table 5).
			Given a path p andan LDD type t (either TOPIC, TOPIC-REL or FO CUS), the probability of p given t is estimated as: P(p|t) := count(t, p)?n i=1 count(t, pi)In order to get a first measure of how well the ap proximation models the data, we compute the path types in section 23 not covered by those extracted from 02-21: 23/(02-21).
			There are 3 such path types (Table 6), each occuring exactly once.
			Given that the total number of path tokens in section 23 is 949,the finite approximation extracted from 02-23 cov ers 99.69% of all LDD paths in section 23.
