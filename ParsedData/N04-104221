ction is actually labeled inconsistently in the training data.
    Other errors could be fixed with additional feature engineering&#8212;for example, including additional specialized regular expressions should make email accuracy nearly perfect.
    Increasing the amount of training data would also be expected to help significantly, as indicated by consistent nearly perfect accuracy on the training set.
  
  
    This paper investigates the issues of regularization, feature spaces, and efficient use of unsupported features in CRFs, with an application to information extraction from research papers.
    For regularization we find that the Gaussian prior with variance depending on feature frequencies performs better than several other alternatives in the literature.
    Feature engineering is a key component of any machine learning solution&#8212;especially in conditionally-trained models with such freedom to choose arbitrary features&#8212;and plays an even more important role than regularization.
