ome extent the cover age problems associated with FrameNet.
	
	
			We measure the similarity between a question and its candidate answer by matching their predicatesand semantic role assignments.
			Since SRs are framespecific, we prioritize frame matching to SR match ing.
			Two predicates match if they evoke the same frame or one of its hypernyms (or hyponyms).
			Thelatter are expressed by the Inherits From and Is In herited By relations in the frame definitions.
			If the predicates match, we examine whether the assignedsemantic roles match.
			Since we represent SR assignments as graphs with edge covers, we can also for malize SR matching as a graph matching problem.
			The similarity between two graphs is measured as the sum of similarities between their subgraphs.We first decompose a graph into subgraphs consist ing of one frame element node w and a set of SR nodes connected to it.
			The similarity between two subgraphs SubG1, and SubG2 is then formalized as: (5) Sim(SubG1,SubG2) = ? ndSR1 ? SubG1 ndS
