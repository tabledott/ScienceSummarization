an (1997) and Ratnaparki (1997).
    Goodman uses an FOM that is similar to that of C&amp;C but one that should, in general, be somewhat more accurate.
    However, both Goodman's and Ratnaparki's work assumes that one is doing a beam search of some sort, rather than a best-first search, and their FOM are unfortunately tied to their frameworks and thus cannot be adopted here.
    We briefly compare our results to theirs in Section 5.
    As noted, our paper takes off from that of C&amp;C and uses the same FOM.
    The major difference is simply that our parser uses the FOM to rank edges (including incomplete edges), rather than simply completed constituents, as was done by C&amp;C.
    What is interesting about our approach is that such a seemingly simple change can produce rather dramatic results.
    Rather than the thousands of edges required by C&amp;C, the parser presented here requires hundreds, or even, if one is willing to pay a small price in accuracy, tens.
