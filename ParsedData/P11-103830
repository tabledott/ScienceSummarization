ce of our method.
    This is due to the limitations of the training data: we obtain the ill-formed words and their standard forms from the SMS corpus, but the ill-formed words in the SMS corpus are not sufficient to cover those in the Twitter data (and we don&#8217;t have sufficient Twitter data to train the SMT method directly).
    Thus, novel ill-formed words are missed in normalisation.
    This shows the shortcoming of supervised data-driven approaches that require annotated data to cover all possibilities of ill-formed words in Twitter.
    The dictionary lookup method (&#8220;DL&#8221;) unsurprisingly achieves the best precision, but the recall on Twitter is not competitive.
    Consequently, the Twitter normalisation cannot be tackled with dictionary lookup alone, although it is an effective preprocessing strategy when combined with more robust techniques such as our proposed method, and effective at capturing common abbreviations such as gf &#8220;girlfriend&#8221;.
