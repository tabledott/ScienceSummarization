    Each POS feature can have one of 5 possible values: noun, verb, adjective, adverb or other.
    Co&#8212;occurrences Features of the form Ci are binary co-occurrence features.
    They indicate the presences or absences of a particular content word in the same sentence as the ambiguous word.
    We use 3 binary co-occurrence features, C1, C2 and C3 to represent the presences or absences of each of the three most frequent content words, C1 being the most frequent content word, C2 the second most frequent and C3 the third.
    Only sentences containing the ambiguous word were used to establish word frequencies.
    Frequency based features like this one contain little information about low frequency classes.
    For words with skewed sense distribution, it is likely that the most frequent content words will be associated only with the dominate sense.
    As an example, consider the 3 most frequent content words occurring in the sentences that contain chief officer, executive and president.
