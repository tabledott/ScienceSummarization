ame POS tag), and the leaves of a parse tree for a Chinese sentence are words.
    To build a Chinese POS tagger, the following questions naturally arise: This paper presents an in-depth study on such issues of processing architecture and feature representation for Chinese POS tagging, within a maximum entropy framework.
    We analyze the performance of the different approaches in our attempt to find the best approach.
    To our knowledge, our work is the first to systematically investigate such issues in Chinese POS tagging.
  
  
    As a first step in our investigation, we built a Chinese word segmenter capable of performing word segmentation without using POS tag information.
    Since errors in word segmentation will propagate to the subsequent POS tagging phase in the one-at-a-time approach, in order for our study to give relevant findings, it is important that the word segmenter we use gives state-ofthe-art accuracy.
    The word segmenter we built is similar to the maximum entropy word segmenter of
