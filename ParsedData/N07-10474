m class prediction, which incorporates a constraint satisfaction method to produce a global prediction for letter-to-phoneme conversion.
    Both PbA and trigram class prediction show improvement over predicting individual phonemes, confirming that L2P systems can benefit from incorporating the relationship between phonemes in a sequence.
    In order to capitalize on the information found in phoneme sequences, we propose to apply an HMM method after a local phoneme prediction process.
    Given a candidate list of two or more possible phonemes, as produced by the local predictor, the HMM will find the best phoneme sequence.
    Using this approach, our system demonstrates an improvement on several language data sets.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
    We describe the letter-phoneme alignment methods including a standard one-to-one alignment method and our many-to-many approach in Section 2.
    The alignment methods are used to align graphemes and phonemes before the phoneme prediction m
