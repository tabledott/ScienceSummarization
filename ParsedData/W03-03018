    Evaluations were performed with respect to four different measures.
    Three of them &#8211; precision, recall, and Fmeasure &#8211; represent traditional measures in Information Retrieval, and were also frequently used in previous word alignment literature.
    The fourth measure was originally introduced by (Och and Ney, 2000), and proposes the notion of quality of word alignment.
    Given an alignment A, and a gold standard alignment ~, each such alignment set eventually consisting of two sets As, .Ap, and 9s, 9p corresponding to Sure and Probable alignments, the following measures are defined (where T is the alignment type, and can be set to either S or P).
    Each word alignment submission was evaluated in terms of the above measures.
    Moreover, we conducted two sets of evaluations for each submission: &#8226; NULL-Align, where each word was enforced to belong to at least one alignment; if a word did not belong to any alignment, a NULL Probable alignment was assigned by default.
