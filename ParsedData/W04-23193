ognition, 15 involve a group discussing natural language processing and neural theories of language, and 8 are miscellaneous meeting types.
    The last set includes 2 very interesting meetings involving the corpus transcribers as participants (example included in [16]).
  
  
    Annotation involved three types of information: marking of DA segment boundaries, marking of DAs themselves, and marking of correspondences between DAs (adjacency pairs, [12]).
    Each type of annotation is described in detail in [7].
    Segmentation methods were developed based on separating out speech regions having different discourse functions, but also paying attention to pauses and intonational grouping.
    To distinguish utterances that are prosodically one unit but which contain multiple DAs, we use a pipe bar (  |) in the annotations.
    This allows the researcher to either split or not split at the bar, depending on the research goals.
    We examined existing annotation systems, including [1,2,5,6,8,10,11], for simila
