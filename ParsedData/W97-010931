e testing set as the methods shown in the above table.
    If just the examples with full WordNet entries were used, the accuracy rose to 90.8%.
    Although the algorithm does not provide high enough accuracy from the point of view of word sense disambiguation, it is more important to bear in mind that our main goal is the PP attachment ambiguity resolution.
    The relatively low accuracy of the word sense disambiguation is compensated by the fact that the same sense disambiguation error is present in both the training set and the classified quadruple.
    The use of the same training set for both the PP attachment and the sense disambiguation provides a positive bias in favour of correct attachment.
    Until we have a sufficiently big enough word sense tagged corpus, we can only hypothesise on the importance of the correct sense disambiguation for the PP attachment.
    Experiments, however, show that if the positive bias between the word senses of the training set and the testing quadruples is removed, t
