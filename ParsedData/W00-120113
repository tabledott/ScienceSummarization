ently, the BBN model uses language-specific rules to guess part of speech tags for unknown words.
  
  
    There is no question that a great deal of care and expertise went into creating the Chinese Treebank, and that it is a source of important grammatical information that is unique to the Chinese language.
    However, there are definite similarities between the grammars of English and Chinese, especially when viewed through the lens of the statistical models we employed here.
    In both languages, the nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs have preferences for certain arguments and adjuncts, and these preferences&#8212;in spite of the potentially vastlydifferent configurations of these items&#8212;are effectively modeled.
    As discussed in the introduction, lexical items' idiosyncratic parsing preferences are modeled by lexicalizing the grammar formalism, using a lexicalized PCFG in one case and a lexicalized stochastic TAG in the other.
    Linguistically-reasonable independence assumptions are made, s
