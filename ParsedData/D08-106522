 log BLEU score.
    We next attempt to understand factors 2 and 3.
    To do that, we carry out lattice MBR when either the hypothesis or the evidence space in Equation 2 is restricted to 1000-best hypotheses (Table 4).
    For comparison, we also include results from lattice MBR when both hypothesis and evidence spaces are identical: either the full lattice or the 1000-best list (from Tables 2 and 3).
    These results show that lattice MBR results are almost unchanged when the hypothesis space is restricted to a 1000-best list.
    However, when the evidence space is shrunk to a 1000-best list, there is a significant degradation in performance; these latter results are almost identical to the scenario when both evidence and hypothesis spaces are restricted to the 1000-best list.
    This experiment throws light on what makes lattice MBR effective over N-best MBR.
    Relative to the N-best list, the translation lattice provides a better estimate of the expected BLEU score.
    On the other hand, there are
