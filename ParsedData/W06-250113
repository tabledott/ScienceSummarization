 complex network of relations in WordNet, and allows the glosses of concepts to include the glosses of synsets to which they are directly related in WordNet.
  
  
    As was done by (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001), we evaluated the measures of relatedness in two ways.
    First, they were compared against human judgments of relatedness.
    Second, they were used in an application that would benefit from the measures.
    The effectiveness of the particular application was an indirect indicator of the accuracy of the relatedness measure used.
    One obvious metric for evaluating a measure of semantic relatedness is its correspondence with the human perception of relatedness.
    Since semantic relatedness is subjective, and depends on the human view of the world, comparison with human judgments is a self-evident metric for evaluation.
    This was done by (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001) in their comparison of five measures of semantic relatedness.
    We follow a similar approach in evaluating the Gloss Vector me
