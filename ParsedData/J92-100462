    The completed semantic frame is used in ATIS both to generate an SQL (Structured Query Language) command to access the database and to generate a text output to be spoken in the interactive dialog.
    The SQL pattern is controlled through lists of frame patterns to match and query fragments to generate given the match.
    Text generation is done by assigning appropriate temporal ordering for modifiers on nouns and for the main noun.
    The modifiers are contained in slots associated with the QSET frame.
