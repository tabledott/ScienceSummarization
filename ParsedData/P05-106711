ce[i] be the current syntactic category set.
    For each tree pair in the corpus, do { a) For the tentative synchronous partitioning operation, use a heuristic function to select the BEST word pair (ei*, f j*) , where both ei*, f j* are NOT &#8220;chosen&#8221;, Category(ei*) E C and Category(f j*) E C. b) If (ei*, fj*) is found in (a), mark ei*, fj* as &#8220;chosen&#8221; and go back to (a), else go to (c).
    At each iteration, one specific set of categories of nodes is handled.
    The category sequence we used in the grammar induction is: We first process top NP chunks because they are the most stable between languages.
    Interestingly, NPs are also used as anchor points to learn monolingual paraphrases (Ibrahim et al., 2003).
    The phrasal structure categories can be extracted from automatic parsers using methods in (Xia, 2001).
    An illustration is given below (Chinese in pinyin form).
    The placement of the dependency arcs reflects the relative word order between a parent node and all its im
