s that the traditional left-to-right decoding approach of string-based systems is inapplicable.
    Additional challenges are posed by the need to handle treelets&#8212;perhaps discontiguous or overlapping&#8212; and a combinatorially explosive ordering space.
    Our decoding approach is influenced by ITG (Wu, 97) with several important extensions.
    First, we employ treelet translation pairs instead of single word translations.
    Second, instead of modeling rearrangements as either preserving source order or swapping source order, we allow the dependents of a node to be ordered in any arbitrary manner and use the order model described in section 2.4 to estimate probabilities.
    Finally, we use a log-linear framework for model combination that allows any amount of other information to be modeled.
    We will initially approach the decoding problem as a bottom up, exhaustive search.
    We define the set of all possible treelet translation pairs of the subtree rooted at each input node in the following
