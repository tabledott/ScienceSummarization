of entities across languages, we compute the similarity of their time distributions.
    The second observation is that NEs often contain or are entirely made up of words that are phonetically transliterated or have a common etymological origin across languages (e.g. parliament in English and , its Russian translation), and thus are phonetically similar.
    Figure 2 shows an example list of NEs and their possible Russian transliterations.
    Approaches that attempt to use these two characteristics separately to identify NEs across languages would have significant shortcomings.
    Transliteration based approaches require a good model, typically handcrafted or trained on a clean set of transliteration pairs.
    On the other hand, time sequence similarity based approaches would incorrectly match words which happen to have similar time signatures (e.g., Taliban and Afghanistan in recent news).
    We introduce an algorithm we call co-ranking which exploits these observations simultaneously to match NEs on one
