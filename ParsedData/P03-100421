I (Polynomial Kernel Inverted), which is an extension of Inverted Index.
    The other is PKE (Polynomial Kernel Expanded), where all feature combinations are explicitly expanded.
    The concept in PKE can also be applicable to kernels for discrete data structures, such as String Kernel (Lodhi et al., 2002) and Tree Kernel (Kashima and Koyanagi, 2002; Collins and Duffy, 2001).
    For instance, Tree Kernel gives a dot product of an ordered-tree, and maps the original ordered-tree onto its all sub-tree space.
    To apply the PKE, we must efficiently enumerate the effective sub-trees from a set of support examples.
    We can similarly apply a sub-tree mining algorithm (Zaki, 2002) to this problem.
