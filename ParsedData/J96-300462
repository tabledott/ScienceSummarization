e paired measures of precision and recall.
    What both of these approaches presume is that there is a single correct segmentation for a sentence, against which an automatic algorithm can be compared.
    We have shown that, at least given independent human judgments, this is not the case, and that therefore such simplistic measures should be mistrusted.
    This is not to say that a set of standards by which a particular segmentation would count as correct and another incorrect could not be devised; indeed, such standards have been proposed and include the published PRCNSC (1994) and ROCLING (1993), as well as the unpublished Linguistic Data Consortium standards (ca.
    May 1995).
    However, until such standards are universally adopted in evaluating Chinese segmenters, claims about performance in terms of simple measures like percent correct should be taken with a grain of salt; see, again, Wu and Fung (1994) for further arguments supporting this conclusion.
    Second, comparisons of different methods a
