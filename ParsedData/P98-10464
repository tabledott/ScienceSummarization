ed on the ability of a verb to occur or not occur in pairs of syntactic frames that are in some sense meaning preserving (diathesis alternations) (Levin, 1993).
    The distribution of syntactic frames in which a verb can appear determines its class membership.
    The fundamental assumption is that the syntactic frames are a direct reflection of the underlying semantics.
    Levin classes are supposed to provide specific sets of syntactic frames that are associated with the individual classes.
    The sets of syntactic frames associated with a particular Levin class are not intended to be arbitrary, and they are supposed to reflect underlying semantic components that constrain allowable arguments.
    For example, break verbs and cut verbs are similar in that they can all participate in the transitive and in the middle construction, John broke the window, Glass breaks easily, John cut the bread, This loaf cuts easily.
    However, only break verbs can also occur in the simple intransitive, The window broke,
