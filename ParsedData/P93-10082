plied, of the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Government. the multiple analyses arising before and after all this added robustness are managed in two ways: first, by highly constraining the additional rulebased modules by partitioning the rules into preference classes, and second, through the addition of a postprocessing parse preference component.
    Processing starts in Gemini when syntactic, semantic, and lexical rules are applied by a bottom-up all-paths constituent parser to populate a chart with edges containing syntactic, semantic, and logical form information.
    Then, a second utterance parser is used to apply a second set of syntactic and semantic rules that are required to span the entire utterance.
    If no semantically acceptable utterance-spanning edges are found during this phase, a component to recognize and correct certain grammatical disfluencies is applied.
    When an acceptable interpretation is found, a set of parse preferences is used to choose a single best interpretat
