wing one label because we can apply all the classes in the later precessing steps without any loss.
			3 Learning a Question Classifier.
			Using machine learning methods for question clas sification is advantageous over manual methods forseveral reasons.
			The construction of a manual clas sifier for questions is a tedious task that requiresthe analysis of a large number of questions.
			More over, mapping questions into fine classes requiresthe use of lexical items (specific words) and there fore an explicit representation of the mapping may be very large.
			On the other hand, in our learning approach one can define only a small number of ?types?
			of features, which are then expanded in adata-driven way to a potentially large number of features (Cumby and Roth, 2000), relying on the abil ity of the learning process to handle it.
			It is hard to imagine writing explicitly a classifier that depends on thousands or more features.
			Finally, a learnedclassifier is more flexible to reconstruct than a man u
