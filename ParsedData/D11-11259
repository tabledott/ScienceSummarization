on to MERT.
    With MERT as a starting point, we have a choice: modify candidate generation, optimization, or both.
    Although alternative candidate generation methods have been proposed (Macherey et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 2008b; Chatterjee and Cancedda, 2010), we will restrict ourselves to MERT-style candidate generation, in order to minimize divergence from the established MERT tuning architecture.
    Instead, we focus on the optimization phase.
    While intuitive, the MERT optimization module focuses attention on Hw&#8217;s best policy, and not on its overall prowess at ranking policies.
    We will create an optimization module that directly addresses Hw&#8217;s ability to rank policies in the hope that this more holistic approach will generalize better to unseen data.
    Assume that the gold scoring function G decomposes in the following way: where g(i, j) is a local scoring function that scores the single candidate translation e(i, j).
    We show an example g in Figure 1.
