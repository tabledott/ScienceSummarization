s, and verb groups, and discards all other syntactic information.
    She examines items that are within &#177;3 phrase segments from the target and combines syntactic evidence with other kinds of evidence, such as capitalization.
    Yarowsky (1993) determines various behaviors based on syntactic category; for example, that verbs derive more disambiguating information from their objects than from their subjects, adjectives derive almost all disambiguating information from the nouns they modify, and nouns are best disambiguated by directly adjacent adjectives or nouns.
    In recent work, syntactic information most often is simply part of speech, used invariably in conjunction with other kinds of information (McRoy 1992; Bruce and Wiebe 1994; Leacock, Chodorow, and Miller, this volume).
    Evidence suggests that different kinds of disambiguation procedures are needed depending on the syntactic category and other characteristics of the target word (Yarowsky 1993; Leacock, Chodorow, and Miller, this volume)&#8
