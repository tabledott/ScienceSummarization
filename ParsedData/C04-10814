by exponential models (as in maximum en tropy classifiers), and with great flexibility to viewthe observation sequence in terms of arbitrary, over lapping features, with long-range dependencies, and at multiple levels of granularity.
			These beneficialproperties suggests that CRFs are a promising ap proach for Chinese word segmentation.New word detection is one of the most impor tant problems in Chinese information processing.Many machine learning approaches have been pro posed (Chen and Bai, 1998; Wu and Jiang, 2000; Nie et al, 1995).
			New word detection is normally considered as a separate process from segmentation.However, integrating them would benefit both seg mentation and new word detection.
			CRFs provide aconvenient framework for doing this.
			They can pro duce not only a segmentation, but also confidence in local segmentation decisions, which can be usedto find new, unfamiliar character sequences sur rounded by high-confidence segmentations.
			Thus, our new word detection is not a stand-alone
