 this optimization are shown in Table 1.
    We can compare TERp with other metrics by comparing their Pearson and Spearman correlations with Adequacy, at the segment, document and system level.
    Document level Adequacy scores are determined by taking the length weighted average of the segment level scores.
    System level scores are determined by taking the weighted average of the document level scores in the same manner.
    We compare TERp with BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), and TER (Snover et al., 2006).
    The IBM version of BLEU was used in case insensitive mode with an ngram-size of 4 to calculate the BLEU scores.
    Case insensitivity was used with BLEU as it was found to have much higher correlation with Adequacy.
    In addition, we also examined BLEU using an ngram-size of 2 (labeled as BLEU-2), instead of the default ngram-size of 4, as it often has a higher correlation with human judgments.
    When using METEOR, the exact matching, porter stemming matching
