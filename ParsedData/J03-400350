    Tables 8 and 9 show the effect of distance on the distribution of modifiers in two of the most frequent syntactic environments: NP and verb modification.
    The distribution varies a great deal with distance.
    Most striking is the way that the probability of STOP increases with increasing distance: from 71% to 89% to 98% in the NP case, from 8% to 60% to 96% in the verb case.
    Each modifier probability generally decreases with distance.
    For example, the probability of seeing a PP modifier to an NP decreases from 17.7% to 5.57% to 0.93%.
    Distribution of nonterminals generated as postmodifiers to a verb within a VP (see tree to the left), at various distances from the head.
    A = True means the modifier is adjacent to the head; V = True means there is a verb between the head and the modifier.
    The distributions were calculated from the first 10000 events for each of the distributions in sections 2&#8211;21.
    Auxiliary verbs (verbs taking a VP complement to
