 word lattice, a further constraint must be enforced ensuring that there is always a path from the starting node of the translation extension&#8217;s source to the node representing the nearest right edge of the already-translated material, as well as a path from the ending node of the translation extension&#8217;s source to future translated spans.
    Figure 3 illustrates the problem.
    If [0,1] is translated, the decoder must not consider translating [2,3] as a possible extension of this hypothesis since there is no path from node 1 to node 2 and therefore the span [1,2] would never be covered.
    In the parser that forms the basis of the hierarchical decoder described in Section 2.3, no such restriction is necessary since grammar rules are processed in a strictly left-to-right fashion without any skips.
  
  
    In both hierarchical and phrase-based models, the distance between words in the source sentence is used to limit where in the target sequence their translations will be generated.
