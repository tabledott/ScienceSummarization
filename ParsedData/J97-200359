complexity of the minimization of subsequential transducers is always as good as that of classical automata minimization: 0(1(21 + 1El) in the acyclic case, and 0(1Ellog1Q1) in the general case.
    Figures 15 to 17 illustrate the minimization algorithm.
    31 (Figure 15) represents a subsequential string-to-weight transducer.
    Notice that the size of )31 cannot be reduced using the automata minimization. represents the transducer obtained by pushing, and Si a minimal transducer realizing the same function as 31 in the tropical semiring.
    Minimal transducer 61 obtained from 71 by automata minimization.
    The transducer obtained by this algorithm is the one defined in the proof of theorem 14 and has the minimal number of states.
    This raises the question of whether there exists a subsequential transducer with the minimal number of transitions and computing the same function as a given subsequential transducer T. The following corollary offers an answer.
