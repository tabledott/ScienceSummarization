quiring labeled data is a difficult and expensive task.
    Therefore, an increasing attention has been recently given to semi-supervised learning, where large amounts of unlabeled data are used to improve the models learned from a small training set (Collins and Singer, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002).
    The hope is that semi-supervised or even unsupervised approaches, when given enough knowledge about the structure of the problem, will be competitive with the supervised models trained on large training sets.
    However, in the general case, semi-supervised approaches give mixed results, and sometimes even degrade the model performance (Nigam et al., 2000).
    In many cases, improving semi-supervised models was done by seeding these models with domain information taken from dictionaries or ontology (Cohen and Sarawagi, 2004; Collins and Singer, 1999; Haghighi and Klein, 2006; Thelen and Riloff, 2002).
    On the other hand, in the supervised setting, it has been shown that incorporating domain and problem
