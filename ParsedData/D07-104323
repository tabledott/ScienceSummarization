que in that it can also prioritize one criterion over another, depending on the clustering task and goals.
	
	
			Dom (2001) describes a parametric technique for generating example clustering solutions.
			He then proceeds to define five ?desirable properties?
			that clustering accuracy measures should display, basedon the parameters used to generate the clustering solution.
			To compare V-measure more directly to alter native clustering measures, we evaluate V-measure and other measures against these and two additional desirable properties.The parameters used in generating a clustering so lution are as follows.
			|C| The number of classes ? |K| The number of clusters ? |Knoise| Number of ?noise?
			clusters; |Knoise| &lt; |K| ? |Cnoise| Number of ?noise?
			classes; |Cnoise| &lt; |C| ? ?
			Error probability; ? = ?1 + ?2 + ?3.
			? ?1 The error mass within ?useful?
			class-cluster pairs ? ?2 The error mass within noise clusters ? ?3 The error mass within noise classes The construction of a clustering sol
