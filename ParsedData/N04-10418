 in any particular syntactic relationship with disease, but because it belongs to the class of instances that does.
    The input to our labeling algorithm is a list of semantic classes, in the form of clusters of words, which may be generated from any source.
    In our experiments, we used the clustering outputs of CBC (Pantel and Lin 2002).
    The output of the system is a ranked list of concept names for each semantic class.
    In the first phase of the algorithm, we extract feature vectors for each word that occurs in a semantic class.
    Phase II then uses these features to compute grammatical signatures of concepts using the CBC algorithm.
    Finally, we use simple syntactic patterns to discover class names from each class' signature.
    Below, we describe these phases in detail.
    We represent each word (concept instance) by a feature vector.
    Each feature corresponds to a context in which the word occurs.
    For example, &amp;quot;catch _&amp;quot; is a verbobject context.
    If the word
