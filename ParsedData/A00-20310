    Parsing sentences using statistical information gathered from a treebank was first examined a decade ago in (ChitraD and Grishman, 1990) and is by now a fairly well-studied problem ((Charniak, 1997), (Collins, 1997), (Ratnaparkhi, 1997)).
    But to date, the end product of the parsing process has for the most part been a bracketing with simple constituent labels like NP, VP, or SBAR.
    The Penn treebank contains a great deal of additional syntactic and semantic information from which to gather statistics; reproducing more of this information automatically is a goal which has so far been mostly ignored.
    This paper details a process by which some of this information&#8212;the function tags&#8212; may be recovered automatically.
    In the Penn treebank, there are 20 tags (figure 1) that can be appended to constituent labels in order to
