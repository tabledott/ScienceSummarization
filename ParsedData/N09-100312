    We have used two standard datasets.
    The first one, RG, consists of 65 pairs of words collected by Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965), who had them judged by 51 human subjects in a scale from 0.0 to 4.0 according to their similarity, but ignoring any other possible semantic relationships that might appear between the terms.
    The second dataset, WordSim3535 (Finkelstein et al., 2002) contains 353 word pairs, each associated with an average of 13 to 16 human judgements.
