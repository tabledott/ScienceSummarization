recision and recall.
    This evaluation criterion carries much practical import, because many of the applications mentioned in Section 1 depend on accurate broad-coverage translation lexicons.
    Machine readable bilingual dictionaries, even when they are available, have only limited coverage and rarely include domain-specific terms (Resnik &amp; Melamed, 1997).
    We define the recall of a word-to-word translation model as the fraction of the bitext vocabulary represented in the model.
    Translation model precision is a more thorny issue, because people disagree about the degree to which context should play a role in judgements of translational equivalence.
    We handevaluated the precision of the link types in our model in the context of the bitext from which the model 4Since function words can be identified by table lookup, no POS-tagger was involved. was induced, using a simple bilingual concordancer.
    A link type (u, v) was considered correct if u and v ever co-occurred as direct translations of
