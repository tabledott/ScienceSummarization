  To tackle the problem of joint syntactic?semantic anal- ysis, the system relies on a syntactic and a semantic subcomponent.
  The syntactic model is a bottom-up projective parser us- ing pseudo-projective transformations, and the semantic model uses global inference mechanisms on top of a pipeline of clas- sifiers.
  The complete syntactic?semantic output is selected from a candidate pool generated by the subsystems.
  The system achieved the top score in the closed challenge: a labeled syntactic accu- racy of 89.32%, a labeled semantic F1 of 81.65, and a labeled macro F1 of 85.49.
