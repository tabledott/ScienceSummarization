n use models with IOBES-F or IOBES-B representations for the committees for the weighted voting, we do not use them in our voting experiments.
    The reason is that the number of classes are different (3 vs. 5) and the estimated VC and LOO bound cannot straightforwardly be compared with other models that have three classes (IOB1/IOB2/IOE1/IOE2) under the same condition.
    We conduct experiments with IOBESF and IOBES-B representations only to investigate how far the difference of various chunk representations would affect the actual chunking accuracies.
  
  
    We use the following three annotated corpora for our experiments.
    Base NP standard data set (baseNP-S) This data set was first introduced by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), and taken as the standard data set for baseNP identification task2.
    This data set consists of four sections (15-18) of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Treebank for the training data, and one section (20) for the test data.
    The data has part-ofspeech (POS)
