ation, equality reasoning, rule application, and al l other aspects of inference together accounting for 6-7% of all processing time in Alembic.
  Details are in [II] .
  We exploited inference rules in several primary ways for the TE and ST tasks.
  The first class of inferenc e rules enforce so-called terminological reasoning, local inference that composes the meaning of words .
  One such rule distributes the meaning of certain adjectives such as "retired" across coordinated titles, as in "retire d chairman and CEO" .
  The phrase parses as follows; note the embedded post semantic phrase types .
  &lt;post &gt; &lt; post-qua I &gt; retired &lt;/post- aua I &gt; &lt;post &gt; &lt;post&gt;chai rman &lt;/post&gt; and &lt;post&gt;CEO&lt;/post &gt; &lt;/post&gt; &lt;/post&gt; This particular example propositionalizes as follows, where the group construct denotes a plural individual in Landmans sense (roughly a set [9]) .
