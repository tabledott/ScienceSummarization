    \MI + 42 + + 4n is the cosine normalization factor and is equal to the Euclidean length of the vector Si.
    The VSM-Disambiguate module, for each summary Si, computes the similarity of that summary with each of the other summaries.
    If the similarity computed is above a pre-defined threshold, then the entity of interest in the two summaries are considered to be coreferent.
  
  
    The cross-document coreference system was tested on a highly ambiguous test set which consisted of 197 articles from 1996 and 1997 editions of the New York Times.
