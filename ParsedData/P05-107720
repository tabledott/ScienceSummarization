le to discover 72.8% of the elements of the Top 100 list.
    However, increasing the values of q and B also increases search time.
    With a beam (B) of 100 and the number of random permutations equal to 100 (i.e., q = 1000) it takes 570 hours of processing time on a single Pentium IV machine, whereas with B = 25 and q = 1000, reduces processing time by more than 50% to 240 hours.
    We could not calculate the total time taken to build noun similarity list using the traditional technique on the entire corpus.
    However, we estimate that its time taken would be at least 50,000 hours (and perhaps even more) with a few of Terabytes of disk space needed.
    This is a very rough estimate.
    The experiment was infeasible.
    This estimate assumes the widely used reverse indexing technique, where in one compares only those vector pairs that have at least one feature in common.
    For evaluating the quality of our final similarity lists, we use the system developed by Pantel and Lin (2002) as gold standard
