    The PCFG P3 is estimated from this corpus. structures, as shown in Figure 6.
    As explained in Section 1, flattening the tree structures in general corresponds to weakening the independence assumptions in the induced PCFG models, so one might expect this to improve the induced language model.
    The counts C3 and the nonunit production probability estimates P3 for the PCFG induced from this two-tree corpus are as follows: The relationship between f and h is also plotted in Figure 4.
    The value of h diverges from f, as before: at f = 0.48/3 -= 0.23.
    As Figure 4 shows, the estimated relative frequency /3 using the flattened tree representations is always closer to f than the estimated relative frequency fi using the Penn II representations, but is only closer to f than the estimated relative frequency f2 using the Chomsky adjunction representations for f greater than approximately 0.7.
    The training corpus 77'4.
