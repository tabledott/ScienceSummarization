 Kan et al., 1998), dynamic programming (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Heinonen, 1998; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001), agglomerative clustering (Yaari, 1997) and divisive clustering (Reynar, 1994; Choi, 2000a) to determine the optimal segmentation.
    The main difficulty in clustering is automatic termination, i.e. determining the number of topic boundaries in a document.
  
  
    The input to our algorithm is a list of tokenised sentences S = {81,..,8}.
    Content words are identified by removing punctuation marks and stopwords from S. A term frequency vector f, is then constructed for each sentence i. fij denotes the number of times content word j occurs in s,.
    The C99 algorithm (Choi, 2000a) uses the cosine metric (van Rijsbergen, 1979) (eq.
    1) to compute a nxn similarity matrix M for S. represents the similarity between s, and si.
    The assumption is, two sentences with similar word usage are likely to be about the same topic.
    This idea has two main problems.
    First, the estimate is inaccurate fo
