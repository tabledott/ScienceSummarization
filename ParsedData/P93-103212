ames that the parser found.
    Because of mistakes, skipping, and recording adjuncts, the finite state parser records nothing or the wrong thing in the majority of cases, but, nevertheless, enough good data are found that the final subcategorization dictionary describes the majority of the subcategorization frames in which the verbs are used in this sample.
    Filtering assesses the frames that the parser found (called cues below).
    A cue may be a correct subcategorization for a verb, or it may contain spurious adjuncts, or it may simply be wrong due to a mistake of the tagger or the parser.
    The filtering process attempts to determine whether one can be highly confident that a cue which the parser noted is actually a subcategorization frame of the verb in question.
    The method used for filtering is that suggested by Brent (1992).
    Let B, be an estimated upper bound on the probability that a token of a verb that doesn't take the subcategorization frame s will nevertheless appear with a cue for s
