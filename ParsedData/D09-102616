rpus is highly multiply labeled: almost 90% of of the documents have more than one tag.
    (For comparison, less than one third of the news documents in the popular RCV1-v2 collection of newswire are multiply labeled).
    We will refer to this collection of data as the del.icio.us tag dataset.
  
  
    A first question we ask of Labeled LDA is how its topics compare with those learned by traditional LDA on the same collection of documents.
    We ran our implementations of Labeled LDA and LDA on the del.icio.us corpus described above.
    Both are based on the standard collapsed Gibbs sampler, with the constraints for Labeled LDA implemented as in Section 2.
    Figure 2: Comparison of some of the 20 topics learned on del.icio.us by Labeled LDA (left) and traditional LDA (right), with representative words for each topic shown in the boxes.
    Labeled LDA&#8217;s topics are named by their associated tag.
    Arrows from right-to-left show the mapping of LDA topics to the closest Labeled LDA topic by cosine
