er grandparent relations.
    In grandparent models each parse tree y is represented as a vector where we have added a second set of duplicate variables, y&#8593;(i, j) for all (i, j) E Z.
    The set of all valid parse trees is then defined as So as before y|i contains variables y(i, j) which indicate which words modify the i&#8217;th word.
    In addition, y|i includes y&#8593;(k, i) variables that indicate the word that word i itself modifies.
    The set of all possible values of y|i is now Hence the y(i, j) variables can take any values, but only one of the y&#8593;(k, i) variables can be equal to 1 (as only one word can be a parent of word i).
    As before, we define i = {y : y|i E ii for i = 0 ... n}.
    We introduce the following assumption: Again, it follows that we can approxiresulting vector z&#8727; may be deficient in two respects.
    First, the variables z&#8727;(i, j) may not form a wellformed directed spanning tree.
    Second, we may have z&#8727;&#8593;(i, j) =&#65533; z&#8727;(i, j) for
