	Characterising Measures Of Lexical Distributional Similarity
		This work investigates the variation in a word?s dis tributionally nearest neighbours with respect to the similarity measure used.
		We identify one type ofvariation as being the relative frequency of the neighbour words with respect to the frequency of the target word.
		We then demonstrate a three-way connec tion between relative frequency of similar words, aconcept of distributional gnerality and the seman tic relation of hyponymy.
		Finally, we consider theimpact that this has on one application of distributional similarity methods (judging the composition ality of collocations).
	
	
			Over recent years, many Natural Language Pro cessing (NLP) techniques have been developedthat might benefit from knowledge of distribu tionally similar words, i.e., words that occur in similar contexts.
			For example, the sparse dataproblem can make it difficult to construct language models which predict combinations of lex ical events.
