    The main features of the generator are: wide coverage and high accuracy It incorporates data from several large corpora and machine readable dictionaries.
    An evaluation has shown the error rate to be very low. robustness The generator does not contain an explicit lexicon or word-list, but instead comprises a set of morphological generalisations together with a list of exceptions for specific (irregular) words.
