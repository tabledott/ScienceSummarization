rts the tree into a string in the target-language.
    We model this conversion by an extended treeto-string transducer that have multi-level trees on the source-side, which gives our system more expressive power and flexibility.
    We also define a direct probability model and use a linear-time dynamic programming algorithm to search for the best derivation.
    The model is then extended to the general log-linear framework in order to rescore with other features like n-gram language models.
    We devise a simple-yet-effective algorithm to generate non-duplicate k-best translations for n-gram rescoring.
    Initial experimental results on English-to-Chinese translation are presented.
  
  
    The concept of syntax-directed (SD) translation was originally proposed in compiling (Irons, 1961; Lewis and Stearns, 1968), where the source program is parsed into a tree representation that guides the generation of the object code.
    Following Aho and Ullman (1972), a translation, as a set of string pairs, can be
