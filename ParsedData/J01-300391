    Alternations are detected by testing the hypothesis that, given any verb, the selectional preferences for arguments occurring in alternating slots will be more similar to each other than those for slots that do not alternate.
    For instance, given a verb participating in the causative alternation, its selectional preferences for the subject in an intransitive use, and for the object in a transitive use, will be more similar to each other than the selectional preferences for these two slots of a verb that does not participate in the causative alternation.
    This method achieves the best accuracy for the causative and the conative alternations (73% and 83%, respectively), despite sparseness of data.
    McCarthy reports that a simpler measure of selectional preferences based simply on head words yields a lower 63% accuracy.
    Since this latter measure is very similar to our CAUS feature, we think that our results would also improve by adopting a similar method of abstracting fr
