 performance as 2PR/ (P R), in which P (precision) is truePositives/(truePositives falsePositives), and R (recall) is truePositives/(truePositives falseNegatives). frequencies of the verbs, both by class and individually.
    By class, unergatives have the lowest average log frequency (1.8), but are the best classified, while unaccusatives and object-drops are comparable (average log frequency = 2.4).
    If we group individual verbs by frequency, the proportion of errors to the total number of verbs is not linearly related to frequency (log frequency &lt; 2: 7 errors/24 verbs, or 29% error; log frequency between 2 and 3: 7 errors/25 verbs, or 28% error; log frequency &gt; 3: 4 errors/10 verbs, or 40% error).
    Moreover, it seems that the highest-frequency verbs pose the most problems to the program.
    In addition, the only verb of log frequency &lt; 1 is correctly classified, while the only one with log frequency &gt; 4 is not.
    In conclusion, we do not find that there is a simple mapping from frequen
