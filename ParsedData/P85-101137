h a node X, which hun only one child Y, then we can de~ with the various cusee as follows.
  We will annotate with Y the q?adruple (p,qs,qa~t) and the constraint that root of the t~,e which can be adjoined at X should have the quadruple (qt,P~,qt) amucinted with it amen8 the trees which were aflowed in the original grammar, if it is to be adjoined st X.
  The cm where the original grammar bad null or obligatory constraint amocinted with this node or Y is labelled with a terminsi symbol, are treated similar to how we dealt with them in the previous cuses.
  Once this has been done, let ql,---,qm be the independent variables for this elementary tree o, then we produce as many co~ of a so that ql,..-,qm take ad possible value8 from Q.
  The only diHerenee ?meal  the varions copies of cs so produced will be eonsteaint8 u ~  with the nodes in the trees.
  Repeat he prose?
  for aft the elementary trees in G a.
  Once this has been dome and each tree |lynn ~ unique name we can write the constraints in terms of them
