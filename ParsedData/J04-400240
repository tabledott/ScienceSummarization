    In performing recombination, Algorithm for breadth-first search with pruning. we obtain a search graph instead of a search tree.
    The exact criterion for performing recombination for the alignment templates is described in Section 5.5.
    Theoretically, we could use any graph search algorithm to search the optimal path in the search space.
    We use a breadth-first search algorithm with pruning.
    This approach offers very good possibilities for adjusting the trade-off between quality and efficiency.
    In pruning, we always compare hypotheses that have produced the same number of target words.
    Figure 7 shows a structogram of the algorithm.
    As the search space increases exponentially, it is not possible to explicitly represent it.
    Therefore, we represent the search space implicitly, using the functions Extend and Recombine.
    The function Extend produces new hypotheses extending the current hypothesis by one word.
    Some hypotheses might be id
