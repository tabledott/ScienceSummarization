ion f : s ? emi, such that we obtain an ordered labeled pair (s, emi).
			The mapping is based on F = {f1, f2, .., fn}, where F contains the features derived from the text.
			Furthermore, if multiple emotion classes can characterize s, then given E?
			E, the target of the mapping function becomes the ordered pair (s,E?).Finally, as further discussed in section 6, the hierarchical case of label assignment requires a sequen 580tial model that further defines levels of coarse ver sus fine-grained classifiers, as done by (Li and Roth, 2002) for the question classification problem.
			4.2 Implementation.
			Whereas our goal is to predict finer emotional mean ing distinctions according to emotional categories in speech; in this study, we focus on the basic task of recognizing emotional passages and on determining their valence (i.e. positive versus negative) becausewe currently do not have enough training data to ex plore finer-grained distinctions.
			The goal here is to get a good understanding of the nature of
