  Table 3 shows the percentages of words correctly seg- mented and tagged, tested on the closed test sentences.
  The trigram model achiew;d 97.5% recall and 97.8% precision flu" the top candidate, while tile bigram model achiew.d 96.2% recall and 96.6% precision.
  Although both tagging models sllow very high l)erformanee, tile 20,5 trigram model outperformed tile bigram model in every metric.
  We then tested the proposed system, which uses smoothed part of speech trigram with word model, on the open test sentences.
  Table 4 shows tile percentages of words correctly segmented and tagged.
  In Table 4, label consistency 2 represents the accuracy of segmen- tation and tagging ignoring the difference in conjuga- tion form.
