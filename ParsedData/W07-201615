of a given verb, and to assign them appropriate semantic roles that describe howthey relate to the verb.
			SRL systems are an important building block for many larger semantic systems.
			For example, in order to determine that ques tion (1a) is answered by sentence (1b), but not by sentence (1c), we must determine the relationships between the relevant verbs (eat and feed) and their arguments.
			(1) a. What do lobsters like to eat?b. Recent studies have shown that lobsters pri marily feed on live fish, dig for clams, sea urchins, and feed on algae and eel-grass.
			c. In the early 20th century, Mainers would only eat lobsters because the fish they caught was too valuable to eat themselves.
			Traditionally, SRL systems have been trained on either the PropBank corpus (Palmer et al, 2005) ? for two years, the CoNLL workshop (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2004; Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2005) has made this their shared task, or the FrameNet corpus ? Senseval-3 used this for their shared task(Litkowski, 2004).
