y of various prior probabilities for text segmentation. where (12) We further rewrite Equation (12) in the form of Equation (13) below by using Equation (5) and replacing with , where is the length of words, i.e.,the number of word tokens in words.
    Equation (13) is used to describe our algorithm in Section 3.1: This section describes an algorithm for finding the minimum-cost segmentation.
    First, we define the terms and symbols used to describe the algorithm.
    Given a text consisting of words, we define as the position between and , so that is just before and is just after .
    Next, we define a graph , where is a set of nodes and is a set of edges. is defined as can be decomposed as follows: and we then minimize to obtain , because where the edges are ordered; the initial vertex and the terminal vertex of are and , respectively.
    An example of is shown in Figure 1.
    We say that covers (16) where is the number of different words in .
    Given these definitions, we describe the algorithm to f
