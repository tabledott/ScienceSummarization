ing to the same set of high scoring dependencies.
    In practice large numbers of such conjunctive nodes lead to very long parse times.
    As an alternative to finding the most probable dependency structure, we have developed an algorithm which maximizes the expected labeled recall over dependencies.
    Our algorithm is based on Goodman&#8217;s (1996) labeled recall algorithm for the phrase-structure PARSEVAL measures.
    As far as we know, this is the first application of Goodman&#8217;s approach to finding highest scoring dependency structures.
    Watson, Carroll, and Briscoe (2005) have also applied our algorithm to the grammatical relations output by the RASP parser.
    The dependency structure, &#960;max, which maximizes the expected recall is: where &#960;i ranges over the dependency structures for S. The expectation for a single dependency structure &#960; is realized as a weighted intersection over all possible dependency structures &#960;i for S. The intuition is that, if &#960;i is the gold st
