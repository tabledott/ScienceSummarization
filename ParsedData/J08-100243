d by saw, and the right daughter is PP headed by with, whose part-of-speech is IN and whose lexical entry is a VP-modifying preposition.
    Figure 21 shows example features for predicate&#8211;argument structures.
    The figure shows features assigned to the conjunctive node denoted as &#945;' in Figure 18.
    Because inactive structures in the node have three predicate&#8211;argument relations, three features are activated.
    The first one is for the relation of want and I, where the label of the relation is ARG1, the distance between the head words is 1, the surface string and the POS of Example features for predicate&#8211;argument structures. the predicate are want and VBD, and those of the argument are I and PRP.
    The second and the third features are for the other two relations.
    We may include features on more than two relations, such as the dependencies among want, I, and dispute, although such features are not incorporated currently.
    In our implementation, some of the atomic features a
