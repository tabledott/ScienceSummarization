    A sequence of good text (I) goes into the channel, and a sequence of corrupted text (0) comes out the other end.
    How can an automatic procedure recover the good input text, I, from the corrupted output, 0?
    In principle, one can recover the most likely input, I, by hypothesizing all possible input texts, I, and selecting the input text with the highest score, Pr(I I 0).
    Symbolically, where ARGMAX finds the argument with the maximum score.
    The prior probability, Pr(I), is the probability that I will be presented at the input to the channel.
    In speech recognition, it is the probability that the talker utters I; in spelling correction (Damerau 1964; Kukich 1992), it is the probability that the typist intends to type I.
    In practice, the prior probability is unavailable, and consequently, we have to make do with a model of the prior probability, such as the trigram model.
    The parameters of the language model are usually estimated by computing various statistics over a la
