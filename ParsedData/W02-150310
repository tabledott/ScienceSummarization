    This contrast can be seen between the German example in (4) and the Urdu one in (5).
    In German, the interrogative word is in first position with the finite verb second; English and Norwegian pattern like German.
    In Urdu the verb is usually in final position, but the interrogative can appear in a number of positions, including following the verb (5c).
    Despite these differences in word order and hence in c-structure, the f-structures are parallel, with the interrogative being in a FOCUS-INT and the sentence having an interrogative STMT-TYPE, as in (6).
    In the project grammars, many basic constructions are of this type.
    However, as we will see in the next section, there are times when parallelism is not possible and not desirable.
    Even in these cases, though, the grammars which can be p
