an effective and simple approach of combining different semantic role labeling systems through joint inference, which significantly improves its performance.
  Our system has been evaluated in the CoNLL-2005 shared task on semantic role labeling, and achieves the highest F1 score among 19 participants.
  Introduction Semantic parsing of sentences is believed to be an important task on the road to natural language understanding, and has immediate applications in tasks such as informa- tion extraction and question answering.
  Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a shallow semantic parsing task, in which for each predicate in a sentence, the goal is to identify all constituents that fill a semantic role, and to determine their roles (Agent, Patient, Instrument, etc.)
  and their adjuncts (Locative, Temporal, Manner, etc.).
