in different approaches to the task.
    In one run (Run 1), they are used to train a classifier that assigns separate entailment judgments for each direction.
    Such judgments are finally composed into a single one for each pair.
    In the other runs, the same features are used for multi-class classification.
    DirRelCond3 [cross lingual, compositional] (Perini, 2012) uses bilingual dictionaries (Freedict5 and WordReference6) to translate content words into English.
    Then, entailment decisions are taken combining directional relatedness scores between words in both directions (Perini, 2011).
    FBK [cross lingual, compositional &amp; multiclass] (Mehdad et al., 2012a) uses cross-lingual matching features extracted from lexical phrase tables, semantic phrase tables, and dependency relations (Mehdad et al., 2011; Mehdad et al., 2012b; Mehdad et al., 2012c).
    The features are used for multi-class and binary classification using SVMs.
