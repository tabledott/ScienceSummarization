ately, we are unlikely to succeed, as we now show.
    For proof purposes, we define our optimization problem with an associated yes-no decision problem:
  
  
    Given a string f of length m and a set of parameter tables (b, E, s), return a string e of length 1 &lt; 2m that maximizes P(elf), or equivalently maximizes Given a string f of length m, a set of parameter tables (b, &#8364;, s), and a real number k, does there exist a string e of length / &lt; 2m such that P(e) &#8226; P(fle) &gt; k?
    We will leave the relationship between these two problems somewhat open and intuitive, noting only that M1-DECIDE's intractability does not bode well for MlOPTIMIZE.
    To show inclusion in NP, we need only nondeterministically choose e for any problem instance and verify that it has the requisite P(e) &#8226; P(fle) in 0(m2) time.
    Next we give separate polynomial-time reductions from two NP-complete problems.
    Each reduction highlights a different source of complexity.
