ature (except for LengthCutoff where the number 9 indicates the threshold for selecting a sentence based on the number of the words in the sentence).
    The reranker in the example is a word-based MMR reranker with a cosine similarity threshold, 0.5.
    We implemented the Degree and LexPageRank methods, and integrated into the MEAD system as new features.
    We normalize each feature so that the sentence with the maximum score gets the value 1.
    We ran MEAD with several policies with different feature weights and combinations of features.
    We fixed Length cutoff at 9, and the weight of the Position feature at 1 in all of the policies.
    We did not try a weight higher than 2.0 for any of the features since our earlier observations on MEAD showed that too high feature weights results in poor summaries.
    Table 2 and Table 3 show the ROUGE scores we have got in the experiments with using LexPageRank, Degree, and Centroid in Tasks 2 and 4, respectively, sorted by ROUGE-1 scores.
