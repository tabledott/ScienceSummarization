Wednesday&amp;quot; Low frequency features involving word n&#8212;grams tend to be unreliable; the NLG2 system therefore only uses features which occur K times or more in the training data.
    The search procedure attempts to find a word sequence wi wn of any length n &lt;M for the input attribute set A such that and where M is an heuristically set maximum phrase length.
    The search is similar to a left-to-right breadthfirst-search, except that only a fraction of the word sequences are considered.
    More specifically, the search procedure implements the recurrence: VVNa = top(N,{wlw E V}) 147.mi-1-1 = top(N,next(WN,i)) The set WN,i is the top N scoring sequences of length i, and the expression next(WN,i) returns all sequences w1 w,+1 such that wi w, E WN,, and wi-Fi E V U *stop*.
    The expression top(N,next(WN,i)) finds the top N sequences in next(WN,i).
    During the search, any sequence that ends with *stop* is removed and placed in the set of completed sequences.
    If N completed hypotheses are
