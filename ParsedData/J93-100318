e was computed by a numerical experiment in which p = 0.01, n1 = 100, and n2 = 10000, which corresponds to the situation in Figure 3.
    The close agreement shows that the likelihood ratio measure produces accurate results over six decades of significance even in the range where the normal X2 measure diverges radically from the ideal.
  
  
    To test the efficacy of the likelihood methods, an analysis was made of a 30,000-word sample of text obtained from the Union Bank of Switzerland, with the intention of finding pairs of words that occurred next to each other with a significantly higher frequency than would be expected, based on the word frequencies alone.
    The text was 31,777 words of financial text largely describing market conditions for 1986 and 1987.
    The results of such a bigram analysis should highlight collocations common in English as well as collocations peculiar to the financial nature of the analyzed text.
    As will be seen, the ranking based on likelihood ratio tests does exactly th
