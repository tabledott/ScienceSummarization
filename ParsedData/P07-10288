ly annotated data, and we will use semantic verb classes as predicates and semantic roles as arguments.
    Examples of extracted (p, rp, w) tuples are (Morality evaluation, Evaluee, gamblers) and (Placing, Goal, briefcase).
    Semantic similarity, on the other hand, will be computed on automatically syntactically parsed corpus, where the predicates are words and the arguments are syntactic dependents.
    Examples of extracted (p, rp, w) tuples from the generalization corpus include (catch, obj, frogs) and (intervene, in, deal).2 This instantiation of the similarity-based model allows us to compute word sense specific selectional preferences, generalizing over manually semantically annotated data using automatically syntactically annotated data.
  
  
    We use FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), a semantic lexicon for English that groups words in semantic classes called frames and lists semantic roles for each frame.
    The FrameNet 1.3 annotated data comprises 139,439 sentences from the British National Corp
