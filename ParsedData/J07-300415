the parsing models of Collins (1999) and Charniak (2000) and returned by the dependency parser of McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira (2005).
    In order to obtain such non-local dependencies, certain types of lexical category such as relative pronouns or raising and control verbs require additional coindexation information (described subsequently).
    We believe that CCGbank&#8217;s extensive annotation of non-local predicate&#8211;argument dependencies is one of its most useful features for researchers using other expressive grammar formalisms, including LFG, HPSG, and TAG, facilitating comparisons in terms of error analyses of particular constructions or types of dependency, such as non-subject extracted relative clauses.
    Because these dependency structures provide a suitable approximation of the underlying semantics, and because each interpretation unambiguously corresponds to one dependency structure (but may be obtained from multiple, equivalent, derivations), we furthermore follow Lin (1998) and Carro
