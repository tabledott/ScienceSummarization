form of preprocessed output; whereas a technique is the method used to create such output.
    We examine six different schemes and three techniques.
    The different techniques chosen illustrate three degrees of linguistic knowledge dependence.
    The first is very light and cheap.
    The second is more expensive, requiring the use of a morphological analyzer.
    And the third is yet more expensive than the second; it is a disambiguation system that requires an analyzer and a disambiguated training corpus.
    REGEX is the baseline technique.
    It is simply greedy regular expression matching to modify strings and/or split off prefix/suffix substrings that look like clitics indicated by specific schemes.
    REGEX cannot be used with complex schemes such as EN and MR (see Section 4.2).
    BAMA, Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (Buckwalter, 2002), is used to obtain possible word analyses.
    Using BAMA prevents incorrect greedy REGEX matches.
    Since BAMA produces multiple analyses, we always
