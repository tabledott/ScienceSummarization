intonationally prominent.
    Furthermore, both of the nows in Example 5 are also prominent.
    So it would seem that intonational prominence alone is insufficient to disambiguate between sentential and discourse uses.
    In this paper we present a more complex model of intonational features and textbased features that can serve to disambiguate between sentential and discourse instances of cue phrases.
    Our model is based on several empirical studies (Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Hirschberg 1990): two studies of individual cue phrases in which we develop our model, and a more comprehensive study of cue phrases as a class, in which we confirm and expand our model.
    Before describing these studies and their results, we must first describe the intonational features examined in our analyses.
  
  
    The importance of intonational information to the communication of discourse structure has been recognized in a variety of studies (Butterworth 1975; Schegloff 1979; Brazil, Coulthard, and Johns 19
