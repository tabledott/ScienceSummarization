aterials that can be used with any statistical classifier.
    The components can be fit together in the following manner.
    For a polysemous word, locate the monosemous relatives for each of its senses in WordNet and extract examples containing these relatives from a large corpus.
    Senses whose contexts greatly overlap can be identified with a simple cosine correlation.
    Often, correlations are high between senses of a word that are systematically related, as we saw for the 'activity' and 'product' senses of work.
    In some cases, the contexts for the two closely related senses may be combined.
    Since the frequencies of the monosemous relatives do not correlate with the frequencies of the senses, prior probabilities must be estimated for classifiers that use them.
    In the experiments of Section 3.2, these were estimated from the testing materials.
    They can also be estimated from a small manually tagged sample, such as the parts of the Brown corpus that have been tagged with senses in Word
