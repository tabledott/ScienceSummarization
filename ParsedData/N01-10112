    Each sense&#8212;tagged occurrence of an ambiguous word is converted into a feature vector, where each feature represents some property of the surrounding text that is considered to be relevant to the disambiguation process.
    Given the flexibility and complexity of human language, there is potentially an infinite set of features that could be utilized.
    However, in corpus&#8212;based approaches features usually consist of information that can be readily identified in the text, without relying on extensive external knowledge sources.
    These typically include the part&#8212;of&#8212;speech of surrounding words, the presence of certain key words within some window of context, and various syntactic properties of the sentence and the ambiguous word.
    The approach in this paper relies upon a feature set made up of bigrams, two word sequences that occur in a text.
    The context in which an ambiguous word occurs is represented by some number of binary features that indicate whether or not a par
