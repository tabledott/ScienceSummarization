   Three main activities occur during these meetings: comparison of sample f-structures, comparison of features and their values, and discussions of new or problematic constructions.
    A month before each meeting, the host site chooses around fifteen sentences whose analysis is to be compared at the meeting.
    These can be a random selection or be thematic, e.g., all dealing with predicatives or with interrogatives.
    The sentences are then parsed by each grammar and the output is compared.
    For the more recent grammars, this may mean adding the relevant rules to the grammars, resulting in growth of the grammar; for the older grammars, this may mean updating a construction that has not been examined in many years.
    Another approach that was taken at the beginning of the project was to have a common corpus of about 1,000 sentences that all of the grammars were to parse.
    For the English, French, and German grammars, this was an aligned tractor manual.
    The corpus sentences were used for the i
