 be linked to said, which is in turn a prototype for the part-of-speech VBD.
    We then encode these prototype links as features in a log-linear generative model, which is trained to fit unlabeled data (see section 4.1).
    Distributional prototype features provide substantial error rate reductions on all three tasks.
    For example, on English part-of-speech tagging with three prototypes per tag, adding prototype features to the baseline raises per-position accuracy from 41.3% to 80.5%.
  
  
    For our part-of-speech tagging experiments, we used data from the English and Chinese Penn treebanks (Marcus et al., 1994; Ircs, 2002).
    Example sentences are shown in figure 1(a) and (b).
    A great deal of research has investigated the unsupervised and semisupervised induction of part-of-speech models, especially in English, and there is unfortunately only space to mention some highly related work here.
    One approach to unsupervised learning of partof-speech models is to induce HMMs from unlabeled data i
