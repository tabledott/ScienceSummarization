rom x.
    The parser may only add a link from a word x to a word y adjacent to x (relative to the set of links already constructed).
    Therefore, the lexical entry of x should collect statistics about each of the adjacency positions of x.
    As seen above, adjacency positions may move, so the learner waits until the parser completes parsing the utterance and then updates each adjacency point Axi with the symbol a at the ith adjacency position of x (relative to the parse generated by the parser).
    It should be stressed that this update does not depend on whether a link was created from x to a.
    In particular, whatever links the parser assigns, Ax (&#8722;1) and Ax1 are always updated by the symbols which appear immediately before and after x.
    The following example should clarify the picture.
    Consider the fragment: put 0 = the &#65533;&#65533; &#65533;&#65533; 0 box on All the links in this example, including the absence of a link from box to on, depend on adjacency points of the form Ax(&#872
