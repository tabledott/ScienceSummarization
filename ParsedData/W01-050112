    To apply co-training, the base NP classification task must first be factored into views.
    For the JOB instances (vectors of part-of-speech tags indexed from &#8212;k to k) a view corresponds to a subset of the set of indices {&#8212;k, , k} .
    The most natural views are perhaps {&#8212;k, , Of and {0, , k}, indicating that one classifier looks at the focus tag and the tags to its left, while the other looks at the focus tag and the tags to its right.
    Note that these views certainly violate the desideratum of conditional independence between view features since both include the focus tag.
    Other views, such as left/right views omitting the focus tag, for example, may be more theoretically attractive, but we found that the left/right views including focus proved most effectual in practice.
    The JOB tagging task requires some minor modifications to the CT algorithm.
    First, it is impractical for the co-training classifiers to predict labels for each instance from the enormou
