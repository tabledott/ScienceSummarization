Given an input sentence f, which is to be translated into a target sentence e, the decodersearches for the most probable translation e?
			accord ing to the following decision rule: e?

			These features include lexicalized re-ordering models, which are parameterized as follows: given an input sentence f, a sequence of target-language phrases e = (e1, . . .
