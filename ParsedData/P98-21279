e, 1990), except that it does not use dependency triples with negative mutual information.
    The measure simHindi&#8222; is the same as sim H indle except that all types of dependency relationships are used, instead of just subject and object relationships.
    The measures simeosine, simdice and SiMJacard are versions of similarity measures commonly used in information retrieval (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992).
    Unlike sim, sim H indle and si -MHindler, they only where S(w) is the set of senses of w in the WordNet, super(c) is the set of (possibly indirect) superclasses of concept c in the WordNet, R(w) is the set of words that belong to a same Roget category as w. make use of the unique dependency triples and ignore their frequency counts.
  
  
    In this section, we present an evaluation of automatically constructed thesauri with two manually compiled thesauri, namely, WordNet1.5 (Miller et al., 1990) and Roget Thesaurus.
    We first define two word similarity measures that are based on the structur
