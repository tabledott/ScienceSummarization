failurele) 0, but i(e) &gt; 0, then the model is spiritually deficient.
    If w(e) were independent of e, neither form of deficiency would pose a problem, but because our models have no long-term constraints, w(e) decreases exponentially with 1.
    When computing alignments, even this creates no problem because e and f are known.
    If, however, we are given f and asked to discover e, then we will find that the product Pr(e) e) is too small for long English strings as compared with short ones.
    As a result, we will improperly favor short English strings.
    We can counteract this tendency in part by replacing Pr(fle) with c/ POI e) for some empirically chosen constant c. This is treatment of the symptom rather than treatment of the disease itself, but it offers some temporary relief.
    The cure lies in better modeling.
    As we progress from Model 1 to Model 5, evaluating the expectations that give us counts becomes increasingly difficult.
    For Models 1 and 2, we are able to include the contribut
