    The purpose of our experiments is to study the impact of the new representations introduced earlier for QA tasks.
    In particular, we focus on question classification and answer re-ranking for Web-based QA systems.
    In the question classification task, we extend previous studies, e.g.
    (Zhang and Lee, 2003; Moschitti, 2006), by testing a set of previously designed kernels and their combination with our new Shallow Semantic Tree Kernel.
    In the answer re-ranking task, we approach the problem of detecting description answers, among the most complex in the literature (Cui et al., 2005; Kazawa et al., 2001).
    The representations that we adopt are: bag-ofwords (BOW), bag-of-POS tags (POS), parse tree (PT), predicate argument structure (PAS) and nested PAS (PASN).
    BOW and POS are processed by means of a linear kernel, PT is processed with TK, PAS and PASN are processed by SSTK.
    We implemented the proposed kernels in the SVM-light-TK software available at ai-nlp.info.uniroma2
