ject in subject position.
    For example, there are two passives which correspond to the active sentence (6.1), a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; passive (6.3), and a passive which seems to pull the object of -or into subject position, namely (6.2).
    One fairly common view is that the phrase &amp;quot;made a mess of&amp;quot; functions as a single idiomatic verb, so that &amp;quot;the house&amp;quot; in (6.1) and (6.
    2) can be simply viewed as the object of the verb &amp;quot;made a mess of&amp;quot;.
    But then to account for (6.3), it must be assumed that &amp;quot;made&amp;quot; is first treated as a normal verb with &amp;quot;a mess&amp;quot; as object.
    This means that either (6.3) has a different underlying syntactic structure than (6.1-2), or that the syntactic analysis assigned to the string &amp;quot;made or (or perhaps &amp;quot;made &lt;trace&gt; or) changes after the passive is accounted for.
    To get a consistent syntactic analysis for these sentences, one can argue either that reanalys
