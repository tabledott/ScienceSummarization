valuation of how the algorithm fares when presented with noun groups produced by distributional clustering.
    In addition, I plan to explore alternative measures of semantic similarity, for example an improved variant on simple path length that has been proposed by Leacock and Chodorow (1994).
    Ultimately, this algorithm is intended to be part of a suite of techniques used for disambiguating words in running text with respect to WordNet senses.
    I would argue that success at that task will require combining knowledge of the kind that WordNet provides, primarily about relatedness of meaning, with knowledge of the kind best provided by corpora, primarily about usage in context.
    The difficulty with the latter kind of knowledge is that, until now, the widespread success in characterizing lexical behavior in terms of distributional relationships has applied at the level of words &#8212; indeed, word forms &#8212; as opposed to senses.
    This paper represents a step toward getting as much leverage as
