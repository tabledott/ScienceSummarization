 a phonemic representation.
    In this way, we convert the names in the source language, say E, into an intermediate phonemic representation P, and then convert the phonemic representation into the target language, say Chinese C. In E2C transliteration, the phoneme-based approach can be formulated as P(C|E) = P(C|P)P(P|E) and conversely we have P(E|C) = P(E|P)P(P|C) for C2E back-transliteration.
    Several phoneme-based techniques have been proposed in the recent past for machine transliteration using transformation-based learning algorithm (Meng et al. 2001; Jung et al, 2000; Virga &amp; Khudanpur, 2003) and using finite state transducer that implements transformation rules (Knight &amp; Graehl, 1998), where both handcrafted and data-driven transformation rules have been studied.
    However, the phoneme-based approaches are limited by two major constraints, which could compromise transliterating precision, especially in English-Chinese transliteration: 1) Latin-alphabet foreign names are of different orig
