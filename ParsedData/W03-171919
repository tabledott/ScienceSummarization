ficant differences between systems in most cases, a larger test set would allow even better statistics.
    In some cases, more training data will also be needed.
    Given the problems noted by some of the participants with some of the data, we would also like to see more consistently annotated training and test data, and test data that is more representative of what was seen in the training data.

    Finally, one question that we did not ask that should have been asked was whether the tested system is used as part of a commercial product or not.
    It is often believed of natural language and speech applications that deployed commercial systems are about a generation behind the systems being developed in research laboratories.
    It would be interesting to know if this is true in the domain of Chinese word segmentat
