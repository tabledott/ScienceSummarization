n not straightforwardly incorporate features pertaining to a segment itself, such as the average length of segments.
    Our model, on the other hand, can incorporate this information quite naturally.
    Suppose that the length of a segment follows a normal distribution , with a mean of and standard deviation of (Ponte and Croft, 1997).
    Then Equation (13) can be augmented to where .
    Equation (17) favors segments whose lengths are similar to the average length (in words).
    Another major difference from their algorithm is that our algorithm does not require training data to estimate probabilities, while their algorithm does.
    Therefore, our algorithm can be applied to domain-independent texts, while their algorithm is restricted to domains for which training data are available.
    It would be interesting, however, to compare our algorithm with their algorithm for the case when training data are available.
    In such a case, our model should be extended to incorporate various features such as th
