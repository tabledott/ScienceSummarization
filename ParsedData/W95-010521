word line; the goal is to see what sense the algorithm chooses when considering the word in the contexts of each of the Roget's Thesaurus classes in which it appears, where a &amp;quot;class&amp;quot; includes all the nouns in one of the numbered categories.7 The following list provides brief descriptions of the 25 senses of line in WordNet: Since line appears in 13 of the numbered categories in Roget's thesaurus, a full description of the values of co would be too large for the present paper.
    Indeed, showing all the nouns in the numbered categories would take up too much space: they average about 70 nouns apiece.
    Instead, I identify the numbered category, and give the three WordNet senses of line for which co was greatest.
    Qualitatively, the algorithm does a good job in most of the categories.
    The reader might find it an interesting exercise to try to decide which of the 25 senses he or she would choose, especially in the cases where the algorithm did less well (e.g. categories #200, #203, #4
