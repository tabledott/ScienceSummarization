 to regroup conjuncts.
    Of course, the regrouping of conjuncts requires a good alignment to begin with, and that requires a reasonable ordering of conjuncts in the training data, since the alignment model is sensitive to word order.
    This suggests an iterative algorithm in which a better grouping of conjuncts leads to a better alignment model, which guides further regrouping until convergence.
    We did not pursue this, as it is not needed in our experiments so far.
  
  
    In this section, we propose two methods for modeling the target MRL.
    This is motivated by the fact that many of the errors made by the A-WASP parser can be detected by inspecting the MR translations alone.
    Figure 7 shows some typical errors, which can be classified into two broad categories: 1.
    Type mismatch errors.
    For example, a state cannot possibly be a river (Figure 7(a)).
    Also it is awkward to talk about the population density of a state&#8217;s highest point (Figure 7(b)).
