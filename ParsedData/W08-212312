  REFERENCE CONSISTENCY.
  If there is a label R-X and the label is inside a relative clause, it must be preceded by a label X.
  3.3 Global SRL Model Toutanova et al.
  (2005) have showed that a global model that scores the complete predicate?
  argument structure can lead to substantial perfor- mance gains.
  We therefore created a global SRL classifier using the following global features in ad- dition to the features from the pipeline: CORE ARGUMENT LABEL SEQUENCE.
  The complete sequence of core argument labels.
  The sequence also includes the predicate and voice, for instance A0+break.01/Active+A1.
  MISSING CORE ARGUMENT LABELS.
  The set of core argument labels declared in the Prop- Bank/NomBank frame that are not present in the predicate?argument structure.
  Similarly to the syntactic submodel, we trained the global SRL model using the online passive?
  aggressive algorithm.
  The cost function ?
  was defined as the number of incorrect links in the predicate?argument structure.
  The numbe
