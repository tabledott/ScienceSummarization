in the return was not a repetition.
    The question of chain returns and when they can occur requires further research.
    When distances between relatable words are not tightly bound (as in the case of returns), the chances of incorrect chain linkages increase.
    It is anticipated that chain return analysis would become integrated with other text processing tools in order to prevent this.
    Also, we believe that chain strength analysis will be required for this purpose.
    Intuitively, some lexical chains are &amp;quot;stronger&amp;quot; than others, and possibly only strong chains can be returned to.
    There are three factors contributing to chain strength.
    Ideally, some combination of values reflecting these three factors should result in a chain strength value that can be useful in determining whether a chain is strong enough to be returned to.
    Also, a strong chain should be more likely to have a structural correspondence than a weak one.
    It seems likely that chains could contain part
