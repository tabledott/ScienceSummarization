handled by ODIE.
    Our previous study (Sekine and Nobata 03) found that about one third of randomly constructed similar newspaper article clusters are well-suited to be presented in table format, and another one third of the clusters can be acceptably expressed in table format.
    This suggests there is a big potential where an ODIE-type system can be beneficial.
  
  
    We demonstrated a new paradigm of Information Extraction technology and showed the potential of this method.
    However, there are problems to be solved to advance the technology.
    One of them is the coverage of the extracted information.
    Although we have created useful tables for some topics, there are event instances which are not found.
    This problem is mostly due to the inadequate performance of the language analyzers (information retrieval component, dependency analyzer or Extended NE tagger) and the lack of a coreference analyzer.
    Even though there are possible applications with limited coverage, it will be essential
