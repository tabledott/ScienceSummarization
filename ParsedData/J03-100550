 possible.
    Part of the reference sentences are obtained by correcting automatic translations of the test sentences that are produced using the approach presented in this article with different reordering constraints.
    The other part is produced from the source sentences without looking at any of their translations.
    The TEST-331 test set is used as held-out data for parameter optimization (for the language mode scaling factor and for the distortion model scaling factor).
    Furthermore, the beam search experiments in which the effect of the different pruning thresholds is demonstrated are carried out on the TEST-331 test set.
    TEST-147: The second, separate test set consists of 147 test sentences.
    Translation results are given in terms of mWER and SSER.
    No parameter optimization is carried out on the TEST-147 test set; the parameter values as obtained from the experiments on the TEST-331 test set are used.
