ely, the correct analysis is also the one with the lowest cost, so it is this analysis that is chosen.
    The method just described segments dictionary words, but as noted in Section 1, there are several classes of words that should be handled that are not found in a standard dictionary.
    One class comprises words derived by productive morphological processes, such as plural noun formation using the suffix ill men0.
    (Other classes handled by the current system are discussed in Section 5.)
    The morphological analysis itself can be handled using well-known techniques from finite-state morphology (Koskenniemi 1983; Antworth 1990; Tzoukermann and Liberman 1990; Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen 1992; Sproat 1992); we represent the fact that fl attaches to nouns by allowing c-transitions from the final states of all noun entries, to the initial state of the sub-WFST representing fl.
    However, for our purposes it is not sufficient to represent the morphological decomposition of, say, plural nouns: we also
