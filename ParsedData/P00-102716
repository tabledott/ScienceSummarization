viously correct ranking in these cases.
    The final alignment constraint that we pursued was based on the pigeonhole principle.
    This principle suggests that for a given part of speech, a root should not have more than one inflection nor should multiple inflections in the same part of speech share the same root.
    There are, of course, exceptions to this tendency, such as travelled/traveled and dreamed! dreamt, which are observed as variant forms of their respected roots.
    71n addition to the consensus similarity score in subcolumn 2, subcolumn 3 shows the average of the ranks of the candidate root given the inflection and the ranks of the candidate inflection given the root.
    This bidirectional average ranking score favors cases where attraction between root and inflection is mutual, and disfavors cases where higher ranked competition exists for a root's attentions, effectively capturing a weak form of the pigeonhole principle.
    Thus it was used as the primary ranking criteria (over raw simil
