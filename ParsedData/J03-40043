, a large proportion of word tokens do not fall at these slots.
    There has been some work looking at other slots (Resnik 1997), and on using nominal arguments as disambiguators for verbs (Federici, Montemagni, and Pirrelli 1999; Agirre and Martinez 2001), but the problem of coverage remains.
    Selectional preferences can be used for WSD in combination with other knowledge sources (Stevenson and Wilks 2001), but there is a need to ascertain when they work well so that they can be utilized to their full advantage.
    This article is aimed at quantifying the disambiguation performance of automatically acquired selectional preferences in regard to nouns, verbs, and adjectives with respect to a standard test corpus and evaluation setup (SENSEVAL-2) and to identify strengths and weaknesses.
    Although there is clearly a limit to coverage using preferences alone, because preferences are acquired only with respect to specific grammatical roles, we show that when dealing with running text, rather than isolated
