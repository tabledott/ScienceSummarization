ut the classifier outputs animal.
			Our feature sensors fail to determine that the focus of the question is ?speed?.
			This example illustrates the necessity of identifying the question focus by analyzing syntactic structures.
			What do you call a professional map drawer ? The classifier returns other entities instead ofequivalent term.
			In this case, both classes are ac ceptable.
			The ambiguity causes the classifier not to output equivalent term as the first choice.
	
	
			This paper presents a machine learning approach to question classification.
			We developed a hierarchicalclassifier that is guided by a layered semantic hierarchy of answers types, and used it to classify questions into fine-grained classes.
			Our experimental re sults prove that the question classification problemcan be solved quite accurately using a learning ap proach, and exhibit the benefits of features based on semantic analysis.
			In future work we plan to investigate further the application of deeper semantic analysis (in
