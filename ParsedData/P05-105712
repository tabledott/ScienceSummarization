 and N(eT) is the frequency of eT in the development corpus.
  
  
    We use a greedy search algorithm to search the alignment with highest probability in the space of all possible alignments.
    A state in this space is a partial alignment.
    A transition is defined as the addition of a single link to the current state.
    Our start state is the empty alignment, where all words in e and f are assigned to null.
    A terminal state is a state in which no more links can be added to increase the probability of the current alignment.
    Our task is to find the terminal state with the highest probability.
    We can compute gain, which is a heuristic function, instead of probability for efficiency.
    A gain is defined as follows: exp[EMm= 1 &#955;mhm(a, e, f)] where l = (i, j) is a link added to a.
    The greedy search algorithm for general loglinear models is formally described as follows: Input: e, f, eT, fT, and D Output: a The above search algorithm, however, is not efficient for our log-linear model
