ch of these constraints and compare the resulting translation hypotheses.
    The experiments will show that the baseline ITG constraints are not sufficient on the Canadian Hansards task.
    Therefore, we present an extension to the ITG constraints.
    These extended ITG constraints increase the alignment coverage from about 87% to 96%.
  
  
    In statistical machine translation, we are given a source language (&#8216;French&#8217;) sentence fJ1 = f1 ... fj ... fJ, which is to be translated into a target language (&#8216;English&#8217;) sentence eI1 = e1 ... ei ... eI.
    Among all possible target language sentences, we will choose the sentence with the highest probability: The decomposition into two knowledge sources in Eq.
    2 is the so-called source-channel approach to statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1990).
    It allows an independent modeling of target language model Pr(eI1) and translation model Pr(fJ1 |eI1).
    The target language model describes the well-formedness of the target
