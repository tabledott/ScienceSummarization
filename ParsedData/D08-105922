    Row &#8220;Duan 2007&#8221; represents the transition-based model from Duan et al. (2007), which applies beamsearch to the deterministic model from Yamada and Matsumoto (2003), and achieved the previous best accuracy on the data.
    Our observations on parsing Chinese are essentially the same as for English.
    Our combined parser outperforms both the pure graph-based and the pure transition-based parsers.
    It gave the best accuracy we are aware of for dependency parsing using CTB.
  
  
    Our graph-based parser is derived from the work of McDonald and Pereira (2006).
    Instead of performing exact inference by dynamic programming, we incorporated the linear model and feature templates from McDonald and Pereira (2006) into our beam-search framework, while adding new global features.
    Nakagawa (2007) and Hall (2007) also showed the effectiveness of global features in improving the accuracy of graph-based parsing, using the approximate Gibbs sampling method and a reranking approach, respectivel
