  Cascaded Grammatical Relation Assignment
  
    In this paper we discuss cascaded Memory- Based grammatical relations assignment.
    In the first stages of the cascade, we find chunks of several types (NP,VP,ADJP,ADVP,PP) and label them with their adverbial function (e.g. local, temporal).
    In the last stage, we assign grammatical relations to pairs of chunks.
    We studied the effect of adding several levels to this cascaded classifier and we found that even the less performing chunkers enhanced the performance of the relation finder.
  
  
    When dealing with large amounts of text, finding structure in sentences is often a useful preprocessing step.
    Traditionally, full parsing is used to find structure in sentences.
    However, full parsing is a complex task and often provides us with more information then we need.
    For many tasks detecting only shallow structures in a sentence in a fast and reliable way is to be preferred over full parsing.
    For example, in information retrieval it can
