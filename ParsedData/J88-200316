f a present reference time that the process in question began at some earlier time and has not yet stopped: 14.
    The president is speaking.
    If the input to a progressive is atomic then by definition it cannot be described as ongoing.
    However, as was noted in the introduction, it may be coerced into a process by being iterated, as in 15.
    Harry is hiccupping.
    There is another route through the network in Figure 2, where the point is coerced into a culmination, i.e., as constituting an atomic event that does have consequences associated with it.
    In this case, the interpretation for (15) parallels the one given for Harry was reaching the top, below.
    However, this particular example is deliberately chosen in order to make that interpretation unlikely.
