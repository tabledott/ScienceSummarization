ind the minimum-cost segmentation or maximum-probability segmentation as follows: Step 2.
    Find the minimum-cost path from to .
    Algorithms for finding the minimum-cost path in a graph are well known.
    An algorithm that can provide a solution for Step 2 will be a simpler version of the algorithm used to find the maximumprobability solution in Japanese morphological analysis (Nagata, 1994).
    Therefore, a solution can be obtained by applying a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm.4 DP algorithms have also been used for text segmentation by other researchers (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Heinonen, 1998).
    The path thus obtained represents the minimum-cost segmentation in when edges correspond with segments.
    In Figure 1, for example, if is the minimum-cost path, then is the minimum-cost segmentation.
    The algorithm automatically determines the number of segments.
    But the number of segments can also be specified explicitly by specifying the number of edges in the minimum-cost path.
