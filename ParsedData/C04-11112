 runs in O(n), where n is the number of sentences.
			In semantic hierarchies such as WordNet (Miller 1990), an is-a relation between two words x and y represents a subordinate relationship (i.e. x is more specific than y).
			Many algorithms have recently been proposed to automatically mine is-a (hypo nym/hypernym) relations between words.
			Here, we focus on is-a relations that are characterized by the questions ?What/Who is X??
			For example, Table 2 shows a sample of 10 is-a relations discovered by the algorithms presented in this paper.
			In this table, we call azalea, tiramisu, and Winona Ryder in stances of the respective concepts flower, dessert and actress.
			These kinds of is-a relations would be useful for various purposes such as ontology con struction, semantic information retrieval, question answering, etc. The main contribution of this paper is a comparison of the quality of our pattern-based and co occurrence models as a function of processing time and corpus size.
			Also, the paper lays
