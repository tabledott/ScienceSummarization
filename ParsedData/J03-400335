    This is a problem for the subcategorization probabilities in models 2 and 3: The probability of having zero subjects, Pl,({}  |S, VP, verb), will be fairly high because of this.
    In addition, sentences with and without subjects appear in quite different syntactic environments.
    For these reasons we modify the nonterminal for sentences without subjects to be SG (see figure 11).
    The resulting model has a cleaner division of subcategorization: Pl,({NP-C}  |S, VP, verb) ,: 1 and Pl,({NP-C}  |SG, VP, verb) = 0.
    The model will learn probabilistically the environments in which S and SG are likely to appear.
    As a final step, we use the rule concerning punctuation introduced in Collins (1996) to impose a constraint as follows.
    If for any constituent Z in the chart Z &#8594; &lt;..X Y..&gt; two of its children X and Y are separated by a comma, then the last word in Y must be directly followed by a comma, or must be the last word in the sentence.
    In training data 96% of commas
