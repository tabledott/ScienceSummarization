ly, or by self-training on raw corpus in a similar approach to that of McClosky (2006)?
    In addition, all knowledge sources we used in the core perceptron and the outside-layer linear model come from the training corpus, whereas many open knowledge sources (lexicon etc.) can be used to improve performance (Ng and Low, 2004).
    How can we utilize these knowledge sources effectively?
    We will investigate these problems in the following work.
