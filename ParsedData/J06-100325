y restoring network edges to their dominant role in similarity com- putations, and using corpus statistics as a secondary, corrective factor.
  A complete exegesis of their work is presented by Budanitsky (1999); here we summarize only their conclusions.
  In the framework of the IS-A hierarchy, Jiang and Conrath postulated that the semantic distance of the link connecting a child-concept c to its parent-concept par(c) is proportional to the conditional probability p(c | par(c)) of encountering an instance of c given an instance of par(c).
  More specifically, distJC(c, par(c)) = ?
  log p(c | par(c)) (10) By definition, p(c | par(c)) = p(c&amp;par(c)) p(par(c)) (11) 21 Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 1 If we adopt Resnik?s scheme for assigning probabilities to concepts (Section 2.6.1), then p(c&amp;par(c)) = p(c), since any instance of a child is automatically an instance of its parent.
  Then, p(c|par(c)) = p(c) p(par(c)) (12) and, recalling the definition of information content, distJC(c, par(c
