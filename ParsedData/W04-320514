imate Sp(V1,V2) using: *narrow- and broad- similarity overlap in their coverage and are treated as a single category, similarity, when postprocessed.
    Narrow similarity tests for rare patterns and hitsest for it had to be approximated rather than estimated from the smaller corpus.
    Note that our patterns specify the tense of the verbs they accept.
    When instantiating these patterns, we conjugate as needed.
    For example, &amp;quot;both Xed and Yed&amp;quot; instantiates on sing and dance as &amp;quot;both sung and danced&amp;quot;.
    In this section, we describe how the presence of a semantic relation is detected.
    We test the relations with patterns exemplified in Table 2.
    We adopt an approach inspired by mutual information to measure the strength of association, denoted Sp(V1, V2), between three entities: a verb pair V1 and V2 and a lexico-syntactic pattern p: As a result of tuning the system on a tuning set of 50 verb pairs, = 8.5.
    Additional test for asymmetric relations.
