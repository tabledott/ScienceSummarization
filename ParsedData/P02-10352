    The approach presented in this paper is a first attempt to scale up stochastic parsing systems based on linguistically fine-grained handcoded grammars to the UPenn Wall Street Journal (henceforth WSJ) treebank (Marcus et al., 1994).
    The problem of grammar coverage, i.e. the fact that not all sentences receive an analysis, is tackled in our approach by an extension of a fullfledged Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) and a constraint-based parser with partial parsing techniques.
    In the absence of a complete parse, a socalled &#8220;FRAGMENT grammar&#8221; allows the input to be analyzed as a sequence of well-formed chunks.
    The set of fragment parses is then chosen on the basis of a fewest-chunk method.
    With this combination of full and partial parsing techniques we achieve 100% grammar coverage on unseen data.
    Another goal of this work is the best possible exploitation of the WSJ treebank for discriminative estimation of an exponential model on LFG parses.
