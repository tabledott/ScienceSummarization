not derive from the abstract N, since it remains unchanged before labials (c.f. unperturbable).
    Thus the results of inverting this rule must include undecipherable for undecipherable but iNdecipherable for indecipherable so that each of them can match properly against the lexicon.
    While inverting a rule may sometimes produce alternative outputs, there are also situations in which no output is produced.
    This happens when an obligatory rule is inverted on a string that it could not have generated.
    For example, iNput cannot be generated by Rule 1 because the N precedes a labial and therefore would obligatorily be converted to m. There is therefore no output when Rule 1 is inverted on iNput.
    However, when Rule 2 is inverted on input, it does produce iNput as one of its results.
    The effect of then inverting Rule 1 is to remove the ambiguity produced by inverting Rule 2, leaving only the unchanged input to be matched against the lexicon.
    More generally, if recognition is carried out by t
