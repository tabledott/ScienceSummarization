, Q rewrites a pair of nonterminals in both languages, where &#945; and Q are the source and target side components, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonterminal occurrences in &#945; and the nonterminal occurrences in Q.
    For example, the following rule captures the swapping of VP and PP between Chinese (source) and English (target).
    We will use the following example from Chinese to English for both systems described in this section: y&#711;u Sh&#175;al&#180;ong j&#711;uxing le huit&#180;an with Sharon hold [past] meeting &#8216;held a meeting with Sharon&#8217; A typical phrase-based decoder generates partial target-language outputs in left-to-right order in the form of hypotheses (Koehn, 2004).
    Each hypothesis has a coverage vector capturing the source-language words translated so far, and can be extended into a longer hypothesis by a phrase-pair translating an uncovered segment.
    This process can be formalized as a deductive system.
    For example, the following deductio
