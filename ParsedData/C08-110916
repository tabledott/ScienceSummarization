			(Izumi etal., 2003) and (Izumi et al, 2004) used an ME ap proach to classify different grammatical errors in transcripts of Japanese interviews.
			They do not present performance of prepositions specifically, but overall performance for the 13 error types they target reached 25% precision and 7% recall.(Eeg-Olofsson and Knuttson, 2003) created a rule based approach to detecting preposition errors in Swedish language learners (unlike the approaches presented here, which focus on English languagelearners), and their system performed at 25% ac curacy.

			While their perfor mance results are quite high, 88% precision and 868 78% recall, it should be noted that their evaluation was on a small corpus with a highly constraineddomain, and focused on a limited number of prepo sitions, thus making direc
