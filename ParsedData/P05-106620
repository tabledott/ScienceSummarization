so used human judgements of translation quality to evaluate the effectiveness of the reordering rules.
    We randomly selected 100 sentences from the test corpus where the English reference translation was between 10 and 20 words in length.'
    For each of these 100 translations, we presented the two annotators with three translations: the reference (human) translation, the output from the baseline system, and the output from the system with reordering.
    No indication was given as to which system was the baseline system, and the ordering in which the baseline and reordered translations were presented was chosen at random on each example, to prevent ordering effects in the annotators&#8217; judgements.
    For each example, we asked each of the annotators to make one of two choices: 1) an indication that one translation was an improvement over the other; or 2) an indication that the translations were of equal quality.
    Annotator 1 judged 40 translations to be improved by the reordered model; 40 transla
