etter labels by itself, giving an experiment similar to that of Pereira and Schabes (1992).
    645 part of speech tags, 27 phrasal categories and the 26 intermediate symbols which were added during binarization Because EM is a local search method, it is likely to converge to different local maxima for different runs.
    In our case, the variance is higher for models with few subcategories; because not all dependencies can be expressed with the limited number of subcategories, the results vary depending on which one EM selects first.
    As the grammar size increases, the important dependencies can be modeled, so the variance decreases.
    It is clear from all previous work that creating more latent annotations can increase accuracy.
    On the other hand, oversplitting the grammar can be a serious problem, as detailed in Klein and Manning (2003).
    Adding subsymbols divides grammar statistics into many bins, resulting in a tighter fit to the training data.
    At the same time, each bin gives a less robu
