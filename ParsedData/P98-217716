s (using the full sentence context); one set consisted of all ambiguous prepositional phrase attachments of the form (v, n,p, n2), and the other set consisted of cases where p = con.
    For testing our classifier, we used only those judgments on which all three annotators agreed.
    The performance of the classifiers Clbigram, dinterp) and c/base, when trained and tested on Spanish language data, are shown in Table 6.
    The Spanish test set has fewer ambiguous prepositions than the English test set, as shown by the accuracy of Ciba&#8222;.
    However, the accuracy improvements of Clbygrara over Cl ba&#8222; are statistically significant for both test sets.5
  
  
    The unsupervised algorithm for prepositional phrase attachment presented here is the only algorithm in the published literature that can significantly outperform the baseline without using data derived from a treebank or parser.
    The accuracy of our technique approaches the accuracy of the best supervised methods, and does so with only a
