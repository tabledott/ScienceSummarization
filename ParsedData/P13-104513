es for a given sentence xi is defined as Y (xi) and the correct tree for a sentence is yi.
    We first define a structured margin loss A(yi, &#710;y) for predicting a tree y&#710; for a given correct tree.
    The loss increases the more incorrect the proposed parse tree is (Goodman, 1998).
    The discrepancy between trees is measured by counting the number of nodes N(y) with an incorrect span (or label) in the proposed tree: We set &#954; = 0.1 in all experiments.
    For a given set of training instances (xi, yi), we search for the function g&#952;, parameterized by &#952;, with the smallest expected loss on a new sentence.
    It has the following form: where the tree is found by the Compositional Vector Grammar (CVG) introduced below and then scored via the function s. The higher the score of a tree the more confident the algorithm is that its structure is correct.
    This max-margin, structureprediction objective (Taskar et al., 2004; Ratliff et al., 2007; Socher et al., 2011b) trains the CVG so that
