sentiment classifiers by assuming that paf,r,z is equal for all the local topics, which effectively ignores the topic model.
    Then we use the estimated parameters within the topic model.9 Secondly, we modify the sampling algorithm.
    The conditional probability used in sampling, expression (2), is proportional to the product of two factors.
    The first factor, d,i &#65533;v,r,z, expresses a preference for topics likely from the co-occurrence information, whereas the second d,i one, pr,z, favors the choice of topics which are predictive of the observable sentiment ratings.
    We used (pd,i r,z)1+0.sstq in the sampling distribution instead of pr,z, where t is the iteration number. q was chosen to be 4, though the quality of the topics seemed to be indistinguishable with any q between 3 and 10.
    This can be thought of as having 1 + 0.95tq ratings instead of a single vector assigned to each review, i.e., focusing the model on prediction of the ratings rather than finding the topic labels which are good
