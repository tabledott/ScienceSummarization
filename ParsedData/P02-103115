 an additional VP node to appear in our path feature.
    We tried two variations of the path feature to address this problem.
    The first collapses sequences of nodes with the same label, for example combining rows 2 and 3 of Table 3.
    The second variation uses only two values for the feature: NP under S (subject position), and NP under VP (object position).
    Neither variation improved performance in the known boundary condition.
    As a gauge of how closely the Propbank argument labels correspond to the path feature overall, we note that by always assigning the most common role for each path, for example always assigning ARG0 to the subject position, and using no other features, we obtain the correct role 69.4% of the time, vs. 82.3% for the complete system.
  
  
    Many recent information extraction systems for limited domains have relied on finite-state systems that do not build a full parse tree for the sentence being analyzed.
    Among such systems, (Hobbs et al., 1997) built finite-state re
