utomatic POS tagging and parsing of the data.
    The data for half of the verbs in each class was subject to manual scrutiny, after initial automatic processing.
    The rest of the data was produced fully automatically.
    The verbs were classified automatically using the four features.
    The accuracy of automatic classification was 52% using all four features, compared to a baseline of 33%.
    The best result was obtained using a combination of three features.
    This gave an accuracy of 66%.
    McCarthy and Korhonen (1998) proposed a method for identifying asAs using MDL.
    This method relied on an estimation of the cost of using Tcms to encode the argument head data at a target slot.
    The sum of the costs for the two target slots was compared to the cost of a TCM for encoding the union of the argument head data over the two slots.
    Results are reported for the causative alternation with 15 verbs.
    This method depends on there being similar quantities of data at the alternating slots, oth
