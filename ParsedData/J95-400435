earn rules for tagging unknown words, and 600,000 words were used to learn contextual rules; 243 rules were learned for tagging unknown words, and 447 contextual tagging rules were learned.
    Unknown word accuracy on the test corpus was 82.2%, and overall tagging accuracy on the test corpus was 96.6%.
    To our knowledge, this is the highest overall tagging accuracy ever quoted on the Penn Treebank Corpus when making the open vocabulary assumption.
    Using the tagger without lexicalized rules, an overall accuracy of 96.3% and an unknown word accuracy of 82.0% is obtained.
    A graph of accuracy as a function of transformation number on the test set for lexicalized rules is shown in figure 7.
    Before applying any transformations, test set accuracy is 92.4%, so the transformations reduce the error rate by 50% over the baseline.
    The high baseline accuracy is somewhat misleading, as this includes the tagging of unambiguous words.
    Baseline accuracy when the words that are unambiguous in our lexico
