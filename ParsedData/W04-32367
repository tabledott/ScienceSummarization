221;, the last character of W is assigned tag &#8220;e&#8221;, and the intervening characters are assigned tag &#8220;m&#8221;.
    (If W is a single-character word, then the single character is assigned &#8220;s&#8221;.)
    In this way, the dynamic programming algorithm only considers valid tag sequences, and we are also able to make use of the W0 C0 feature during testing.
    After word segmentation is done by the maximum entropy classifier, a post-processing step is applied to correct inconsistently segmented words made up of 3 or more characters.
    A word W is defined to be inconsistently segmented if the concatenation of 2 to 6 consecutive words elsewhere in the segmented output document matches W. In the post-processing step, the segmentation of the characters of these consecutive words is changed so that they are segmented as a single word.
    To illustrate, if the concatenation of 2 consecutive words &#8220;&#24052;&#36187; &#32599;&#32435;&#8221; in the segmented output document matches another
