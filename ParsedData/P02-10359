he parser builds one S chunk and then one TOKEN for the stranded preposition.
    A final capability of XLE that increases coverage of the standard-plus-fragment grammar is a SKIMMING technique.
    Skimming is used to avoid timeouts and memory problems.
    When the amount of time or memory spent on a sentence exceeds a threshhold, XLE goes into skimming mode for the constituents whose processing has not been completed.
    When XLE skims these remaining constituents, it does a bounded amount of work per subtree.
    This guarantees that XLE finishes processing a sentence in a polynomial amount of time.
    In parsing section 23, 7.2% of the sentences were skimmed; 26.1% of these resulted in full parses, while 73.9% were FRAGMENT parses.
    The grammar coverage achieved 100% of section 23 as unseen unlabeled data: 74.7% as full parses, 25.3% FRAGMENT and/or SKIMMED parses.
  
  
    We employed the well-known family of exponential models for stochastic disambiguation.
