xi l iary trees.
  They can represent constituents which ar e adjuncts to basic struc- tures (adverbial).
  They can also represent basic senten- tial structures corresponding to verbs or predicates taking sentential complements.
  Auxiliary trees (see right tree in Figure 2) are characterized as follows: ?
  internal nodes are labeled by non-terminals; ?
  leaf nodes are labeled by terminals or by non-terminal nodes to be substituted except for exactly one node (called the foot node) labeled by a non-terminal on which only adjunction can apply; furthermore the la- bel of the foot node is the same as the label of the root node.
  Initial ~:  Auxiliary ~c~: $ ; ; substitution nodes Figure 2: Schematic initial and auxiliaxy trees The trees in L are called lexical trees.
  They repre- sent basic categories or constituents which serve as argu- ments, to initial or auxiliary trees.
  They are reduced to a pre-terminal node in the case of simple categories or are expanded into tree structures in the case 0f compoun
