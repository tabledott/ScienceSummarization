 basic assumptions that will figure prominently in my suggestions for a lexical semantics framework.
    The first is that, without an appreciation of the syntactic structure of a language, the study of lexical semantics is bound to fail.
    There is no way in which meaning can be completely divorced from the structure that carries it.
    This is an important methodological point, since grammatical distinctions are a useful metric in evaluating competing semantic theories.
    The second point is that the meanings of words should somehow reflect the deeper, conceptual structures in the system and the domain it operates in.
    This is tantamount to stating that the semantics of natural language should be the image of nonlinguistic conceptual organizing principles (whatever their structure).
    Computational lexical semantics should be guided by the following principles.
    First, a clear notion of semantic well-formedness will be necessary to characterize a theory of possible word meaning.
    This may en
