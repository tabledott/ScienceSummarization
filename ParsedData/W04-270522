feature encoded in the lexical entry for possible (derived from the corresponding adjverb possibly).
    Discrepancies between these procedures and the annotator are resolved on a case by case basis.
    If the dictionary is wrong, the dictionary should be changed, e.g., root, as in root cause was added to the dictionary as a potential MNR adjective with a meaning like the adverb basically.
    However, if the annotator is wrong, the annotation should be changed, e.g., if an annotator marked &#8220;slow&#8221; as a ARGM-TMP, the program would let them know that it should be a ARGMMNR.
    This process both helps with annotation accuracy and enriches our lexical database.
    We used other procedures to detect errors including: Nom-type Argument nominalizations are nominalizations that play the role of one of the arguments in the ROLESET.
    Thus the word acquirer should be assigned the ARG0 role in the following example because acquirer is a subject nominalization: REL = acquirer, ARG0 = acquirer, ARG1 = of
