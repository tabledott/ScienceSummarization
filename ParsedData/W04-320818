    We found that the IBM Model 4 EM learning performs much worse on TDT3 data.
    Figure 3 shows that the EM learner performs about 30% worse on average on the TDT3 data.
    Since the IBM model parameters can be better estimated if the input sentences are more parallel, we have tried to add parallel sentences to the extracted sentence pairs in each iteration step, as proposed by Zhao and Vogel (2002).
    However, our experiments showed that adding parallel corpus gives no improvement on the final output.
    This is likely due to (1) the parallel corpus is not in the same domain as the TDT corpus; and (2) there are simply not enough parallel sentences extracted at each step for the reliable estimation of model parameters.

    Bootstrapping is significantly more useful than new word translations for mining parallel sentences It is important for us to gauge the effects of the two main ideas in our algorithm, Bootstrapping and EM lexicon learning, on the extraction paralle
