create a mapping between the xcomp unsaturated VP complement Kim thought of leaving (xcomp thought of) (xcomp of leaving) ccomp saturated clausal complement Kim asked about him playing rugby (ccomp asked about) (ccomp about him) (ncsubj playing him ) (dobj playing rugby) ta textual adjunct delimited He made the discovery: (ta colon discovery was) by punctuation Kim was the abbot CCG dependencies and the GRs.
    This involved mapping each argument slot in the 425 lexical categories in the CCG lexicon onto a GR.
    In the second stage, the GRs created for a particular sentence&#8212;by applying the mapping to the parser output&#8212;were passed through a Python script designed to correct some of the obvious remaining differences between the CCG and GR representations.
    In the process of performing the transformation we encountered a methodological problem: Without looking at examples it was difficult to create the mapping and impossible to know whether the two representations were converging.
