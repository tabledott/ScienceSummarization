ID/LP grammars (Shieber, 1984), in which word-order variations would be accommodated by the parser, and related ideas for generation of free word-order languages in the TAG framework (Joshi, 1987).
    Our work differs from the ID/LP work in several important respects.
    First, we are not merely parsing, but translating with a bigram language model.
    Also, of course, we are dealing with
  
  
    The algorithm above was tested in the SILC translation system.
    The translation lexicon was largely constructed by training on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus, which consists of governmental transcripts.
    The corpus was sentence-aligned statistically (Wu, 1994); Chinese words and collocations were extracted (Fung and Wu, 1994; Wu and Fung, 1994); then translation pairs were learned via an EM procedure (Wu and Xia, 1995).
    The resulting English vocabulary is approximately 6,500 words and the Chinese vocabulary is approximately 5,500 words, with a many-to-many translation mapping avera
