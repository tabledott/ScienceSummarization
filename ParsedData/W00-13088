are true for more than the corresponding threshold number of histories in the training data are included in the model.
    The feature templates in Ratnaparkhi (1996) that were left out were the ones that look at the previous word, the word two positions before the current, and the word two positions after the current.
    These features are of the same form as template 4 in Table 1, but they look at words in different positions.
    Our motivation for leaving these features out was the results from some experiments on successively adding feature templates.
    Adding template 4 to a model that incorporated the general feature templates 1 to 3 only and the rare feature templates 5-8 significantly increased the accuracy on the development set &#8212; from 96.0% to 96.52%.
    The addition of a feature template that looked at the preceding word and the current tag to the resulting model slightly reduced the accuracy.
    The model was trained and tested on the part-ofspeech tagged WSJ section of the Penn Treeba
