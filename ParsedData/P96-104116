eline method on these corpora, as measured by difference in entropy.
    In the graphs on the left of Figures 2-4, each point represents an average over ten runs; the error bars represent the empirical standard deviation over these runs.
    Due to resource limitations, we only performed multiple runs for data sets of 50,000 sentences or less.
    Each point on the graphs on the right represents a single run, but we consider sizes up to the amount of data available.
    The graphs on the bottom of Figures 3-4 are close-ups of the graphs above, focusing on those algorithms that perform better than the baseline.
    To give an idea of how these cross-entropy differences translate to perplexity, each 0.014 bits correspond roughly to a 1% change in perplexity.
    In each run except as noted below, optimal values for the parameters of the given technique were searched for using Powell's search algorithm as realized in Numerical Recipes in C (Press et al., 1988, pp.
    309-317).
    Parameters were chosen to opti
