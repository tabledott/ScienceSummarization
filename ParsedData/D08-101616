by increasing the number of messages to update.
    We believe this is a compelling advantage over dynamic programming&#8212;in which new factors usually increase the runtime and space multiplicatively by exploding the number of distinct items.10 But how long does updating each message take?
    The runtime of summing over all assignments EA in 10For example, with unknown tags T, a model with PTREE+TAGLINK will take only O(n3 + n2g2) time for BP, compared to O(n3g2) time for dynamic programming (Eisner &amp; Satta 1999).
    Adding TRIGRAM, which is string-local rather than tree-local, will increase this only to O(n3 + n2g2 + ng3), compared to O(n3g6) for dynamic programming.
    Even more dramatic, adding the SIB family of O(n3) PAIRij,ik factors will add only O(n3) to the runtime of BP (Table 1).
    By contrast, the runtime of dynamic programming becomes exponential, because each item must record its headword&#8217;s full set of current children. equation (4) may appear prohibitive.
    Crucially, however,
