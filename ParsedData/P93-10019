lect the fact that the former dataset was relatively more difficult than the latter for the class of alignment methods that they were evaluating.
    Figure 2 plots f (x) as a function of x, where x is a byte position in the English text and f (x) is the corresponding byte position in the French text, as determined by char align.
    For comparison's sake, the plot also shows a straight line connecting the two endpoints of the file.
    Note that f (x) follows the straight line fairly closely, though there are small but important residuals, which may be easier to see in If the residuals are large, or if they show a sharp discontinuity, then it is very likely that the two texts don't match up in some way (e.g., a page/figure is missing or misplaced).
    We have used the residuals in this way to help translators catch potentially embarrassing errors of this kind.
    Figure 4 illustrates this use of the residuals for the European Parliamentary text presented in Figure 1.
    Note that the residuals have relati
