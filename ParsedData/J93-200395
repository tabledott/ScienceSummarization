 -y with -yk = 0 for all k. Equation (108) allows us to compute the counts -4(0 I e; f, e) in 0(//n + 0g) operations, where g is the number of partitions of 0.
    Although g grows with 0 like (400)-1 exp 7A/20/3 [11], it is manageably small for small 0.
    For example, 0 = 10 has 42 partitions.
    Proof of Formula (108).
    Introduce the generating functional where x is an indeterminant.
    Then To obtain Equation (113), rearrange the order of summation and sum over 0 to eliminate the 6-function of 0.
    To obtain Equation (114), note that 0, = Em1 6(i, a) and so i= x4).' flr X6(j'al).
    To obtain Equation (115), interchange the order of the sums on a] /-=-1 and the product on j.
    To obtain Equation (116), note that in the sum on a, the only term for which the power of x is nonzero is the one for which a = i.
    Now note that for any indeterminants x, yl, y2, , where zk = (-1) This follows from the calculation The reader will notice that the left-hand side of Equation (120) involves only powers of
