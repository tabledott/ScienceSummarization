ed into a single description which would, of course, not be canonical.
    Since all pairs are unifiable, the relation that they establish between sentences is entriely arbitrary.
    However, a third grammar can be written that unifies with these combined descriptions only if the sentences they describe in the two langauages stand in a certain relation to one another.
    The relation we are interested in is, of course, the translation relation which, for the purposes of the kind of experimantal system I have in mind I take to be definable even for isolated sentences.
    Such a transfer grammar can readily capture all the components of the translation relation that have in fact been built into translation systems: correspondences between words and continuous or discontinuous phrases, use of selectional features or local contexts, case frames, reordering rules, lexical functions, compositional semantics, and so on.
  
  
    In 'FUG, linguistic objects are represented by functional descriptions (FDs).
