mple 32.
    In fact, this analysis explains why it is that only process verbs participate in the resultative construction, and why the resultant phrase (the adjectival phrase) must be a subset of the states, namely, stage-level event predicates.
    Because the meaning of the sentence in 32 is determined by both function application of hammer to its arguments and function application of flat to the event-type of the verb, this is an example of cocompositionality (cf.
    Pustejovsky [forthcoming] for discussion).
    Having discussed some of the behavior of logical polysemy in verbs, let us continue our discussion of lexical ambiguity with the issue of metonymy.
    Metonymy, where a subpart or related part of an object &amp;quot;stands for&amp;quot; the object itself, also poses a problem for standard denotational theories of semantics.
    To see why, imagine how our semantics could account for the &amp;quot;reference shifts&amp;quot; of the complements shown in Example 33.16 Example 33 The complements of
