;quot; (e.g.
    SYNONYMY, GLOSS); and (b) shorter paths.
    For this purpose we assign the following weights to each relation considered: W(SYNONYM) = 1.0; w(IS-A) = 0.9; w(GLoss) = 0.9; w(IN-GLoss) = 0.3; w(HAs-PART) = 0.7; w(MoRPHo-DERIVATION) = 0.6; and W(COLLIDESENSE) = 0.5.
    When computing the f2 factor, we assume that whenever at least two relations of the same kind repeat, we should consider the sequence of relations equivalent to a single relation, having the weight devided by the length of the sequence.
    If we denote by rir&#8222;i the number of different relation types encountered in a path, and rirsame(rel) denotes the number of links of type rel in a sequence, then we define f2 with the formula: *Factor h is a semantic measure operating on a conceptual space.
    When searching for a lexico-semantic path, a search space SS is created, which contains all WordNet content words that can be reached from the candidate antecedent or the anaphor in at most five combinations of the seven relations
