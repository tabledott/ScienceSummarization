ased on language-specific rules for constructing a similar words (SW) set for each analysis of a word.
    This set is composed of morphological variations of the word under the given analysis.
    For example, the Hebrew token &#1491;&#1500;&#1497; can be analyzed as either a noun (boy) or a verb (gave birth).
    The noun SW set for this token is composed of the definiteness and number inflections &#1501;&#1497;&#1491;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;,&#1501;&#1497;&#1491;&#1500;&#1497;,&#1491;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; (the boy, boys, the boys), while the verb SW set is composed of gender and tense inflections &#1493;&#1491;&#1500;&#1497;,&#1492;&#1491;&#1500;&#1497; (she/they gave birth).
    The approximated probability of each analysis is based on the corpus frequency of its SW set.

    Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2000) proposed a similar method for the unsupervised estimation of p(t|w) in English, relying on simple spelling features to characterize similar word clas
