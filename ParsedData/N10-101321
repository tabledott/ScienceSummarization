a given word, e.g. the &#8220;hurricane&#8221; sense of position in Figure 1.
    This notion is evaluated empirically by computing the correlation between the predicted similarity using the contextual multi-prototype method and human similarity judgements for different usages of the same word.
    The Usage Similarity (USim) data set collected in Erk et al. (2009) provides such similarity scores from human raters.
    However, we find no evidence for correlation between USim scores and their corresponding prototype similarity scores (p = 0.04), indicating that prototype vectors may not correspond well to human senses.
  
  
    Table 3 compares the inferred synonyms for several target words, generally demonstrating the ability of the multi-prototype model to improve the precision of inferred near-synonyms (e.g. in the case of singer or need) as well as its ability to include synonyms from less frequent senses (e.g., the experiment sense of research or the verify sense of prove).
    However, there are a numb
