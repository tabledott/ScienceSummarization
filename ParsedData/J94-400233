 exceed a parametrically specified value (the salience difference threshold) and (ii) the statistical score of C2 is significantly greater than that of C1, then RAPSTAT will substitute the former for the latter as the currently preferred candidate.
    If conditions (i) and (ii) do not hold, RAPSTAT confirms RAP's selection of C1 as the preferred antecedent.
    If these conditions do hold, then RAPSTAT selects C2 as the currently preferred candidate and proceeds to compare it with the next element of L. It repeats this procedure for each successive pair of candidates in L until either (i) or (ii) fails or the list is completed.
    In either case, the last currently preferred candidate is selected as the antecedent.
    An example of a case in which RAPSTAT overules RAP is the following.
