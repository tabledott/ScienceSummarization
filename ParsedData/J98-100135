ough this is certainly true for any concept hierarchy), and that they are so broad as to be of little use in establishing meaningful semantic categories.
    Nonetheless, thesauri provide a rich network of word associations and a set of semantic categories potentially valuable for language-processing work; however, Roget's and other thesauri have not been used extensively for WSD.9 WordNet combines the features of many of the other resources commonly exploited in disambiguation work: it includes definitions for individual senses of words within it, as in a dictionary; it defines &amp;quot;synsets&amp;quot; of synonymous words representing a single lexical concept, and organizes them into a conceptual hierarchy,1&#176; like a thesaurus; and it includes other links among words according to several semantic relations, including hyponymy/hyperonymy, antonymy, and meronymy.
