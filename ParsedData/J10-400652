    The cardinality of LDepDM is 796, including direct and inverse links.
    The weights assigned to the tuples by the scoring function &#963; are given by Local Mutual Information (LMI) computed on the raw corpus-derived word&#8211;link&#8211;word cooccurrence counts.
    Given the co-occurrence count Oijk of three elements of interest (in our case, the first word, the link, and the second word), and the corresponding expected count under independence Eijk, LMI = Oijk log Oijk Eijk .
    LMI is an approximation to the log-likelihood ratio measure that has been shown to be a very effective weighting scheme for sparse frequency counts (Dunning 1993; Pad&#180;o and Lapata 2007).
    The measure can also be interpreted as the dominant term of average MI or as a heuristic variant of pointwise MI to avoid its bias towards overestimating the significance of low frequency events, and it is nearly identical to the Poisson&#8211;Stirling measure (Evert 2005).
    LMI has considerable compu
