 system?s ability to assign a higher confi dence score to correct judgements than wrong ones (Dagan et al, 2005): after the n judgements are sorted in decreasing order by their confidence value, the following measure is computed: cws = 1 n n?
			i=1 #correct-up-rank-i i All evaluation measures are computed over the whole test set as well as on the 7 different subsets(CD, IE, etc.).
			The results are summarised in Table 1.
			We also computed precision, recall and F measure for both classes TRUE and FALSE and will discuss the results in the text whenever of interest.Experiment 2: Shallow Features In this experi ment only the shallow features (see Section 2) were used.
			The overall accuracy of 56.9% is significantly higher than the baseline.2Column 2 in Table 1 shows that this decent per formance is entirely due to excellent performanceon the CD subset.
			(Recall that the CD set was de signed explicitly with examples with high lexicaloverlap in mind.)
			In addition, the method overes timates the number of
