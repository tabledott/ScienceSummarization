 a generalization of previous algorithms that use the distributional hypothesis (Harris 1985) for finding similar words.
    Instead of applying the hypothesis to words, Lin and Pantel applied it to paths in dependency trees.
    Essentially, if two paths tend to link the same sets of words, they hypothesized that the meanings of the corresponding paths are similar.
    It is from paths of the form subject-verb-object that we extract our set of associated verb pairs.
    Hence, this paper is concerned only with relations between transitive verbs.
    A path, extracted from a parse tree, is an expression that represents a binary relation between two nouns.
    A set of paraphrases was generated for each pair of associated paths.
    For example, using a 1.5GB newspaper corpus, here are the 20 most associated paths to &amp;quot;X solves Y&amp;quot; generated by DIRT: This list of associated paths looks tantalizingly close to the kind of axioms that would prove useful in an inference system.
    However, DIRT on
