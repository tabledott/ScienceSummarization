 when the initial parallel corpus is very small, the amount of extracted data is also quite small.
    This is due to the low coverage of the dictionary learned from that corpus.
    Our candidate pair selection step (Section 2.2) discards pairs with too many unknown (or unrelated) words, according to the dictionary; thus, only few sentences fulfill the word-overlap condition of our filter.
    As mentioned in Section 1, our goal is to use the extracted data as additional MT training data and obtain better translation performance on a given in-domain MT test set.
    A simple way of estimating the usefulness of the data for this purpose is to measure its coverage of the test set, i.e., the percentage of running n-grams from the test corpus that are also in our corpus.
    Tables 3 and 4 present the coverage of our extracted corpora.
    For each initial corpus size, the first column shows the coverage of that initial corpus, and the second column shows the coverage of the initial corpus plus the extracted cor
