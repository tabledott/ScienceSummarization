ped to one of 50 pos sible classes (We call the set of all possible class labels for a given question a confusion set (Golding and Roth, 1999)).
			Our learned classifier is based on the SNoW learning architecture (Carlson et al, 1999; Roth, 1998)2 where, in order to allow the classifier to output more than one class label, wemap the classifier?s output activation into a condi tional probability of the class labels and threshold it.
			The question classifier makes use of a sequence of two simple classifiers (Even-Zohar and Roth, 2001), each utilizing the Winnow algorithm within SNoW.
			The first classifies questions into coarse classes (Coarse Classifier) and the second into fineclasses (Fine Classifier).
			A feature extractor automatically extracts the same features for each clas sifier.
			The second classifier depends on the first in2Freely available at http://L2R.cs.uiuc.edu/cogcomp/cc software.html ABBR, ENTITY,DESC,HUMAN,LOC,NUM ABBR, ENTITY ENTITY, HUMAN ENTITY, LOC,NUM DESC Coarse Classifier Fine C
