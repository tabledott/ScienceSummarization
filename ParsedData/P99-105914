ly define La for all a E VT to be minimal such that if (x, y) E L(H a), x' e Lx, y' E Ly, then x'ayi E La, where stands for the concatenation language Lai &#8226; &#8226; Lai,.
    Then H generates language L. We next present a simple construction that transforms a HAG H into a bilexical CFG G generating the same language.
    The construction also preserves derivation ambiguity.
    This means that for each string w, there is a lineartime 1-to-1 mapping between (appropriately de5 Alshawi (1996) describes HAs as accepting (or equivalently, generating) zi and z from the outside in.
    To make Figure 3 easier to follow, we have defined HAs as accepting symbols in the opposite order, from the inside out.
    This amounts to the same thing if transitions are reversed, I. is exchanged with F., and any transition probabilities are replaced by those of the reversed Markov chain. fined) canonical derivations of w by H and canonical derivations of w by G. We adopt the notation above for H and the components of its he
