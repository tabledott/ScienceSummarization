    Although the extracted system edit results in the same corrected sentence as the first gold-standard edit option, the system hypothesis was considered to be invalid.
    In this work, we propose a method, called MaxMatch (M2), to overcome this problem.
    The key idea is that if there are multiple possible ways to arrive at the same correction, the system should be evaluated according to the set of edits that matches the gold-standard as often as possible.
    To this end, we propose an algorithm for efficiently computing the set of phrase-level edits with the maximum overlap with the gold standard.
    The edits are subsequently scored using F1 measure.
    We test our method in the context of the HOO shared task and show that our method results in a more accurate evaluation for error correction.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the proposed method; Section 3 presents experimental results; Section 4 discusses some details of grammar co
