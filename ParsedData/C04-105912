ator: #wsum( 11 : tw , ?) The terms or nodes ( 1t ? nt ) contribute unequally to the final result according to the weight ( iw ) associated with each it . Ordered Distance Operator: #N( 1t ? nt ) The terms must be found within N words of each other in the text in order to contribute to the document's belief value.
			An n-gram phrase can be modeled as an ordered distance operator with N=n. Unordered Distance Operator: #uwN( 1t ? nt ) The terms contained must be found in any order within a window of N words in order for this operator to contribute to the belief value of the document.
			3.2 Structured Query Models.
			Given the representation power of the structured query language, the Top-1 hypothesis, Top-N Best hypothesis list, and the translation lattice can be converted into three Structured Query Models respectively.
			For first-best and n-best hypotheses, we collect related target n-grams of a given source word according to the alignments generated in the Viterbi decoding process.
