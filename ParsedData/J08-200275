    This is especially true when we model the dependencies with discriminative models capable of incorporating non-local features.
    We incorporated joint information by using two types of features: features of the complete sequence of argument labels and features modeling dependencies between the labels of arguments and syntactic features of other arguments.
    We showed that both types of features yielded significant performance gains over a state-of-the-art local model.
    For further improving performance in the presence of perfect syntactic parses, we see at least three promising avenues for improvement.
    First, one could improve the identification of argument nodes, by better handling of long-distance dependencies; for example, by incorporating models which recover the trace and null element information in Penn Treebank parse trees, as in Levy and Manning (2004).
    Second, it may be possible to improve the accuracy on modifier labels, by enhancing the knowledge about the semantic chara
