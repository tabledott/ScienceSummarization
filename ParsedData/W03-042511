talization do not work as well as in English, because all nouns are capitalized in German.
    For German, in addition to the entity lists provided, we also used a small gazetteer of names (4500 first and last names, 4800 locations in Germany and 190 countries), which was collected by browsing web pages in about two person-hours.
    The average classifier performance gain by using these features is about 1.5F for the testa data and about .6F for the testb data.
  
  
    In conclusion, we have shown results on a set of both well-established and novel classifier techniques which improve the overall performance, when compared with the best performing classifier, by 17-21% on the English task.
    For the German task, the improvement yielded by classifier combination is smaller.
    As a machine learning method, the RRM algorithm seems especially suited to handle additional feature streams, and therefore is a good candidate for classifier combination.
