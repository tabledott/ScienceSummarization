es involve a number of parameters.
    We believe the IR parameters are quite robust, and did not heavily focus on improving this stage, but the two clustering steps during template induction require parameters to control stopping conditions and word filtering.
    While all learning algorithms require parameters, we think it is important for future work to focus on removing some of these to help the algorithm be even more robust to new domains and genres.
