    'Non-constituent NP conjunction, which Treebank labels NX, is another example that still causes problems.

    These two kinds of chunk structure derived from the Treebank data were encoded as chunk tags attached to each word and provided the targets for the transformation-based learning.
  
  
    As shown in Fig.
    1, transformation-based learning starts with a supervised training corpus that specifies the correct values for some linguistic feature of interest, a baseline heuristic for predicting initial values for that feature, and a set of
