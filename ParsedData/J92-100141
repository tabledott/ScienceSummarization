so enables a system to make reasonable guesses about the syntactic and semantic identity of unknown words so that they do not prevent parsing (see Rau, Jacobs, and Zernik 1989).
    Once morphological analysis of a word is complete, the system retrieves (or derives) the corresponding senses and establishes initial semantic preferences for the primary senses.
    For example, by default, the sense of agree meaning 'to concur' (agree 1) is preferred over its other senses.
    The lexical entry for agree marks this preference by giving it : TYPE *primary* (see Figure 15).
    The entry also says that derivations (listed in the :S-DERIV field) agree1+ment and agree2-1-able are preferred, derivations agreel&#177;able and agree3+ment are deprecated, and all other sense-affix combinations (excepting inflections) have been disallowed.
    During morphological analysis, the system retrieves only the most general senses.
    It waits until the preprocessor or the parser identifies supporting evidence before it retrieve
