ds.
  Structurally they are characterized the same way as initial trees except hat they are not necessary rooted by S. As noted in Section 2, the major composition operation in TAGs is adjunct ion.
  We define subst i tut ion in TAGs to take place on spec- ified nodes on the frontiers of elementary trees.
  When a node is marked to be substituted, no adjunction can take place on that node.
  Furthermore , substitution is always mandatory.
  In case of substitution on a node labeled by S (sentential complement), only trees derived from initial trees (therefore rooted by S) can be substituted.
  In all other cases, any tree derived from a lexlcal tree rooted by the same label as the given node can be substituted.
  The resulting tree is obtained by replacing the node by the derived tree.
  Substitution is illustrated in Figure 3.
  We conventionally mark substitution odes by a down ar row (~).
  We define the tree set  of a TAG G, T(G) to be the set of all derived trees starting from initial trees in I. Further
