nslation we also face the problem of sparse data.
    Our aim is to use word classes in statistical machine translation to allow for more robust statistical translation models.
    A naive approach for doing this would be the use of mono-lingually optimized word classes in source and target language.
    Unfortunately we can not expect these independently optimized classes to be correspondent.
    Therefore mono-lingually optimized word classes do not seem to be useful for machine translation (see also (Fung and Wu, 1995)).
    We define bilingual word clustering as the process of forming corresponding word classes suitable for machine translation purposes for a pair of languages using a parallel training corpus.
    The described method to determine bilingual word classes is an extension and improvement of the method mentioned in (Och and Weber, 1998).
    Our approach is simpler and computationally more efficient than (Wang et al., 1996).
