al pragmatic research focusing on multi-party dialogs, such as dialog act (DA) classification.
    Most previous work in that area is limited to interaction between two speakers (e.g.
    Switchboard, (Stolcke et al., 2000)).
    When more than two speakers are involved, the question of who is the addressee of an utterance is crucial, since it generally determines what DAs are relevant after the addressee&#8217;s last utterance.
    So, knowledge about adjacency pairs is likely to help DA classification.
    In future work, we plan to extend our inference process to treat speaker ranking (i.e.
    AP identification) and agreement/disagreement classification as a single, joint inference problem.
    Contextual information about agreements and disagreements can also provide useful cues regarding who is the addressee of a given utterance.
    We also plan to incorporate acoustic features to increase the robustness of our procedure in the case where only speech recognition output is available.
