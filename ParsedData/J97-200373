rtant advantage of local determinization is that it can be applied to any transducer without restriction.
    Furthermore, local determinization also admits an on-the-fly implementation.
    New characterizations of rational functions shed new light on some aspects of the theory of finite-state transducers (Reutenauer and Schiitzenberger 1995).
    We have also offered a generalization of the operations we use based on the notions of semiring and power series, which help to simplify problems and algorithms used in various cases.
    In particular, the string semirirtg that we introduced makes it conceptually easier to describe many algorithms and properties.
    Subsequential transducers admit very efficient algorithms.
    The determinization and minimization algorithms in the case of string-to-weight transducers presented here complete a large series of algorithms that have been shown to give remarkable results in natural language processing.
    Sequential machines lead to useful algorithms in many other a
