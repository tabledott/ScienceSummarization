 requires practical testing.
    We have not yet carried out formal usability trials, nor investigated the design of feedback texts (e.g. how best to word the anchors), nor confirmed that adequate response times could be obtained for full-scale applications.
    However, if satisfactory large-scale implementations prove feasible, the method brings many potential benefits.
    &#8226; A document in natural language (possibly accompanied by diagrams) is the most flexible existing medium for presenting information.
    We cannot be sure that all meanings can be expressed clearly in network diagrams or other specialized presentations; we can be sure they can be expressed in a document.
    &#8226; It seems intuitively obvious that authors will understand feedback texts much better than they understand alternative methods of presenting knowledge bases, such as network diagrams.
    Our experience has been that people can learn to use the DRAFTERII system in a few minutes.
