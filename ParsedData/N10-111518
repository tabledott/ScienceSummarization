ncy parsing, we do not exclude punctuation marks from the evaluation.
    Results are presented in Table 2.
    Our nondirectional easy-first parser significantly outperforms the left-to-right greedy MALT parser in terms of accuracy and root prediction, and significantly outperforms both parsers in terms of exact match.
    The globally optimized MST parser is better in rootprediction, and slightly better in terms of accuracy.
    We evaluated the parsers also on the English dataset from the CoNLL 2007 shared task.
    While this dataset is also derived from the WSJ Treebank, it differs from the previous dataset in two important aspects: it is much smaller in size, and it is created using a different conversion procedure, which is more linguistically adequate.
    For these experiments, we use the dataset POS tags, and the same parameters as in the previous set of experiments: we train the nondirectional parser for 20 iterations, with the same feature set.
    The CoNLL dataset contains some nonprojective con
