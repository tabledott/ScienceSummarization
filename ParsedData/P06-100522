    &#8220;the audience turned up its nose at the performance,&#8221; such phrases are apparently quite rare in actual test sets.
  
  
    The noun-pronoun path coreference can be used directly as a feature in a pronoun resolution system.
    However, path coreference is undefined for cases where there is no path between the pronoun and the candidate noun &#8211; for example, when the candidate is in the previous sentence.
    Therefore, rather than using path coreference directly, we have features that are true if C(p) is above or below certain thresholds.
    The features are thus set when coreference between the pronoun and candidate noun is likely (a coreferent path) or unlikely (a non-coreferent path).
    We now evaluate the utility of path coreference within a state-of-the-art machine-learned resolution system for third-person pronouns with nominal antecedents.
    A standard set of features is used along with the bootstrapped gender/number, semantic comp
