tween two possible spin directions, and where electrons propagate their spin direction to neighbouring electrons until the system reaches a stable configuration.
    The authors equate terms with electrons and term orientation to spin direction.
    They build a neighbourhood matrix connecting each pair of terms if one appears in the gloss of the other, and iteratively apply the spin model on the matrix until a &#8220;minimum energy&#8221; configuration is reached.
    The orientation assigned to a term then corresponds to the spin direction assigned to electrons.
    The system of Kim and Hovy (2004) tackles orientation detection by attributing, to each term, a positivity score and a negativity score; interestingly, terms may thus be deemed to have both a positive and a negative correlation, maybe with different degrees, and some terms may be deemed to carry a stronger positive (or negative) orientation than others.
    Their system starts from a set of positive and negative seed terms, and expands the posit
