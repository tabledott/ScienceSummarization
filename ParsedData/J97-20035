llowing sections, we give an extended description of these devices.
    We first consider string-to-string transducers, which have been successfully used in the representation of large-scale dictionaries, computational morphology, and local grammars and syntax, and describe the theoretical bases for their use.
    In particular, we recall classical theorems and provide some new ones characterizing these transducers.
    We then consider the case of sequential string-to-weight transducers.
    Language models, phone lattices, and word lattices are among the objects that can be represented by these transducers, making them very interesting from the point of view of speech processing.
    We give new theorems extending the known characterizations of stringto-string transducers to these transducers.
    We define an algorithm for determinizing string-to-weight transducers, characterize the unambiguous transducers admitting determinization, and describe an algorithm to test determinizability.
    We also give an a
