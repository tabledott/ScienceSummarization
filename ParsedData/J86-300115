ound discourse-level segmentation, there has been very little investigation of the extent of agreement about where the segment boundaries lie.
    There have been no psychological studies of the consistency of recognition of section boundaries.
    However, Mann (Mann et al. 1975) asked several people to segment a set of dialogues.
    He has reported [personal communication] that his subjects segmented the discourses approximately the same; their disagreements were about utterances at the boundaries of segments.2 Several studies of spontaneously produced discourses provide additional evidence of the existence of segment boundaries, as well as suggesting some of the linguistic cues available for detecting boundaries.

    Butterworth (1975) found speech rate differences that correlated with segments; speech rate is slower at start of a segment than toward the end.
    The linguistic structure consists of the discourse segments and
