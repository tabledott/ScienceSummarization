global thresholding and multiple-pass parsing, and one significant variation on traditional beam thresholding.
    We examine the value of these techniques when used separately, and when combined.
    In order to examine the combined techniques, we also introduce an algorithm for optimizing the settings comments on earlier drafts, and the anonymous reviewers for their extensive comments. of multiple thresholds.
    When all three thresholding methods are used together, they yield very significant speedups over traditional beam thresholding, while achieving the same level of performance.
    We apply our techniques to CKY chart parsing, one of the most commonly used parsing methods in natural language processing.
    In a CKY chart parser, a two-dimensional matrix of cells, the chart, is filled in.
    Each cell in the chart corresponds to a span of the sentence, and each cell of the chart contains the nonterminals that could generate that span.
    Cells covering shorter spans are filled in first, so we also
