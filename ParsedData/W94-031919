s a deep syntactic representation; none attempt to go from semantics to surface form in a single step.
    IDAS and PENMAN use variants of the same deep syntactic language, SPL [Kasper, 1989].
    FUF and JOYCE use deep syntactic languages that are based (respectively) on functional unification and meaning-text theory, but these convey much the same information as SPL.
    SPOKESMAN uses the realization specification language of MUMBLE [McDonald, 1983] as its deep syntactic representation; I have found it difficult to compare this language to the others, but McDonald (personal communication) agrees that it conveys essentially the same information as SPL.
    Unfortunately, while all of the systems possessed a module which converted semantic representations into deep syntactic ones, each system used a different name for this module.
    In FUF it is the 'lexical chooser', in IDAS it is the 'text planner', in JOYCE it is the 'sentence planner', in SPOKESMAN it is the 'text structurer', and in PENMAN it doesn't
