, the second-order semiring EP,R,S,T lets us take expectations of vectors and outer products of vectors.
    So we can find means and covariances of any number of linearly decomposable quantities (e.g., feature counts) defined on the hypergraph.
    We will consider some other choices in Sections 4.3&#8211;4.4 below.
    Thus, for generality, we conclude this section by stating the precise technical conditions needed to construct EP,R and EP,R,S,T: As a matter of notation, note that above and in Tables 1&#8211;2, we overload &#8220;+&#8221; to denote any of the addition operations within P, R, 5, T; overload &#8220;0&#8221; to denote their respective additive identities; and overload concatenation to denote any of the multiplication operations within or between P, R, S, T. &#8220;1&#8221; refers to the multiplicative identity of P. We continue to use distinguished symbols &#174;, &#174;, 0,1 for the operations and identities in our &#8220;main semiring of interest,&#8221; EP,R or EP,R,S,T .
