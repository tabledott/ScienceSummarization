 one defines a &amp;quot;true&amp;quot; category member is subjective and may depend on the specific application, so we leave this exercise to a person.
    Typically, the words near the top of the ranked list are highly associated with the category but the density of category words decreases as one proceeds down the list.
    The user may scan down the list until a sufficient number of category words is found, or as long as time permits.
    The words selected by the user are added to a permanent semantic lexicon with the appropriate category label.
    Our goal is to allow a user to build a semantic lexicon for one or more categories using only a small set of known category members as seed words and a text corpus.
    The output is a ranked list of potential category words that a user can review to create a semantic lexicon quickly.
    The success of this approach depends on the quality of the ranked list, especially the density of category members near the top.
    In the next section, we describe experim
