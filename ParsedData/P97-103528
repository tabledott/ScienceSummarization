ction we used PARADISE to evaluate two confirmation strategies, using as examples fairly simple information access dialogues in the train timetable domain.
    In this section we demonstrate that PARADISE is applicable to a range of tasks, domains, and dialogues, by presenting AVMs for two tasks involving more than information access, and showing how additional dialogue phenomena can be tagged using AVM attributes.
    First, consider an extension of the train timetable task, where an agent can handle requests to reserve a seat or purchase a ticket.
    This task could be represented using the AVM in Table 6 (an extension of Table 1), where the agent must now acquire the value of the attribute request-type, in order to know what to do with the other information it has acquired.
    Figure 5 presents a hypothetical dialogue in this extended task domain, and illustrates user utterance types and an agent dialogue strategy that are very different from those in Figures 2 and 3.
    First, Agent C in Figure 5 uses
