rnym of c' and c' is a hyponym of c. In fact, the hierarchy is not a single hierarchy but instead consists of nine separate subhierarchies, each headed by the most general kind of concept, such as (entity), (abstraction), (event), and (psychological feature).
    For the purposes of this work we add a common root dominating the nine subhierarchies, which we denote (root).
    There are some important points that need to be clarified regarding the hierarchy.
    First, every concept in the hierarchy has a nonempty synset (except the notional concept (root)).
    Even the most general concepts, such as (entity), can be denoted by some noun; the synset for (entity) is { entity, something }.
    Second, there is an important distinction between an individual concept and a set of concepts.
    For example, the individual concept (entity) should not be confused with the set or class consisting of concepts denoting kinds of entities.
