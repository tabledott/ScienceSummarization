    In one model, Discourse Model A, discourse uses are set apart as separate intermediate phrases.
    Recall from Section 3 that intonational phrasing can serve to divide speech into units of information, for purposes such as scope disambiguation.
    So, a broader discourse scope for a cue phrase may be signalled by setting it apart from other items that it might potentially modify if interpreted more narrowly.
    That is, in an utterance such as Now let's talk about cue phrases, now may be more likely to be interpreted in its discourse sense if it is physically set apart from the verb it might otherwise modify in its sentential guise.
    We have also seen that a discourse cue phrase may be part of a larger intermediate phrase and deaccented or given a L* pitch accent&#8212;Discourse Model B.
    While the absence of a pitch accent generally tends to convey that an item represents old information or is inferrable in the discourse, deaccenting is also frequently associated with function words&#8212;pr
