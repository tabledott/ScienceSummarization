er is that it can be used to reduce the parse space for estimation of the log-linear parsing models.
    By focusing on those parses which result from the most probable lexical category sequences, we are able to perform effective discriminative training without considering the complete parse space, which for most sentences is prohibitively large.
    The idea of supertagging originated with LTAG; however, in contrast to the CCG grammars used in this article, the automatically extracted LTAG grammars have, as yet, been too large to enable effective supertagging (as discussed in the previous section).
    We are not aware of any other work which has demonstrated the parsing efficiency benefits of supertagging using an automatically extracted grammar.
    The work in this article began as part of the Edinburgh wide-coverage CCG parsing project (2000&#8211;2004).
    There has been some other work on defining stochastic categorial grammars, but mainly in the context of grammar learning (Osborne and Briscoe 1997;
