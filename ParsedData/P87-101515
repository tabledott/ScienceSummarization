d k, then all trees of the form ti tP3 for each i &gt; 0 will also generated by G (as shown in Figure 9b).
    The string pumping lemma for CFG's (uvwxy-theorem) can be seen as a corollary of this lemma. from this pumping lemma: a single path can be pumped independently.
    For example, let us consider a tree set containing trees of the form shown in Figure 4a.
    The tree t2 must be on one of the two branches.
    Pumping t2 will change only one branch and leave the other branch unaffected.
    Hence, the resulting trees will no longer have two branches of equal size.
    We can give a tree pumping lemma for TAG's by adapting the uvwxy-theorem for CFL's since the tree sets of TAG's have independent and context-free paths.
    This pumping lemma states that if there is tree, t = t2t3t4t5, generated by a TAG G, such that its height is more than a predetermined bound k, then all trees of the form ti it tstt ts for each i &gt; 0 will also generated by G. Similarly, for tree sets with independent paths and more
