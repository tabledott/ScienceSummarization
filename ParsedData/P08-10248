FG, while generating the target translation from the other (Chiang, 2007).
    All the models we present use the grammar extraction technique described in Chiang (2007), and are bench-marked against our own implementation of this hierarchical model (Hiero).
    Figure 3 shows a simple instance of a hierarchical grammar with two non-terminals.
    Note that our approach is general and could be used with other synchronous grammar transducers (e.g., Galley et al. (2006)).
    Our log-linear translation model defines a conditional probability distribution over the target translations of a given source sentence.
    A particular sequence of SCFG rule applications which produces a translation from a source sentence is referred to as a derivation, and each translation may be produced by many different derivations.
    As the training data only provides source and target sentences, the derivations are modelled as a latent variable.
    The conditional probability of a derivation, d, for a target translation, e, condi
