y 2005.
    The results were very similar to the results we obtained with the version from 18 March 2005.
    We did not experiment with the new re-ranking model of Charniak and Johnson (2005), even though it improves upon Charniak (2000) significantly.
    For comparison, the system we submitted to CoNLL 2005 had an F-Measure of 78.45 on the WSJ Test set.
    The winning system (Punyakanok, Roth, and Yih 2005) had an F-Measure of 79.44 and our current system has an F-Measure of 80.32.
    For the Brown Test set, our submitted version had an F-Measure of 67.71, the winning system had 67.75, and our current system has 68.81.
    Figure 20 shows the per-label performance of our joint model using the top five Charniak parse trees on the Test WSJ test set.
    The columns show the Precision, Recall, F-Measure, and the total number of arguments for each label.
  
  
    In accord with standard linguistic assumptions, we have shown that there are substantial gains to be had by jointly modeling the argument frames o
