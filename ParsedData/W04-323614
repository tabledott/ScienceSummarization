nt, we have chosen N to be 3.
    The 250K-word CTB corpus, tagged with 32 different POS tags (such as &#8220;NR&#8221;, &#8220;PU&#8221;, etc) was employed in our evaluation of POS taggers in this study.
    We ran 10-fold CV on the CTB corpus, using our word segmenter&#8217;s output for each of the 10 runs as the input sentences to the POS tagger.
    POS tagging accuracy is simply calculated as (number of characters assigned correct POS tag) / (total number of characters).
    Figure 3: POS tagging accuracy using one-at-atime, word-based POS tagger The POS tagging accuracy is plotted in Figure 3.
    The average POS tagging accuracy achieved for the 10 experiments was only 84.1%, far lower than the 96% achievable by English POS taggers on the English Penn Treebank tag set.
    The average training time was 25 minutes, while testing took about 20 seconds.
    As an experiment, we also conducted POS tagging using only the features (a), (f), and (g) in Section 3.1, similar to (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and we obtai
