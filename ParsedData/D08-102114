ntly reduces the paraphrases that can be used.
    For instance, VP/(NP/NNS) is the only label for the paraphrases in Table 4 that is compatible with the parse tree given in Figure 2.
    Because the CCG labels for a given sentence are so specific, many times there are no matches.
    Therefore we also investigated a looser constraint.
    We choose the highest probability paraphrase with any label (i.e. the set of labels extracted from all parse trees in our parallel corpus): Equation 10 only applies syntactic constraints during phrase extraction and ignores them during substitution.
    In our experiments, we evaluate the quality of the paraphrases that are generated using Equations 8, 9 and 10.
    We compare their quality against the Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) baseline.
  
  
    We conducted a manual evaluation to evaluate paraphrase quality.
    We evaluated whether paraphrases retained the meaning of their original phrases and whether they remained grammatical when they replaced the original phr
