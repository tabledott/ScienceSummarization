    .. (This is in fact a log-linear model in which the component FSAs define the features: string x has log fi(x) occurrences of feature i.)
    In short, weighted finite-state operators provide a language for specifying a wide variety of parameterized statistical models.
    Let us turn to their training.
  
  
    We are primarily concerned with the following training paradigm, novel in its generality.
    Let f&#952; : E* xA* &#8212;* R&gt;0 be a joint probabilistic relation that is computed by a weighted FST.
    The FST was built by some recipe that used the parameter vector 0.
    Changing 0 may require us to rebuild the FST to get updated weights; this can involve composition, regexp compilation, multiplication of feature strengths, etc.
    (Lazy algorithms that compute arcs and states of tion cannot be realized by any weighted FST), one can sometimes succeed by first intersecting g with a smaller regular set in which the input being considered is known
