 source language.
    During the search, we store backpointers to the maximizing arguments.
    After performing the search, we can generate the optimum translation.
    The resulting algorithm has a worst-case complexity of O(J &#183; M &#183; Ve &#183; E).
    Here, Ve denotes the vocabulary size of the target language and E denotes the maximum number of phrase translation candidates for a source language phrase.
    Using efficient data structures and taking into account that not all possible target language phrases can occur in translating a specific source language sentence, we can perform a very efficient search.
    This monotone algorithm is especially useful for language pairs that have a similar word order, e.g.
    SpanishEnglish or French-English.
  
  
    In the following sections, we will present results on three tasks: Verbmobil, Xerox and Canadian Hansards.
    Therefore, we will show the corpus statistics for each of these tasks in this section.
