gnificant improvement is achieved when the model is made sensitive to syntactic structures by adding a constituent feature (Chiang, 2005).
    In the last two years, many research efforts were devoted to integrating the strengths of phrasebased and syntax-based methods.
    In the following, we review four representatives of them.
    1) Hassan et al. (2007) integrate supertags (a kind of lexicalized syntactic description) into the target side of translation model and language model under the phrase-based translation framework, resulting in good performance improvement.
    However, neither source side syntactic knowledge nor reordering model is further explored. the solution shows effective empirically, it only utilizes the source side syntactic phrases of the input parse tree during decoding.
    Furthermore, the translation probabilities of the bilingual phrases and other tree-to-string rules are not compatible since they are estimated independently, thus having different parameter spaces.
