 at the start of a sentence, and it occurs in the list of frequent lower-cased words, then it would be mapped to the feature 1-1-A.
    The word with each character mapped to its .
    For example, G.M. would be mapped to A.A., and Animal would be mapped to Aaaaaa.
    The word with each character mapped to its type, but repeated consecutive character types are not repeated in the mapped string.
    For example, Animal would be mapped to Aa, G.M. would again be mapped to A.A..
    The tagger was applied and trained in the same way as described in (Ratnaparkhi 1996).
    The feature templates described above are used to create a set of binary features , where is the tag, and is the &#8220;history&#8221;, or context.
    An example is if t = S and the word being tagged = &#8220;Mr.&#8221; otherwise , defining a conditional distribution over the tags given a history as The parameters are trained using Generalized Iterative Scaling.
    Following (Ratnaparkhi 1996), we only include features which occur 5 times or
