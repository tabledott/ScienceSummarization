near neighbour substitutes, but would nevertheless be compositional.
    They explore four methods for detecting compositionality using resources acquired from distributional data.
    They use these on 40 candidates on 4 separate tasks which aim to determine whether i) the item is compositional, ii) one component word contributes its meaning iii) the verb contributes its meaning iv) the particle contributes its meaning.
    The classifications on each of these tasks according to these methods are contrasted with a gold standard classification from 26 judges on the same data.
    The methods exceed the mean agreement of the annotators in some cases, particularly as regards the contribution from the particle.
    Baldwin et al. (2003) are also exploring empirical models of compositionality using LSA with nounnoun compounds and verb-particle constructions.
    In their study, they compare the similarities of the component words with WordNet based similarity scores and demonstrate a moderate correlation, lower f
