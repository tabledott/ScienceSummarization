    Anaphoric annotation differs from the previous tasks because annotators do not assign labels, but rather create links between anaphors and their antecedents.
    It is therefore not clear what the &#8220;labels&#8221; should be for the purpose of calculating agreement.
    One possibility would be to consider the intended referent (real-world object) as the label, as in named entity tagging, but it wouldn&#8217;t make sense to predefine a set of &#8220;labels&#8221; applicable to all texts, because different objects are mentioned in different texts.
    An alternative is to use the marked antecedents as &#8220;labels&#8221;.
