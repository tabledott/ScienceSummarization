n a held-out set of test data and achieved accuracy of 78%.
    The interest data was included in a study by (Ng accuracies are associated with the classifiers included in the ensemble, which attained accuracy of 89% when evaluated with the test data. and Lee, 1996), who represent the context of an ambiguous word with the part-of-speech of three words to the left and right of interest, a morphological feature indicating if interest is singular or plural, an unordered set of frequently occurring keywords that surround interest, local collocations that include interest, and verb-object syntactic relationships.
    These features are abbreviated p-o-s, morph, co-occur, collocates, and verb-obj in Table 5.
    A nearest-neighbor classifier was employed and achieved an average accuracy of 87% over repeated trials using randomly drawn training and test sets.
