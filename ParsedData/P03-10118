g a clone of original node &#949;i as a child of node &#949;j is calculated in two steps: first, the choice of whether to insert a clone under &#949;j, with probability Pins(clone|&#949;j), and the choice of which original node to copy, with probability where Pmakeclone is the probability of an original node producing a copy.
    In our implementation, for simplicity, Pins(clone) is a single number, estimated by the EM algorithm but not conditioned on the parent node &#949;j, and Pmakeclone is a constant, meaning that the node to be copied is chosen from all the nodes in the original tree with uniform probability.
    It is important to note that Pmakeclone is not dependent on whether a clone of the node in question has already been made, and thus a node may be &#8220;reused&#8221; any number of times.
    This independence assumption is crucial to the computational tractability of the algorithm, as the model can be estimated using the dynamic programming method above, keeping counts for the expected number o
