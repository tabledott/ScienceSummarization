ond consequence of the fact that the coreference chains in our standard annotation are not complete is that in the evaluation of direct anaphora resolution, we only verify if the antecedents indicated are correct; we do not evaluate how complete the coreferential chains produced by the system are.
    By contrast, in the evaluation of the MUC coreference task, where all types of referring expressions are considered, the resulting co-reference chains are evaluated, rather than just the indicated antecedent (Vilain et al. 1995).
    Even our limited notion of coreference chain was, nevertheless, very helpful in the automatic evaluation, considerably reducing the number of cases to be checked manually. agreement between our annotators in Poesio and Vieira (1998) was often only partial, in addition to precision and recall measures, we evaluated the system's performance by measuring its agreement with the annotators using the K statistic we used in Poesio and Vieira (1998) to measure agreement among annotators.
