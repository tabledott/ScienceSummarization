 and v, gives rise to models based on multiplication.
    One of the most sophisticated proposals for semantic composition is that of Clark et al. (2008) and the more recent implementation of Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011a).
    Using techniques from logic, category theory, and quantum information they develop a compositional distributional semantics that brings type-logical and distributional vector space models together.
    In their framework, words belong to different type-based categories and different categories exist in different dimensional spaces.
    The category of a word is decided by the number and type of adjoints (arguments) it can take and the composition of a sentence results in a vector which exists in sentential space.
    Verbs, adjectives and adverbs act as relational functions, are represented by matrices, and modify the properties of nouns, that are represented by vectors (see also Baroni and Zamparelli (2010) for a proposal similar in spirit).
