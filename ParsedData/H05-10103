med (2000) uses com petitive linking to greedily construct matchingswhere the pair score is a measure of word to-word association, and Matusov et al (2004) find exact maximum matchings where the pair scores come from the alignment posteriors of generative models.
			Tiedemann (2003) proposes incorporating a variety of word association ?clues?
			into a greedy linking algorithm.What we contribute here is a principled ap proach for tractable and efficient learning of the alignment score s jk(e, f) as a function of arbitrary features of that token pair.
			This con tribution opens up the possibility of doing the kind of feature engineering for alignment that has been so successful for other NLP tasks.
			Wefirst present the algorithm for large margin es timation of the scoring function.
			We then showthat our method can achieve AER rates com parable to unsymmetrized IBM Model 4, usingextremely little labeled data (as few as 100 sen tences) and a simple feature set.
