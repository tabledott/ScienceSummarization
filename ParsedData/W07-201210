r data sets to have reliable population samples.
			This has made the task particularly challenging for participants, because naive learning strategies (such as empirical adjustment of distance thresholds to optimize standard clustering algorithms) might be misleaded by the training set.
			2.1.4 AnnotationThe annotation of the data was performed separately in each set of documents related to an ambiguous name.
			Given this set of approximately 100 documents that mention the ambiguous name, the an notation consisted in the manual clustering of eachdocument according to the actual entity that is re ferred on it.When non person entities were found (for in stance, organization or places named after a person) the annotation was performed without any special rule.
			Generally, the annotator browses documents following the original ranking in the search results; after reading a document he will decide whether thementions of the ambiguous name refer to a new en tity or to a entity previously identified.
