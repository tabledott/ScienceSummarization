    This paper presents a model that jointly identifies words with high regional affinity, geographicallycoherent linguistic regions, and the relationship between regional and topic variation.
    The key modeling assumption is that regions and topics interact to shape observed lexical frequencies.
    We validate this assumption on a prediction task in which our model outperforms strong alternatives that do not distinguish regional and topical variation.
    We see this work as a first step towards a unsupervised methodology for modeling linguistic variation using raw text.
    Indeed, in a study of morphosyntactic variation, Szmrecsanyi (2010) finds that by the most generous measure, geographical factors account for only 33% of the observed variation.
    Our analysis might well improve if non-geographical factors were considered, including age, race, gender, income and whether a location is urban or rural.
    In some regions, estimates of many of these factors may be obtained by cro
