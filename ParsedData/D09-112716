n of bilingual feature computation would be of O(kn2) complexity in the worse case because when combining the largest spans one has to scan over the whole sentence.
    We envision the use of a clever datastructure would reduce the complexity, but leave this to future work, as the experiments (Table 8) show that 5Our definition implies that we only consider faithful spans to be contiguous (Galley et al., 2004).
    Also note that source spans include all dependents of st and st&#8722;1. the parser is only marginally (&#8764;6%) slower with the new bilingual features.
    This is because the extra work, with just 3 bilingual features, is not the bottleneck in practice, since the extraction of the vast amount of other features in Table 2 dominates the computation.
  
  
    Besides those cited in Section 1, there are some other related work on using bilingual constraints for grammar induction (rather than parsing).
    For example, Hwa et al. (2005) use simple heuristics to project English trees to Spanish and
