983, 292ff.) distinguishes between an Actor Focus and a Discourse Focus, as well as corresponding lists, viz.
    Potential Actor Focus List and Potential Discourse Focus List.
    Sufi and McCoy (1994) in their RAFT/RAPR approach use grammatical roles for ordering the focus lists and make a distinction between Subject Focus, Current Focus, and corresponding lists.
    Both focusing algorithms prefer an element that represents the Focus to the elements in the list when the anaphoric expression under consideration is not the agent (for Sidner) or the subject (for Suri and McCoy).
    Relating these approaches to our proposal, they already exhibit a weak preference for a single hearer-old (more precisely, evoked) discourse element.
    Dahl and Ball (1990), describing the anaphora resolution module of the PUNDIT system, improve the focusing mechanism by simplifying its underlying data structures.
    Thus, their proposal is more closely related to the centering model than any other focusing mechanism.
