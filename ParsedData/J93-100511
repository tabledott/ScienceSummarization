 the NP or its governing verb. and partially address the third problem in a procedure we will now describe.
    We want to use the verb-noun-preposition table to derive a table of bigrams counts, where a bigram is a pair consisting of a noun or verb and an associated preposition (or no preposition).
    To do this we need to try to assign each preposition that occurs either to the noun or to the verb that it occurs with.
    In some cases it is fairly certain whether the preposition attaches to the noun or the verb; in other cases, this is far less certain.
    Our approach is to assign the clear cases first, then to use these to decide the unclear cases that can be decided, and finally to divide the data in the remaining unresolved cases between the two hypotheses (verb and noun attachment).
    The procedure for assigning prepositions is as follows: This procedure gives us bigram counts representing the frequency with which a given noun occurs associated with an immediately following preposition (or no prep
