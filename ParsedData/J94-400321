to a different selection of target words.
    We wish to select the most plausible target language word for each ambiguous source language word, basing our decision on the counts obtained from the target corpus, as illustrated in Table 1.
    To that end, we should define a selection algorithm whose outcome depends on all the syntactic tuples in the sentence.
    If the data obtained from the corpus do not substantially support any one of the alternatives, the algorithm should notify the translation system that it cannot reach a statistically meaningful decision.
    Our algorithm is based on a statistical model.
    However, we wish to point out that we do not see the statistical considerations, as expressed in the model, as fully reflecting the linguistic considerations (syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic) that determine the correct translation.
    The model reflects only part of the relevant data and in addition makes statistical assumptions that are only partially satisfied.
    Therefore, a statistically
