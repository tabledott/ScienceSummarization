tate, this is a valid derivation of the string intractable.
    Figure 6 is a similar representation for the generation of impractical.
    Figures 7 and 8 illustrate this machine operating as a recognizer.
    As we pointed out earlier, there are two results when the cascade of rules that this machine represents is inverted on the string intractable.
    As Figure 7 shows, the n can be mapped into n by the n:n transition at state 0 or into N by the transition to state 2.
    The latter transition is acceptable because the following t is not a labial and thus matches against the &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; transition to state 0.
    When the following symbol is a labial, as in Figure 8, the process blocks.
    Notice that the string iNput that would have been written on the intermediate tape before the machines were composed is blocked after the second symbol by constraints coming from the m-machine.
    Repeated composition reduces the machines corresponding to the rules of a complete phonological grammar to a
