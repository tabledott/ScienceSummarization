    In this section, we assess the usefulness of the PSEs identified in Section 3 and listed in Table 9 by using them to perform document-level classification of opinion pieces.
    Opinion-piece classification is a difficult task for two reasons.
    First, as discussed in Section 2.1, both opinionated and factual documents tend to be composed of a mixture of subjective and objective language.
    Second, the natural distribution of documents in our data is heavily skewed toward nonopinion pieces.
    Despite these hurdles, using only our PSEs, we achieve positive results in opinion-piece classification using the basic knearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm with leave-one-out cross-validation (Mitchell 1997).
    Given a document, the basic KNN algorithm classifies the document according to the majority classification of the document&#8217;s k closest neighbors.
    For our purposes, eac
