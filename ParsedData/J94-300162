nfusion by carefully distinguishing and keeping track of these various roles.
    We first consider how to apply a rule to strings that have been preprocessed so that every instance of the left context A is followed by the auxiliary symbol &lt; and every instance of the right context p is preceded by the symbol &gt;, where &lt; and &gt; are not in E. This means that the replacement operator can be defined solely in terms of these distinct context-marking brackets, without regard to what A and p actually specify and what they might have in common with each other or with 0 and 0.
    In essence, we assume that the replacement relation for the above rule applies to the upper strings shown below, and that all three string pairs are acceptable because each of the corresponding B-b pairs is bracketed by &lt; and &gt;.
