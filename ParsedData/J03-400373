tistical parsing up to around 1998.
    Of particular relevance is other work on parsing the Penn WSJ Treebank (Jelinek et al. 1994; Magerman 1995; Eisner 1996a, 1996b; Collins 1996; Charniak 1997; Goodman 1997; Ratnaparkhi 1997; Chelba and Jelinek 1998; Roark 2001).
    Eisner (1996a, 1996b) describes several dependency-based models that are also closely related to the models in this article.
    Collins (1996) also describes a dependency-based model applied to treebank parsing.
    Goodman (1997) describes probabilistic feature grammars and their application to parsing the treebank.
    Chelba and Jelinek (1998) describe an incremental, history-based parsing approach that is applied to language modeling for speech recognition.
    History-based approaches were introduced to parsing in Black et al. (1992).
    Roark (2001) describes a generative probabilistic model of an incremental parser, with good results in terms of both parse accuracy on the treebank and also perplexity scores for language modeling.
