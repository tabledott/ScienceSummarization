reement is at chance.
    Additionally, the latter ratio is bounded at 2: SSwithin &#8804; SStotal by definition, and dftotal &lt; 2dfwithin because each item has at least two judgments.
    Subtracting the ratio s2within/s2total from 1 yields a coefficient which ranges between &#8722;1 and 1, where 1 signifies perfect agreement and 0 signifies chance agreement.
    We can unpack the formula for &#945; to bring it to a form which is similar to the other coefficients we have looked at, and which will allow generalizing &#945; beyond simple numerical values.
    The first step is to get rid of the notion of arithmetic mean which lies at the heart of the measure of variance.
    We observe that for any set of numbers x1, ... , xN with a mean x&#175; = 1N &#8721;Nn=1 xn, the sum of square differences from the mean SS can be expressed as the sum of square of differences between all the (ordered) pairs of numbers, scaled by a factor of 1/2N.
    For calculating &#945; we considered each item to be a separate level
