the part-ofspeech tags are used to decide which are content words.
    There is no attempt to disambiguate any of the words identified as part of a named entity.
    These are excluded because they have already been analyzed semantically by means of the classification added by the named entity identifier (see Section 4.4).
    Another reason for not attempting WSD on named entities is that when words are used as names they are not being used in any of the senses listed in a dictionary.
    For example, Rose and May are names but there are no senses in LDOCE for this usage.
    It may be possible to create a dummy entry in the set of LDOCE senses indicating that the word is being used as a name, but then the sense tagger would simply repeat work carried out by the named entity identifier.
    We take the part-of-speech tags assigned by the Brill tagger and use a manually created mapping to translate these to the corresponding LDOCE grammatical category (see Section 3.2).
    Any senses which do not correspond
