ectiveness of the search could be greatly improved if the search results were grouped together according to the corresponding sense, rather than presented as a flat, sense-mixed list of items (whether links to full-length documents, or extracted facts).
			As an added benefit, userswould have easier access to a wider variety of re sults, whenever the top 10 or so results returned by the largest search engines happen to refer to only one particular (arguably the most popular) sense of the query (e.g., the programming language in the case of Python), thus submerging or ?hiding?
			documents that refer to other senses of the query.In various natural language applications, significant performance gains are achieved as a function of data size rather than algorithm complex ity, as illustrated by the increasingly popular use of the web as a (very large) corpus (Dale, 2003).
			It seems therefore natural to try to exploit the webin order to also improve the performance of relation extraction, i.e. the discovery of us
