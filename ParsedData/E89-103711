p a new descriptive possibility.
    If a and 4) are both structural correspondences, then so is their composition a 0 4).
    Thus, even though the units of the semantic structure correspond directly only to the units of the f-structure and have no immediate connection to the nodes of the c-structure, a semantic description can be formulated in terms of c-structure relations.
    The expression a(4)(M(*))) can appear on a c-structure rule-element to designate the semantic-structure unit corresponding to the f-structure that corresponds to the mother of the node that matches that rule-element.
    Since projections are monadic functions, we can remove the uninformative parentheses and write (a4:M* ARGO = 0(4)M* SUBJ), or, using the metavariable, (a I ARGO =a( Kw).
    Schemata such as this can be freely mixed with LFG's standard functional specifications in lexical entries and c-structure rules.
    For example, the lexical entry for fall might be given as follows: Descriptions formulated by composing separat
