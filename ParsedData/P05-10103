.
    Each non-terminal node in the complete data is labeled with a complete symbol of the form , where is the non-terminal symbol of the corresponding node in the observed tree and is a latent annotation symbol, which is an element of a fixed set .
    A complete/incomplete tree pair of the sentence, &#8220;the cat grinned,&#8221; is shown in Figure 2.
    The complete parse tree, (left), is generated through a process just like the one in ordinary PCFGs, but the non-terminal symbols in the CFG rules are annotated with latent symbols, the probability of the complete tree ( ) is where denotes the probability of an occurrence of the symbol at a root node and denotes the probability of a CFG rule.
    The probability of the observed tree is obtained by summing for all the assignments to latent anUsing dynamic programming, the theoretical bound of the time complexity of the summation in Eq.
    1 is reduced to be proportional to the number of non-terminal nodes in a parse tree.
    However, the calculation at no
