asures based on longest common subsequence statistics and skip bigram co-occurrence statistics in the following sections.
  
  
    A sequence Z = [z1, z2, ..., zn] is a subsequence of another sequence X = [x1, x2, ..., xm], if there exists a strict increasing sequence [i1, i2, ..., ik] of indices of X such that for all j = 1, 2, ..., k, we have xij = zj (Cormen et al. 1989).
    Given two sequences X and Y, the longest common subsequence (LCS) of X and Y is a common subsequence with maximum length.
    We can find the LCS of two sequences of length m and n using standard dynamic programming technique in O(mn) time.
    LCS has been used to identify cognate candidates during construction of N-best translation lexicons from parallel text.
    Melamed (1995) used the ratio (LCSR) between the length of the LCS of two words and the length of the longer word of the two words to measure the cognateness between them.
    He used as an approximate string matching algorithm.
