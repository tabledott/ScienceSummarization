candidates in another language.
    Time sequence scoring is then used to re-rank the candidates and choose the one best temporally aligned with the NE.
    That is, we attempt to choose a candidate which is both a good transliteration (according to the current model) and is well aligned with the NE.
    Finally, pairs of NEs and the best candidates are used to iteratively train the transliteration model.
    A major challenge inherent in discovering transliterated NEs is the fact that a single entity may be represented by multiple transliteration strings.
    One reason is language morphology.
    For example, in Russian, depending on a case being used, the same noun may appear with various endings.
    Another reason is the lack of transliteration standards.
    Again, in Russian, several possible transliterations of an English entity may be acceptable, as long as they are phonetically similar to the source.
    Thus, in order to rely on the time sequences we obtain, we need to be able to group variants of
