a proportion of the structures found in two dependency treebanks are allowed under different constraints.
    Assuming that the treebank structures are sampled from naturally occurring structures in natural language, this provides an indirect evaluation of the linguistic adequacy of the different proposals.
    The experiments are based on data from the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) (Haji&#711;c et al., 2001) and the Danish Dependency Treebank (DDT) (Kromann, 2003).
    PDT contains 1.5M words of newspaper text, annotated in three layers according to the theoretical framework of Functional Generative Description (B&#246;hmov&#225; et al., 2003).
    Our experiments concern only the analytical layer, and are based on the dedicated training section of the treebank.
    DDT comprises 100k words of text selected from the Danish PAROLE corpus, with annotation property all structures gap degree 0 gap degree 1 gap degree 2 gap degree 3 gap degree 4 edge degree 0 edge degree 1 edge degree 2 edge degree 3 edge degr
