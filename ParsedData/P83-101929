ration of the self-corr,:ction component is closely tied to the grammar of the parser; for it is the parsing grammar that specifies what sort of constituents count as the same for copying.
    For example, if the grammar did not treat there as a noun phrase when it is subject of a sentence, the self-correction rules could not properly resolve a sentence like because the editing rules would never recognize that people and there are the same sort of element.
    (Note that (13) cannot be treated as a Restart because the lexical trigger is not present.)
    Thus, the observed pattern of self-correction introduces empirical constraints on the set of features that are available for syntactic rules.
    The self-correction rules impose constraints not only on what linguistic elements must count as the same, but also on what must count as different.
    For example, in sentence (14), could and be must be recognized as different sorts of elements in the grammar for the AUX node to be correctly resolved.
