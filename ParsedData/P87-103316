orithm presented in the previous sections has been implemented and tested as part of a general parsing method for Systemic Functional Grammar, which is described in [3].
    The algorithm was integrated with the structure building module of the PATR-II system [101, written in the Zetalisp programming language.
    While the feature-description corresponding to a grammar may have hundreds of disjunctions, the descriptions that result from parsing a sentence usually have only a small number of disjunctions, if any at all.
    Most disjunctions in a systemic grammar represent possible alternative values that some particular feature may have (along with the grammatical consequences entailed by choosing particular values for the feature).
    In the analysis of a particular sentence most features have a unique value, and some features are not present at all.
    When disjunction remains in the description of a sentence after parsing, it usually represents ambiguity or an underspecified part of the grammar.
