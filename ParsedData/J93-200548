that would otherwise be missing from the lexical semantics of an entry.
    While full automatic extraction of semantic collocations is not yet feasible, some recent research in related areas is promising.
    Hindle (1990) reports interesting results of this kind based on literal collocations, where he parses the corpus (Hindle 1983) into predicate&#8212;argument structures and applies a mutual information measure (Fano 1961; Magerman and Marcus 1990) to weigh the association between the predicate and each of its arguments.
    For example, as a list of the most frequent objects for the verb drink in his corpus, Hindle found beer, tea, Pepsi, and champagne.
    Based on the distributional hypothesis that the degree of shared contexts is a similarity measure for words, he develops a similarity metric for nouns based on their substitutability in certain verb contexts.
    Hindle thus finds sets of semantically similar nouns based on syntactic co-occurrence data.
    The sets he extracts are promising; for exam
