nts tend to occur after their heads.
    Thus, the right sibling is particularly important as it is often the dependent of the potential discourse connective under investigation.
    If the connective string has a discourse function, then this dependent will often be a clause (SBAR).
    For example, the discourse usage in &#8220;After I went to the store, I went home&#8221; can be distinguished from the nondiscourse usage in &#8220;After May, I will go on vacation&#8221; based on the categories of their right siblings.
    Just knowing the syntactic category of the right sibling is sometimes not enough; experiments on the development set showed improvements by including more features about the right sibling.
    Consider the example below: and where.
    The syntactic category of &#8220;where&#8221; is SBAR, so the set of features above could not distinguish the single word &#8220;where&#8221; from a full embedded clause like &#8220;I went to the store&#8221;.
    In order to address this deficiency, we incl
