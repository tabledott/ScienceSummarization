 Note also that the transformations which are taken into account are a superset of the transformations taken into account by Gildea and Palmer (2002).
    This experiment considers use of semantic features: Pred HW, Arg HW, Semsubcat, and Drole.
    (Feature set SEMANTIC.)
    Of course, there are only results for SEM-TAG, which turns out to be 1.9%.
    This is the best performance yet.
    In our final experiment, we use supertag features: pertag, Drole.
    (Feature set SUPERTAG.)
    The error rates are 2.8% for SEM-TAG and 7.4% for SYNTTAG.
    Considering SEM-TAG only, this model performs better than its corresponding DEEP model, probably because supertag for SEM-TAG include crucial semantic information.
    Considering SYNTTAG only, this model performs worse than its corresponding DEEP model, presumably because of sparse data problems when modeling supertags.
    This sparse data problem is also apparent by comparing the model based on SEM-TAG with the corresponding SEM-TAG SEMANTIC model.
