ords This similarity-based model of selectional preferences is a straightforward implementation of the idea of generalization from seen headwords to other, similar words.
    Like the clustering-based model, it is not tied to the availability of WordNet or any other manually created resource.
    The model uses two corpora, a primary corpus for the extraction of seen headwords and a generalization corpus for the computation of semantic similarity metrics.
    This gives the model flexibility to influence the similarity metric through the choice of text domain of the generalization corpus.
    Instantiation used in this paper.
    Our aim is to compute selectional preferences for semantic roles.
    So we choose a particular instantiation of the similarity-based model that makes use of the fact that the two-corpora approach allows us to use different notions of &#8220;predicate&#8221; and &#8220;argument&#8221; in the primary and generalization corpus.
    Our primary corpus will consist of manually semantical
