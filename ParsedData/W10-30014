    The most recent approaches to uncertainty detection exploit machine learning models that utilize manually labeled corpora.
    Medlock and Briscoe (2007) used single words as input features in order to classify sentences from biological articles (FlyBase) as speculative or non-speculative based on semi-automatically collected training examples.
    Szarvas (2008) extended the methodology of Medlock and Briscoe (2007) to use n-gram features and a semi-supervised selection of the keyword features.
    Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) proposed a linguistically motivated approach based on syntactic information to semi-automatically refine a list of hedge cues.
    Ganter and Strube (2009) proposed an approach for the automatic detection of sentences containing uncertainty based on Wikipedia weasel tags and syntactic patterns.
    The BioScope corpus (Vincze et al., 2008) is manually annotated with negation and speculation cues and their linguistic scope.
    It consists of clinical free-texts, biological tex
