he frame accordingly specifies the same consonant on both the root and the surface tapes, advancing both of them.
    A parallel move, differing only in the identity of the consonant, is made from (c) to (d).
    The move from (d) to (e) is similar to that from (a) to (b) except that, this time, the vocalism tape does advance.
    The nondeterministic prediction that is being made in this case is that there will be no further slots for the &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; to fill.
    Just what it is that makes this the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; move is a matter to which we shall return.
    The move from (e) to (f) differs from the previous two moves over root consonants in that the &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; is being &amp;quot;spread&amp;quot;.
    In other words, the root tape does not move, and this possibility is allowed on the specific grounds that it is the last symbol on the tape.
    Once again, the automata are making a nondeterministic decision, this time that there will be another consonant called for later by th
