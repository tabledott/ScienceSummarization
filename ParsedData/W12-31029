er systems.
    Specifically, each block in which A appears includes four implicit pairwise comparisons (against the other presented systems).
    A is rewarded once for each of the four comparisons in which A wins, and its score is the number of such winning pairwise comparisons, divided by the total number of non-tying pairwise comparisons involving A.
    This scoring metric is different from that used in prior years in two ways.
    First, the score previously included ties between system rankings.
    In that case, the score for A reflected how often A was rated as better than or equal to other systems, and was normalized by all comparisons involving A.
    However, this approach unfairly rewards systems that are similar (and likely to be ranked as tied).
    This is problematic since many of the systems use variations of the same underlying decoder (Bojar et al., 2011).
    A second difference is that this year we no longer include comparisons against reference translations.
    In the past, reference t
