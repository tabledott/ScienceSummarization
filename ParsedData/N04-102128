nal model gets a %BLEU score of 31.9. ture added to the baseline features on its own, and a combination of new features.
  
  
    The use of discriminative reranking of an n-best list produced with a state-of-the-art statistical MT system allowed us to rapidly evaluate the benefits of off-the-shelf parsers, chunkers, and POS taggers for improving syntactic well-formedness of the MT output.
    Results are summarized in Table 2; the best single new feature improved the %BLEU score from 31.6 to 32.5.
    The 95% confidence intervals computed with the bootstrap resampling method are about 0.8%.
    In addition to experiments with single features we also integrated multiple features using a greedy approach where we integrated at each step the feature that most improves the BLEU score.
    This feature integration produced a statistically significant improvement of absolute 1.3% to 32.9 %BLEU score.
    Our single best feature, and in fact the only single feature to produce a truly significant improvement, was th
