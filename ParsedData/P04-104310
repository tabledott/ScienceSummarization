In order to evaluate K(&#57738;(Fx), &#57738;(Fz)) without evaluating the feature vector x&#57742; and z&#57742; we define the indicator function Ii(n) = 1 if the substructure i is rooted at node n and 0 otherwise.
    It follows that &#57738;i(Fx) = &#57738;n&#57738;Nx Ii(n), where Nx is the set of the Fx&#8217;s nodes.
    Therefore, the kernel can be written as: where Nx and Nz are the nodes in Fx and Fz, respectively.
    In (Collins and Duffy, 2002), it has been shown that &#57738;i Ii(nx)Ii(nz) = A(nx, nz) can be computed in O(JNxJ x INzI) by the following recursive relation: guments, cannot be included one in the other.
    This property is important because a convolution kernel would not be effective to distinguish between an object and its sub-parts.
    The above object space aims to capture all the information between a predicate and one of its arguments.
    Its main drawback is that important structural information related to interargument dependencies is neglected.
    In order to solve this pro
