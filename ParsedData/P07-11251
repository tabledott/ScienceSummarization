g: The second example contains a hedge, signaled by the use of suggest and might, which renders the proposition inhibit(XfK89&#8212;*Felin-9) speculative.
    Such analysis would be useful in various applications; for instance, consider a system designed to identify and extract interactions between genetic entities in the biomedical domain.
    Case 1 above provides clear textual evidence of such an interaction 992 and justifies extraction of inhibit(XfK89&#8212;*Felin-9), whereas case 2 provides only weak evidence for such an interaction.
    Hedging occurs across the entire spectrum of scientific literature, though it is particularly common in the experimental natural sciences.
    In this study we consider the problem of learning to automatically classify sentences containing instances of hedging, given only a very limited amount of annotatorlabelled &#8216;seed&#8217; data.
    This falls within the weakly supervised ML framework, for which a range of techniques have been previously explored.
