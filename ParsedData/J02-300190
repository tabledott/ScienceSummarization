data from the same broad semantic domain into which the frames are grouped.
    To investigate the degree to which our system is dependent on the set of semantic roles used, we performed experiments using abstract, general semantic roles such as AGENT, PATIENT, and GOAL.
    Such roles were proposed in theories of linking such as Fillmore (1968) and Jackendoff (1972) to explain the syntactic realization of semantic arguments.
    This level of roles, often called thematic roles, was seen as useful for expressing generalizations such as &#8220;If a sentence has an AGENT, the AGENT will occupy the subject position.&#8221; Such correlations might enable a statistical system to generalize from one semantic domain to another.
    Recent work on linguistic theories of linking has attempted to explain syntactic realization in terms of the fundamentals of verbs&#8217; meaning (see Levin and Rappaport Hovav [1996] for a survey of a number of theories).
    Although such an explanation is desirable, our goal is more mo
