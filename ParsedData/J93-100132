radically from one segment to another.
    For example, if we divide the Brown Corpus into 10 segments of 100,000 words each, we find that the frequency of Kennedy is: 58, 57, 2, 12, 6, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0.
    The variance of these 10 numbers is 539.
    Under the binomial assumption, we obtain a very different estimate of the variance.
    In a sample of n =-- 100,000 words, with fr = 140 per million, we would expect a variance of np(1 &#8212; fr) 14.
    (The variance of the binomial is approximately the same as the expected value when p is small.)
    The large discrepancy between the empirically derived estimate of the variance (539) and the one based on the binomial assumption (14) indicates that the binomial assumption does not fit the data very well.
  
  
    When the data don't fit the model very well, we may wish to look for alternative models.
    Four articles in this special issue propose empirical alternatives to traditional parsing methods based on the competence model.
    As we have seen, the comp
