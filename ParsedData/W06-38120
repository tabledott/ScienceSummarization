  Chinese Whispers - An Efficient Graph Clustering Algorithm And Its Application To Natural Language Processing Problems
  
    We introduce Chinese Whispers, a randomized graph-clustering algorithm, which is time-linear in the number of edges.
    After a detailed definition of the algorithm and a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses, the performance of Chinese Whispers is measured on Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems as diverse as language separation, acquisition of syntactic word classes and word sense disambiguation.
    At this, the fact is employed that the small-world property holds for many graphs in NLP.
  
  
    Clustering is the process of grouping together objects based on their similarity to each other.
    In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), there are a variety of applications for clustering.
    The most popular ones are document clustering in applications related to retrieval and word clustering for finding sets of similar words or concept hierarchies.
