ith 2,000 tweets, the error rate for Unigrams was 46% versus 23.8% for our approach.
			As forsubjectivity detection, this occurs because our features are in fact able to capture a more general rep resentation of the tweets.Another advantage of TwitterSA over Uni grams is that it produces more robust models.
			Toillustrate this, we present the error rates of Uni grams and TwitterSA where the training data is composed by data from each source in isolation.For the TweetFeel website, where data is very bi ased (see Section 3), Unigrams obtained an error rate of 44.5% whereas over a sample of the same size of the combined training data (Figure 3), itobtained an error rate of around 30%.
			Our ap proach also performed worse over this data thanthe general one, but still had a reasonable er ror rate, 25.1%.
			Regarding the Twendz website, which is the noisiest one (Section 3), Unigrams also obtained a poor performance comparing itagainst its performance over a sample of the general data with a same size (see Tabl
