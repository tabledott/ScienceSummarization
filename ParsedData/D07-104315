number of pairs of data points that are clustered similarly in the target and hypothesized clus tering.
			That is, each pair of points can either be 1)clustered together in both clusterings (N11), 2) clustered separately in both clusterings (N00), 3) clustered together in the hypothesized but not the tar get clustering (N01) or 4) clustered together in the target but not in the hypothesized clustering (N10).
			Based on these 4 values, a number of measures have been proposed, including Rand Index (Rand, 1971), 2Homogeneity is not measured by V-measure as a count of the number of classes contained by a cluster but ?fewer?
			is an acceptable way to conceptualize this criterion for the purposes of these examples.
			413 Adjusted Rand Index (Hubert and Arabie, 1985), ?statistic (Hubert and Schultz, 1976), Jaccard (Mil ligan et al, 1983), Fowlkes-Mallows (Fowlkes andMallows, 1983) and Mirkin (Mirkin, 1996).
			We il lustrate this class of measures with the calculation of Rand Index.
			Rand(C,K) = N11+N00n(n?1)/
