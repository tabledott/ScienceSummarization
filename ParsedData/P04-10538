    We do not need richly annotated corpora or any initial manually selected seeds.
    Instead of them, we use a named entity (NE) tagger.
    Recently developed named entity taggers work quite well and extract named entities from text at a practically usable level.
    In addition, the set of types of named entities has been extended by several research groups.
    For example, Sekine proposed 150 types of named entities (Sekine et al., 2002).
    Extending the range of NE types would lead to more effective relation discovery.
    If the type ORGANIZATION could be divided into subtypes, COMPANY, MILITARY, GOVERNMENT and so on, the discovery procedure could detect more specific relations such as those between COMPANY and COMPANY.
    We use an extended named entity tagger (Sekine, 2001) in order to detect useful relations between extended named entities.
    We define the co-occurrence of NE pairs as follows: two named entities are considered to co-occur if they appear within the same sentence and are sepa
