tes were selected by hand so as to obtain an even split between candidates which did participate in the alternation (positive candidates) and those which did not (negative candidates).
    Four human judges were used to determine the &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot;.
    The judges were asked to specify a yes or no decision on participation for each verb.
    They were also permitted a don't know verdict.
    The kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) was calculated to ensure that there was significant agreement between judges for the initial set of candidates.
    From these, verbs were selected which had 75% or more agreement, i.e. three or more judges giving the same yes or no decision for the verb.
    For the causative alternation we were left with 46 positives and 53 negatives.
    For the conative alternation we had 6 of each.
    In both cases, we used the Mann Whitney U test to see if there was a significant relationship between the similarity measure and participation.
    We then used a thre
