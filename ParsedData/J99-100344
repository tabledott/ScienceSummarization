ticle presents the Geometric Segment Alignment (GSA) algorithm, which uses segment boundary information to reduce the correspondence relation in SIMR's output to a segment alignment.
    The GSA algorithm can be applied equally well to sentences, paragraphs, lists of items, or any other text units for which boundary information is available.
    A set of correspondence points, supplemented with segment boundary information, expresses segment correspondence, which is a richer representation than segment alignment.
    Figure 10 illustrates how segment boundaries form a grid over the bitext space.
    Each cell in the grid represents the intersection of two segments, one from each half of the bitext.
    A point of correspondence inside cell (X,y) indicates that some token in segment X corresponds with some token in segment y; i.e., segments X and y correspond.
    For example, Figure 10 indicates that segment e corresponds with segments G and H. In contrast to a correspondence relation, &amp;quot;an alignment
