ccurately transformed trees.
    We also note that the very simple model that ignores syntax and takes the last mentioned noun-phrase as the referent performs quite a bit worse, about 43% correct.
    This indicates that syntax does play a very important role in anaphora resolution.
    We see a significant improvement after the word knowledge is added to the program.
    The P(plwa) probability gives the system information about gender and animaticity.
    The contribution of this factor is quite significant, as can be seen from Table 1.
    The impact of this probability can be seen more clearly from another experiment in which we tested the program (using just Hobbs distance and gender information) on the training data.
    Here the program can be thought of having &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; gender/animaticity knowledge.
    We obtained a success rate of 89.3%.
    Although this success rate overstates the effect, it is a clear indication that knowledge of a referent's gender and animaticity is essential
