    According to the definition of coreference, this means that Referent(Every TV network) = Referent(its) so that Referent(its) is the set of all TV networks, predicting incorrectly that (1c) means (lc'): (Incidentally, coreference and anaphora are not only different; they are also extremely difficult to combine into a proper equivalence relationship that allows us to recognize different clauses as being &amp;quot;about the same thing.&amp;quot; Consider, for example, the relation, say R, which holds between NV]. and NP2 if and only if either NPi and NP2 corefer (in the sense of the definition in Section 1) or NPi is an anaphoric antecedent of NP2 or NP2 is an anaphoric antecedent of NP1 Note that R is not an equivalence relation.
    The subject of (1c), for example, can corefer with a plural pronoun in the next sentence, e.g., (...) They are now required to do this, but They and it (in (1c)) do not stand in th
