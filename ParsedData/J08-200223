 gives the representation of the correct and guessed labelings shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(b), in the first and second rows of the table, respectively.
    To convert a labeling on parse tree nodes to this form, we create a labeled set for each possibly multi-constituent argument.
    All remaining sets of words are implicitly labeled with NONE.
    We can see that, in this way, exact bracketing is not necessary and also no partial credit is given when only some of several constituents in a multi-constituent argument are labeled correctly.
    We will refer to word sets as &#8220;spans.&#8221; To compute the measures, we are comparing a guessed set of labeled spans to a correct set of labeled spans.
    We briefly define the various measures of comparison used herein, using the example guessed and correct Argument-based scoring measures for the guessed labeling.
