s of information.
    This means that we have to adjust our hypothesis: more information is better, but only up to the point where the wealth of information overwhelms the machine learning system.
    Where this point is found obviously differs for each system.
    For the combiners, the situation is rather inconclusive.
    In some cases, especially for WPDV(Tags), combining at a higher granularity (i.e., using more information) produces better results.
    In others, combining at a lower granularity works better.
    In all cases, the difference in scores between the columns is extremely small and hardly supports any conclusions either way.
    What is obviously much more important for the combiners is the quality of the information they can work with.
    Here, higher granularity on the part of the ingredients is preferable, as combiners based on Wotan taggers perform better than those based on WotanLite taggers,3&#176; and ingredient performance seems to be even more useful, as BestLite yields yet better
