.4% recall, and 85.7% f-measure.
    Recently, we have also tested the system on legal documents (the headnotes used by Westlaw company), and the program works well on those documents too.
    The evaluation of sentence reduction (see (Jing, 2000) for details) used a corpus of 500 sentences and their reduced forms in human-written abstracts.
    400 sentences were used to compute corpus probabilities and 100 sentences were used for testing.
    The results show that 81.3% of the reduction decisions made by the system agreed with those of humans.
    The humans reduced the length of the 500 sentences by 44.2% on average, and the system reduced the length of the 100 test sentences by 32.7%.
    The evaluation of sentence combination module is not as straightforward as that of decomposition or reduction since combination happens later in the pipeline and it depends on the output from prior The new measure is an echo of the original bad idea, blurred just enough to cloud prospects both for enforcement and for cou
