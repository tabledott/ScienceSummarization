			the relatively poor performance of the phrase-basedmodel is the consequence of an inadequate set of ori entation labels.
			To try to answer this question, weuse the set of orientation labels {M,S,Dl,Dr} de scribed in Section 3.
			Results for this different set oforientations are shown in Table 4.
			While the phrasebased model appears to benefit more from the distinction between left- and right-discontinuous, sys tems that incorporate hierarchical models remain the most competitive overall: their best performance on MT06, MT05, and MT08 are respectively 34.36, 32.85, and 27.03.
			The best non-hierarchical models achieve only 33.79, 32.32, and 26.32, respectively.All these differences (i.e., .57, .53, and .71) are sta tistically significant at the .05 level.Our res
