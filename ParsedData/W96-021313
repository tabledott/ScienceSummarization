n also exhibit similar bias.
    Thus specialized features may be less effective for those words affected by inter-annotator bias.
    A simple solution to eliminate inter-annotator inconsistency is to train and test the model on data that has been created by the same annotator.
    The results of such an experiment' are shown in Table 10.
    The total accuracy is higher, implying that the singly-annotated training and test sets are more consistent, and the improvement due to the specialized features is higher than before (.1%) but still modest, implying that either the features need further improvement or that intra-annotator inconsistencies exist in the corpus.
    Most of the recent corpus-based POS taggers in the literature are either statistically based, and use Markov Model(Weischedel et al., 1993, Merialdo, 1994) or Statistical Decision Tree(Jelinek et al., 1994, Magerman, 1995)(SDT) techniques, or are primarily rule based, such as Brill's Transformation Based Learner(Brill, 1994)(TBL).
