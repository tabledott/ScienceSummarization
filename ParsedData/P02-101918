els to estimate scores as follows: The r that maximizes this score will also maximize the probability PCMB(wjr).
    The probabilities PPHL(wjr) are computed as follows: This equation is approximated by the expression for PPHL shown in Figure 1 after several simplifying assumptions.
    The probabilities P(pron rjr) are taken to be equal for all possible pronunciations of r in the dictionary.
    Next we assume independence of the misspelling from the right word given the pronunciation of the right word i.e.
    P (wjr, pron r) = P(wjpron r).
    By inversion of the conditional probability this is equal to P(pron rjw) multiplied by P(w)IP(pron r).
    Since we do not model these marginal probabilities, we drop the latter factor.
    Next the probability P(pron rjw) is expressed as which is approximated by the maximum term in the sum.
    After the following decomposition: P(pron w, pron rjw) = P(pron wjw)xP(pron rjw,pron w) ti P(pron wjw)xP(pron rjpron w) where the second part represents a final independence
