Poesio Inter-Coder Agreement for CL figures on the diagonal of the confusion matrix in Table 4) and dividing by the total number of items.
    The expected agreement values and the resulting values for the coefficients are shown in Table 5.
    The values of &#960; and &#954; are very similar, which is to be expected when agreement is high, because this implies similar marginals.
    Notice that A&#954;e &lt; A&#960;e , hence &#954; &gt; &#960;; this reflects a general property of &#954; and &#960;, already mentioned in Section 2.4, which will be elaborated in Section 3.1.
    Request are clearly distinct classifications, Check is somewhere between the two.
    We therefore opt to weigh the distances between the categories as follows (recall that 1 denotes maximal disagreement, and identical categories are in full agreement and thus have a distance of 0).
    Statement 0 1 0.5 Info-Request 1 0 0.5 The only sources of disagreement in the coding example of Table 4 are the six utterances marked as Info-Requests
