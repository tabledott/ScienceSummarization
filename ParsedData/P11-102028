d collected two paraphrases of each using Mechanical Turk.
    We conducted a post-annotation survey of workers who had completed both the video description and the direct paraphrasing tasks, and found that paraphrasing was considered more difficult and less enjoyable than describing videos.
    Of those surveyed, 92% found video annotations more enjoyable, and 75% found them easier.
    Based on the comments, the only drawback of the video annotation task is the time required to load and watch the videos.
    Overall, half of the workers preferred the video annotation task while only 16% of the workers preferred the paraphrasing task.
    The data produced by the direct paraphrasing task also diverged less, since the annotators were inevitably biased by lexical choices and word order in the original sentences.
    On average, a direct paraphrase had a PINC score of 70.08, while a parallel description of the same video had a score of 78.75.
