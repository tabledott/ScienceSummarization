 categories and light gray cells are statistically equivalent to the best numbers in their categories.
    Analyzing all runs according to the adequacy and fluency table, we make the following observations: Applying the stemmer achieves higher correlation with adequacy but keeping case information achieves higher correlation with fluency except for (only is shown).
    For example, Pearson&#8217;s correlation of ROUGE-S* with adequacy increases from 0.85 (Case) to 0.95 while its Pearson&#8217;s with fluency drops from 0.84 (Case) to 0.78 (Stem).
    We will focus our discussions on the Stem set in adequacy and Case set in fluency.
    Pearson's values in the Stem set of the Adequacy Table, indicates that ROUGE- L and ROUGE-S with a skip distance longer than 0 correlate highly and linearly with adequacy and NIST.
    ROUGE-S* achieves best correlation with a Pearson&#8217;s 0.95.
    Measures favoring consecutive matches, i.e. and 12, ROUGE-W, GTM20 and 30, ROUGE-S0 (bigram), and WER have lower Pear- Among the
