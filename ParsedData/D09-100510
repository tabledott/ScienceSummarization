 in our algorithms; neither specifies a loop order.
    One could however use a non-commutative semiring by ordering each hyperedge&#8217;s antecedents and specifying that a derivation&#8217;s weight is the product of the weights of its hyperedges when visited in prefix order.
    Tables 1&#8211;2 will not assume any commutativity. graph.
    It is often convenient to permit this probability distribution to be unnormalized, i.e., one may have to divide it through by some Z to get a proper distribution that sums to 1.
    We are also given two functions of interest r, s : D &#8594; R, each of which decomposes additively over its component hyperedges e: that is, r(d) def = EeEd re, and s(d) def = EeEd se.
    We are now interested in computing the following quantities on the hypergraph HG: Note that r/Z, s/Z, and t/Z are expectations under p of r(d), s(d), and r(d)s(d), respectively.
    More formally, the probabilistic interpretation is that D is a discrete sample space (consisting gorithm is a more efficient
