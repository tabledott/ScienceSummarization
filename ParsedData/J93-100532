    Like the lexicon derived from the COBUILD dictionary, the fixed lexicon of 7,822 corpus-derived associations derived from our bigram table as described above (that is, all bigrams where f (w, p) &gt; 3 and I(w, p) &gt; 2) contains categorical information about associations.
    Using it for disambiguation in the way the COBUILD dictionary was used gives the results indicated in Table 7.
    The precision is similar to that which was achieved with the LA procedure with a threshold of 2, although the recall is lower.
    This suggests that while overall coverage of association pairs is important, the information about the relative strengths of associations contributing to the LA score is also significant.
    It must be noted that the dictionary information we derived from COBUILD was composed for people to use in printed form.
    It seems likely that associations were left out because they did not serve this purpose in one way or another.
    For instance, listing many infrequent or semantically predict
