t help is again one of data sparseness, due to most verbs occurring rarely in the OTC.
    There were only 19 occasions when a happens-before pair from VerbOcean correctly matched a human BEFORE TLINK, of which 6 involved the same rule being right twice (including learn happens-before forget, a rule which students are especially familiar with!
    ), with the rest being right just once.
    There were only 5 occasions when a VerbOcean rule incorrectly matched a human BEFORE TLINK, involving just three rules.
    The previous baseline was a hybrid confidence-based combination of corpus-induced lexical relations with hand-created rules for temporal ordering.
    One could consider another obvious hybrid, namely learning from annotations created by GTag-annotated corpora.
    Since the intuitive baseline fares badly, this may not be that attractive.
    However, the dramatic impact of closure could help offset the limited coverage provided by human intuitions.
    Table 4 (line GTag+closure+ME-C) shows the resul
