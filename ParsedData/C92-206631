			A Comput ing the Ins ide P rob- ab i l i t i es In the following, the inside and outside probabilities are re\]ative to the input string w. 3 t" stands for the the set of foot nodes, S for the set of nodes on which substitution can occur, ~ for the set of root nodes of initial trees, and ,4 for the set of non-terminal nodes of auxiliary trees.
			The inside probability can be computed bottom-up with the following recurrence quations.
			For all node v/found in an elementary tree, it can be shown that: 1.
			If b\[$r/\] ~ a, I(b,7, i , - , - , I ) = dl if / = i+ 1 and if.
			a = w~ +1, 0 otherwise.
			2.
