anded forms of the search terms (see the patterns in (2)&#8211;(4)).
    This process can be automated straightforwardly using a script that generates all the search terms for a given bigram, issues an AltaVista or Google query for each of the search terms, and then adds up the resulting number of matches for each bigram.
    We applied this process to all the bigrams in our data set, covering seen and unseen adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb-object bigrams (i.e., a set of 540 bigrams in total).
    The queries were carried out in January 2003 (and thus the counts are higher than those reported in Keller, Lapata, and Ourioupina [2002], which were generated about a year earlier).
    For some bigrams that were unseen in the BNC, our Web-based procedure returned zero counts; that is, there were no matches for those bigrams in the Web searches.
    It is interesting to compare the Web and NANTC with respect to zero counts: Both data sources are larger than the BNC and hence should be able to mitigate the data
