 a FTAG, G, then we have equations of the form fl = ~x.el f .
  = Ax.e,~ e l , .
  ,e~ are encodings of auxiliary trees #h. .
  , f l ,  as discussed above.
  These expressions obey the syntax which is defined ~ccursively as follows.
  e ::= NIL ::= TOP ::~ Cl A e 2 ::~ e I V g2 ::---- f (e ) where x js a variable over feature structures and f is a function variable.
  In addition, as discussed above, we have another equation given by fo = Ax./I(x) V .
  .V  fn(~) The initial trees are represented by a set of equations of the form !
  xrn ~ ~ra where e~,..
  ., e m are expressions which describe the initial trees at  , .
  ,  ~n Note that in the expressions e l , .
  ,  e,, e~,.. , e,,, wherever adjunction is possible, we use the function variable f0 as described above.
  The gram- mar is characterized bythe structures derivable from any one of the initial trees.
  Therefore, we add ~0 ---- Zt V... V ~tn Assuming that we specify reentrancy using the Variables Yl,...~ Yk and equations Yt : e~ for 1 _ i &lt; k,
