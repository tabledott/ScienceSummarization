 words long) that overlap.
    They collectively correspond to intention 1.1.1 (hatred of commuting).
    The fact that they are short and overlapping suggests that they could be taken together as a whole.
    Chain 9, {environment, setting, surrounding}, corresponds to intention 1.1.2 (hated suburbs).
    Even though the chain is a lot shorter in length than the intention, its presence is a clue to the existence of a separate intention in its textual vicinity.
    Since the lexical chain boundary is more than two sentences away from the intention boundary, other textual information would be required to confirm the structure.
    Overall, the lexical chains found in this example provide a good clue for the determination of the intentional structure.
    In some cases, the chains correspond exactly to an intention.
    It should also be stressed, however, that the lexical structures cannot be used on their own to predict an exact structural partitioning of the text.
    This of course was never expected.
