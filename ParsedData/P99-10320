  Development And Use Of A Gold-Standard Data Set For Subjectivity Classifications
  
    This paper presents a case study of analyzing and improving intercoder reliability in discourse using statistical techniques. corrected tags are formulated and successfully used to guide a revision of the coding manual and develop an automatic classifier.
  
  
    This paper presents a case study of analyzing and improving intercoder reliability in discourse tagging using the statistical techniques presented in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1998; Bruce and Wiebe, to appear).
    Our approach is data driven: we refine our understanding and presentation of the classification scheme guided by the results of the intercoder analysis.
    We also present the results of a probabilistic classifier developed on the resulting annotations.
    Much research in discourse processing has focused on task-oriented and instructional dialogs.
    The task addressed here comes to the fore in other genres, especially news reporting.
