selected as a seed word, a whole set of weapons that cooccur with artillery can now be selected in future iterations.
    If one of those weapons occurs frequently enough, the scores for the words that it co-occurs with may exceed those of any vehicles, and this effect may be strong enough that no vehicles are selected in any future iteration.
    In addition, because it promotes high frequency terms, such a statistic tends to have the same effect as a minimum occurrence cutoff, i.e. few if any low frequency words get added.
    A simple probability is a much more conservative statistic, insofar as it selects far fewer words with the potential for infection, it limits the extent of any infection that does occur, and it includes rare words.
    Our motto in using this statistic for selection is, &amp;quot;First do no harm.&amp;quot;
  
  
    The simple ratio used to select new seed words will tend not to select higher frequency words in the category.
    The solution to this problem is to make the initial see
