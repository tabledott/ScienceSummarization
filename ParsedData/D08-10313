of grouping the mentions into equivalence classes, so that each equivalence class contains exactly those mentions that refer to the same discourse entity.
    The number of equivalence classes is not specified in advance, but is bounded by the number of mentions.
    In this paper, we view coreference resolution as a graph problem: Given a set of mentions and their context as nodes, generate a set of edges such that any two mentions that belong in the same equivalence class are connected by some path in the graph.
    We construct this entity-mention graph by learning to decide for each mention which preceding mention, if any, belongs in the same equivalence class; this approach is commonly called the pairwise coreference model (Soon et al., 2001).
    To decide whether two mentions should be linked in the graph, we learn a pairwise coreference function pc that produces a value indicating the probability that the two mentions should be placed in the same equivalence class.
