uring that information which is known to be important at a given step in the derivation is input directly to that step&#8217;s history representation, and that as information becomes less relevant it has increasing numbers of history representations to pass through before reaching the step&#8217;s history representation.
    The principle we apply when designing the inputs to each history representation is that we want recency in this flow of information to match a linguistically appropriate notion of structural locality.
    To achieve this structurally-determined inductive bias, we use Simple Synchrony Networks, which are specifically designed for processing structures.
    ASSN divides the processing of a structure into a set of sub-processes, with one sub-process for each node of the structure.
    For phrase structure tree derivations, we divide a derivation into a set of sub-derivations by assigning a derivation step to the sub-derivation for the node top which is on the top of the stack prior to that s
