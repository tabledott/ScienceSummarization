ccessful for adjectives as well, although this is not the case in our evaluation.
    This is because the sense discrimination of adjectives is carried out after that for nouns in our algorithm (see Section 4.4), and the former is hindered by the low results of the latter.
    Adverbs cannot be disambiguated by preference methods against LDOCE because it does not contain the appropriate information.
    Our analysis of the behavior of the individual partial taggers provides some clues to the behavior of the overall system, consisting of all taggers, on the different subcorpora, as shown in Table 7.
    The system performs to roughly the same level over the noun, verb, and adjective sub-corpora with only a 3% difference between the best and worst performance.
    The system's worst performance is on the abverb sub-corpus, where it disambiguates only slightly more than 70% of tokens successfully.
    This may be due to the fact that only two partial taggers provide evidence for this grammatical category.
