mooth the probability estimates involved in some way.
    The second nonstructural problem with Model 1 is that it seems to align too few target words to the null source word.
    Anecdotal examination of Model 1 alignments of English source sentences with French target sentences reveals that null word alignments rarely occur in the highest probability alignment, despite the fact that French sentences often contain function words that do not correspond directly to anything in their English translation.
    For example, English phrases of the form (nouns)(noun&#65533;) are often expressed in French by a phrase of the form (noun&#65533;) de (nouns), which may also be expressed in English (but less often) by a phrase of the form (noun&#65533;) of (nouns).
    The structure of Model 1 again suggests why we should not be surprised by this problem.
    As normally defined, Model 1 hypothesizes only one null word per sentence.
    A target sentence may contain many words that ideally should be aligned to null, plus
