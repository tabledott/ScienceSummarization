erminal string in a finitely ambiguous context-free grammar is linearly bounded by the length of the terminal string.
    The proof of this fact is omitted for lack of space, but can be found elsewhere (Pereira and Warren.
    1983).
    General definite-clause proof procedures need to access the values of variables (bindings) in derived clauses.
    The structure-sharing method of representation makes the time to access a variable binding at worst linear in the length of the derivation.
    Furthermore, the number of variables to be looked up in a derivation step is at worst linear in the size of the derivation.
    Finally, the time (and space) to finish a derivation step, once all the relevant bindings are known, does not depend on the size of the derivation.
    Therefore, using this method for parsing offline-parsable grammars makes the time complexity of each step at worst o(n2) in the length of the input.
    Some simplifications are possible that improve that time bound.
    First, it is possible to u
