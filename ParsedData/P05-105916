ng corpus had 18,773 sentence pairs with a total of 276,113 Chinese words and 315,415 English words.
    We evaluate our translation models in terms of agreement with human-annotated word-level alignments between the sentence pairs.
    For scoring the Viterbi alignments of each system against goldstandard annotated alignments, we use the alignment error rate (AER) of Och and Ney (2000), which measures agreement at the level of pairs of words: where A is the set of word pairs aligned by the automatic system, GS is the set marked in the gold standard as &#8220;sure&#8221;, and GP is the set marked as &#8220;possible&#8221; (including the &#8220;sure&#8221; pairs).
    In our Chinese-English data, only one type of alignment was marked, meaning that GP = GS.
    In our hand-aligned data, 20 sentence pairs are less than or equal to 15 words in both languages, and were used as the test set for the first experiment, and 47 sentence pairs are no longer than 25 words in either language and were used to evaluate the p
