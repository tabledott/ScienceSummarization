POS labelling result indicates a word with POS t only if the boundary tag sequence composed of its boundary part conforms to s or bm*e style, and all POS tags in its POS part equal to t. For example, a tag sequence b NN m NN e NN represents a threecharacter word with POS tag NN.
  
  
    The perceptron algorithm introduced into NLP by Collins (2002), is a simple but effective discriminative training method.
    It has comparable performance to CRFs, while with much faster training.
    The perceptron has been used in many NLP tasks, such as POS tagging (Collins, 2002), Chinese word segmentation (Ng and Low, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2007) and so on.
    We trained a character-based perceptron for Chinese Joint S&amp;T, and found that the perceptron itself could achieve considerably high accuracy on segmentation and Joint S&amp;T.
    In following subsections, we describe the feature templates and the perceptron training algorithm.
    The feature templates we adopted are selected from those of Ng and Low (2004)
