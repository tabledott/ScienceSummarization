  Learning Extraction Patterns For Subjective Expressions
  
    This paper presents a bootstrapping process that learns linguistically rich extraction patterns for subjective (opinionated) expressions.
    High-precision classifiers label unannotated data to automatically create a large training set, which is then given to an extraction pattern learning algorithm.
    The learned patterns are then used to identify more subjective sentences.
    The bootstrapping process learns many subjective patterns and increases recall while maintaining high precision.
  
  
    Many natural language processing applications could benefit from being able to distinguish between factual and subjective information.
    Subjective remarks come in a variety of forms, including opinions, rants, allegations, accusations, suspicions, and speculations.
    Ideally, information extraction systems should be able to distinguish between factual information (which should be extracted) and non-factual information (which should be discar
