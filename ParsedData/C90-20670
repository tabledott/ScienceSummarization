	Word Sense Disambiguation With Very Large Neural Networks Extracted From Machine Readable Dictionaries
		In this paper, we describe a means for automatically building very large neural networks (VLNNs) from definition texts in machine-readable dictionaries, and demonslrate he use of these networks for word sense disambiguation.
		Our method brings together two earlier, independent approaches to word sense disambiguation: the use of machine-readable dictionaries and spreading and activation models.
		The automatic construction of VLNNs enables real-size xperiments with neural networks for natural language processing, which in turn provides insight into their behavior and design and can lead to possible improvements.
	
	
			Automated language understanding requires the determination f the concept which a given use of a word represents, a process referred to as word sense disambiguation (WSD).
			WSD is typically effected in natural llanguage processing systems by utilizing semantic teature lists for each word
