, as it prohibits the generation only of distinguishing descriptions with more than K properties, and for all practical purposes K can be small (referring expressions usually express a limited number of properties).
    Defining an upper bound K, however, does have a disadvantage: We lose completeness (see van Deemter [2002]).
    In particular, the algorithm will fail for objects that can be uniquely described only with K + 1 (or more) edges.
    Of course, one could argue that in such cases objects should be distinguished using other means (e.g., by pointing).
    Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to look for classes of graphs for which the subgraph isomorphism problem can be solved more efficiently, without postulating upper bounds.
    For instance, if G and H are planar (simple) graphs the problem can be solved in time linear in the number of vertices of G (Eppstein 1999).
    Basically, a planar graph is one that can be drawn on a plane in such a way that there are no crossing edges (thus, for instance, th
