d indeed verify these expectations.
  
  
    We have found that the Pk error metric for text segmentation algorithms is affected by the variation of segment size distribution, becoming slightly more lenient as the variance increases.
    It penalizes false positives significantly less than false negatives, particularly if the false positives are uniformly distributed throughout the document.
    It penalizes near-miss errors more than pure false positives of equal magnitude.
    Finally, it fails to take into account situations in which multiple boundaries occur between the two sides of the probe, and it often misses or underpenalizes mistakes in small segments.
    We proposed two modifications to tackle these problems.
    The first, which we call Pk, simply doubles the false positive penalty.
    This solves the problem of overpenalizing false negatives, but it is not effective at dealing with the other problems.
    The second, which we call WindowDiff (WD), counts the number of boundaries between the tw
