ly reliable 266 ground truth they provide when grading performance.
  Finally, we consider sense disambiguation for mediums other than clean English text.
  For example, we look at word pairs such as terse/tense and cookie/rookie which may be plausi- bly confused in optical character recognition (OCR).
  Homo- phones, such as aid~aide, and censor/sensor, are ideal can- didates for such a study because large data sets with known ground truth are available in written text, yet they are true ambiguities which must be resolved routinely in oral commu- nication.
  We discover that the central claims of this paper hold for all of these potential definitions of sense.
  This corroborating evidence makes us much more confident in our results than if they were derived solely from a relatively small hand-tagged data set.
  DEF IN IT IONS OF  COLLOCATION Collocation means the co-occurrence of two words in some defined relationship.
  We look at several such relationships, in- cluding direct adjacency and first word to t
