tively a parse (an almost parse).
    In the linguistic context, there can be many ways of increasing the complexity of descriptions of lexical items.
    The idea is to associate lexical items with descriptions that allow for all and only those elements on which the lexical item imposes constraints to be within the same description.
    Further, it is necessary to associate each lexical item with as many descriptions as the number of different syntactic contexts in which the lexical item can appear.
    This, of course, increases the local ambiguity for the parser.
    The parser has to decide which complex description out of the set of descriptions associated with each lexical item is to be used for a given reading of a sentence, even before combining the descriptions together.
    The obvious solution is to put the burden of this job entirely on the parser.
    The parser will eventually disambiguate all the descriptions and pick one per lexical item, for a given reading of the sentence.
    However, there
