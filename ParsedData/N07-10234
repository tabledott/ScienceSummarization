and we will call this restricted grammar a deletion SCFG.
    For instance, a deletion SCFG rule that removes an adverbial phrase (ADVP) between an noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP) may be written as follows: In a sentence compression framework similar to the one presented by K&amp;M, we build SCFGs that are fully trainable from a corpus of document and reduced sentences.
    Such an approach comprises two subproblems: (1) transform tree pairs into synchronous grammar derivations; (2) based on these derivations, assign probabilities to deletion SCFG productions, and more generally, to compressions produced by such grammars.
    Since the main point of our paper lies in the exploration of better probability estimates through Markovization and lexicalization of SCFGs, we first address the latter problem, and discuss the task of building synchronous derivations only later in Section 4.
    The overall goal of a sentence compression system is to transform a given input sentence f into a concise and grammati
