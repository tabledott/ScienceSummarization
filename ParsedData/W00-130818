he VBNBP and VBD/VBN confusions.
    Below is the performance on the test set of the resulting model when features for disambiguating verb forms are added to the model of Section 2.
    The number of VBNBP confusions was reduced by 23.1% as compared to the baseline.
    The number of VBD/VBN confusions was reduced by 12.3%.
    96.83% 86.87%
  
  
    As discussed in section 1.3 above, the task of determining RB/RP/IN tags for words like down, out, up is difficult and in particular examples, there are often no good local syntactic indicators.
    For instance, in (2), we find the exact same sequence of parts of speech, but (2a) is a particle use of on, while (2b) is a prepositional use.
    Consequently, the accuracy on the rarer RP (particles) category is as low as 41.5% for the Baseline model (cf.
    Table 4).
    (2) a. Kim took on the monster. b. Kim sat on the monster.
    We tried to improve the tagger's capability to resolve these ambiguities through adding information on verbs' preferences to take sp
