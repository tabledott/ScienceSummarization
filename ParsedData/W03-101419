ive and passive voices to behave so differently.
    To understand why this is so, we looked in the training data and found that the passive voice is often used to query someone about a specific opinion.
    For example, here is one such sentence from our training set: &#8220;Ernest Bai Koroma of RITCORP was asked to address his supporters on his views relating to &#8216;full blooded Temne to head APC&#8217;.&#8221; In contrast, many of the sentences containing asked in the active voice are more general in nature, such as &#8220;The mayor asked a newly formed JR about his petition.&#8221; Figure 3 also shows that expressions using talk as a noun (e.g., &#8220;Fred is the talk of the town&#8221;) are highly correlated with subjective sentences, while talk as a verb (e.g., &#8220;The mayor will talk about...&#8221;) are found in a mix of subjective and objective sentences.
    Not surprisingly, longer expressions tend to be more idiomatic (and subjective) than shorter expressions (e.g., put an end (to) vs. put;
