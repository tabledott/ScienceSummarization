  An Unsupervised Approach To Recognizing Discourse Relations
  
    We present an unsupervised approach to discourse relations of hold between arbitrary spans of texts.
    We show that discourse relation classifiers trained on examples that are automatically extracted from massive amounts of text can be used to distinguish between some of these relations with accuracies as high as 93%, even when the relations are not explicitly marked by cue phrases.
  
  
    In the field of discourse research, it is now widely agreed that sentences/clauses are usually not understood in isolation, but in relation to other sentences/clauses.
    Given the high level of interest in explaining the nature of these relations and in providing definitions for them (Mann and Thompson, 1988; Hobbs, 1990; Martin, 1992; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Hovy and Maier, 1993; Knott and Sanders, 1998), it is surprising that there are no robust programs capable of identifying discourse relations that hold between arbitrary spans of text.
