    Unknown source phrases are substituted by the back-translated paraphrases and translation proceeds on the paraphrases.
    In line with previous work, we exploit multiple source corpora to alleviate data sparseness and increase translation coverage.
    However, we differ in several important respects.
    Our method operates over phrases rather than sentences.
    We propose a generative formulation which treats triangulation not as a post-processing step but as part of the translation model itself.
    The induced phrase-table entries are fed directly into the decoder, thus avoiding the additional inefficiencies of merging the output of several translation systems.
    Although related to Callison-Burch et al. (2006) our method is conceptually simpler and more general.
    Phrase-table entries are created via multiple source languages without the intermediate step of paraphrase extraction, thereby reducing the exposure to compounding errors.
    Our phrase-tables may well contain paraphrases but these
