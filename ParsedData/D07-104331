re included only a randomly selected 10% sample of H* accents, providing a more even distribution of pitch accent types for clustering: H* (54.4%), L*(32.1%), L+H* (26.5%), L*+H (2.8%), H+!H* (2.1%).We extracted ten acoustic features from each ac cented word to serve as the clustering space for this experiment.
			Using Praat?s (Boersma, 2001) Get Pitch (ac)... function, we calculated the mean F0and ?F0, as well as z-score speaker normalized ver sions of the same.
			We included in the feature vector the relative location of the maximum pitch value inthe word as well as the distance between this max5Pitch accents containing a high tone may also be downstepped, or spoken in a compressed pitch range.
			Here we col lapsed all DOWNSTEPPED instances of each pitch accent with the corresponding non-downstepped instances.
			417 imum and the point of maximum intensity.
			Finally, we calculated the raw and speaker normalized slope from the start of the word to the maximum pitch, and from the maximum pitch to the end
