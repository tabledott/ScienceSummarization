    Donald&#8217;s features include compression bigrams, as well as soft syntactic evidence extracted from parse trees and dependency trees.
    The strength of McDonald&#8217;s approach partially stems from its robustness against redundant and noisy features, since each feature is weighted proportionally to its discriminative power, and his approach is thus hardly penalized by uninformative features.
    In contrast, our work puts much more emphasis on feature analysis than on efficient optimization, and relies on a statistical framework (maximum-likelihood estimates) that strives for careful feature selection and combination.
    It also describes and evaluates models inco
