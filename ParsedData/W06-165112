			EntitiesWe develop two separate sequence tagging classi fiers for opinion extraction and source extraction, using linear-chain Conditional Random Fields(CRFs) (Lafferty et al, 2001).
			The sequence tag ging is encoded as the typical ?BIO?
			scheme.4Each training or test instance represents a sen tence, encoded as a linear chain of tokens and their 4?B? is for the token that begins an entity, ?I? is for to kens that are inside an entity, and ?O? is for tokens outside an entity.
			433 associated features.
			Our feature set is based on that of Choi et al (2005) for source extraction5,but we include additional lexical and WordNet based features.
			For simplicity, we use the same features for opinion entity extraction and sourceextraction, and let the CRFs learn appropriate fea ture weights for each task.
			3.1 Entity extraction features.
			For each token xi, we include the following fea tures.
