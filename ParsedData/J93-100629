n be stochastically modeled as 0( NAT), the factor by which the standard deviation of a sum of n independent and identically distributed random variables multiplies) We construct the initial AST using a function that pairs single sentences near the middle of the text with as many as 0(Vii) sentences in the other text; it is generously designed to admit all but the most improbable associations.
    Experience shows that because of this policy the results are highly insensitive to the particular function used to build this initial table.'
    The main body of the relaxation process consists of the following steps: Build the WAT.
    For all sentences 5A in the first text, each word in sA is compared with each word in those sentences 53 of the second text that are considered as candidates for correspondence, Le., for which (0,58) E AST.
    A pair of words is entered into the WAT if the distributions of the two words in their texts are sufficiently similar and if the total number of occurrences indicates that th
