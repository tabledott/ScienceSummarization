 different insights into the linguistic phenomena found in text.
    In section 3.5, we describe how the HMM implementation itself supports tuning.
    In addition, our implementation supports a number of explicit parameters to facilitate tuning and reuse, including specification of lexicon and training corpus.
    There is also support for a flexible tagset.
    For example, if we want to collapse distinctions in the lexicon, such as those between positive, comparative, and superlative adjectives, we only have to make a small change in the mapping from lexicon to tagset.
    Similarly, if we wish to make finer grain distinctions than those available in the lexicon, such as case marking on pronouns, there is a simple way to note such exceptions.
  
  
    We have used the tagger in a number of applications.
    We describe three applications here: phrase recognition; word sense disambiguation; and grammatical function assignment.
    These projects are part of a research effort to use shallow analysis techniq
