 guarantees, such as guaranteed convergence and the possibility of a certificate of optimality.
    These guarantees are possible because our algorithms directly solve an LP relaxation.
    Other work has considered LP or integer linear programming (ILP) formulations of inference in NLP (Martins et al., 2009; Riedel and Clarke, 2006; Roth and Yih, 2005).
    These approaches typically use general-purpose LP or ILP solvers.
    Our method has the advantage that it leverages underlying structure arising in LP formulations of NLP problems.
    We will see that dynamic programming algorithms such as CKY can be considered to be very efficient solvers for particular LPs.
    In dual decomposition, these LPs&#8212;and their efficient solvers&#8212;can be embedded within larger LPs corresponding to more complex inference problems.
  
  
    We now describe the type of models used throughout the paper.
    We take some care to set up notation that will allow us to make a clear connection between inference problems and
