 were used for the present study to condition the probability of the rule, A a, are presented in Figure 4, in a tree structure.
    This is a sort of decision tree for a tree-walking algorithm to decide what value to return, for a given partial tree and a given depth.
    For example, if the algorithm is asked for the value at level 0, it will return A, the left-hand side of the rule being expanded.&amp;quot; Suppose the algorithm is asked for the value at level 4.
    After level 2 there is a branch in the decision tree.
    If the left-hand side of the rule is a POS, and there is no sibling to the left of constituent (A) in the derivation, then the algorithm takes the right branch of the decision tree to decide what value to return; otherwise the left branch.
    Suppose it takes the left branch.
    Then after level 3, there is another branch in the decision tree.
    If the left-hand side of the production is a POS, then the algorithm takes the right branch of the decision tree, and returns (at level 4) t
