 highly valued than those in which they are affiliated with low-frequency signatures; it is thus of capital importance not to underestimate the total frequency of a signature.'
    When two signatures as we have defined them here are collapsed, there are two major effects on the description length: pointers to the merged signature are shorter&#8212;leading to a shorter total description length&#8212;but, in general, predicted frequencies of the corn30 As long as we keep the total number of words fixed, the global task of minimizing description length can generally be obtained by the local strategy of finding the largest cohort for a group of forms to associate with: if the same data can be analyzed in two ways, with the data forming groups of sizes {q} in one case, and {a2, }in the other, maximal compression is obtained by choosing the case (k = 1,2) for which is the greatest.
