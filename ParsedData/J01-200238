ring training, in the sequence in which they were derived.
    This means that application of the rules is fully deterministic.
    Corpus statistics have been at the basis of selecting the rule sequence, but the resulting tagger does not explicitly use a probabilistic model.
    3.2.2 Memory-Based Learning.
    Another learning method that does not explicitly manipulate probabilities is machine-based learning.
    However, rather than extracting a concise set of rules, memory-based learning focuses on storing all examples of a task in memory in an efficient way (see Section 2.3).
    New examples are then classified by similarity-based reasoning from these stored examples.
    A tagger using this learning method, MBT, was proposed by Daelemans et al. (1996).18 During the training phase, the training corpus is transformed into two case bases, one which is to be used for known words and one for unknown words.
    The cases are stored in an IGTree (a heuristically indexed version of a case memory Paelemans, Van
