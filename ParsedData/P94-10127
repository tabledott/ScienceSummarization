ability is their length.
    Note that there are other length-based alignment methods that measure length in number of words instead of characters (Brown et al. 1991).
    However, since Chinese text consists of an unsegmented character stream without marked word boundaries, it would not be possible to count the number of words in a sentence without first parsing it.
    Although it has been suggested that lengthbased methods are language-independent (Gale Sz Church 1991; Brown et al. 1991), they may in fact rely to some extent on length correlations arising from the historical relationships of the languages being aligned.
    If translated sentences share cognates, then the character lengths of those cognates are of course correlated.
    Grammatical similarities between related languages may also produce correlations in sentence lengths.
    Moreover, the combinatorics of non-IndoEuropean languages can depart greatly from IndoEuropean languages.
    In Chinese, the majority of words are just one or two char
