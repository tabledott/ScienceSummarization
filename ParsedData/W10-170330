e of the additional restriction we placed on US workers.
    13We suspect that newly registered workers on MTurk already start with an &#8220;approval rating&#8221; of 100%, and so requiring a high approval rating alone might not guard against new workers.
    It is not entirely clear if our suspicion is true, but our past experiences with MTurk usually involved a noticeably faster completion rate than what we experienced this time around, indicating our suspicion might very well be correct.
    Table 10: Statistics for data collected on MTurk for the ranking task.
    In total, 55,082 rank labels were collected across the eight language pairs (145% of expert data).
    Each language pair had 600 sets, and we requested each set completed by 5 different workers.
    Since each set provides 5 labels, we could have potentially obtained 600 x 5 x 5 = 15,000 labels for each language pair.
    The Label count row indicates to what extent that potential was met (over the 30-day lifetime of our tasks), and the &#8220
