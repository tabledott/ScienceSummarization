etation of the underlying semantics.
    Several researchers have tackled the syntactic analysis (Lauer, 1995; Pustejovsky et al., 1993; Liberman and Sproat, 1992), usually using a variation of the idea of finding the subconstituents elsewhere in the corpus and using those to predict how the larger compounds are structured.
    We are interested in the third task, interpretation of the underlying semantics.
    Most related work relies on hand-written rules of one kind or another.
    Finin (1980) examines the problem of noun compound interpretation in detail, and constructs a complex set of rules.
    Vanderwende (1994) uses a sophisticated system to extract semantic information automatically from an on-line dictionary, and then manipulates a set of hand-written rules with handassigned weights to create an interpretation.
    Rindflesch et al. (2000) use hand-coded rule based systems to extract the factual assertions from biomedical text.
    Lapata (2000) classifies nominalizations according to whether the
