too large even for a small n. When evaluated on simultaneous learning of named entities and relations, our approach not only provides a significant improvement in the predictors&#8217; accuracy; more importantly, it provides coherent solutions.
    While many statistical methods make &#8220;stupid&#8221; mistakes (i.e., inconsistency among predictions), that no human ever makes, as we show, our approach improves also the quality of the inference significantly.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 formally defines our problem and section 3 describes the computational approach we propose.
    Experimental results are given in section 4, followed by some discussion and conclusion in section 5.
  
  
    We consider the relational inference problem within the reasoning with classifiers paradigm, and study a specific but fairly general instantiation of this problem, motivated by the problem of recognizing named entities (e.g., persons, locations, organization names) and relations betwee
