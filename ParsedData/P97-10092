 and Lee's experiment, 192,800 occurrences of 191 words were used as training examples.
    There are thousands of polysemous words, e.g., there are 11,562 polysemous nouns in WordNet.
    For every polysemous word to occur thousands of times each, the corpus must contain billions of words.
    Secondly, learning to disambiguate a word from the previous usages of the same word means that whatever was learned for one word is not used on other words, which obviously missed generality in natural languages.
    Thirdly, these algorithms cannot deal with words for which classifiers have not been learned.
    In this paper, we present a WSD algorithm that relies on a different intuition: (2) Two different words are likely to have similar meanings if they occur in identical local contexts.
    Consider the sentence: (3) The new facility will employ 500 of the existing 600 employees The word &amp;quot;facility&amp;quot; has 5 possible meanings in WordNet 1.5 (Miller, 1990): (a) installation, (b) proficiency/technique
