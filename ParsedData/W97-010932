he accuracy of the PP attachment falls substantially.
    We have conducted an experiment, in which the disambiguated senses of the testing set were replaced by the most frequent senses, i.e. the first senses as defined in WordNet.
    This caused a substantial reduction of accuracy to 76.5%.
    The fact that our approximate disambiguation (algorithm in Chapter 2) leads to 88.1% correct PP attachment is partly to be attributed to the positive bias of disambiguation of the testing examples against the same training set which is also used for the decision tree induction.
    The disambiguation errors are thus hidden by their replication in both the training and the testing sets.
    As we have already mentioned, Collins and Brooks [C&amp;B951 based their method on matching the testing quadruples against the set of training examples.
    The decision on the attachment was made according to which attachment type had a higher count in the training corpus.
    If no match for the given quadruple was found, the alg
