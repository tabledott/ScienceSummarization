 los hombres:..., decia&#8217;s head is given as decirlo, although the main verbs of relative clauses are normally dependent on what the relative modifies, in this case the article Lo.
    A quick look at unlabeled attachment accuracies indicate that errors in Arabic parsing are the most common across all languages: prepositions (62%), conjunctions (69%) and to a lesser extent verbs (73%).
    Similarly, for labeled accuracy, the hardest edges to label are for dependents of verbs, i.e., subjects, objects and adverbials.
    Note the difference in error between the unlabeled parser and the edge labeler: the former makes mistakes on edges into prepositions, conjunctions and verbs, and the latter makes mistakes on edges into nouns (subject/objects).
    Each stage by itself is relatively accurate (unlabeled accuracy is 79% and labeling accuracy3 is also 79%), but since there is very little overlap in the kinds of errors each makes, overall labeled accuracy drops to 67%.
    This drop is not nearly as significant
