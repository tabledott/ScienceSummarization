Lin (1998b) has shown it to be a special case of his measure in which all child?parent probabilities are equal.
  6 In their original experiments, Lin and Jiang and Conrath used SemCor, a sense-tagged subset of the Brown Corpus, as their empirical data; but we decided to follow Resnik in using the full and untagged corpus.
  While this means trading accuracy for size, we believe that using a non-disambiguated corpus constitutes a more-general approach, as the availability and size of disambiguated texts such as SemCor is highly limited.
