ding distance features that measure abs ( E &#8722; k ); orthographic features; word frequencies; common-word features; a bias term set always to 1; and an HMM approximation cor(Ej+1, Fk+1).
    Because of the modularity of the structured output SVM, our SVM ITG re-uses a large amount infrastructure from the matching solution.
    We essentially plug an ITG parser in the place of the matching algorithm, and add features to take advantage of information made available by the parser. x remains a sentence pair, and y becomes an ITG parse tree that decomposes x and specifies an alignment.
    Our required components are as follows: The OT vector has two new features in addition to those present in the matching system&#8217;s O.
    These features can be active only for non-terminal productions, which have the form A &#8212;* [AA]  |(AA).
    One feature indicates an inverted production A &#8212;* (AA), while the other indicates the use of an invalid span according to a provided English dependency tree, as describ
