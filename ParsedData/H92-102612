nemon- ics, 10% of the constituent mnemonics, and 5% of the mnemonic productions actually contributed to parses of test sentences.
  Grammar  and  Mode l  Per fo rmance Met r i cs To evaluate the performance of a grammar and an ac- companying model, we use two types of measurements: ?
  the any-consistent rate, defined as the percentage of sentences for which the correct parse is proposed among the many parses that the grammar provides for a sentence.
  We also measure the parse base, which is defined as the geometric mean of the num- ber of proposed parses on a per word basis, to quan- tify the ambiguity of the grammar.
  the Viterbi rate defined as the percentage of sen- tences for which the most likely parse is consistent.
  The arty-consistent ra e is a measure of the grammars coverage of linguistic phenomena.
  The Viterbi rate eval- uates the grammars  coverage with the statistical model imposed on the grammar.
  The goal of probabilistic modelling is to produce a Viterbi rate close to the arty- consist
