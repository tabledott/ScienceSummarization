tiplication approach (Sarawagi and Kirpal 2004), which is based on the wellknown observation that a scalar product of two vectors depends only on the coordinates for which both vectors have non-zero values.
    Further, we observe that most commonly used similarity scores for feature vectors x&#65533; and y&#65533;, such as cosine and Dice, can be decomposed into three values: one depending only on features of x&#65533;, another depending only on features of y&#65533;, and the third depending on the features shared both by x&#65533; and y&#65533;.
    More formally, commonly used similarity scores F(x&#65533;, y) can be expressed as: and f3 for some common similarity functions.
    For each of these scores, f2 = f3.
    In our work, we compute all of these scores, but report our results using only the cosine function.
    Let A and B be two matrices of PMI feature vectors.
    Our task is to compute the similarity between all vectors in A and all vectors in B.
