ic pattern acquisition.
    Pattern acquisition is considered important for a variety of &#8220;text understanding&#8221; tasks, though our particular reference will be to Information Extraction (IE).
    In IE, the objective is to search through text for entities and events of a particular kind&#8212;corresponding to the user&#8217;s interest.
    Many current systems achieve this by pattern matching.
    The problem of recall, or coverage, in IE can then be restated to a large extent as a problem of acquiring a comprehensive set of good patterns which are relevant to the scenario of interest, i.e., which describe events occurring in this scenario.
    Among the approaches to pattern acquisition recently proposed, unsupervised methods' have gained some popularity, due to the substantial reduction in amount of manual labor they require.
    We build upon these approaches for learning IE patterns.
    The focus of this paper is on the problem of convergence in unsupervised methods.
    As with a variety of rel
