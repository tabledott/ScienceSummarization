h-string for any finite-state transducer T is a (possibly empty) sequence of symbol-pairs u1: v1 u2: v2 .
    . un : vn that label the transitions of an accepting path in T. The path-language of T, notated as Paths(T), is simply the set of all path-strings for T. Paths(T) is obviously regular, since it is accepted by the finite-state machine constructed simply by interpreting the transition labels of T as elements of an alphabet of unanalyzable pair-symbols.
    Also, if P is a finite-state machine that accepts a pair-symbol language, we define the path-relation Rel(P) to be the relation accepted by the fst constructed from P by reinterpreting every one of its pair-symbol labels as the corresponding symbol pair of a transducer label.
    It is clear for all fsts T that Rel(M(Paths(T))) = R(T), the relation accepted by T. Now suppose that R1 and R2 are regular relations accepted by the transducers Ti and T2, respectively, and note that Paths(TI) n Paths(T2) is in fact a regular language of pair-symbols accepte
