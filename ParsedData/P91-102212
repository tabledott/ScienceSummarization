3 shows the two-state Markov model that we use for generating beads.
    We assume that a single sentence in one language lines up with zero, one, or two sentences in the other and that paragraph markers may be deleted.
    Thus, we allow any of the eight beads shown in Table 2.
    We also assume that Pt (e) = Pr (f), Pr (eff ) = Pr (eef ), and Pr ([e) = Pr(f f).
  
  
    Given a bead, we determine the lengths of the sentences it contains as follows.
    We assume the probability of an English sentence of length te given an e-bead to be the same as the probability of an English sentence of length Ce in the text as a. whole.
    We denote this probability by Nee).
    Similarly, we assume the probability of a French sentence of length ef given an f-bead to be Pr (e.f).
    For an ef-bead, we assume that the English sentence has length ee with probability Pr (se) and that log of the ratio of length of the French sentence to the length of the English sentence is normally distributed with mean p and variance a2
