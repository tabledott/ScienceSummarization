 work is that each candidate term is scored independently of other terms.
    We score a group of related terms rather than each term at a time.
    Future work may enhance our simple head-word frequency score and may take into account additional relationships between terms, including common words in modifying positions.
    Termight uses a part-of-speech tagger to identify candidate noun phrases.
    Justeson and Katz (1993) only consult a lexicon and consider all the possible parts of speech of a word.
    In particular, every word that can be a noun according to the lexicon is considered as a noun in each of its occurrences.
    Their method thus yields some incorrect noun phrases that will not be proposed by a tagger, but on the other hand does not miss noun phrases that may be missed due to tagging errors.
