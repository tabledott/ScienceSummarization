 data (see also Dagan, Marcus, and Makovitch [1992] and Dagan, Pereira, and Lee [19941).
    More specifically, conditional probabilities of words are smoothed by taking the weighted average of those of similar words using the similarity measure as the weights.
    The advantage of this approach is that it does not rely on any prior knowledge, but it appears difficult to find a smoothing method that is both efficient and theoretically sound.
    As an alternative, a number of authors have proposed the use of class-based models, which assign (conditional) probability values to (existing) classes of words, rather than individual words.
    An example of the class-based approach is Resnik's method of generalizing values of a case frame slot using a thesaurus and the so-called selectional association measure (Resnik 1993a, 1993b).
    The selectional association, denoted A(C I v, r), is defined as follows: where C is a class of nouns present in a given thesaurus, v is a verb and r is a slot name, as described ear
