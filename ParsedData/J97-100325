    They are &amp;quot;clumped&amp;quot; together, and it is these clumps or groups that TextTiling assumes are indicative of the subtopic structure.
    The problem of segmentation therefore becomes the problem of detecting where these clumps begin and end.
    For example, words binary through planet have considerable overlap in sentences 58 to 78, and correspond to the subtopic discussion Binary/trinary star systems make life unlikely shown in the (manually produced) outline in Section 1.
    There is also a well-demarcated cluster of terms between sentences 35 and 50, corresponding to the grouping together of paragraphs 10, 11, and 12 by human judges who have read the text, and to the subtopic discussion in Section 1 of How the moon helped life evolve on earth.
    These observations suggest that a very simple take on lexical cohesion relations (Halliday and Hasan 1976) can be used to determine subtopic boundaries.
    However, from the diagram it is evident that simply looking for chains of repea
