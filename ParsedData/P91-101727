Ctiqval, and not by `sikkuy'.
    The reason for this problem is that after producing the possible target alternatives, our model ignores the source language input as it uses only a monolingual target corpus.
    This can be solved if we use an aligned bilingual corpus, as suggested by Sadler (1989) and Brown et al. (1990).

    This resource is much more expensive and less available than the untagged monolingual corpus, while it seems to be necessary only for relatively rare situations.
    Lack of deep understanding.
    By their nature, statistical methods rely on large quantities of shallow informati
