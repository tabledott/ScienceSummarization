an be interpreted as the percentage of operations saved by starting from C versus starting from the baseline.
			We aim to construct a clustering consistent with A as opposed to a clustering identical to A because some senses in A may not exist in the corpus used to generate C. In our experiments, we extract answer classes from WordNet.
			The word dog belongs to both the Person and Animal classes.
			However, in the newspaper corpus, the Person sense of dog is at best extremely rare.
			There is no reason to expect a clustering algorithm to discover this sense of dog.
			The baseline distance dist(B, A) is exactly the number of elements to be clustered.
			We made the assumption that each element belongs to exactly one cluster.
			The transforma tion procedure is as follows: 1.
			Suppose there are m classes in the answer.
			key.
			We start with a list of m empty sets, each of which is labeled with a class in the answer key.
			2.
			For each cluster, merge it with the set.
