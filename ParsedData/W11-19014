is lessens the reliability of statistical evidence in the form of lexical coverage and semantic relatedness that could be derived from the data and used by a classifier to generate better predictive models.
    The importance of a well-defined tagging scheme and consistent ITA has been well recognized and studied in the past (Poesio, 2004; Poesio and Artstein, 2005; Passonneau, 2004).
    There is a growing consensus that in order for these to be most useful for language understanding applications such as question answering or distillation &#8211; both of which seek to take information access technology to the next level &#8211; we need more consistent annotation of larger amounts of broad coverage data for training better automatic techniques for entity and event identification.
    Identification and encoding of richer knowledge &#8211; possibly linked to knowledge sources &#8211; and development of learning algorithms that would effectively incorporate them is a necessary next step towards improving the cu
