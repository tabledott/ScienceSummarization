ariety of noncontiguous structures and dependen- cies.
  A wide range of Treebank users now strongly desire a level of annotation that makes explicit some form of predicate-argument structure.
  The desired level of rep- resentation would make explicit the logical subject and logical object of the verb, and would indicate, at least in clear cases, which subconstituents serve as arguments of the underlying predicates and which serve as modifiers.
  During the next phase of the Treebank project, we expect o provide both a richer analysis of the existing corpus and a parallel corpus of predicate-argument structures.
  This will be done by first enriching the annotation of the current corpus, and then automatically extracting predicate-argument structure, at the level of distinguishing logical subjects and objects, and distinguishing arguments from adjuncts for clear cases.
  Enrichment will be achieved by automatically transforming the current Penn Treebank into a level of structure close to the intended target,
