tionally, a unit of probability was implicitly assumed to correspond to a meaningful linguistic structure; a tagging of a word or an application of a rewriting rule.
    One reason for the assumption is to enable dynamic programming algorithms, such as the Viterbi algorithm.
    The probability of a complete structure must be decomposed into atomic structures in which ambiguities are limited to a tractable size.
    Another reason is to estimate plausible probabilities.
    Because a probability is defined over atomic structures, they should also be meaningful so as to be assigned a probability.
    In feature forest models, however, conjunctive nodes are responsible for the former, whereas feature functions are responsible for the latter.
    Although feature functions must be defined locally in conjunctive nodes, they are not necessarily equivalent.
    Conjunctive nodes may represent any fragments of a complete structure, which are not necessarily linguistically meaningful.
    They should be designed to p
