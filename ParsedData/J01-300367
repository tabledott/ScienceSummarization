ay distinction among the classes&#8212;although the aggregate data revealed little difference in these feature values between unaccusatives and objectdrops.
    Comparing the third to the first panel of Table 15, we observe that the addition of the PASS feature hinders the discriminability of unergatives and unaccusatives (increasing errors from 2 to 5); it does help in discriminating the other pairs of classes, but only slightly (reducing the number of errors by 1 in each case).
    The VBN feature shows a similar pattern, but is much more helpful at distinguishing unergatives from object-drops, and object-drops from unaccusatives.
    In comparing the fourth to the first panel of Table 15, we find that the confusability of unergatives and objectdrops is reduced from 9 errors to 7, and of unaccusatives and object-drops from 10 errors to 6.
    The latter result is somewhat surprising, since the aggregate VBN data for the unaccusative and object-drop classes are virtually identical.
    We conclude that contr
