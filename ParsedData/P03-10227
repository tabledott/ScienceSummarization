guage (as opposed to written text).
    The same is true for anaphors with non-NP-antecedents.
    However, while they are far more frequent in spoken language than in written text, they still constitute only a fraction of all coreferential expressions in our corpus.
    This defines an upper limit for what the resolution of these kinds of anaphors can contribute at all.
    These facts have to be kept in mind when comparing our results to results of coreference resolution in written text.
    Training and test data instances were generated from our corpus as follows.
    All markables were sorted in document order, and markables for first and second person pronouns were removed.
    The resulting list was then processed from top to bottom.
    If the list contained an NP-markable at the current position and if this markable was not an indefinite noun phrase, it was considered a potential anaphor.
    In that case, pairs of potentially coreferring expressions were generated by combining the potential anaphor
