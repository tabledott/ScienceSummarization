of (Carreras, 2007), using a two-stage semi-supervised learning approach.
    We conduct experiments on dependency parsing of English (on Penn Treebank data) and Czech (on the Prague Dependency Treebank).
    Our experiments investigate the effectiveness of: 1) the basic SS-SCM for dependency parsing; 2) a combination of the SS-SCM with Koo et al. (2008)&#8217;s semisupervised approach (even in the case we used the same unlabeled data for both methods); 3) the twostage semi-supervised learning approach that inIn this model v1, ... , vk are scalar parameters that may be positive or negative; q1 ... qk are functions (in fact, generative models), that are trained on unlabeled data.
    The vj parameters will dictate the relative strengths of the functions q1 ... qk, and will be trained on labeled data.
    For convenience, we will use v to refer to the vector of parameters v1 ... vk, and q to refer to the set of generative models q1 ... qk.
    The full model is specified by values for w, v, and q.
    We will w
