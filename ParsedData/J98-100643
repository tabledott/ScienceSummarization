cult for the classifier to distinguish, due to a high degree of overlap in the training contexts.
    Problems of this sort can be detected even before testing, by computing correlations between the vectors of open-class words for the different senses.
    The cosine correlation between the 'activity' and 'product' senses of work is r = .49, indicating a high degree of overlap.
    The mean correlation between pairs of senses for the other words in Table 7 is r = .31.
  
  
    Our evidence indicates that local context is superior to topical context as an indicator of word sense when using a statistical classifier.
    The benefits of adding topical to local context alone depend on syntactic category as well as on the characteristics of the individual word.
    The three words studied yielded three different patterns; a substantial benefit for the noun line, slightly less for the verb serve, and none for the adjective hard.
    Some word senses are simply not limited to specific topics, and appear freely in m
