 probabilities to NPs such as [NP yesterday the dog] in sentences such as Yesterday the dog barked. nonterminal is an NPB.
    Specifically, equations (5) and (6) are modified to be The modifier and previous-modifier nonterminals are always adjacent, so the distance variable is constant and is omitted.
    For the purposes of this model, L0(l0) and R0(r0) are defined to be H(h).
    The probability of the previous example is now Coordination constructions are another example in which the independence assumptions in the basic models fail badly (at least given the current annotation method in the treebank).
    Figure 9 shows how coordination is annotated in the treebank.12 To use an example to illustrate the problems, take the rule NP(man) &#8594; NP(man) CC(and) NP(dog), which has probability The independence assumptions mean that the model fails to learn that there is always exactly one phrase following the coordinator (CC).
    The basic probability models will give much too high probabilities to unlikely p
