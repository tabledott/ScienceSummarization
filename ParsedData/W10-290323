cate which logical symbols are usually composed together, without considering their alignment to text.
  
  
    In this section we describe our experimental setup, which includes the details of the domain, resources and parameters.
    We evaluate our system on the Geoquery domain as described previously.
    The domain consists of a database and Prolog query language for U.S. geographical facts.
    The corpus contains of 880 natural language queries paired with Prolog logical form queries ((x, z) pairs).
    We follow previous approaches and transform these queries into a functional representation.
    We randomly select 250 sentences for training and 250 sentences for testing.6 We refer to the training set as Response 250 (R250) indicating that each example x in this data set has a corresponding desired database response r. We refer the testing set as Query 250 (Q250) where the examples only contain the natural language queries.
    6Our inference problem is less constrained than previous approaches thus
