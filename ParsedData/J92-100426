 control strategies in the best-first search algorithm, it is impossible to predict the computational load for a spoken-input mode.
    This section describes how TINA handles several issues that are often considered to be part of the task of a parser.
    These include agreement constraints, semantic restrictions, Stephanie Seneff TINA: A Natural Language System for Spoken Language Applications subject-tagging for verbs, and long distance movement (often referred to as gaps, or the trace, as in &amp;quot;(which article), do you think I should read (t1)?&amp;quot;) (Chomsky 1977).
    The gap mechanism resembles the Hold register idea of ATNs (Woods 1970) and the treatment of bounded domination metavariables in lexical functional grammars (LFGs) (Bresnan 1982, p. 235 ff.
    ), but it is different from these in that the process of filling the Hold register equivalent involves two steps separately initiated by two independent nodes.
    Our approach to the design of a constraint mechanism is to establish a fra
