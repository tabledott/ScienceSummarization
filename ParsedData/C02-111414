999)).
			Since the algorithms used are in many waysvery similar, this improvement demands expla nation.Some of the difference in accuracy can be at tributed to the corpora used.
			The experiments in (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) were performed on the 500,000 word MUC-4 corpus, and those of (Roark and Charniak, 1998) were performedusing MUC-4 and the Wall Street Journal cor pus (some 30 million words).
			Our model was built using the British National Corpus (100 million words).
			On the other hand, our modelwas built using only a part-of-speech tagged cor pus.
			The high accuracy achieved thus questions the conclusion drawn by Roark and Charniak (1998) that ?parsing is invaluable?.
			Our results clearly indicate that a large PoS-tagged corpusmay be much better for automatic lexical ac quisition than a small fully-parsed corpus.
			This claim could of course be tested by comparing techniques on the same corpus.To evaluate the advantage of using PoS infor mation, we compared the graph model with asimilarity
