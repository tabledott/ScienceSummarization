ventional metaphors by finding systematic differences in selectional preferences between domains.
    For instance, if CorMet were to find a sentence like Funds poured into his bank account in a document from the FINANCE domain, it could infer that in that domain, pour has a selection preference for financial assets in its subject.
    By comparing this selectional preference with pour&#8217;s selectional preferences in the LAB domain, CorMet can infer a metaphorical mapping from money to liquids.
    By finding sets of co-occuring interconcept mappings (like the above mapping and a mapping from investments to containers, for instance), Cormet can articulate the higher-order structure of conceptual metaphors.
    Note that Cormet is designed to detect higherorder conceptual metaphors by finding some of the sentences embodying some of the interconcept mappings constituting the metaphor of interest but is not designed to be a tool for reliably detecting all instances of a particular metaphor.
