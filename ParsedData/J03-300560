based probability estimation and address the question of how to find a suitable level of generalization in a hierarchy (i.e., WordNet).
    The results of the three methods used on the two data sets are shown in Table 15.
    We employed the same pseudodisambiguation method to test whether Web-based frequencies can be used for distinguishing between seen and artificially constructed unseen bigrams.
    We obtained the data sets of Rooth et al. (1999), Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth (2000), and Clark and Weir (2002) described above.
    Given a set of (v, n, v') triples, the task was to decide whether (v, n) or (v', n) was the correct pair.
    We obtained AltaVista counts for f (v, n), f (v', n), f (v), and f (v') as described in Section 2.3.9 Then we used two models for pseudodisambiguation: the joint probability model compared the joint probability estimates f (v, n) and f (v', n) and predicted that the bigram with the highest estimate is the seen one.
    The conditional probability model compared the condit
