ded (the difference in performance is statistically significant, as determined by a signed test, at a significance level of 0.001).
    Also present in Table 1 are the results of training Brill's tagger on the same data.
    The results of this tagger are presented to provide a performance comparison with a widely used tagger.
    Also worth mentioning is that the tagger achieved an accuracy of 96.76% when trained on the entire data5; a Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) achieves 96.83% accuracy with the same training data/test data.
