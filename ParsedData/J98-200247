e average number of obtained rules for a data set was 2,752.3.
    Table 13 shows the disambiguation result averaged over the 10 data sets.
    From Table 13, we see that TEL performs the best, edging over the second place MDL+Default by a small margin, and then followed by LA+Default, and SA+Default.
    Below we discuss further observations concerning these results.
    MDL and SA.
    According to our experimental results, the accuracy and coverage of MDL appear to be somewhat better than those of SA.
    As Resnik (1993b) pointed out, the use of selectional association log P(pc(1c7) seems to be appropriate for cognitive modeling.
    Our experiments show, however, that the generalization method currently employed by Resnik has a tendency to overfit the data.
    Table 14 shows example generalization results for MDL (with classes with probability less than 0.05 discarded) and SA.
    Note that MDL tends to select a tree cut closer to the root of the thesaurus tree.
    This is probably the key reason why M
