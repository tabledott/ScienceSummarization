as led to very effective classification (Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih, 1999).
    Figure 2 shows a worked example of the concepts in this section.
    Suppose we have n items x1, ... , xn to divide into two classes C1 and C2, and we have access to two types of information: We would like to maximize each item&#8217;s &#8220;net happiness&#8221;: its individual score for the class it is assigned to, minus its individual score for the other class.
    But, we also want to penalize putting tightlyassociated items into different classes.
    Thus, after some algebra, we arrive at the following optimization problem: assign the xis to C1 and C2 so as to minimize the partition cost The problem appears intractable, since there are 2n possible binary partitions of the xi&#8217;s.
    However, suppose we represent the situation in the following manner.
    Build an undirected graph G with vertices {v1, ... , vn, s, t}; the last two are, respectively, the source and sink.
    Add n edges (s, vi), each with weight ind1(xi),
