ures for the arceager parser are as low as 68.93% and 65.93%, respectively, which represents a drop of almost ten percentage points in precision and almost five percentage points in recall.
    Summarizing the results of the accuracy evaluation, we have seen that all four algorithms can be used for deterministic, classifier-based parsing with competitive accuracy.
    The results presented are close to the state of the art without any optimization of feature representations and learning algorithm parameters.
    Comparing different algorithms, we have seen that the capacity to capture non-projective dependencies makes a significant difference in general, but with language-specific effects that depend primarily on the frequency of non-projective constructions.
    We have also seen that the non-projective list-based algorithm is more stable and predictable in this respect, compared to the use of pseudo-projective parsing in combination with an essentially projective parsing algorithm.
    Finally, we have obse
