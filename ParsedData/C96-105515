 experiment are shown in Table 2.
  Three values are shown for each of the six variations in the experiment: the mean overlap, the median overlap, and the percentage of perfect overlaps (overlaps of value 1.00).
  In every case, the median is higher than the mean.
  Put another way, there is always a cluster of good overlaps, but the general tendency is to have fairly poor overlaps.
  The six variations of the experiment are as follows.
  The first distinction is whether or not to count the neg- ative evidence.
  We note that the use of negative xam- ples, i.e., plausible uses of the verb in contexts which are disallowed, was a key component of this experi- ment.
  There are 1082 positive examples and 586 nega- tive examples.
  Although this evidence is useful, it is not available in dictionaries, corpora, or other convenient resources that could be used to extend Levins classi- fication.
  Thus, to extend our approach to novel word senses (i.e., words not occurring in Levin), we would not be able to use nega
