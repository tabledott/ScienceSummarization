rm recognizes literalness, metonymy, metaphor, and anomaly in the following order and by the following characteristics.
    The above analysis also illustrates, I hope, why metonymy and metaphor are easily confused: both are nonliteral and are found through the discovery of some aspect (a property) shared by the source, a preference, and the target, in the above case a surface noun.
    The differences are (a) how that aspect is selected, (b) the operations that follow, (c) the effect those operations produce, and (d) subsequent processing.
    In the case of metonymy, (a) the selected aspect forms a regular semantic relationship with a property from the target; (b) there is substitution, i.e., replacement of one concept with another; (c) hence the apparent referential function of metonymy; and (d) is unclear at present.
    In the case of metaphor, (a) the selected aspect is relevant; (b) forms an analogy with another aspect from the target; and (c) the effect is of surprise discovery of similarity between t
