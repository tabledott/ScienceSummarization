corpora and different genres of text.
    Biber (1993) investigated variation in a number syntactic features over genres, or registers, of language.
    Of particular importance to statistical parsers is the investigation of frequencies for verb subcategorizations such as Roland and Jurafsky (1998).
    Roland et al. (2000) find that subcategorization frequencies for certain verbs vary significantly between the Wall Street Journal corpus and the mixed-genre Brown corpus, but that they vary less so between genre-balanced British and American corpora.
    Argument structure is essentially the task that automatic parsers attempt to solve, and the frequencies of various structures in training data are reflected in a statistical parser's probability model.
    The variation in verb argument structure found by previous research caused us to wonder to what extent a model trained on one corpus would be useful in parsing another.
    The probability models of modern parsers include not only the number and syntactic ty
