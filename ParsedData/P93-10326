arnered as little as 3% of the information gained by his subcategorization learner running on tagged text, which itself ignored a huge percentage of the information potentially available).
    More recently, Brent (1992) substituted a very simple heuristic method to detect verbs (anything that occurs both with and without the suffix -ing in the text is taken as a potential verb, and every potential verb token is taken as an actual verb unless it is preceded by a determiner or a preposition other than to.4 This is a rather simplistic and inadequate approach to verb detection, with a very high error rate.
    In this work I will use a stochastic part-of-speech tagger to detect verbs (and the part-of-speech of other words), and will suggest that this gives much better results.6 Leaving this aside, moving to either this last approach of Brent's or using a stochastic tagger undermines the consistency of the initial approach.
    Since the system now makes integral use of a high-error-rate component,6 it makes litt
