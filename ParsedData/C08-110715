at are part of that rule (each unary template is extracted following the same procedure describedin Section 3.2).
			For example, from ?X find solu tion to Y ? X solve Y ? we generate the unary rules ?X find?
			X solve?, ?X find solution?
			Xsolve?, ?solution to Y ? solve Y ? and ?find solu tion to Y ? solve Y ?.
			The score of each generated rule is set to be the score of the original binary rule.The same unary rule can be derived from different binary rules.
			For example, ?hire Y ? employ Y ? is derived both from ?X hire Y ? X em ploy Y ? and ?hire Y for Z ? employ Y for Z?, having a different score from each original binary rule.
			The second step of the algorithm aggregates the different scores yielded for each derived rule to produce the final rule score.
			Three aggregationfunctions were tested: sum (Derived-Sum), aver age (Derived-Avg) and maximum (Derived-Max).
