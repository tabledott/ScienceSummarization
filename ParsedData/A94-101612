em, developing which is not a trivial task.
  
  
    Ultimately, a multi-engine system depends on the quality of each particular engine.
    We expect the performance of KBMT and EBMT to grow.
    We plan to use a standard regression mechanism to modify the scoring system based on feedback from having humans select the best covers for test texts.
    The current system is human-aided.
    We have begun an experiment with a fully-automated mode, with the understanding that the quality will drop.
    The most important effect of this change is that accurate quality scores become much more important, since the first choice becomes the only choice.
    Besides improving the KBMT and EBMT scoring mechanisms, we need to provide finer distinctions for the lexical transfer engine's output.
    As the databases for this are quite large (all together, over 400,000 entries), adding scores to individual entries is, in the short run, prohibitive.
    We have not as yet discovered any feasible automatic technique for gene
