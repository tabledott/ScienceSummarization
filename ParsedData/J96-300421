s (page 808) denote ghosts or spirits.
    As we shall argue, the semantic class affiliation of a hanzi constitutes useful information in predicting its properties.
  
  
    There is a sizable literature on Chinese word segmentation: recent reviews include Wang, Su, and Mo (1990) and Wu and Tseng (1993).
    Roughly speaking, previous work can be divided into three categories, namely purely statistical approaches, purely lexical rule-based approaches, and approaches that combine lexical information with statistical information.
    The present proposal falls into the last group.
    Purely statistical approaches have not been very popular, and so far as we are aware earlier work by Sproat and Shih (1990) is the only published instance of such an approach.
    In that work, mutual information was used to decide whether to group adjacent hanzi into two-hanzi words.
    Mutual information was shown to be useful in the segmentation task given that one does not have a dictionary.
    A related point is that mutua
