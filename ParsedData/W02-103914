e rewording and reordering examples were so varied that we were unable to find any regularities which might be exploited by a translation model.
    Among the cases which do result from language differences, the most common is the &#8220;ne ... pas&#8221; construction (e.g.
    Figure 1).
    Fifteen percent of the 86 total crossings are due to this construction.
    Because &#8220;ne ... pas&#8221; wraps around the verb, it will always result in a crossing.
    However, the types of syntactic structures (categorized as context-free grammar rules) which are present in cases of negation are rather restricted.
    Of the 47 total distinct syntactic structures which resulted in crossings, only three of them involved negation.
    In addition, the crossings associated with these particular structures were unambiguously caused by negation (i.e. for each structure, only negation-related crossings were present).
    Next most common is the case where the English contains a modal verb which is aligned with the main v
