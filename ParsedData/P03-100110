ications that exceed this cutoff are actually classified as legitimate.
    Figure 2 shows a plot of the precision/recall tradeoff as this threshold is changed.
    As the threshold is raised, precision increases while recall decreases.
    Based on this graph we choose to set the threshold at 0.9.
    Applying the Decision Tree algorithm with Bagging, using the pre-determined threshold, to the held out test set of 500 examples extracted with the CN/PN pattern yields a precision of .95 and a recall of .718.
    Under these same conditions, but applied to a held out test set of 500 examples extracted with the APOS pattern, the filter has a precision of .95 and a recall of .92.
    The CN/PN and APOS filters were used to extract concept-instance pairs from unstructured text.
    The approximately 15GB of newspaper text (described above) was passed through the regular expression patterns and filtered through their appropriate learned classifier.
    The output of this process is approximately 2,000,000 concept-i
