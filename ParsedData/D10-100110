 tagging examples.
    For the CFG case we define the extended index set to be Here each pair (i, t) represents word wi being assigned the tag t. Thus each parse-tree vector y will have additional (binary) components y(i, t) specifying whether or not word i is assigned tag t. (Throughout this paper we will assume that the tagset used by the tagger, T, is a subset of the set of nonterminals considered by the parser, N.) Note that this representation is over-complete, since a parse tree determines a unique tagging for a sentence: more explicitly, for any i &#8712; {1... n}, Y &#8712; T, the following linear constraint holds: We apply the same extension to the tagging index set, effectively mapping trigrams down to unigram assignments, again giving an over-complete representation.
    The extended index set for tagging is referred to as Itag.
    From here on we will make exclusive use of extended index sets for CFG parsing and trigram tagging.
    We use the set Y to refer to the set of valid parse structures u
