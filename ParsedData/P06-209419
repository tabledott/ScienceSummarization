 to enhance these components and add coreference in order to increase coverage.
    Also, there are basic domain limitations.
    We made the system &#8220;on-demand&#8221; for any topic, but currently only within regular news domains.
    As configured, the system would not work on other domains such as a medical, legal, or patent domain, mainly due to the design of the extended NE hierarchy.
    While specific hierarchies could be incorporated thi for new domains, it will also be desirable to integrate bootstrapping techniques for rapid incremental additions to the hierarchy.
    Also at the moment, table column labels are simply Extended NE categories, and do not indicate the role.
    We would like to investigate this problem in the future.
  
  
    In this paper, we proposed &#8220;On-demand Information Extraction (ODIE)&#8221;.
    It is a system which automatically identifies the most salient structures and extracts the information on whatever topic the user demands.
    It relies on recent advances i
