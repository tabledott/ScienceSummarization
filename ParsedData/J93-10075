ol, Xtract, which is able to retrieve a wide range of collocations with high performance.
    Preliminary results obtained with parts of Xtract have been described in the past (e.g., Smadja and McKeown 1990); this paper gives a complete description of the system and the results obtained.
    Xtract now works in three stages.
    In the first stage, pairwise lexical relations are retrieved using only statistical information.
    This stage is comparable to Church and Hanks (1989) in that it evaluates a certain word association between pairs of words.
    As in Church and Hanks (1989), the words can appear in any order and they can be separated by an arbitrary number of other words.
    However, the statistics we use provide more information and allow us to have more precision in our output.
    The output of this first stage is then passed in parallel to the next two stages.
    In the second stage, multiple-word combinations and complex expressions are identified.
    This stage produces output comparable to
