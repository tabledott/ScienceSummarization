y people, and vehicles.
    It seems obvious that attacks will occur on people and on physical targets, but a person might not realize that attacks will also occur on dates (e.g., Monday) and on locations (e.g., a neighborhood).
    This example shows how the corpus-based approach can identify semantic preferences that a person might not anticipate.
    Also, note that the semantic profile shows no instances of attacks on terrorists or weapons, which makes sense in this domain.
    The semantic profile is used to select semantic preferences that are strong enough to become selectional restrictions.
    We use the following formula to identify strong semantic preferences: The first test selects semantic categories that are extracted with high frequency, under the assumption that this reflects a real association with the category.
    The second case selects semantic categories that represent a relatively high percentage of the extractions even though the frequency might be low (e.g., 2 out of 4 extractions).
