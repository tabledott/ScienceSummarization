and understanding hypernym relations like settlements and agreements.
    Pronoun errors come in two forms.
    Roughly 40% of these errors are attribute mismatches involving sometimes ambiguous uses of gender and number (e.g., she with Pat Carney).
    Another 40% are not semantic or attribute-based, but rather simply arise due to the order in which we check potential antecedents.
    In all these situations, the correct links are missed because the system chooses a closer (incorrect) antecedent.
    These four highlighted errors (lengthening, semantics, attributes, ordering) add up to 77% of all recall errors in the selected set.
    In general, each error type is particular to a specific mention type.
    This suggests that recall improvements can be made by focusing on one mention type without aversely affecting the others.
    Our sieve-based approach to coreference uniquely allows for such new models to be seamlessly inserted.
