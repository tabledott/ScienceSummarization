b, and 77 times as a preposition/subordinating conjunction.2 Using these lexical definitions, a new, possibly ambiguous, tag is produced for each word type.
    E.g. once would get a new tag, representing the category of words which can be both adverbs and prepositions/conjunctions (RB-IN).
    Frequency order is taken into account in this process: if there would be words which, like once, can be RB or IN, but more frequently IN than RB (e.g. the word below), then a different tag (IN-RB) is assigned to these words.
    The original tag set, consisting of 44 morphosyntactic tags, was expanded this way to 419 (possibly ambiguous) tags.
    In the WSJ example, the resulting lexicon contains 57962 word types, 7464 (13%) of which are ambiguous.
    On the same training set, 76% of word tokens are ambiguous.
    When tagging a new sentence, words are looked up in the lexicon.
    Depending on whether or not they can be found there, a case representation is constructed for them, and they are retrieved from either th
