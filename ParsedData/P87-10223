given entity (continuing) before introducing a related entity As is evident in constraint 3, ranking of the items on the forward center list, Cf, is crucial.
    We rank the items in Cf by obliqueness of grammatical relation of the subcategorized functions of the main verb: that is, first the subject, object, and object2, followed by other subcategorized functions, and finally, adjuncts.
    This captures the idea in [GJW86] that subjecthood contributes strongly to the priority of an item on the Cf list.

    See figure 2.
    Retaining may be a way to signal an intention to shift.
    While we do not claim that speakers really behave in such an orderly fashion, an algorithm that expects this kind of behavior is more successful than those which depend solely on recency or parallelism of grammatical function.
    The interaction of centering with global focusing mechanisms and with other factors such as intentional structure, semantic selectional
