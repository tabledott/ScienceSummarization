l corpora is still relatively small in comparison to the large amount of available monolingual text.
    It is unlikely that one can find parallel corpora in any given domain in electronic form.
    This is a particularly acute problem in language pairs such as Chinese/English or Japanese/English where there are fewer translated texts than in European language pairs.
    While we should make use of any existing parallel corpora as lexical translation resources, we should not ignore the even larger amount of monolingual text.
    However, using non-parallel corpora for lexical translation has been a daunting task, considered much more difficult than that with parallel corpora.
    In this paper, we present an initial algorithm for translating technical terms using a pair of non-parallel corpora.
    Evaluation results show translation precisions at around 30% when only the top candidate is considered.
    While this precision is lower than that achieved with parallel corpora, we show that top 20 candidate outp
