    In such cases, having more training data is normally more useful than any concerns of balance, and one should simply use all the text that is available.
    We wish to avoid a smuggling of values into the criterion for corpus-hood.
    McEnery and Wilson (following others before them) mix the question &#8220;What is a corpus?&#8221; with &#8220;What is a good corpus (for certain kinds of linguistic study)?&#8221; muddying the simple question &#8220;Is corpus x good for task y?&#8221; with the semantic question &#8220;Is x a corpus at all?&#8221; The semantic question then becomes a distraction, all too likely to absorb energies that would otherwise be addressed to the practical one.
    So that the semantic question may be set aside, the definition
