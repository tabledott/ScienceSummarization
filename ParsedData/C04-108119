S 0.953 0.961 0.957 0.403 Table 3: Overall results of CRF segmentation on closed and open tests To compare our results against other systems, we summarize the competition results reported in (Sproat and Emerson, 2003) in Table 4.
			XXc and XXo indicate the closed and open runs on datasetXX respectively.
			Entries contain the F1 perfor mance of each participating site on different runs, with the best performance in bold.
			Our results are in the last row.
			Column SITE-AVG is the averageF1 performance over the datasets on which a site re ported results.
			Column OUR-AVG is the average F1 performance of our system over the same datasets.Comparing performance across systems is diffi cult since none of those systems reported results on all eight datasets (open and closed runs on 4 datasets).
			Nevertheless, several observations could be made from Table 4.
			First, no single system achieved best results in all tests.
			Only one site (S01)achieved two best runs (CTBc and PKc) with an av erage of 91.8% over
