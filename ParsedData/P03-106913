ncy-style version of the corpus using MINIPAR (Lin, 1998) a broad coverage parser for English which employs a manually constructed grammar and a lexicon derived from WordNet with an additional dictionary of proper names (130,000 entries in total).
    The grammar is represented as a network of 35 nodes (i.e., grammatical categories) and 59 edges (i.e., types of syntactic (dependency) relations).
    The output of MINIPAR is a dependency graph which represents the dependency relations between words in a sentence (see Table 1 for an example).
    Lin (1998) evaluated the parser on the SUSANNE corpus (Sampson, 1996), a domain independent corpus of British English, and achieved a recall of 79% and precision of 89% on the dependency relations.
    From the two different parsed versions of the BLLIP corpus the following features were extracted: Verbs.
