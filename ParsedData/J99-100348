tput causes alignment errors in predictable ways.
    GSA employs several backing-off heuristics to reduce the number of errors.
    Typical errors of commission are stray points of correspondence like the one in cell (H,e) in Figure 10.
    This point indicates that (G,H) and (e,f) should form a 2 x 2 aligned block, whereas the lengths of the component segments suggest that a pair of 1 x 1 blocks is more likely.
    In a separate development bitext, I have found that SIMR is usually wrong in these cases.
    To reduce such errors, GSA asks Gale &amp; Church's length-based alignment algorithm (Gale and Church 1991a; Michel Simard, personal communication) for a second opinion on any aligned block that is not 1 x 1.
    Whenever the length-based algorithm prefers a more fine-grained alignment, its judgement overrules SIMR's.
    Typical errors of omission are illustrated in Figure 10 by the complete absence of correspondence points between segments (B,C,D) and (b,c).
    This empty block of segments is sandwich
