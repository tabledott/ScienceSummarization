n of 5% is achieved over the best component model.
    Parsing is also the task to which Henderson and Brill (1999) apply combination methods with reductions of up to 30% precision error and 6% recall error compared to the best previously published results of single statistical parsers.
    This recent research shows that the combination approach is potentially useful for many NLP tasks apart from tagging.
  
  
    Our experiments have shown that, at least for the word class tagging task, combination of several different systems enables us to raise the performance ceiling that can be observed when using data-driven systems.
    For all tested data sets, combination provides a significant improvement over the accuracy of the best component tagger.
    The amount of improvement varies from 11,3% error reduction for WSJ to 24.3% for LOB.
    The data set that is used appears to be the primary factor in the variation, especially the data set's consistency.
    As for the type of combiner, all stacked systems usi
