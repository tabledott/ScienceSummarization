 Collins (2005) (Z&amp;C), a CCG-based algorithm which uses Prolog logical forms.
    Table 1 summarizes the results at the end of the learning curves (792 training examples for AWASP, WASP and SCISSOR, 600 for Z&amp;C).
    A few observations can be made.
    First, algorithms that use Prolog logical forms as the target MRL generally show better recall than those using FunQL.
    In particular, A-WASP has the best recall by far.
    One reason is that it allows lexical items to be combined in ways not allowed by FunQL or the hand-written templates in Z&amp;C, e.g.
    [smallest [state] [by area]] in Figure 3.
    Second, Z&amp;C has the best precision, although their results are based on 280 test examples only, whereas our results are based on 10-fold cross validation.
    Third, A-WASP has the best F-measure.
    To see the relative importance of each component of the A-WASP algorithm, we performed two ablation studies.
    First, we compared the performance of A-WASP with and without conjunct regrouping (S
