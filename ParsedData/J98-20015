    Theories of definite descriptions such as (Christophersen 1939; Hawkins 1978; Webber 1979; Prince 1981; Heim 1982) identify two subtasks involved in the interpretation of a definite description: deciding whether the definite description is related to an antecedent in the texe&#8212;which in turn may involve recognizing fairly fine-grained distinctions-and, if so, identifying this antecedent.
    Some of these theories have been cast in the form of classification schemes (Hawkins 1978; Prince 1992), and have been used for corpus analysis (Prince 1981, 1992; Fraurud 1990);5 yet, we are aware of no attempt at verifying whether subjects not trained in linguistics are capable of recognizing the proposed distinctions, which is a precondition for using these schemes for the kind of large-scale text annotation exer
