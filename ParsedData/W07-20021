simple most frequent sense heuristic,as attested in the all-words track of the last Senseval competition (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).
			In the ory, larger amounts of training data (SemCor hasapprox.
			500M words) would improve the perfor mance of supervised WSD, but no current projectexists to provide such an expensive resource.
			An other problem of the supervised approach is that theinventory and distribution of senses changes dra matically from one domain to the other, requiring additional hand-tagging of corpora (Mart??nez and Agirre, 2000; Koeling et al, 2005).
			Supervised WSD is based on the ?fixed-list of senses?
			paradigm, where the senses for a target wordare a closed list coming from a dictionary or lex icon.
			Lexicographers and semanticists have long warned about the problems of such an approach,where senses are listed separately as discrete entities, and have argued in favor of more complex rep resentations, where, for instance, senses are dense regions in a continuum (Cruse, 2000).Unsuperv
