o big, there are too many spurious feature pairs, and the model can&#8217;t distinguish informative from noninformative features.
    We carried out a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to examine the effect of different feature types.
    The ANOVA revealed a reliable effect of feature type (F(9,171) = 3.31; p &lt; 0.01).
    We performed Post-hoc Tukey tests to further examine whether there are any significant differences among the different features and between our model and the baseline.
    We found out that NL, VTNL, VD, and VDND are significantly better than BR (a = 0.01), whereas NL and VDND are not significantly different from each other.
    However, they are significantly better than all other features (a = 0.05).
    In this experiment we compare our model&#8217;s performance against human judges.
    Twelve texts were randomly selected from the 20 texts in our test data.
    The texts were presented to subjects with the order of their sentences scrambled.
    Participants were asked to reorder
