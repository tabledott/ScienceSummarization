 in Figure 4 can only have discontinuousorientation with respect to what comes next in En glish, since words surrounding the Chinese phrasehave already been translated.
			When several hier archical orientations are possible according to thealignment grid, we choose according to the follow ing order of preference: (1) monotone, (2) swap, (3) discontinuous.
			For instance, in the case of with iranin Figure 4, only swap and discontinuous orientations are possible (monotone orientation is impossi ble because of the block hold consultations), hence we give preference to swap.
			This prediction turns out to be the correct one according to the decoding 852 steps that complete the alignment grid.
	
	
			We now analyze the system output of Figure 4 to fur ther motivate the hierarchical model, this time from the perspective of the decoder.
			We first observe that the prepositional phrase in the future should rotatearound a relatively large noun phrase headed by consultations.
