he above problems, Liu et al. (2007) propose to use forest-to-string rules to enhance the expressive power of their tree-to-string model.
    As is inherent in a tree-to-string framework, Liu et al.&#8217;s method defines a kind of auxiliary rules to integrate forestto-string rules into tree-to-string models.
    One problem of this method is that the auxiliary rules are not described by probabilities since they are constructed during decoding, rather than learned from the training corpus.
    So, to balance the usage of different kinds of rules, they use a very simple feature counting the number of auxiliary rules used in a derivation for penalizing the use of forest-to-string and auxiliary rules.
    In this paper, an alternative solution is presented to combine the strengths of phrase-based and syntax-based methods.
    Unlike previous work, our solution neither requires larger applicability contexts (Galley et al., 2006), nor depends on pseudo nodes (Marcu et al., 2006) or auxiliary rules (Liu et al., 200
