TAG) and Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).
    One of Miyao and Tsujii&#8217;s motivations is to model predicate&#8211;argument dependencies, including long-range dependencies, which was one of the original motivations of the wide-coverage CCG parsing project.
    Miyao and Tsujii (2003a) present another log-linear model for an automatically extracted LTAG which uses a simple unigram model of the elementary trees together with a loglinear model of the attachments.
    Miyao and Tsujii (2005) address the issue of practical estimation using an automatically extracted HPSG grammar.
    A simple unigram model of lexical categories is used to limit the size of the charts for training, in a similar way to how we use a CCG supertagger to restrict the size of the charts.
    The main differences between Miyao and Tsujii&#8217;s work and ours, aside from the different grammar formalisms, are as follows.
    The CCG supertagger is a key component of our parsing system.
    It allows practical estimation of t
