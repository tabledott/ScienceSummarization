sing summaries to improve their quality.
    They suggested three types of operations: elimination, aggregation, and smoothing.
    The goal of the elimination operation is similar to that of the sentence reduction operation in our system.
    The difference is that while elimination always removes parentheticals, sentenceinitial PPs and certain adverbial phrases for every extracted sentence, our sentence reduction module aims to make reduction decisions according to each case and removes a sentence component only if it considers it appropriate to do so.
    The goal of the aggregation operation and the smoothing operation is similar to that of the sentence combination operation in our system.
    However, the combination operations and combination rules that we derived from corpus analysis are significantly different from those used in the above system, which mostly came from operations in traditional natural language generation.
