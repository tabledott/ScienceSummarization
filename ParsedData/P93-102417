ation is equivalent to the minimization of a single function, the free energy where (D) is the average distortion (5) and H is the cluster membership entropy (6).
    The free energy determines both the distortion and the membership entropy through root where T = 0-1 is the temperature.
    The most important property of the free energy is that its minimum determines the balance between the &amp;quot;disordering&amp;quot; maximum entropy and &amp;quot;ordering&amp;quot; distortion minimization in which the system is most likely to be found.
    In fact the probability to find the system at a given configuration is exponential in F so a system is most likely to be found in its minimal free energy configuration.
    The analogy with statistical mechanics suggests a deterministic annealing procedure for clustering (Rose et al., 1990), in which the number of clusters is determined through a sequence of phase transitions by continuously increasing the parameter 0 following an annealing schedule.
