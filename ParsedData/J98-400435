d using the transformation/detransformation process described above.
    The first three rows of the table show the number of productions in each PCFG (which is the number of distinct local trees in the corresponding transformed training corpus), and the labeled precision and recall measures for the detransformed parse trees.
    Randomization tests for paired sample data were performed to assess the significance of the difference between the labeled precision and recall scores for the output of the Id PCFG and the other PCFGs (Cohen 1995).
    The labeled precision and recall scores for the Flatten and Parent transforms differed significantly from each other and also from the Id transform at the 0.01 level, while neither the NP-VP nor the N'-V' transform differed significantly from each other or the Id transform at the 0.1 level.
    The remaining rows of Table 1 show the number of times certain tree schema appear in these (detransformed) tree sequences.
    The rows labeled NP attachments and VP attachments
