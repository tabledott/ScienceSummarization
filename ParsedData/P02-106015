y any other machine-learning system.
    Moreover, the performance is consistently better than those based on handcrafted rules.
    With any learning technique, one important question is how much training data is required to achieve acceptable performance.
    More generally how does the performance vary as the training data size changes?
    The result is shown in Figure 2 for MUC-7 NE task.
    It shows that 200KB of training data would have given the performance of 90% while reducing to 100KB would have had a significant decrease in the performance.
    It also shows that our system still has some room for performance improvement.
    This may be because of the complex word feature and the corresponding sparseness problem existing in our system.
    Another important question is about the effect of different sub-features.
    Table 8 answers the question on MUC-7 NE task: 1) Applying only 1 f gives our system the performance of 77.6%.
    2) 2 f is very useful for NER and increases the performance further
