This in dicates that our unknown word features were more useful for corpora with segmentation stan dards that tend to result in longer words.
			In the HK corpus, when we added in un known word features, our performance dropped.
			However, we found that the testing data uses different punctuation than the training set.
			Our system could not distinguish new word characters from new punctuation, since having a com plete punctuation list is considered external knowledge for closed track systems.
			If the new punctuation were not unknown to us, our per formance on HK data would have gone up to 0.952 F and the unknown word features would have not hurt the system too much.
			Table 4 present recalls (R), precisions (P), f scores (F) and recalls on both unknown (Roov) and known words (Riv).
