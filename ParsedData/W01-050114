U' until = u for he h2} allow h to posit labels for all examples in U' repeat g times select label 1 at random according to DL most confidently labeled 1 to the labeled data.
    This procedure preserves the distribution of labels in the labeled data as instances are labeled and added.
    The modified CT algorithm is presented in Figure 3.
  
  
    We evaluate co-training for JOB classification using a standard data set assembled by Ramshaw and Marcus from sections 15 18 (training data, 211727 instances) and 20 (test data, 47377 instances) of the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).
    Training instances consist of part-ofspeech tag and JOB label for a focus word, along with contexts of two part-of-speech tags to the left and right of the focus.
    Our goal accuracy of 95.17% is the performance of a supervised JOB classifier trained on the correctly labeled version of the full training data.
    (In our experiments the goal classifier uses the left view of the data, which actual
