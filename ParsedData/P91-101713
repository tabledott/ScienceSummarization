e' was counted 20 times, while the other alternatives were not observed at all.
    These counts are given as input to the statistical model described in the next section, which performs the actual target word selection.
  
  
    Our selection algorithm is based on the following statistical model.
    Consider first a single relation.
    The linguistic model provides us with several alternatives as in example (8).
    We assume that each alternative has a theoretical probability pi to be appropriate for this case.
    We wish to select the alternative for which pi is maximal, provided that it is significantly larger than the others.
    We have decided to measure this significance by the odds ratio of the two most probable alternatives P = P1lP2.
    However, we do not know the theoretical probabilities, therefore we get a bound for p using the frequencies of the alternatives in the corpus.
    Let pi be the probabilities as observed in the corpus (Pi = flan, where ni is the number of times that alternative
