    Nevertheless, Xu et al. (2004) show that an MT system with a word segmenter outperforms a system working with individual characters in an alignment template approach.
    On different language pairs, (Koehn and Knight, 2003) and (Habash and Sadat, 2006) showed that data-driven methods for splitting and preprocessing can improve Arabic-English and German-English MT.
    Beyond this, there has been no finer-grained analysis of what style and size of word segmentation is optimal for MT.
    Moreover, most discussion of segmentation for other tasks relates to the size units to identify in the segmentation standard: whether to join or split noun compounds, for instance.
    People generally assume that improvements in a system&#8217;s word segmentation accuracy will be monotonically reflected in overall system performance.
    This is the assumption that justifies the concerted recent work on the independent task of Chinese word segmentation evaluation at SIGHAN and other venues.
    However, we show tha
