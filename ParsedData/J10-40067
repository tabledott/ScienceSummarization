cepts as clusters of properties (Jackendoff 1990; Murphy 2002).
    In this case, the task is not to find out that dog is similar to puppy or cat, but that it has a tail, it is used for hunting, and so on.
    Almuhareb (2006), Baroni and Lenci (2008), and Baroni et al. (2010) use the words co-occurring with a noun to approximate its most prototypical properties and correlate distributionally derived data with the properties produced by human subjects.
    Cimiano and Wenderoth (2007) instead focus on that subset of noun properties known in lexical semantics as qualia roles (Pustejovsky 1995), and use lexical patterns to identify, for example, the constitutive parts of a concept or its function (this is in turn analogous to the problem of relation extraction).
    The distributional semantics methodology also extends to more complex aspects of word meaning, addressing issues such as verb selectional preferences (Erk 2007), argument alternations (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Joanis, Stevenson, and James 2008), ev
