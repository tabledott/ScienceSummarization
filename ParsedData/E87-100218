odic template, but none was available from the root.
    A derivation cannot be allowed to count as complete until all tapes are exhausted, so the automata have reached impasse.
    We must assume that, when this happens, the automata are able to return to a preceding situation in which an essentially arbitrarily choice was made, and try a different alternative.
    Indeed, we must assume that a general backtracking strategy is in effect, which ensures that all allowable sequences of choices are explored.
    Now consider the nondeterministic choice that was made in the move from (a) to (b), as contrasted with the one made under essentially circumstances from (d) to the vocalism tape had advanced in the first of these situations, but not in the second, we should presumably have been able to generate the putative form &amp;quot;aktibib&amp;quot;, which does not exist.
    This can be excluded only if we assume that there is a transducer that disallows this sequence of events, or if the frames available for &am
