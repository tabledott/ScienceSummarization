7;s and Spearman&#8217;s correlation by 0.044 and 0.067 respectively, and these differences are significant, suggesting that rank preference is a more appropriate model for the AA task.
    Four senior and experienced ESOL examiners remarked the 97 FCE test scripts drawn from 2001 exams, using the marking scheme from that year (see Section 2).
    In order to obtain a ceiling for the performance of our system, we calculate the average correlation between the CLC and the examiners&#8217; scores, and find an upper bound of 0.796 and 0.792 Pearson&#8217;s and Spearman&#8217;s correlation respectively.
    In order to evaluate the overall performance of our system, we calculate its correlation with the four senior examiners in addition to the RASCH-adjusted CLC scores.
    Tables 4 and 5 present the results obtained.
    The average correlation of the AA system with the CLC and the examiner scores shows that it is close dicted values with the CLC and the examiners&#8217; scores, where E1 refers to the first exami
