uages.
    This is because the target language annotations that we use for evaluation differ from the Stanford dependency annotation.
    Some of these differences are warranted in that certain target language phenomena are better captured by the native annotation.
    However, differences such as choice of lexical versus functional head are more arbitrary.
    To highlight this point we run two additional experiments.
    First, we had linguists, who were also fluent speakers of German, re-annotate the DE test set so that unlabeled arcs are consistent with Stanfordstyle dependencies.
    Using this data, NO CLUSTERS obtains 60.0% UAS, PROJECTED CLUSTERS 63.6% and X-LINGUAL CLUSTERS 64.4%.
    When compared to the scores on the original data set (48.9%, 50.3% and 50.7%, respectively) we can see that not only is the baseline system doing much better, but that the improvements from cross-lingual clustering are much more pronounced.
    Next, we investigated the accuracy of subject and object dependencies, as th
