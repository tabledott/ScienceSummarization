een done in this area; (Yamron et al., 1994) briefly mentions a patternmatching approach, while (Arbabi et al., 1994) discuss a hybrid neural-net/expert-system approach to (forward) transliteration.
    The information-losing aspect of transliteration makes it hard to invert.
    Here are some problem instances, taken from actual newspaper articles:1 English translations appear later in this paper.
    Here are a few observations about backtransliteration: Like most problems in computational linguistics, this one requires full world knowledge for a 100% solution.
    Choosing between Katarina and Catalina (both good guesses for 53!
    *) might even require detailed knowledge of geography and figure skating.
    At that level, human translators find the problem quite difficult as well. so we only aim to match or possibly exceed their performance.
  
  
    Bilingual glossaries contain many entries mapping katakana phrases onto English phrases, e.g.
    : ( aircraft carrier 7 -t&#8226; 7 ).
