  /   - - - / We abo adopt the convention that any derived tree with a node which has an OA constraint associated with it will not be included in the tree set associated with a TAG, G. The string language L of G is then defined as the get of all terminal strings at all trees derived in G (starting with initial tre~) whkh have on OA constraints left-in them.
  Example 2.5: Let G == (I,A) be a TAG with local constraints where : Of -- A:  8= S (~) / I / I a S /1 /1 h I ?
  S (?~) There are no constraints in a t. In ~ no auxiliasT trees are adjoinabie at the root node and the foot node and for the center S node there are an constraints.
  Starting with a t and adjoining ~ to a t at the root node we obtain ?
