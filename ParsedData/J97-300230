    Instead, a generic bracketing transduction grammar is employed, containing only one nonterminal symbol, A, which rewrites either recursively as a pair of A's or as a single terminal-pair: Longer productions with rank &gt; 2 are not needed; we show in the subsections below that this minimal transduction grammar in normal form is generatively equivalent to any reasonable bracketing transduction grammar.
    Moreover, we also show how postprocessing using rotation and flattening operations restores the rank flexibility so that an output bracketing can hold more than two immediate constituents, as shown in Figure 11.
    The bu distribution actually encodes the English-Chinese translation lexicon with degrees of probability on each potential word translation.
    We have been using a lexicon that was automatically learned from the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus via statistical sentence alignment (Wu 1994) and statistical Chinese word and collocation extraction (Fung and
