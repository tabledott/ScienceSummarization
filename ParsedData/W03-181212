f this indicated similarity of meaning.
    For this purpose, we used latent semantic analysis (LSA) to build a vector space model in which term-term similarities could be measured.
    LSA is a method for representing words as points in a vector space, whereby words which are related in meaning should be represented by points which are near to one another, first developed as a method for improving the vector model for information retrieval (Deerwester et al., 1990).
    As a technique for measuring similarity between words, LSA has been shown to capture semantic properties, and has been used successfully for recognising synonymy (Landauer and Dumais, 1997), word-sense disambiguation (Sch&#168;utze, 1998) and for finding correct translations of individual terms (Widdows et al., 2002).
    The LSA model we built is similar to that described in (Sch&#168;utze, 1998).
    First, 1000 frequent content words (i.e. not on the stoplist)l were chosen as &#8220;content-bearing words&#8221;.
