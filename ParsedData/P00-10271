    This paper presents an original and successful algorithm for the nearly unsupervised induction of inflectional morphological analyzers, with a focus on highly irregular forms not typically handled by other morphology induction algorithms.
    It is useful to consider this task as three separate steps: The target output of Step 1 is an inflection-root mapping such as shown in Table 1, with optional columns giving the hypothesized stem change and suffix analysis as well as part of speech.
    This suffix-focused transformational model is not, as given, sufficient for languages with prefixal, infixal and reduplicative morphologies.
    But it is remarkably productive across I
