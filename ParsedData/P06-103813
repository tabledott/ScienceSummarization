hin another.
    For example, any pattern of the form CHC is contained in a pattern of the form HCHC (&#8216;x and y&#8217;, &#8216;both x and y&#8217;.)
    The shared part yields exactly the same subgraph.
    This policy could be changed for a discovery of finer relationships.
    The main observation on G is that words that are highly interconnected are good candidates to form a category.
    This is the same general observation exploited by (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), who try to find graph regions that are more connected internally than externally.
    We use a different algorithm.
    We find all strong n-cliques (subgraphs containing n nodes that are all bidirectionally interconnected.)
    A clique Q defines a category that contains the nodes in Q plus all of the nodes that are (1) at least unidirectionally connected to all nodes in Q, and (2) bidirectionally connected to at least one node in Q.
    In practice we use 2-cliques.
    The strongly connected cliques are the bidirectional arcs in G and the
