he same 0(n3) time and space requirements as the Inside/Outside (I/O) and LRI algorithms.
    The completion step again dominates the computation, which has to compute probabilities for at most 0(n3) states.
    By organizing summations (11) and (12) so that 7&amp;quot; are first summed by LHS nonterminals, the entire completion operation can be accomplished in 0(n3).
    The one-time cost for the matrix inversions to compute the left-corner and unit production relation matrices is also 0(n3).
  
  
    This section discusses extensions to the Earley algorithm that go beyond simple parsing and the computation of prefix and string probabilities.
    These extensions are all quite straightforward and well supported by the original Earley chart structure, which leads us to view them as part of a single, unified algorithm for solving the tasks mentioned in the introduction.
    A Viterbi parse for a string x, in a grammar G, is a left-most derivation that assigns maximal probability to x, among all possible deriv
