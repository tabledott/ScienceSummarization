estricting the relation between the Cb(Ui) and the Cb(Ui_l) to be coreference (equality) may be too strong.
  Future work should examine the role of shifts to functionally dependent entities or entities related by partially ordered set (POSET) relations to the previous Cb.

  Cb(Ui) = Cb(Ui_l), or there is no Cb(Ui-1) Cb(Ui) = Cp(Ui) If both (1) and (2) hold then we are in a CONTINUE transition.
  The CONTINUE transition corresponds to cases where the speaker has been talking about a particular entity and indicates an intention to continue talking about that entity.
  9If (1) holds but (2) doesnt  hold then we are in a RETAIN transition.
  RETAIN corresponds to a situation where the speaker is intending to SH
