labeled as coreferent into the same coreference chain.
    Following Ng &amp; Cardie (2002), our baseline system reimplements the Soon et al. (2001) system.
    The system uses 12 features.
    Given a potential antecedent REi and a potential anaphor REQ the features are computed as follows3. those; else F. NUMBER T if both REi and REQ agree in number; else F. GENDER U if either REi or REQ have an undefined gender.
    Else if they are both defined and agree T; else F. PROPER NAME T if both REi and REQ are proper names; else F. APPOSITIVE T if REQ is in apposition with REi; else F. In the baseline system semantic information is limited to WordNet semantic class matching.
    Unfortunately, a WordNet semantic class lookup exhibits problems such as coverage, sense proliferation and ambiguity4, which make the WN CLASS feature very noisy.
    We enrich the semantic information available to the classifier by using semantic similarity measures based on the WordNet taxonomy (Pedersen et al., 2004).
    The measures
