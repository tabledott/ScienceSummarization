ism available for expressing relative position with reference to variable positions established via unbounded dependencies.
  Let con- dition (1 VFIN) be satisfied at absolute position 5, i.e.
  at the fifth word to the right.
  Then (L-1 N) would require there to be a feature "N" in absolute position 4, (L* N) would establish a second unbounded de- pendency somewhere left of position 5 (but right of position 0), i.e.
  looking for satisfaction at one of positions 4,3,2,1.
  Often context conditions work on ambiguous co- horts, i.e.
  one reading satisfiesthe condition, but this reading perhaps is not the correct one in the first place.
  If so, should a risk be taken?
  The CG formal- ism makes this a matter of deliberate choice.
  All 170 3 constraints so far treated allow the context condi- tions to be satisfied by ambiguous context cohorts.
  By appending the character C to the position num- ber, one requires the respective condition to be satisfied only if the cohort being tested is itself un- ambiguous.
