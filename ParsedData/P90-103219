 will be selected.
    When the degree is 4 the second alternative containing the verbs listed under SV-coilocates (e.g.
    &amp;quot;overpower&amp;quot;) will be selected.
    All the verbal collocates shown in this figure have actually been retrieved by Xtract at a preceding stage.
    The unification of the logical form of Figure 4 with the lexical grammar and then with the syntactic grammar will ultimately produce the sentences shown in Figure 6 among others.
    In this example, the sentential zone was not used since no phrasal template expresses its semantics.
    The verbs selected are all listed under the 5V-collocates of the first alternative in Figure 5.
    We have been able to use Cook to generate several sentences in the domain of stock market reports using this method.
    However, this is still on-going research and the scope of the system is currently limited.
    We are working on extending Cook's lexicon as well as on developing extensions that will allow flexible interaction among collocat
