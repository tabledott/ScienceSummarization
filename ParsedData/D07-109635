			But instead of describ ing the systems one by one, we focus on the basic methodological building blocks that are often foundin several systems although in different combina tions.
			For descriptions of the individual systems, we refer to the respective papers in the proceedings.
			Section 5.1 is devoted to system architectures.
			We then describe the two main paradigms for learning and inference, in this year?s shared task as well as in last year?s, which we call transition-based parsers (section 5.2) and graph-based parsers (section 5.3), adopting the terminology of McDonald and Nivre (2007).5 Finally, we give an overview of the domain adaptation methods that were used (section 5.4).

			Most systems perform some amount of pre- andpost-processing, making the actual parsing compo nent part of a sequential workflow of varying length
