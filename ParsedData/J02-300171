 given target word requires that one role always be present or that having two instances of the same role is extremely unlikely.
    To capture this information, we introduce the notion of a frame element group, which is the set of frame element roles present in a particular sentence (technically a multiset, as duplicates are possible, though quite rare).
    Frame element groups (FEGs) are unordered: examples are shown in Table 13.
    Sample probabilities from the training data for the frame element groups of the target word blame are shown in Table 14.
    The FrameNet corpus recognizes three types of &#8220;null-instantiated&#8221; frame elements (Fillmore 1986), which are implied but do not appear in the sentence.
    An example of null instantiation is the sentence &#8220;Have you eaten?&#8221; where food is understood.
    We did not attempt to identify such null elements, and any null-instantiated roles are not included in the sentence&#8217;s FEG.
    This increases the variability of observed FEGs,
