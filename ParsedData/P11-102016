t al. (2010) have proposed PEM, which uses a second language as pivot to establish semantic equivalence.
    Thus, no n-gram overlaps are required to determine the semantic adequacy of the paraphrase candidates.
    PEM also separately measures lexical dissimilarity and fluency.
    Finally, all three scores are combined using a support vector machine (SVM) trained on human ratings of paraphrase pairs.
    While PEM was shown to correlate well with human judgments, it has some limitations.
    It only models paraphrasing at the phrase level and not at the sentence level.
    Further, while it does not need reference sentences for the evaluation dataset, PEM does require suitable bilingual data to train the metric.
    The result is that training a successful PEM becomes almost as challenging as the original paraphrasing problem, since paraphrases need to be learned from bilingual data.
    The highly parallel nature of our data suggests a simpler solution to this problem.
    To measure semantic equivalence,
