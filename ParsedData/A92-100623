ation is not a linguistic one but a conceptual one, since it relies on facts about sending data in this domain, rather than on the syntax or lexical semantics about the verb send.
    It must therefore be performed by the text planner, and not the sentence planner.
  
  
    Porting is an important way to evaluate complete applied text generation systems, since there is no canonical set of tasks that such a system must be able to perform and on which it can be tested.
    (Realization components, on the other hand, can be tested for their syntactic and perhaps lexical coverage.)
    Joyce was originally designed to generate only component descriptions (as in Figure 2).
    The &amp;quot;flow analyzer&amp;quot; heuristic tool was added later to the system, and the completely different type of text it required was a first successful test of Joyce and its text planner in particular.
    The modular design of Joyce proved beneficial during the porting to the new application.
    The following conceptually well-de
