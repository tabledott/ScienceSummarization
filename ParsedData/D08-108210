 the generative process, which allows us to potentially produce a far wider range of possible trees.
  
  
    There are three categories of parameters used in the model.
    The first category of parameters models the generation of new MR productions from their parent MR productions: e.g., P(mb|mQ,arg = 1); the second models the generation of a hybrid sequence from an MR production: e.g., P(w1|mQ), P(Mb|mQ, w1); the last models the selection of a hybrid pattern given an MR production, e.g., P(m &#8594; w til|mQ).
    We will estimate parameters from all categories, with the following constraints: These parameters model the MR structures, and can be referred to as MIt model parameters.
    These parameters model the emission of NL words, the &#8220;END&#8221; symbol, and child semantic categories from an MR production.
    We call them emission parameters.

    Er 0(r|mj) = 1 for all j, where r is a hybrid pattern listed in Table 1.
    These parameters model the selection of hybrid patterns.
