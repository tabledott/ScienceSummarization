  Coping With Syntactic Ambiguity Or How To Put The Block In The Box On The Table
  
    we construct a table so that the entry in the tells the parser how to parse i occurrences of 9.
    An Example Suppose for example that we were given the following grammar: (40a) S NP VP ADJS (40b) S V NP (PP) ADJS ADJS (40c) VP -0.
    V NP (PP) ADJS (40d) PP P NP (40e) NP NI NP PP ADJS adj ADJS I (In this example we will assume no lexical ambiguity V, P, inspection, we notice that NP are Catalan grammars and that ADJS is a Step grammar.
    PP = E i&gt;0 NP = N ADJS = With these observations, the parser can process PPs, and by counting the number of occurrencof terminal symbols and looking up numbers in the appropriate tables.
    We now substitute (41a-c) into (40c).
    (42) VP = V NP (1 + PP)ADJS V (N E N)')(E (E and simplify the convolution of the two Catalan functions VP = V (N E adj') so that the parser can also find VPs by just counting coccurrences of terminal symbols.
    Now we simplify so that can also be pa
