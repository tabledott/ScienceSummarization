sents, for instance, the set of final output strings at a final state r. Define the pq-subsequential transducer T -= (Q, i, F, E, ft 6,a, P) by Q = Qi X Q2/ i = (i1/ i2).
    F = {(qi,q2) E Q: qi E Fi, 82(q2, pi(qi)) n F2 01, with the following transition and output functions: and with the final output function defined by: V(qi,q2) E F, p((qi, q2)) = 0-2 (q2, pi (qi ))p2(.5(q2, pi (qi ))) Clearly, according to the definition of composition, the transducer r realizes g of.
    The definition of p shows that it admits at most pq distinct output strings for a given input one.
    This ends the proof of the theorem.
    0 Figure 3 gives an example of a 1-subsequential or subsequential transducer T2.
    The result of the composition of the transducers Ti and 12 is shown in Figure 4.
    States in the transducer T3 correspond to pairs of states of Ti and T2.
    The composition consists essentially of making the intersection of the outputs of Ti with the inputs of 72.
    Transducers admit another useful operation
