e 7 illustrates an unsafe segmentation, in which a segment boundary (denoted by the 11 symbol) lies between a and mange, where there is no rift.
    Figure 8, on the other hand, illustrates a safe segmentation.
    The reader will notice that a safe segmentation does not necessarily result in semantically coherent segments: mes and devoirs are certainly part of one logical unit, yet are separated in this safe segmentation.
    Once such a safe segmentation has been applied to the French sentence, we can make the assumption while searching for the appropriate English translation that no word in the translated English sentence will have to account for French words located in multiple segments.
    Disallowing interExample of a safe segmentation. segment alignments dramatically reduces the scale of the computation involved in generating a translation, particularly for large sentences.
    We can consider each segment sequentially while generating the translation, working from left to right in the French sentence
