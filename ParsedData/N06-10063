l is to say whether the hypothesis follows from the text and general background knowledge, according to the intuitions of an intelligent human reader.
    That is, the standard is not whether the hypothesis is logically entailed, but whether it can reasonably be inferred.
  
  
    In this section we try to give a unifying overview to current work on robust textual inference, to present fundamental limitations of current methods, and then to outline our approach to resolving them.
    Nearly all current textual inference systems use a single-stage matching/proof process, and differ mainly in the sophistication of the matching stage.
    The simplest approach is to base the entailment prediction on the degree of semantic overlap between the text and hypothesis using models based on bags of words, bags of n-grams, TF-IDF scores, or something similar (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005).
    Such models have serious limitations: semantic overlap is typically a symmetric relation, whereas entailment is clearly not, and,
