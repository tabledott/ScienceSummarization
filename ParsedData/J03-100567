ght difference in performance between the MON and the S3 reordering constraints on the Hansards task.
    The computation time is also rather high compared to the Verbmobil task: For the S3 constraint, the average translation time is about 3 minutes per sentence for the translation direction English to French and about 10 minutes per sentence for the translation direction French to English.
    The following parameter setting is used for the experiment conducted here: tc = 5.0, t, = 10.0, nc = 250, and to = 12.
    (The actual parameters are chosen in informal experiments to obtain reasonable CPU times while permitting only a small number of search errors.)
    No cardinality histogram pruning is carried out.
    As for the Germanto-English translation experiments, word reordering is restricted so that it may not cross punctuation boundaries.
    The resulting fragment lengths are much larger for the translation direction English to French, and still larger for the translation direction French to English, whe
