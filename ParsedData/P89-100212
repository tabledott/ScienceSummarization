roaches when used for generation.
    Thus for generation, we want a traversal order geared to the premise of the generation problem, that is, to the semantic structure of the sentence.
    The new algorithm is designed to reflect such a traversal strategy respecting the semantic structure of the string being generated, rather than the string itself.
  
  
    Given an analysis tree for a sentence, we define the pivot node as the lowest node in the tree such that it and all higher nodes up to the root have the same semantics.
    Intuitively speaking, the pivot serves as the semantic head of the root node.
    Our traversal will proceed both top-down and bottomup from the pivot, a sort of semantic-head-driven traversal of the tree.
    The choice of this traversal allows a great reduction in the search for rules used to build the analysis tree.
    To be able to identify possible pivots, we distinguish a subset of the rules of the grammar, the chain rules, in which the semantics of some right-hand-side elemen
