  Assumpt ions  about  the  Knowledge Base Our algorithm is intended to be reasonably domain- independent.
  do, however, make some assump- tions about the structure of the host systems un- derlying knowledge base, and require that certain interface functions be provided.
  in particular, we assume that: ?
  Every entity is characterised in terms of a col- lection of a t t r ibutes  and their values.
  An attrii)ute-value pair is what is sometimes thought of as a property; an example is (colour, red).
  Every entity has as one of its attributes ome type .
  This is a special attr ibute that  corresponds to the kinds of properties that  are typically real- iT, ed by head nouns; an example is (type, dog).
  The knowledge base may organize some attr ibute values in a subsumption taxonomy (e.g., as is done in KI:ONE [BS85] and related KR systems).
  Such a taxonomy might record, for example, that  an- imM subsumes dog, and that  red subsumes car- let.
  For such taxonomically-organized values, the knowledge-base
