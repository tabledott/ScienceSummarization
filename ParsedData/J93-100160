 approach, where there is no need for human judgment.
  
  
    The flourishing renaissance of empiricism in computational linguistics grew out of the experience of the speech recognition community during the 1970s and 1980s.
    Many of the same statistical techniques (e.g., Shannon's Noisy Channel Model, n-gram models, hidden Markov models (HMMs), entropy (H), mutual information (I), Student's t-score) have appeared in one form or another, often first in speech, and then soon thereafter in language.
    Many of the same researchers have applied these methods to a variety of application areas ranging from language modeling for noisy channel applications (e.g., speech recognition, optical character recognition [OCR], and spelling correction [Damerau 1964; Kukich 1992]), to part-of-speech tagging, parsing, translation, lexicography, text compression (Bell, Cleary, and Witten 1990) and information retrieval (IR) (Salton 1989; Frakes and Baeza-Yates 1992).
    Empiricism is, of course, a very old tradition.
