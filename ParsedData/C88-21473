  Thus, if the root of an auxiliary tree is labelled by a nonterminal symbol, X, then there is a node (called the foot node) in the frontier of this tree which is labelled by X.
  The rest of the nodes in the frontier are labelled by terminal symbols.

  Let 7 be a tree with a node labelled by X.
  Let fl be an auxiliary tree, whose root and foot node are also labelled by X.
  Then, adjoining/3 at the node labelled by X in 7 will result in tbe tree illustrated in Figure 3.
