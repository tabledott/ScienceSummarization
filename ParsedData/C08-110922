ing Approach ExampleThe sampling procedure outlined here is inspired by the one described in (Chodorow and Lea cock, 2000) for the task of evaluating the usage of nouns, verbs and adjectives.
			The central idea is to skew the annotation corpus so that it contains a greater proportion of errors.
			Here are the steps in the procedure: 1.
			Process a test corpus of sentences so that each.
			preposition in the corpus is labeled ?OK? or ?Error?
			by the system.
			2.
			Divide the processed corpus into two sub-.
			corpora, one consisting of the system?s ?OK? prepositions and the other of the system?s ?Error?
			prepositions.
			For the hypotheticaldata in Figure 1, the ?OK? sub-corpus con tains 90% of the prepositions, and the ?Error?
			sub-corpus contains the remaining 10%.
			3.
			Randomly sample cases from each sub-.
			corpus and combine the samples into an an notation set that is given to a ?blind?
			human rater.
			We generally use a higher sampling rate for the ?Error?
			sub-corpus because we want
