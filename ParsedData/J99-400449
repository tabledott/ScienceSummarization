here is clearly a relationship between the two equations, the exact pattern of the relationship is not obvious.
    Notice that the outside formula is about twice as complicated as the inside formula.
    This doubled complexity is typical of outside formulas, and partially explains why the item-based description format is so useful: descriptions for the simpler inside values can be developed with relative ease, and then automatically used to compute the twice-as-complicated outside values.'
    Item derivation tree of [goal] and outer tree of [b].
    For a context-free grammar, using the CKY parser of Figure 3, recall that the inside probability for an item [i, A, j] is P(A --&#247; w,. wi.A).
    The outside probability for the same item is P(S Wt_lAwf wn).
    Thus, the outside probability has the property that when multiplied by the inside probability, it gives the probability that the start symbol generates the sentence using the given item, P(S wlAw wn w1 &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; wn)&#8226; This probabi
