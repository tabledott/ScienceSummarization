dressing the true shape of the curvefor smaller thresholds and not at the expected operat ing levels.
			Nonetheless, this is a subject for further study, especially as we consider alternatives to our ?filter 30?
			approach for managing beam width.
			There are a number of important ways that this work can and will be continued.
			The code base fortaking a list of n,m-grams and computing the re quired frequencies for signifance evaluation can beapplied to related problems.
			For example, skip-ngrams (n-grams that allow for gaps of fixed or vari able size) may be studied better using this approachleading to insight about methods that weakly ap proximate patterns.The original goal of this work was to better understand the character of phrasetables, and it remains a useful diagnostic technique.
			It will hope fully lead to more understanding of what it takes to make a good phrasetable especially for languages that require morphological analysis or segmentation to produce good tables using standard methods.
