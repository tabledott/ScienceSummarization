eme).
    The system has been used to analyse about 150 million words of English text drawn primarily from the PTB, TREC, BNC, and Reuters RCV1 datasets in connection with a variety of projects.
    The grammar and PoS tagger lexicon have been incrementally improved by manually examining cases of parse failure on these datasets.
    However, the effort invested amounts to a few days&#8217; effort for each new dataset as opposed to the main grammar development effort, centred on Susanne, which has extended over some years and now amounts to about 2 years&#8217; effort (see Briscoe, 2006 for further details).
    To build the parsing module, the unification grammar is automatically converted into an atomiccategoried context free &#8216;backbone&#8217;, and a nondeterministic LALR(1) table is constructed from this, which is used to drive the parser.
    The residue of features not incorporated into the backbone are unified on each rule application (reduce action).
    In practice, the parser takes average time r
