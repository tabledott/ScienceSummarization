ntation and POS tagging results are required as inputs to other NLP tasks, such as phrase chunking, dependency parsing, and machine translation.
    Word segmentation and POS tagging in a joint process have received much attention in recent research and have shown improvements over a pipelined fashion (Ng and Low, 2004; Nakagawa and Uchimoto, 2007; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Jiang et al., 2008a; Jiang et al., 2008b).
    In joint word segmentation and the POS tagging process, one serious problem is caused by unknown words, which are defined as words that are not found in a training corpus or in a system&#8217;s word dictionary1.
    The word boundaries and the POS tags of unknown words, which are very difficult to identify, cause numerous errors.
    The word-character hybrid model proposed by Nakagawa and Uchimoto (Nakagawa, 2004; Nakagawa and Uchimoto, 2007) shows promising properties for solving this problem.
    However, it suffers from structural complexity.
