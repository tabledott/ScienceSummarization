e cost of assuming Q is c, then the cost of assuming P1 is wic, and the cost of assuming P2 is W2C.
    Third, factoring or synthesis is allowed.
    That is, goal wffs may be unified, in which case the resulting wff is given the smaller of the costs of the input wffs.
    This feature leads to minimality through the exploitation of redundancy.
    Note that in (4), if to), + w2 &lt; 1, most specific abduction is favored&#8212;why assume Q when it is cheaper to assume Pi and P2.
    If w1+ to2 &gt; 1, least specific abduction is favored&#8212; why assume P1 and P2 when it is cheaper to assume Q.
    But in P16 A Pt D Q if P1 has already been derived, it is cheaper to assume P2 than Q. P1 has provided evidence for Q, and assuming the &amp;quot;remainder&amp;quot; P2 of the necessary evidence for Q should be cheaper.
    Factoring can also override least specific abduction.
    Suppose we have the axioms Pe A Pt D Qj Pt A Pt D Q2 and we wish to derive Qi A Q2, where each conjunct has an assumability cost of $10
