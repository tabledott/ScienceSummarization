nce of MBR on hypergraphs generated by Hiero/SAMT systems.
    Table 4 compares Hypergraph MBR (HGMBR) with MAP and MBR decoding on 1000 best lists.
    On some systems such as the Arabic-English SAMT, the gains from Hypergraph MBR over 1000-best MBR are significant.
    In other cases, Hypergraph MBR performs at least as well as N-best MBR.
    In all cases, we observe a 7X speedup in runtime.
    This shows the usefulness of Hypergraph MBR decoding as an efficient alternative to Nbest MBR.
    We now describe the results by tuning MBR ngram parameters (Equation 2) using MERT.
    We first compute N + 1 MBR feature functions on each edge of the lattice/hypergraph.
    We also include the total decoder cost on the edge as as additional feature function.
    MERT is then performed to optimize the BLEU score on a development set; For MERT, we use 40 random initial parameters as well as parameters computed using corpus based statistics (Tromble et al., 2008).
    Table 5 shows results for NIST systems.
