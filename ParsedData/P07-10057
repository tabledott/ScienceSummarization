 on allowing it to weigh the WSD model predictions weighted synchronous context-free grammar (CFG) against other pieces of evidence so as to optimize (Lewis and Stearns, 1968).
    A synchronous CFG translation accuracy (as measured by BLEU).
    The consists of rewrite rules such as the following: contribution of our work lies in showing for the first X &#8212;* ('y, &#945;) (1) time that integrating a WSD system significantly improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical MT system on an actual translation task.
    In the next section, we describe our WSD system.
    34 where X is a non-terminal symbol, -y (&#945;) is a string of terminal and non-terminal symbols in the source (target) language, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the non-terminals in -y and &#945; indicated by co-indexation.
    Hence, -y and &#945; always have the same number of non-terminal symbols.
    For instance, we could have the following grammar rule: where boxed indices represent the correspondences betw
