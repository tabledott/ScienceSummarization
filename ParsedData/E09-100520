   The method was evaluated on the Senseval-3 dataset, as shown in row Nav05 on Table 2.
    Note that the method labels an instance with the most frequent sense of the word if the algorithm produces no output for that instance, which makes comparison to our system unfair, specially given the fact that the MFS performs better than SSI.
    In fact it is not possible to separate the effect of SSI from that of the MFS.
    For this reason we place this method close to the MFS baseline in Table 2.
    In (Navigli and Lapata, 2007), the authors perform a two-stage process for WSD.
    Given an input context, the method first explores the whole LKB in order to find a subgraph which is particularly relevant for the words of the context.
    Then, they study different graph-based centrality algorithms for deciding the relevance of the nodes on the subgraph.
    As a result, every word of the context is attached to the highest ranking concept among its possible senses.
    The Spr method is very similar to (Navigli a
