olumn in Table 5 lists the top 40 verbobject pairs in (Tapanainen et al., 1998).
    The &amp;quot;mi&amp;quot; column show the result of our mutual information filter.
    The `+' sign means that the verb-object pair is also consider to be non-compositional according to mutual information filter (3).
    The `---' sign means that the verb-object pair is present in our dependency database, but it does not satisfy condition (3).
    For each marked pairs, the &amp;quot;similar collocation&amp;quot; column provides a similar collocation with a similar mutual information value (i.e., the reason why the pair is not consider to be non-compositional).
    The `o' marked pairs are not found in our collocation database for various reasons.
    For example, &amp;quot;finish seventh&amp;quot; is not found because &amp;quot;seventh&amp;quot; is normalized as &amp;quot;..NUM&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;have a go&amp;quot; is not found because &amp;quot;a go&amp;quot; is not an entry in our lexicon, and &amp;quot;take advantage&
