 resources.
    With seemingly endless amounts of textual data at our disposal, we have a tremendous opportunity to automatically grow semantic term banks and ontological resources.
    To date, researchers have harvested, with varying success, several resources, including concept lists (Lin and Pantel 2002), topic signatures (Lin and Hovy 2000), facts (Etzioni et al. 2005), and word similarity lists (Hindle 1990).
    Many recent efforts have also focused on extracting semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (Szpektor et al. 2004), is-a (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002), part-of (Girju et al.
    2006), and other relations.
    The following desiderata outline the properties of an ideal relation harvesting algorithm: riety of relations (i.e., not just is-a or part-of).
    To our knowledge, no previous harvesting algorithm addresses all these properties concurrently.
    In this paper, we present Espresso, a generalpurpose, broad, and accurate corpus harvesting algorithm requiring minimal supervi
