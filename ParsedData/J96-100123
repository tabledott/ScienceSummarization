    XTRACT has been developed and tested on English-only input.
    For optimal performance, XTRACT itself relies on other tools, such as a part-of-speech tagger and a robust parser.
    Although such tools are becoming more widely available in many languages, they are still hard to find.
    We have thus assumed in Champollion that these tools were only available in one of the two languages; namely, English, termed the source language throughout the paper.
  
  
    To rank the proposed translations so that the best one is selected, Champollion uses a quantitative measure of correlation between the source collocation and its complete or partial translations.
    This measure is also used to reduce the search space to a manageable size, by filtering out partial translations that are not highly correlated with the source collocation.
    In this section, we discuss the properties of similarity measures that are appropriate for our application.
    We explain why the Dice coefficient meets these crite
