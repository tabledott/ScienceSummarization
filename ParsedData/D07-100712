 WSD sys tem, which was specifically designed for the purpose of Portuguese to English translation, but this system was also only evaluated on WSD accuracy, and not integrated in a full-scale machine translation system.
			Ng et al (2003) show that it is possible to use automatically word aligned parallel corpora to train accurate supervised WSD models.
			The purpose ofthe study was to lower the annotation cost for su pervised WSD, as suggested earlier by Resnik andYarowsky (1999).
			However this result is also en couraging for the integration of WSD in SMT, since it suggests that accurate WSD can be achieved using training data of the kind needed for SMT.
	
	
			SMT 4.1 WSD models for every phrase in the input.
			vocabulary Just like for the baseline phrase translation model,WSD models are defined for every phrase in the in put vocabulary.
			Lexical choice in SMT is naturallyframed as a WSD problem, so the first step of inte gration consists of defining a WSD model for every phrase in the SMT input vocab
