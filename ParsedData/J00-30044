that use the word as the basic unit.
    For example, search engines index documents by storing a list of the words they contain, and allow the user to retrieve all documents that contain a specified combination of query terms.
    This presupposes that the documents are segmented into words.
    Failure to do so, and treating every character as a word in itself, greatly decreases the precision of retrieval since large numbers of extraneous documents are returned that contain characters, but not words, from the query.
    Figure 3 illustrates what happens when each character in a query is treated as a single-character word.
    The intended query is &amp;quot;physics&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;physicist.&amp;quot; The first character returns documents about such things as &amp;quot;evidence,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;products,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;body,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;image,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;prices&amp;quot;; while the second returns documents about &amp;quot;theory,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;barber,&amp;quot; and so
