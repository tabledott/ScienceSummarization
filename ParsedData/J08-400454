than chance is not enough to establish reliability.
    This has already been pointed out by Cohen (1960, page 44): &#8220;to know merely that x is beyond chance is trivial since one usually expects much more than this in the way of reliability in psychological measurement.&#8221; The same point has been repeated and stressed in many subsequent works (e.g., Posner et al. 1990; Di Eugenio 2000; Krippendorff 2004a): The reason for measuring reliability is not to test whether coders perform better than chance, but to ensure that the coders do not deviate too much from perfect agreement (Krippendorff 2004a, page 237).
    The relevant notion of significance for agreement coefficients is therefore a confidence interval.
    Cohen (1960, pages 43&#8211;44) implies that when sample sizes are large, the sampling distribution of x is approximately normal for any true population value of x, and therefore confidence intervals for the observed value of x can be determined using the usual multiples of the standard error.
