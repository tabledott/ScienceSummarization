n the same data set that was used to optimize the parameters), not on a completely unseen test set.
    This procedure is well-justified in the context of Rooth et al.&#8217;s (1999) and Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth&#8217;s (2000) work, which aimed at building models of lexical semantics, not of pseudodisambiguation.
    Therefore, they carried out their final evaluations on unseen test sets for the tasks of lexicon induction (Rooth et al. 1999) and target language disambiguation (Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth 2000), once the model parameters had been fixed using the pseudodisambiguation development set.8 Clark and Weir (2002) use a setting similar to that of Rooth et al.
    (1999) and Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth (2000); here pseudodisambiguation is employed to evaluate the performance of a class-based probability estimation method.
    In order to address the problem of estimating conditional probabilities in the face of sparse data, Clark and Weir (2002) define probabilities in terms of classes in a semant
