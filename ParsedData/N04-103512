mples of alignment graphs.
    Graphically, we have been depicting the triple (S, T, A) as a rooted, directed, acyclic graph (where direction is top-down in the diagrams).
    We refer to such a graph as an alignment graph.
    Formally, the alignment graph corresponding to S, T, and A is just T, augmented with a node for each element of S, and edges from leaf node t E T to element s E S iff A aligns s with t. Although there is a difference between a node of the alignment graph and its label, we will not make a distinction, to ease the notational burden.
    To make the presentation easier to follow, we assume throughout this section that the alignment graph is connected, i.e. there are no unaligned elements.
    All of the results that follow have generalizations to deal with unaligned elements, but unaligned elements incur certain procedural complications that would cloud the exposition.
    It turns out that it is possible to systematically convert certain fragments of the alignment graph into rules of PA(
