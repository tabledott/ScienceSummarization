ility assignment.
    In fact, for a couple of choices of initial grammar and corpus, the original algorithm produces grammars with somewhat better cross-entropy estimates than those yielded by the new one.
    However, in every case the bracketing accuracy on a separate test set for the result of bracketed training is above 90% (100% in several cases), in contrast to bracketing accuracies ranging between 15% and 69% for unbracketed training.
    For our main experiment, we used part-of-speech sequences of spoken-language transcriptions in the Texas Instruments subset of the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) corpus (Hemphill et al., 1990), and a bracketing of those sequences derived from the parse trees for that subset in the Penn Treebank.
    Out of the 770 bracketed sentences (7812 words) in the corpus, we used 700 as a training set C and 70 (901 words) as a test set T. The following is an example training string corresponding to the parsed sentence (Mist (the fares (for ((flight) (number 891)))))) .)
