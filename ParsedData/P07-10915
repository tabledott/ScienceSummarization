 subtle issues would then be introduced due to the complexity of syntax-based decoder, and the impact of syntax on reordering will be difficult to single out.
    There have been many reordering strategies under the phrase-based camp.
    A notable approach is lexicalized reordering (Koehn et al., 2005) and (Tillmann, 2004).
    It should be noted that this approach achieves the best result within certain distortion limit and is therefore not a good model for global reordering.
    There are a few attempts to the preprocessing approach to reordering.
    The most notable ones are (Xia and McCord, 2004) and (Collins et al., 2005), both of which make use of linguistic syntax in the preprocessing stage.
    (Collins et al., 2005) analyze German clause structure and propose six types of rules for transforming German parse trees with respect to English word order.
    Instead of relying on manual rules, (Xia and McCord, 2004) propose a method in learning patterns of rewriting SL sentences.
    This method parses t
