ce of verbnoun-preposition ambiguity.
    Consider the example of sentence (2), where we have to choose the attachment given verb send, noun soldier, and preposition into.
    (2) Moscow sent more than 100,000 soldiers into Afganistan The idea is to contrast the probability with which into occurs with the noun soldier (P(into I soldier)) with the probability with which into occurs with the verb send (P(into I send)).
    A tscore is an appropriate way to make this contrast (see Church et al. to appear).
    In general, we want to calculate the contrast between the conditional probability of seeing a particular preposition given a noun with the conditional probability of seeing that preposition given a verb.
    We use the &amp;quot;Expected Likelihood Estimate&amp;quot; (Church et al., to appear) to estimate the probabilities, in order to adjust for small frequencies; that is, given a noun and verb, we simply add 1/2 to all bigram frequency counts involving a preposition that occurs with either the noun or th
