.
    Lastly, we analyze systems based on the ratio between labeled F1 score for semantic dependencies and the LAS for syntactic dependencies.
    In other words, this measure normalizes the semantic scores relative to the performance of the parsing component.
    This measure estimates the true overall performance of the semantic subtasks, independent of the syntactic parser.5 For example, this score addresses the situations where the semantic labeled F1 score of one system is artificially low because the corresponding syntactic component does not perform well.
    Similarly to the CoNLL-2005 shared task, this shared task evaluation is separated into two challenges: Closed Challenge - systems have to be built strictly with information contained in the given training corpus, and tuned with the development section.
    In addition, the PropBank and NomBank lexical frames can be used.
    These restrictions mean that constituent-based parsers or SRL systems can not be used in this challenge because the constitu
