008) achieved this by extracting features for their semantic subtask models both from the parser used in the closed challenge and a secondary parser that was trained on a different corpus.
    The improvements measured were relatively small for the in-domain WSJ corpus (0.2 labeled macro F1 points) but larger for the out-of-domain Brown corpus (approximately 1 labeled macro F1 point).
    Tables 10 and 11 indicate that in both challenges the results on the out-of-domain corpus (Brown) are much lower than the results measured in-domain (WSJ).
    The difference is around 7&#8211;8 LAS points for the syntactic subtask and 12&#8211;14 labeled F1 points for semantic dependencies.
    Overall, this yields a drop of approximately 10 labeled macro F1 points for most systems.
    This performance decrease on out-of-domain corpora is consistent with the results reported in CoNLL-2005 on SRL (using the same Brown corpus).
    These results indicate that domain adaptation is a problem that is far from being solved for b
