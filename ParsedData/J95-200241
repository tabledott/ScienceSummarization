bilistic CFGs (Aho and Ullman 1972, Algorithm 2.10).
    The main difference is the updating of rule probabilities, for which the &amp;expansion probabilities are again needed.
    Andreas Stolcke Efficient Probabilistic Context-Free Parsing The crucial step in this procedure is the addition of variants of the original productions that simulate the null productions by deleting the corresponding nonterminals from the RHS.
    The spontaneous dot shifting described in the previous sections effectively performs the same operation on the fly as the rules are used in prediction and completion.
    The probabilistic extension of Earley's parser preserves the original control structure in most aspects, the major exception being the collapsing of cyclic predictions and unit completions, which can only make these steps more efficient.
    Therefore the complexity analysis from Earley (1970) applies, and we only summarize the most important results here.
    The worst-case complexity for Earley's parser is dominated by
