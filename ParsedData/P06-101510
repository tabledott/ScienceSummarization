ration plus one.
    In general, we expect that the set of patterns is formed by those of the previous iteration plus a new one.
    Yet, new statistical evidence can lead the algorithm to discard a pattern that was previously discovered.
    In this phase, Espresso retrieves from the corpus the set of instances I that match any of the patterns in P. In Section 3.2, we propose a principled measure of instance reliability, rt, for ranking instances.
    Next, Espresso filters incorrect instances using the algorithm proposed in Section 3.3 and then selects the highest scoring m instances, according to rt, as input for the subsequent iteration.
    We experimentally set m=200.
    In small corpora, the number of extracted instances can be too low to guarantee sufficient statistical evidence for the pattern discovery phase of the next iteration.
    In such cases, the system enters an expansion phase, where instances are expanded as follows: Web expansion: New instances of the patterns in P are retrieved from the
