 The results are shown in Figures 6 and 7.
    Summary of the results of Version 1 on training data.
    The recall and precision figures for the system's performance over the test data are presented in Table 19.
    This corpus consisted of 14 texts, containing 2,990 NPs.
    Again, ah-nost half of the NPs were considered as potential antecedents.
    The system processed 464 definite descriptions; of these, the system could classify 324: 115 as direct anaphora, 209 as discourse-new.
    Of the antecedents, 88 were defirtites themselves.
    The system incorrectly resolved 77 definite descriptions: 19 anaphoric definites and 58 discoursenew.
    As before, there were just a few more errors in anaphora resolution than in anaphora classification.
    The overall recall for the test data was 53% (247/464); precision was 76% (247/324).
    One difference between the results on the two data sets is the distribution into classes of those descriptions that the system fails to classify.
    In the first corpus, the
