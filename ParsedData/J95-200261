    Because of the imprecise relationship between LR probabilities and SCFG probabilities, it is not clear if the model thus estimated corresponds to any particular SCFG in the usual sense.
    Briscoe and Carroll (1993) turn this incongruity into an advantage by using the LR parser as a probabilistic model in its own right, and show how LR probabilities can be extended to capture non&#8212;context-free contingencies.
    The problem of capturing more complex distributional constraints in natural language is clearly important, but well beyond the scope of this article.
    We simply remark that it should be possible to define &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; nonstandard probabilities in terms of Earley parser actions so as to better model non&#8212;context-free phenomena.
    Apart from such considerations, the choice between LR methods and Earley parsing is a typical space-time tradeoff.
