  Hierarchical Phrase-Based Translation  
  
    present a statistical machine translation model that uses that contain subphrases.
    The model is formally a synchronous context-free grammar but is learned from a parallel text without any syntactic annotations.
    Thus it can be seen as combining fundamental ideas from both syntax-based translation and phrase-based translation.
    We describe our system&#8217;s training and decoding methods in detail, and evaluate it for translation speed and translation accuracy.
    Using BLEU as a metric of translation accuracy, we find that our system performs significantly better than the Alignment Template System, a state-of-the-art phrasebased system.
