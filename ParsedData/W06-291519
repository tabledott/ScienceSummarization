 cross validation.
    Although LSPM predicts the perspective of both documents and sentences, we will doubt the quality of the sentence-level predictions if the document-level predictions are incorrect.
    The experimental results are shown in Table 5.
    We include the results for the naive Bayes models from Table 3 for easy comparison.
    The accuracy of LSPM is comparable or even slightly better than that of the naive Bayes models.
    This is very encouraging and suggests that the proposed LSPM closely captures how perspectives are reflected at both the document and sentence levels.
    Examples 1 and 2 from the introduction were predicted by LSPM as likely to contain strong perspectives, i.e., large Pr(S&#65533; = s1).
    Examples 3 and 4 from the introduction were predicted by LSPM as likely to contain little or no perspective information, i.e., high Pr( S&#65533; = s0).
    The comparable performance between the naive Bayes models and LSPM is in fact surprising.
    We can train a naive Bayes mode
