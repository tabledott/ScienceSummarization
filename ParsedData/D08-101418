ier performs worse than SVM, which displays a directly proportional trend between the number of sentences in the data set and the observed F-measure.
    This trend could be explained by the fact that the SVM classifier is more robust with regard to noisy data, when compared to Naive Bayes.
  
  
    To test the validity of the results on other languages, we ran a portability experiment on Spanish.
    To build a test dataset, a native speaker of Spanish translated the gold standard of 504 sentences into Spanish.
    We maintain the same subjectivity annotations as for the Romanian dataset.
    To create the training data required by the first two experiments, we translate both the MPQA corpus and the SemCor corpus into Spanish using the Google Translation service,2 a publicly available machine translation engine also based on statistical machine translation.
    We were therefore able to implement all the experiments but the third, which would have required a manually translated version of the SemCor corpus.
