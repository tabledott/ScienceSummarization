    Research paper search engines, such as CiteSeer (Lawrence et al., 1999) and Cora (McCallum et al., 2000), give researchers tremendous power and convenience in their research.
    They are also becoming increasingly used for recruiting and hiring decisions.
    Thus the information quality of such systems is of significant importance.
    This quality critically depends on an information extraction component that extracts meta-data, such as title, author, institution, etc, from paper headers and references, because these meta-data are further used in many component applications such as field-based search, author analysis, and citation analysis.
    Previous work in information extraction from research papers has been based on two major machine learning techniques.
    The first is hidden Markov models (HMM) (Seymore et al., 1999; Takasu, 2003).
    An HMM learns a generative model over input sequence and labeled sequence pairs.
    While enjoying wide historical success, standard HMM models have di
