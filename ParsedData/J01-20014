 but no dictionary and no morphological rules particular to any specific language.
    At present, the goal of the program is restricted to providing the correct analysis of words into component pieces (morphemes), though with only a rudimentary categorical labeling.
    The underlying model that is utilized invokes the principles of the minimum description length (MDL) framework (Rissanen 1989), which provides a helpful perspective for understanding the goals of traditional linguistic analysis.
    MDL focuses on the analysis of a corpus of data that is optimal by virtue of providing both the most compact representation of the data and the most compact means of extracting that compression from the original data.
    It thus requires both a quantitative account whose parameters match the original corpus reasonably well (in order to provide the basis for a satisfactory compression) and a spare, elegant account of the overall structure.
    The novelty of the present account lies in the use of simple statements
