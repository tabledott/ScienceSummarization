   The first six rules each had a precision of greater than 90% for the training data with the exception of rule 4 which had a precision of 80% for 5 resolutions.
    The summary performance of the Naive Algorithm and CogNIAC (including all 8 rules) for the first 100 or so pronouns in three narrative texts are: Results for 298 third person pronouns in text about two same gender people.
    Since both the Naive Algorithm and the resolve all pronouns configuration of CogNIAC are required to resolve all pronouns, precision and recall figures are not appropriate.
    Instead % correct figures are given.
    The high precision version of CogNIAC is reported with recall (number correct/number of instances of coreference) and precision (number correct/number of guesses) measures.
    The conclusion to draw from these results is: if forced to commit to all anaphors, CogNIAC performs comparably to the Naive Algorithm.
