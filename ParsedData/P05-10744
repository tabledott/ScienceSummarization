ally aligned parts of the bilingual corpus, and how we evaluated the paraphrases.
    Section 4 gives the results of our evaluation and gives a number of example paraphrases extracted with our technique.
    Section 5 reviews related work, and Section 6 discusses future directions.
  
  
    Much previous work on extracting paraphrases (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003) has focused on finding identifying contexts within aligned monolingual sentences from which divergent text can be extracted, and treated as paraphrases.
    Barzilay and McKeown (2001) gives the example shown in Figure 1 of how identical surrounding substrings can be used to extract the paraphrases of burst into tears as cried and comfort as console.
    While monolingual parallel corpora often have identical contexts that can be used for identifying paraphrases, bilingual parallel corpora do not.
    Instead, we use phrases in the other language as pivots: we look at what foreign language phrases the Engli
