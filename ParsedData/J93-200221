en though they cannot be perfectly independent.
    Their dependence could be modeled using a multinomial rather than a binomial model, but the experimental data suggest that this is unnecessary. be +S by assuming that it is -S and then showing that if this were true, the observed pattern of cooccurrence of V with cues for S would be extremely unlikely.
    3.1.1 Binomial Frequency Data.
    In order to use the hypothesis testing method we need to estimate the probability 7_, that an occurrence of a verb V will be followed by a cue for S if V is -S. In this section it is assumed that 7_, is known.
    The next section suggests a means of estimating 7_,.
    In both sections it is also assumed that for each +S verb, V, the probability that V will be followed by a cue for S is greater than 7r_5.
    Other than that, no assumptions are made about the probability that a +S verb will be followed by a cue for S. For example, two verbs with transitive senses, such as cut and walk, may have quite different frequencie
