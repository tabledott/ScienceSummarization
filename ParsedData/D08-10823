 that the learned generative models are able to assign a high score to the correct meaning for input sentences, but that this correct meaning is not always the highest scoring option.
    To address this problem, we use a simple reranking approach to select a parse from a k-best list of parses.
    This pipelined approach achieves state-ofthe-art performance on two publicly available corpora.
    In particular, the flexible generative model leads to notable improvements in recall, the total percentage of sentences that are correctly parsed.
  
  
    In Section 9, we will compare performance with the three existing systems that were evaluated on the same data sets we consider.
    SILT (Kate et al., 2005) learns deterministic rules to transform either sentences or their syntactic parse trees to meaning structures.
    WASP (Wong and Mooney, 2006) is a system motivated by statistical machine translation techniques.
    It acquires a set of synchronous lexical entries by running the IBM alignment model (Brown e
