		The model of Chiang (2005) employsa synchronous context-free grammar to allow hierarchical approaches to reordering.
			The syntax based models of Yamada and Knight (2001) andMarcu et al (2006) build a full parse tree in the target language, again effectively allowing hierarchi cal reordering based on synchronous grammars.
			Itis worth noting that none of these approaches to re ordering make use of explicit syntactic information in the source language?for example, none of the methods make use of an existing source-language parser (the systems of Yamada and Knight (2001) and Marcu et al (2006) make use of a parser in the target language, i.e., English).
			Finally, note that a number of statistical MT systems make use of source language syntax in transducer-style approaches; see (Lin, 2004; Ding and Palmer, 2005; Quirk et al, 2005; Liu et al,2006; Huang et al, 2006).
			In contrast to the prepro cessing approach, they attempt to incorporate syntax directly into the decoding stage.
