    To enable comparison of responses, we performed a closed-form questionnaire study, where the number and types of the target classes are defined in advance, for which we prepared a forced-choice and a non-forced-choice variant.
    The forced-choice study provides data for a maximally restricted experimental situation, which corresponds most closely to the automatic verb classification task.

    Materials consisted of individually randomized lists of the same 59 verbs used fo
