the event that he describes in a sentence.
    I will call it the speaker identification, or simply, identification.&#176; When the main predicate of an utterance selects one of its arguments for the identification locus (henceforth Ident), the speaker automatically identifies (with varying degrees) with the viewpoint of its referent (usually human).
    The unmarked Ident is the SUBJECT, but some verbs have nonSUBJECT Ident For instance, among giving/receiving verbs, ageru 'give' and morau 'receive' have SUBJECT 'dent while kureru 'give' has OBJECT2 Ident,I8 and for going/coming verbs, &amp;a 'go' has SUBJECT Ident while kuru 'come' has nonSUBJECT Ident.
    Each Ident feature is carried over in a complex predicate made with one of these verbs as the &amp;quot;higher&amp;quot; predicate (e.g., V-kureru 'give the favor of V-ing' Ident=nonSUBJ).
    Counterexamples to the constraint stated in (9) are cases with verbs of nonSUBJECT Ident I7&amp;quot;Identification&amp;quot; is a better term than &amp;quot;empat
