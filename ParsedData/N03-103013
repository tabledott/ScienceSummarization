t in the input DS-LST.
    However, given such a tree as input, one cannot estimate probabilities such as without running into a severe sparseness problem.
    To overcome this, we map the input DS-LST into a more abstract representation that contains only the salient features of the DS-LST.
    This mapping leads to the notion of a dominance set over a discourse segmented lexicalized syntactic tree.
    In what follows, we define this notion and show that it provides adequate parameterization for the discourse parsing problem. that such points in the structure of a DSLST (the boxed nodes in the tree in Figure 4) carry the most indicative information with respect to the potential discourse tree we want to build.
    A set representation of the points of a DS-LST is called the domi&#8220;attachment&#8221; &#8220;attachment&#8221; ce set of a DS-LST.
    For each edu we identify a word in as the head word of edu and denote it is defined as the word with the highest occurrence as a lexical head in the lexicalize
