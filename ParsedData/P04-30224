    In the next section, we describe our extraction system.
    We present results in section 3, and we conclude after making some general observations in section 4.
  
  
    We built Maximum Entropy models for predicting the type of relation (if any) between every pair of mentions within each sentence.
    We only model explicit relations, because of poor inter-annotator agreement in the annotation of implicit relations.
    Table 1 lists the types and subtypes of relations for the ACE RDC task, along with their frequency of occurence in the ACE training data2.
    Note that only 6 of these 24 relation types are symmetric: &#8220;relative-location&#8221;, &#8220;associate&#8221;, &#8220;other-relative&#8221;, &#8220;other-professional&#8221;, &#8220;sibling&#8221;, and &#8220;spouse&#8221;.
    We only model the relation subtypes, after making them unique by concatenating the type where appropriate (e.g.
    &#8220;OTHER&#8221; became &#8220;OTHER-PART&#8221
