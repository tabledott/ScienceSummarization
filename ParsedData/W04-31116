ped and are in production, while also trying to give enough of the overall vision to place the work that has been done in context.
    Section 2 discusses some of the main issues around the development of the guidelines for entity annotation, for both the oncology and inhibition domains.
    Section 3 first discusses the overall plan for the different levels of annotation, and then focuses on the integration of the two levels currently in production, entity annotation and syntactic structure.
    Section 4 describes the flow of the annotation process, including the development of the statistical taggers mentioned above.
    Section 5 is the conclusion.
  
  
    Annotation has been proceeding for both the oncology and the inhibition domains.
    Here we give a summary of the main features of the annotation guidelines that have been developed.
    We have been influenced in this by previous work in annotation for biomedical information extraction (Ohta et al., 2002; Gaizauskas et al., 2003).
    However, we di
