core for each resolution class.
    The right-hand side of Table 4 shows the average distribution and scores across all data sets.
    These scores confirm our expectations about the relative difficulty of different types of resolutions.
    For example, it appears that proper names are easier to resolve than common nouns; gendered pronouns are easier than 1st and 2nd person pronouns, which, in turn, are easier than ungendered 3rd person pronouns.
    Similarly, our intuition is confirmed that many CEs can be accurately resolved based on exact string matching, whereas resolving against antecedents that do not have overlapping strings is much more difficult.
    The average scores in Table 4 show that performance varies dramatically across the resolution classes, but, on the surface, appears to be relatively consistent across data sets.
    None of the data sets performs exactly the same, of course, so we statistically analyze whether the behavior of each resolution class is similar across the data sets.
