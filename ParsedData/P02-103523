 much narrower window in which to operate.
    As such, it is more appropriate to assess the disambiguator in terms of reduction in error rate (36% relative to the upper bound) than in terms of absolute F-score.
    Both the DR and LFG annotations broadly agree in their measure of error reduction.
    The lower reduction in error rate relative to the upper bound for DR evaluation on the Brown corpus can be attributed to a corpus effect that has also been observed by Gildea (2001) for training and testing PCFGs on the WSJ and Brown corpora.5 Breaking down results according to parse quality shows that irrespective of evaluation measure and corpus, around 4% overall performance is lost due to non-full parses, i.e.
    FRAGMENT, or SKIMMED, or SKIMMED+FRAGMENT parses.
    Due to the lack of standard evaluation measures and gold standards for predicate-argument matching, a comparison of our results to other stochastic parsing systems is difficult.
    To our knowledge, so far the only direct point of comparison is
