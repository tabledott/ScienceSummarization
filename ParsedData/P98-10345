    Using this simple algorithm with a naive heuristic for matching rules, we achieve surprising accuracy in an evaluation on two base NP corpora of varying complexity, both derived from the Penn Treebank WSJ.
    The first base NP corpus is that used in the Ramshaw &amp; Marcus work.
    The second espouses a slightly simpler definition of base NP that conforms to the base NPs used in our Empire sentence analyzer.
    These simpler phrases appear to be a good starting point for partial parsers that purposely delay all complex attachment decisions to later phases of processing.
    Overall results for the approach are promising.
    For the Empire corpus, our base NP finder achieves 94% precision and recall; for the Ramshaw &amp; Marcus corpus, it obtains 91% precision and recall, which is 2% less than the best published results.
    Ramshaw &amp; Marcus, however, provide the learning algorithm with word-level information in addition to the partof-speech information used in our base NP finder.
