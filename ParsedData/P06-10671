s immediately preceding it and is given by the following equation: where k &gt;= n. N-gram language models have been successfully used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) as was first proposed by (Bahl et al., 1983).
    They play an important role in selecting among several candidate word realization of a given acoustic signal.
    N-gram language models have also been used in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) as proposed by (Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993).
    The run-time search procedure used to find the most likely translation (or transcription in the case of Speech Recognition) is typically referred to as decoding.
    There is a fundamental difference between decoding for machine translation and decoding for speech recognition.
    When decoding a speech signal, words are generated in the same order in which their corresponding acoustic signal is consumed.
    However, that is not necessarily the case in MT due to the fact that different languages have different word order requirements.
