rth significance list, SL).
    The order indicates the degree of collocativity.
    Multiple candidates with identical scores are listed in random order.
    This is necessary, in particular, when co-occurrence frequency is used as an association measure.
    In this approach, the set of the highest ranked word combinations is evaluated for each measure, and the proportion of TPs among this -best list (the precision) is computed.
    Another measure of goodness is the proportion of TPs in the base data that are also contained in the -best list (the recall).
    While precision measures the quality of the -best lists produced, recall measures their coverage, i.e., how many of all true collocations in the corpus were identified.
    The most problematic aspect here is that conclusions drawn from -best lists for a single (and often small) value of are only snapshots and likely to be misleading.
    For instance, considering the set of AdjN base data with we might arrive at the following results (Table 2 gives t
