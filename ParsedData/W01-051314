t least two separate datasets (124,952 in all), but being evaluated against all of the 2610 valid units.
    Double columns 3 and 4 show effects from high-frequency filtering the n-grams of the first and second columns (reporting only 29,716 and 17,720 n-grams) respectively.
    As Table 3 suggests, for every condition, the information-like algorithms seem to perform best at identifying valid, general MWU headwords.
    Moreover, they are enhanced when cross-sourcing is considered; but since much of their strength comes from identifying proper nouns, filtering has little or even negative impact.
    On the other hand, data source.
    They also improve significantly with filtering.
    Overall, though, after the algorithms are judged, even the best score of 0.265 is far short of the maximum possible, namely 1.0.
    Since WordNet is static and cannot report on all of a corpus&#8217; n-grams, one may expect different performance by using a more all-encompassing, dynamic resource.
