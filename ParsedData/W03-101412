earner can then retrain using the larger training set and the process repeats.
    The subjective patterns can also be added to the highprecision subjective sentence classifier as new features to improve its performance.
    The dashed lines in Figure 1 represent the parts of the process that are bootstrapped.
    In this section, we will describe the high-precision sentence classifiers, the extraction pattern learning process, and the details of the bootstrapping process.
    The high-precision classifiers (HP-Subj and HP-Obj) use lists of lexical items that have been shown in previous work to be good subjectivity clues.
    Most of the items are single words, some are N-grams, but none involve syntactic generalizations as in the extraction patterns.
    Any data used to develop this vocabulary does not overlap with the test sets or the unannotated data used in this paper.
    Many of the subjective clues are from manually developed resources, including entries from (Levin, 1993; Ballmer and Brennenstuhl, 19
