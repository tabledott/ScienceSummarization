ex.)
    Many of the pattern candidates discovered in the previous stage are not usable.
    In order to find a usable subset, we focus on the symmetric patterns.
    Our rationale is that two content-bearing words that appear in a symmetric pattern are likely to be semantically similar in some sense.
    This simple observation turns out to be very powerful, as shown by our results.
    We will eventually combine data from several patterns and from different corpus windows (Section 4.)
    For identifying symmetric patterns, we use a version of the graph representation of (Widdows and Dorow, 2002).
    We first define the singlepattern graph G(P) as follows.
    Nodes correspond to content words, and there is a directed arc A(x, y) from node x to node y iff (1) the words x and y both appear in an instance of the pattern P as its two CWs; and (2) x precedes y in P. Denote by Nodes(G), Arcs(G) the nodes and arcs in a graph G, respectively.
    We now compute three measures on G(P) and combine them for all patt
