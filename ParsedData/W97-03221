    This paper presents three unsupervised learning algorithms that are able to distinguish among the known senses (i.e., as defined in some dictionary) of a word, based only on features that can be automatically extracted from untagged text.
    The object of unsupervised learning is to determine the class membership of each observation (i.e. each object to be classified), in a sample without using training examples of correct classifications.
    We discuss three algorithms, McQuitty's similarity analysis (McQuitty, 1966), Ward's minimum&#8212;variance method (Ward, 1963) and the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin, 1977), that can be used to distinguish among the known senses of an ambiguous word without the aid of disambiguated examples.
    The EM algorithm produces maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a probabilistic model, where that model has been specified in advance.
    Both Ward's and McQuitty's methods are agglomerative clustering algorithms that
