counts re-created using this smoothing technique correlate significantly with plausibility judgments for adjective-noun bigrams.
    They also show that this class-based approach outperforms distance-weighted averaging (Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999), a smoothing method that re-creates unseen word co-occurrences on the basis of distributional similarity (without relying on a predefined taxonomy), in predicting plausibility.
    In the current study, we used the smoothing technique of Lapata, Keller, and McDonald (2001) to re-create not only adjective-noun bigrams, but also noun-noun and verb-object bigrams.
    As already mentioned in Section 2.1, it was assumed that the noun is the predicate in adjective-noun bigrams; for noun-noun bigrams, we treated the right noun as the predicate, and for verb-object bigrams, we treated the verb as the predicate.
    We applied Lapata, Keller, and McDonald&#8217;s (2001) technique to the unseen bigrams for all three bigram types.
    We also used it on the seen bigrams, wh
