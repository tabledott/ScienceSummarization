combined with the FS1 features.
    The last line shows the results obtained when all features from FS1 and FS2 were used.
    Table 1 shows that the new features increase the argument identification F-measure by 3.61%, and the role assignment accuracy with 4.29%.
    For the argument identification task, the head and content word features have a significant contribution for the task precision, whereas NE features contribute significantly to the task recall.
    For the role assignment task the best features from the feature set FS2 are the content word features (cw and cPos) and the Boolean NE flags, which show that semantic information, even if minimal, is important for role classification.
    Surprisingly, the phrasal verb collocation features did not help for any of the tasks, but they were useful for boosting the decision trees.
    Decision tree learning provided by C5 (Quinlan, 2002) has built in support for boosting.
    We used it and obtained improvements for both tasks.
