gh our method brings improvements in the BLEU score, the sentence extraction method does better.
    Joining both extracted datasets does not improve performance; since most of the parallel data in this corpus exists at sentence level, the extracted fragments cannot bring much additional knowledge.
    The Fragment-noLLR datasets bring no translation performance improvements; moreover, when the initial corpus is small (1M words) and the comparable corpus is noisy (BBC), the data has a negative impact on the BLEU score.
    This indicates that LLR-Lex is a higher-quality lexicon than GIZALex, and an important component of our method.
  
  
    Much of the work involving comparable corpora has focused on extracting word translations (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Diab and Finch, 2000; Koehn and Knight, 2000; Gaussier et al., 2004; Shao and Ng, 2004; Shinyama and Sekine, 2004).
    Another related research effort is that of Resnik and Smith (2003), whose system is designed to discover parallel document pairs o
