    Named entity recognition (NER) is the most studied information extraction (IE) task.
    NER typically focuses on detecting instances of &#8220;person&#8221;, &#8220;location&#8221;, &#8220;organization&#8221; names and optionally instances of &#8220;miscellaneous&#8221; or &#8220;time&#8221; categories.
    The scalability of statistical NER allowed researchers to apply it successfully on large collections of newswire text, in several languages, and biomedical literature.

    80s (Carreras et al., 2002; Florian et al., 2003), while Bio-NER accuracy ranges between the low 70s and 80s, depending on the data-set used for training/evaluation (Dingare et al., 2005).
    One shortcoming of NER is its over-simplified ontological model, leaving instances of other potent
