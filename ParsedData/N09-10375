espond to a single phrasal node in the entire tree.
    We then augment the labels of the phrasal node and its descendents with the type of named entity.
    We also distinguish between the root node of an entity, and the descendent nodes.
    See Figure 1 for an illustration.
    This representation has several benefits, outlined below.
    The OntoNotes data does not contain any nested entities.
    Consider the named entity portions of the rules seen in the training data.
    These will look, for instance, like none &#8594; none person, and organization &#8594; organization organization.
    Because we only allow named entity derivations which we have seen in the data, nested entities are impossible.
    However, there is clear benefit in a representation allowing nested entities.
    For example, it would be beneficial to recognize that the United States Supreme Court is a an organization, but that it also contains a nested GPE.1 Fortunately, if we encounter data which has been annotated with nested entit
