ere aligned in the Model 4 output.
    Table 4 displays the results on both language pairs when these additional features are used with the refined model.
    This produces a large increase in performance, and when including the possibles, produces AERs of 5.29 and 25.8, both well below that of Model 4 alone (shown in Tables 1 and 2).
    Using 10-fold cross-validation we are able to generate results on the whole of the Hansards test data which are comparable to previously published results.
    As the sentences in the test set were randomly chosen from the training corpus we can expect cross-validation to give an unbiased estimate of generalisation performance.
    These results are displayed in Table 5, using the possible (P) alignments for training.
    As the training set for each fold is roughly four times as big previous training set, we see a small improvement in AER.
    The final results of 6.47 and 5.19 with and without Model 4 features both exceed the performance of Model 4 alone.
    However the u
