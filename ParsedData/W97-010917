ns, as dqn(Q3,Q2)=dqv(Q3,Q4)=(0.25+0.007+0)/3.0857 and the noun business of Q3 is disambiguated to its sense nearest to the disambiguated sense of company in Q2.
    The verb in Q4 is monosemous, therefore the algorithm finds a set of similar quadruples for nouns (Q2 qualifies in spite if having the same noun (company), because it has already been disambiguated in the previous steps): Q2, Q3 and Q6.
    The nearest quadruple in this set is Q2 (dqn(Q4,Q2)=0) and the noun company in Q4 is disambiguated to the sense of the noun in Q2.
    The quadruple Q5 has no similar quadruples for the current SDT and therefore the next quadruple is Q6.
    Similarly to the above disambiguations, both its verb and noun are disambiguated.
    There is no further match for any quadruple and therefore SDT is increased to 0.2 and the algorithm starts with Q1 again (the quadruples Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q6 are already fully disambiguated).
    No matches are found for SDT4.2 for neither Q1 or Q5.
    The algorithm iterates until SDT=0.6 w
