01)).
    In contrast, our work classifies individual sentences, as does the research in (Wiebe et al., 1999).
    Sentence-level subjectivity classification is useful because most documents contain a mix of subjective and objective sentences.
    For example, newspaper articles are typically thought to be relatively objective, but (Wiebe et al., 2001) reported that, in their corpus, 44% of sentences (in articles that are not editorials or reviews) were subjective.

    (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) describes a method for identifying the semantic orientation of words, for example that beautiful expresses positive sentiments.
    Researchers have focused on learning adjectives or adjectival phrases (Turney, 2002; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Wiebe, 2000) and verbs (Wiebe et al., 2001), but no previous work has focused on learning nouns.
    A unique aspect of our work is the use of bootstrapping methods that ex
