t to the right of their head, the adjacency feature encodes this monovalency through parameters P(STOPIPP/SBAR, adjacent) = 0 and P(STOPIPP/SBAR, not adjacent) = 1.
    Figure 13 shows some particularly bad structures returned by model 1 with no distance variables.
    Another surprise is that subcategorization can be very useful, but that the distance measure has masked this utility.
    One interpretation in moving from the least parameterized model (Model 1 [No, No]) to the fully parameterized model (Model 2 [Yes, Yes]) is that the adjacency condition adds around 11% in accuracy; the verb condition adds another 1.5%; and subcategorization finally adds a mere 0.8%.
    Under this interpretation subcategorization information isn&#8217;t all that useful (and this was my original assumption, as this was the order in which features were originally added to the model).
    But under another interpretation subcategorization is very useful: In moving from Model 1 (No, No) to Model 2 (No, No), we see a 10% improvem
