ults of our experiments on these data will remain relevant regardless of improvements in technology for automatic word alignment.
    Second, we wanted to measure how much of the complexity is not attributable to systematic translation divergences, both in the languages as a whole (SVO vs. SOV), and in specific constructions (English not vs. French ne... pas).
    To eliminate this source of complexity of translational equivalence, we used English/English bitexts.
    We are not aware of any previous studies of word alignments in monolingual bitexts.
    Even manually annotated word alignments vary in their reliability.
    For example, annotators sometimes link many words in one sentence to many words in the other, instead of making the effort to tease apart more fine-grained distinctions.
    A study of such word alignments might say more about the annotation process than about the translational equivalence relation in the data.
    The inevitable noise in the data motivated us to focus on lower bounds, com
