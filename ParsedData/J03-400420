e specified gr in the training data is divided by |Cn|.
    The frequency credit attached to a hyponym is propagated to the superordinate hypernyms, and the frequency of a hypernym (nc') totals the frequency at its hyponyms: The distribution over VC is obtained similarly using the troponym relation.
    For the distribution over AC, the frequency credit for each adjective is divided by the number of synsets to which the adjective belongs, and the credit for an ac is the sum over all the synsets that are members by virtue of the similar-to WordNet link.
    To disambiguate a verb occurring with a given noun, the vc from Cv that gives the largest estimate for p(vc|nc,gr) is taken.
    The nc for the co-occurring noun is the nc from Cn that maximizes this estimate.
    The estimate for p(nc|vc,gr) is taken as in equation (16) but selecting the vc to maximize the estimate for p(vc|nc,gr) rather than p(nc|vc,gr).
    An adjective is likewise disambiguated to the ac from all those to which the adjective belongs, us
