s well known (Abney, 1997) that PCFG-type approximations to unification grammars can yield inconsistent probability models due toloss of probability mass: the parser successfully re turns the highest ranked parse tree but the constraint solver cannot resolve the f-equations (generated in the pipeline or ?hidden?
			in the integrated model) and the probability mass associated with that tree is lost.
			This case, however, is surprisingly rare for our grammars: only 0.0018% (85 out of 48424) of theoriginal Penn-II trees (without FRAGs) fail to pro duce an f-structure due to inconsistent annotations(Table 1), and for parsing section 23 with the in tegrated model (A-PCFG), only 9 sentences do notreceive a parse because no f-structure can be gen erated for the highest ranked tree (0.4%).
			Parsing with the pipeline model, all sentences receive onecomplete f-structure.
			Research on adequate probability models for unification grammars is important.
