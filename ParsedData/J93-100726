ns that if two words are involved in a collocation then: These two assumptions are used to analyze the word distributions, and we base our filtering techniques on them.
    In this stage as well as in the two others, we often need part-of-speech information for several purposes.
    Stochastic part-of-speech taggers such as those in Church (1988) and Garside and Leech (1987) have been shown to reach 95-99% performance on free-style text.
    We preprocessed the corpus with a stochastic part-of-speech tagger developed at Bell Laboratories by Ken Church (Church 1988).9 In the rest of this section, we describe the algorithm used for the first stage of Xtract in some detail.
    We assume that the corpus is preprocessed by a part of speech tagger and we note w, a collocate of w if the two words appear in a common sentence within a distance of 5 words.
    Input: The tagged corpus, a given word w. Output: All the sentences containing w. Description: This actually encompasses the task of identifying sentence bounda
