 The alignment &#710;aJ1 that has the highest probability (under a certain model) is also called the Viterbi alignment (of that model): A detailed comparison of the quality of these Viterbi alignments for various statistical alignment models compared to human-made word alignments can be found in Och and Ney (2003).
    The baseline alignment model does not allow a source word to be aligned with two or more target words.
    Therefore, lexical correspondences like the German compound word Zahnarzttermin for dentist&#8217;s appointment cause problems because a single source word must be mapped onto two or more target words.
    Therefore, the resulting Viterbi alignment of the standard alignment models has a systematic loss in recall.
    Here, we Example of a (symmetrized) word alignment (VERBMOBIL task). describe various methods for performing a symmetrization of our directed statistical alignment models by applying a heuristic postprocessing step that combines the alignments in both translation directions (s
