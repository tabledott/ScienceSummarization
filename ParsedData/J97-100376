ft in vocabulary indicates a change in subtopic.
    Because this evaluation method assumes that article boundary changes are more important than subtopic boundary changes, it penalizes the algorithm for marking very strong subtopic changes that occur within a very cohesive document before relatively weaker changes in vocabulary between similar articles.
    For example, for hypothetical articles d1, d2, and d3, assume d1 has very strong internal coherence indicators, d2 has relatively weak ones, and d3 is in the midrange.
    The interidr subtopic transition scores for d1 can swamp out the score for the transition between d2 and d3.
    Nevertheless, because others have used this evaluation method, one such evaluation is shown here as well.
    The evaluation set consisted of 44 articles from the Wall Street Journal from 1989.
    Consecutive articles were used, except any article fewer than 10 sentences was removed.
    The data consisted of 691 paragraphs, most of which contained between 1 and 3 sentences,
