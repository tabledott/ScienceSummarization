    During SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000), data for 35 words was made available adding up to about 20,000 examples tagged with respect to the Hector dictionary.
    The size of the tagged corpus increased with SENSEVAL-2 (Kilgarriff, 2001), when 13,000 additional examples were released for 73 polysemous words.
    This time, the semantic annotations were performed with respect to WordNet.
    Additionally, (Kilgarriff, 1998) mentions the Hector corpus, which comprises about 300 word types with 300-1000 tagged instances for each word, selected from a 17 million word corpus.
    Sense tagged corpora have thus been central to accurate WSD systems.
    Estimations made in (Ng, 1997) indicated that a high accuracy domain independent system for WSD would probably need a corpus of about 3.2 million sense tagged words.
    At a throughput of one word per minute (Edmonds, 2000), this would require about 27 manyears of human annotation effort.
