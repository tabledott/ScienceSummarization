			Voice feature is the voice (active/passive) of the current predicate.
			This is extracted with a simple rule: a verb is identified as passive if it follows a to-be verb in the same phrase chunk and its POS tag is VBN(past participle) or it immediately follows a noun phrase.
			Position feature describes if the current word is before or after the predicate.
			Chunk pattern encodes the sequence of chunks from the current words to the predicate.
			Clause tag indicates the boundary of clauses.
			Clause path feature is a path formed from a semi-parsed tree containing only clauses and chunks.
			Each clause is named with the chunk preceding it.
			The clause path is the path from predicate to target word in the semi-parse tree.
			Clause position feature is the position of the target word relative to the predicate in the semi-parse tree containing only clauses.
