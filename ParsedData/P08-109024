d on a logarithm scale of the difference between the counts of before and after classifications.
    Formally, the score is calculated as the following: where E is the set of all event pairs, B(i, j) is how many times we classified events i and j as before in Gigaword, and D(i, j) _ |B(i, j) &#8722; B(j,i)|.
    The relation i0j indicates that i is temporally before j.
  
  
    Out approach gives higher scores to orders that coincide with the pairwise orderings classified in our gigaword training data.
    The results are shown in figure 5.
    Of the 69 chains, 6 did not have any ordered events and were removed from the evaluation.
    We generated (up to) 300 random orderings for each of the remaining 63.
    We report 75.2% accuracy, but 22 of the 63 had 5 or fewer pairs of ordered events.
    Figure 5 therefore shows results from chains with more than 5 pairs, and also 10 or more.
    As we would hope, the accuracy improves the larger the ordered narrative chain.
    We achieve 89.0% accuracy on the 24 d
