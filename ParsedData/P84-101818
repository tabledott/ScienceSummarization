 the English sentence John knows Mary, a possible fumctional description of which we was given in (2).
    I take it that the French sentence has an essentially isomorphic structure.
    In fact, following the plan laid out at the beginning of the paper, let us assume that the functional description of the French sentence is that given in (2) with obvious replacements for the values of the Lex attribute and with attribute names x, in the English grammar systematically replaced by F-x, in the French.
    Thus we have F-Cat, F-Head, etc.
    Suppose now, that, using the English grammar and a suitable parsing algorithm, the structure given in (2) is derived from the English sentence, and that this description is then unified with the following transfer grammar: The first clause of the principal conjunct states a very strong requirement, namely that the description of a phrase in one of the two languages should be a description of a phrase of the same category in the other language.
    The disjunct that follows
