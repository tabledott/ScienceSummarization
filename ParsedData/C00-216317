lignment models by conlparing the Viterbi alignment of the model with a human-made alignment.
  We have shown that by using inore sophisticated models the quality of the alignments improves ignificantly.
  Fur- ther improvements in producing better alignments are expected from using the HMM alignment model to bootstrap the fertility models, fronl making use of cognates, and from statistical lignment models that are based on word groups rather than single words.
