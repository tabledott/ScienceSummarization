ted to build RTE pairs requires proficiency in multiple languages, thus significantly increasing the costs of the data creation process.
    To address these issues, in this paper we devise a cost-effective methodology to create cross-lingual textual entailment corpora.
    In particular, we focus on the following problems: (1) Is it possible to collect T-H pairs minimizing the intervention of expert annotators?
    To address this question, we explore the feasibility of crowdsourcing the corpus creation process.
    As a contribution beyond the few works on TE/CLTE data acquisition, we define an effective methodology that: i) does not involve experts in the most complex (and costly) stages of the process, ii) does not require preprocessing tools, and iii) does not rely on the availability of already annotated RTE corpora. to non-experts, difficult to accomplish, and not suitable for the application of the quality-check mechanisms provided by current crowdsourcing services.
