    Levinger et al. (1995) developed a context-free method in order to acquire the morpho-lexical probabilities, from an untagged corpus.
    Their method handles the data sparseness problem by using a set of similar words for each word, built according to a set of rules.
    The rules produce variations of the morphological properties of the word analyses.
    Their tests indicate an accuracy of about 88% for context-free analysis selection based on the approximated analysis distribution.
    In tests we reproduced on a larger data set (30K tagged words), the accuracy is only 78.2%.
    In order to improve the results, the authors recommend merging their method together with other morphological disambiguation methods &#8211; which is the approach we pursue in this work.
    Levinger's morphological disambiguation system (Levinger, 1992) combines the above approximated probabilities with an expert system, based on a manual set of 16 syntactic constraints .
    In the first phase, th
