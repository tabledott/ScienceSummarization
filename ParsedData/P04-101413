 class, if one node heads a sub-derivation producing more correct dependencies than the other node (and each sub-derivation only produces correct dependencies), then the node with less correct dependencies cannot be part of a correct derivation.
    The conjunctive and disjunctive nodes appearing in correct derivations form a new correct feature forest.
    The correct forest, and the complete forest containing all derivations spanning the sentence, can be used to estimate the required likelihood value and feature expectations.
    Let E&#57740;&#57737; fi be the expected value of fi over the forest (D for model A; then the values in (5) can be obtained by calculating E&#57740;j &#57737; fi for the complete forest (Dj for each sentence Sj in the training data (the second sum in (5)), and also E&#57738;j &#57737;fi for each forest Tj of correct derivations (the first sum in (5)): where log Z&#57740; is the normalisation constant for (D.
