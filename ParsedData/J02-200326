thy An algorithm for determining top(c, v, r).
    An example generalization: Determining top((soup), stir, obj).
    1997; Li and Abe 1998; Wagner 2000), the level of generalization is often determined for a small number of hand-picked verbs and the result compared with the researcher&#8217;s intuition about the most appropriate level for representing a selectional preference.
    According to this approach, if (sandwich) were chosen to represent (hotdog) in the object position of eat, this might be considered an undergeneralization, since (food) might be considered more appropriate.
    For this work we argue that such an evaluation is not appropriate; since the purpose of this work is probability estimation, the most appropriate level is the one that leads to the most accurate estimate, and this may or may not agree with intuition.
    Furthermore, we show in Section 7 that to generalize unnecessarily can be harmful for some tasks: If we already have lots of data regarding (sandwich), why generalize any hi
