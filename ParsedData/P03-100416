ish the relative position of each character and character type.
    We use the Kyoto University Corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997), 7,958 sentences in the articles on January 1st to January 7th are used as training data, and 1,246 sentences in the articles on January 9th are used as the test data.
    The task of Japanese dependency parsing is to identify a correct dependency of each Bunsetsu (base phrase in Japanese).
    In previous research, we presented a state-of-the-art SVMs-based Japanese dependency parser (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).
    We combined SVMs into an efficient parsing algorithm, Cascaded Chunking Model, which parses a sentence deterministically only by deciding whether the current chunk modifies the chunk on its immediate right hand side.
    The input for this algorithm consists of a set of the linguistic features related to the head and modifier (e.g., word, part-of-speech, and inflections), and the output from the algorithm is either of the value +1 (dependent) or -1 (independent).
