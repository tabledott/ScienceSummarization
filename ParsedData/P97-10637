y, there are cases where this assumption is false.
    We prefer not to model those cases, in order to achieve higher accuracy with less effort on the cases where the assumption is true.
    The purpose of the competitive linking algorithm is to help us re-estimate the model parameters.
    The variables that we use in our estimation are summarized in Figure 2.
    The linking algorithm produces a set of links between word tokens in the bitext.
    We define a link token to be an ordered pair of word tokens, one from each half of the bitext.
    A link type is an ordered pair of word types.
    Let n(,,v) be the co-occurrence frequency of u and v and k(u,v) be the number of links between tokens of u and v3.
    An 'Note that k(u,&#8222;) depends on the linking algorithm, but n(&#8222;,&#8222;.) is a constant property of the bitext. important property of the competitive linking algorithm is that the ratio k(uv)/n(u) tends to be very high if u and v are mutual translations, and quite low if they are not.
