ven a document collection c, From these, we select words which appear more than A1 = 20 times in the collection, and have a I(w; c) greater than A2 = 10.
    These words are to the document&#8217;s feature vector with a weight equal to log(I(w; c)).
    The next set of models use the features extracted using the methodology described in Section 2.
    Biographical information such as birth year, and occupation, when found, is quite useful in connecting documents.
    If a document connects a name with a birth year, and another document connects the same name with the same birth year, typically, those two documents refer to the same person.
    These extracted features were used to categorically cluster documents in which they appeared.
    Because of their high degree of precision and specificity, documents which contained similar extracted features are virtually guaranteed to have the same referent.
    By clustering these documents first, large high quality clusters formed, which then then provided an ancho
