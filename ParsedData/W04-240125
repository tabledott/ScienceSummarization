lly trusts the labels of entity classifier, and only the relation predictions may be different from the basic relation classifier.
    In other words, LP is able to enhance the performance of entity classification, which is impossible for pipeline.
    The final approach, Omniscience, tests the conceptual upper bound of this entity/relation classification problem.
    It also trains the two classifiers separately as the basic approach.
    However, it assumes that the entity classifier knows the correct relation labels, and similarly the relation classifier knows the right entity labels as well.
    This additional information is then used as features in training and testing.
    Note that this assumption is totally unrealistic.
    Nevertheless, it may give us a hint that how much a global inference can achieve.
    Tables 2 &amp; 3 show the performance of each approach in F&#946;=1 using 5-fold cross-validation.
    The results show that LP performs consistently better than basic and pipeline, both in entit
