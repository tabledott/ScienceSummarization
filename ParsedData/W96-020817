res actually knowing the conditional probability of each category given each of the exponentially large number of possible instance descriptions. curves generally follow a power law where predictive accuracy climbs fairly rapidly and then levels off at an asymptotic level.
    A learning curve can reveal whether the performance of a system is approaching an asymptote or whether additional training data would likely result in significant improvement.
    Since gathering annotated training data is an expensive time-consuming process, it is important to understand the performance of methods given varying amounts of training data.
    In addition to measuring generalization accuracy, we also collected data on the CPU time taken to train and test each method for each trainingset size measured on the learning curve.
    This provides information on the computational resources required by each method, which may also be useful in deciding between them for particular applications.
    It also provides data on how the
