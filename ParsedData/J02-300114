ven an adjective (e.g., critical in &#8220;critical praise&#8221;).
    The corpus used in this project is perhaps best described in terms of the methodology used by the FrameNet team.
    We outline the process here; for more detail see Johnson et al. (2001).
    As the first step, semantic frames were defined for the general domains chosen; the frame elements, or semantic roles for participants in a frame, were defined; and a list of target words, or lexical predicates whose meaning includes aspects of the frame, was compiled for each frame.
    Example sentences were chosen by searching the British National Corpus for instances of each target word.
    Separate searches were performed for various patterns over lexical items and part-of-speech sequences in the target words&#8217; context, producing a set of subcorpora for each target word, designed to capture different argument structures and ensure that some examples of each possible syntactic usage of the target word would be included in the final databas
