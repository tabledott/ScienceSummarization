    The graph perspective has four main advantages.
    (1) There are many attractive and well-understood algorithms for dealing with graph structures (see, e.g., Gibbons [1985], Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest [1990], or Chartrand and Oellermann [1993]).
    In this article, we describe a straightforward branch and bound algorithm for finding the relevant subgraphs in which cost functions are used to guide the search process.
    (2) By defining different cost functions for the graph perspective, we can simulate (and improve) some of the well-known algorithms for the generation of referring expressions mentioned above.
    This facilitates the formal comparison of these algorithms and makes it easier to transfer results from one algorithm to another.
    (3) The graph perspective provides a clean solution for some problems that have plagued earlier algorithms.
    For instance, the generation of relational expressions (i.e., referring expressions t
