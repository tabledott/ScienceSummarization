 the arguments of predicates in general English text.
    Gildea and Palmer (2002) developed a system to predict semantic roles (as defined in PropBank) from sentences and their parse trees as determined by the statistical parser of Collins (1999).
    In this paper, we examine how the syntactic representations used by different statistical parsers affect the performance of such a system.
    We compare a parser based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b) with the Collins parser.
    As the CCG parser is trained and tested on a corpus of CCG derivations that have been obtained by automatic conversion from the Penn Treebank, we are able to compare performance using both goldstandard and automatic parses for both CCG and the traditional Treebank representation.
    The Treebankparser returns skeletal phrase-structure trees without the traces or functional tags in the original Penn Treebank, whereas the CCG parser returns wordword dependencies that correspond to the underlying
