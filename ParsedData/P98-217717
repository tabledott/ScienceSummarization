tiny fraction of the supervision.
    Since only a small part of the extraction heuristic is specific to English, and since partof-speech taggers and morphology databases are widely available in other languages, our approach is far more portable than previous approaches for this problem.
    We successfully demonstrated the portability of our approach by applying it to the prepositional phrase attachment task in the Spanish language.
  
  
    We thank Dr. Lauri Kartunnen for lending us the Spanish natural language tools, and Mike Collins for helpful discussions on this work.
