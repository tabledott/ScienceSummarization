ifiers of H. Either n or m may be zero, and n = The model can be considered to be a variant of Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG).
    In PCFGs each rule a &#8212;&gt; in the CFG underlying the PCFG has an associated probability P(/31a).
    In (Collins 97), P (01a) is defined as a product of terms, by assuming that the right-hand-side of the rule is generated in three steps: probability I P, h, H), where Ln+i (in+1) = STOP.
    The STOP symbol is added to the vocabulary of nonterminals, and the model stops generating left modifiers when it is generated.
    Other rules in the tree contribute similar sets of probabilities.
    The probability for the entire tree is calculated as the product of all these terms.
    (Collins 97) describes a series of refinements to this basic model: the addition of &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; (a conditioning feature indicating whether or not a modifier is adjacent to the head); the addition of subcategorization parameters (Model 2), and parameters that model wh-movement
