  THE REPRESENTATION OF INGREDIENTS In most natural anguage systems, it is assumed that all the entities in the domain of discourse are singular individuals.
  In more complex domains, such as recipes, this simplification is of limited value, since a large proportion of the objects we find are masses or sets, such as those described by the noun phrases two ounces of salt and three pounds of carrots respectively.
  In order to permit the representation f enti- ties such as these, EPICURE makes use of a notion of a generalized physical object or physob].
  This permits a consistent representation f entities irre- spective of whether they are viewed as individuals, masses or sets, by representing each as a knowledge base entity (KBE) with an appropriate structure at.
