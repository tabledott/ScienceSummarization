uments, representing 30 out of the 53 documents that were double-tagged.
    Results are based on pre-segmented documents.
    Our team was able to reach a significant level of consistency, even though they faced a number of challenges which reflect differences in the agreement scores at the various levels.
    While operating under the constraints typical of any theoretical approach in an applied environment, the annotators faced a task in which the complexity increased as support from the guidelines tended to decrease.
    Thus, while rules for segmenting were fairly precise, annotators relied on heuristics requiring more human judgment to assign relations and nuclearity.
    Another factor is that the cognitive challenge of the task increases as the tree takes shape.
    It is relatively straightforward for the annotator to make a decision on assignment of nuclearity and relation at the inter-clausal level, but this becomes more complex at the intersentential level, and extremely difficult when linking lar
