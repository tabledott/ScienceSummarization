se of classes instead of the words themselves has the advantage of better generalization.
    For example, if there exist classes in source and target language that contain town names, it is possible that an alignment template learned using a specific town name can be generalized to other town names.
    In the following, e&#732; and f&#732; denote target and source phrases, respectively.
    To train the probability of applying an alignment template p(z = (FJy1 , EI~1 , &#732;A)  |f&#732;), we use an extended version of the algorithm phrase-extract from Section 3.3.
    All bilingual phrases that are consistent with the alignment are extracted together with the alignment within this bilingual phrase.
    Thus, we obtain a count N(z) of how often an alignment template occurred in the aligned training corpus.
    The probability of using an alignment template to translate a specific source language phrase f&#732; is estimated by means of relative frequency: To reduce the memory requirement of the alignment tem
