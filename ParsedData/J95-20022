n sparse grammars by making use of Earley's top-down control structure.
    It can process any context-free rule format without conversion to some normal form, and combines computations for (a) through (d) in a single algorithm.
    Finally, the algorithm has simple extensions for processing partially bracketed inputs, and for finding partial parses and their likelihoods on ungrammatical inputs.
  
  
    Context-free grammars are widely used as models of natural language syntax.
    In their probabilistic version, which defines a language as a probability distribution over strings, they have been used in a variety of applications: for the selection of parses for ambiguous inputs (Fujisaki et al. 1991); to guide the rule choice efficiently during parsing (Jones and Eisner 1992); to compute island probabilities for non-linear parsing (Corazza et al.
    1991).
    In speech recognition, probabilistic context-free grammars play a central role in integrating low-level word models with higher-level language model
