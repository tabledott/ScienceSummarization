e, the mode-1 matricization of the tensor in Table 2 results in a matrix with the entries vertically arranged as they are in the table, but replacing the second and third indices with a single index ranging from 1 to 6 (cf. matrix A of Table 3).
    More explicitly, in mode-n matricization we map each tensor entry (i1, i2, ..., iN) to matrix entry (in, j), where j is computed as in Equation (1), adapted from Kolda and Bader (2009).
    For example, if we apply mode-1 matricization to the tensor of dimensionality 3 x 2 x 3 in Table 2, we obtain the matrix A3x6 in Table 3 (ignore the labels for now).
    The tensor entry x3,1,1 is mapped to the matrix cell a3,1; x3,2,3 is mapped to a3,6; and x1,2,2 is mapped to a1,4.
    Observe that each column of the matrix is a mode-1 fiber of the tensor: The first column is the x*11 fiber; the second column is the x*21 fiber, and so on.
    Matricization has various mathematically interesting properties and practical applications in computations involving tensors (Kolda 200
