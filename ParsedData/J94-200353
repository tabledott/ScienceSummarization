interpretation is found with minimal processing by interleaving the steps of the Centering algorithm proposed in Brennan et al.
  Note that nothing special needs to be said about the fact that EMPATHY is the discourse factor that made Hanako the Cp in 24b and thus predicted that Hanako would be the Cb at 24c (pace Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987).
  The preference in the interpretation follows from the distinction between CONTINUE and RETAIN and the ranking of Cf.
  Thus, the centering framework is easily adapted to handle this language-specific eature.
  3.3 Topic and Empathy In general the assignment of the EMPATHY relationship ispragmatic.
  It is determined by the speakers relation to the discourse participants in the discourse.
  In 24, for example, the EMPATHY relationship between the speaker and Hanako and between the speaker and Taroo is clear: the use of the empathy verb in the second sentence indicates that the speaker is closer to Hanako than to Taroo.
  However, besides cases where the speaker
