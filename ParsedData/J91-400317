s-of-running, while in 18b it means simply move-by-running (cf.
    Jackendoff 1983).
    The methodology described above for distinguishing word senses is also assumed by those working in more formal frameworks.
    For example, Dowty (1985) proposes multiple entries for control and raising verbs, and establishes their semantic equivalence with the use of meaning postulates.
    That is, the verbs in Examples 19 and 20 are lexically distinct but semantically related by rules.3 Given the conventional notions of function application and composition, there is little choice but to treat all of the above cases as polysemous verbs.
    Yet, something about the systematicity of such ambiguity suggests that a more general and simpler explanation should be possible.
    By relaxing the conditions on how the meaning of a complex expression is derived from its parts, I will, in fact, propose a very straightforward explanation for these cases of logical polysemy.
