 is defined only for NPs, has only two values (S, corresponding to subjects, and VP, corresponding to objects).
    In cases in which the path feature includes an S or VP ancestor of an NP node as part of the path to the target word, the gov feature is a function of the path feature.
    This is the case most of the time, including for our prototypical subject (VBTVPTStNP) and object (VBTVPtNP) paths.
    Of the 35,138 frame elements identified as NPs by the parser, only 4% have a path feature that does not include a VP or S ancestor.
    One such example is shown in Figure 6, where the small clause &#8220;the remainder renting ...&#8221; has no S node, giving a path feature from renting to the remainder of VBTVPTNPtNP.
    The value of the gov feature here is VP, as the algorithm finds the VP of the sentence&#8217;s main clause as it follows parent links up the tree.
    The feature is spurious in this case, because the main VP is not headed by, or relevant to, the target word renting.
