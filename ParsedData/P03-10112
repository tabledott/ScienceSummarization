 tree substitution grammars (Haji&#711;c et al., 2002) can be trained on parse trees from parallel treebanks.
    However, real bitexts generally do not exhibit parse-tree isomorphism, whether because of systematic differences between how languages express a concept syntactically (Dorr, 1994), or simply because of relatively free translations in the training material.
    In this paper, we introduce &#8220;loosely&#8221; tree-based alignment techniques to address this problem.
    We present analogous extensions for both tree-to-string and tree-to-tree models that allow alignments not obeying the constraints of the original syntactic tree (or tree pair), although such alignments are dispreferred because they incur a cost in probability.
    This is achieved by introducing a clone operation, which copies an entire subtree of the source language syntactic structure, moving it anywhere in the target language sentence.
    Careful parameterization of the probability model allows it to be estimated at no additiona
