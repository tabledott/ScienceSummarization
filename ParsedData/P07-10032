rget side) parses and word alignments.
    Rules are extracted from target side constituents that can be projected onto contiguous spans of the source sentence via the word alignment.
    Constituents that project onto non-contiguous spans of the source sentence do not yield transducer rules themselves, and can only be incorporated into larger transducer rules.
    Thus, if the word alignment of a sentence pair does not respect the constituent structure of the target sentence, then the minimal translation units must span large tree fragments, which do not generalize well.
    We present and evaluate an unsupervised word alignment model similar in character and computation to the HMM model (Ney and Vogel, 1996), but which incorporates a novel, syntax-aware distortion component which conditions on target language parse trees.
    These trees, while automatically generated and therefore imperfect, are nonetheless (1) a useful source of structural bias and (2) the same trees which constrain future stages of proce
