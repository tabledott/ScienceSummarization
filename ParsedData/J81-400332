 semantics of XGs.
    As pointed out before, this formalisation does not offer any substantial problems.
    Next, it is not clear whether XGs are as general as they could be.
    For instance, it might be possible to extend them to handle right extraposition of constituents, which, although less common than left extraposition, can be used to describe quite frequent English constructions, such as the gap between head noun and relative clause in: What files are there that were created today?
    It may however be possible to describe such situations in terms of left extraposition of some other constituent (e.g. the verb phrase &amp;quot;are there&amp;quot; in the example above).
    Finally, I have been looking at what transformations should be applied to an XG developed as a clear description of a language, so that the resulting grammar could be used more efficiently in parsing.
    In particular, I have been trying to generalise results on deterministic parsing of context-free languages into appropriate pri
