l,k)}).
    Because &#8710;(p &#8722; 2) &lt; q, we can again use the inductive hypothesis to infer &#928;(p &#8722; 2, i, k) and &#928;(p, i, k).
    Furthermore, it must be the case that either k and j are adjacent or there is an earlier configuration cp&#8722;r (r &lt; &#8710;(p)) such that cp&#8722;r = (&#963;Jk,jJ&#946;,Acp_r); in both cases it follows that &#928;(p, k,j) (in the latter through the inductive hypothesis via &#928;(p &#8722; r, k, j)).
    As before, &#928;(p, i, k), &#928;(p, k,j) and (i, l, k) E Acp together entail &#928;(p, i, j).
    For completeness, we need to show that for any sentence x and projective dependency forest Gx = (Vx, Ax) for x, there is a transition sequence C0,m such that Gcm = Gx.
    We prove this by induction on the length JxJ of x = (w0, w1, ... , wn).
    Basis: If JxJ = 1, then the only projective dependency forest for x is G = ({0},0) and Gcm = Gx for C0,m = (cs(x)).
    Inductive step: Assume that the claim holds if JxJ &lt; p (for some p &gt; 1) and assume tha
