irs and normalized to the interval [0, 1] through division by the maximal weight.
    If we take all disagreements to be of equal weight then the expected disagreement is exactly the complement of the expected agreement for &#954; as calculated in Section 2.4: Finally, the coefficient &#954;w itself is the ratio of observed disagreement to expected disagreement, subtracted from 1 in order to yield a final value in terms of agreement.
    Do &#954;w = 1 &#8722; De We end this section with an example illustrating how all of the agreement coefficients just discussed are computed.
    To facilitate comparisons, all computations will be based on the annotation statistics in Table 4.
    This confusion matrix reports the results of an experiment where two coders classify a set of utterances into three categories.
    2.7.1 The Unweighted Coefficients.
    Observed agreement for all of the unweighted coefficients (S, &#954;, and &#960;) is calculated by counting the items on which the coders agree (the Artstein and
