to automatically analyze such pairs to gain enough knowledge to accurately map new katakana phrases that come along, and learning approach travels well to other languages pairs.
    However, a naive approach to finding direct correspondences between English letters and katakana symbols suffers from a number of problems.
    One can easily wind up with a system that proposes iskrym as a back-transliteration of aisukuriimu.
    Taking letter frequencies into account improves this to a more plausible-looking isclim.
    Moving to real words may give is crime: the i corresponds to ai, the $ corresponds to su, etc.
    Unfortunately, the correct answer here is ice cream.
    After initial experiments along these lines, we decided to step back and build a generative model of the transliteration process, which goes like this: This divides our problem into five sub-problems.
    Fortunately, there are techniques for coordinating solutions to such sub-problems, and for using generative models in the reverse direction.
