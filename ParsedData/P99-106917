likelihood procedure.
    Its computational difficulty grows (and the quality of solutions degrade) rapidly with the number of features.
  
  
    Ron Kaplan and Hadar Shemtov at Xerox PARC provided us with two LFG parsed corpora.
    The Verbmobil corpus contains appointment planning dialogs, while the Homecentre corpus is drawn from Xerox printer documentation.
    Table 1 summarizes the basic properties of these corpora.
    These corpora contain packed c/fstructure representations (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1995) of the grammatical parses of each sentence with respect to Lexical-Functional grammars.
    The corpora also indicate which of these parses is in fact the correct parse (this information was manually entered).
    Because slightly different grammars were used for each corpus we chose not to combine the two corpora, although we used the set of features described in section 2 for both in the experiments described below.
    Table 2 describes the properties of the features used for each corpus.
