 one, we compare success rates for the resolution of pronominal anaphora that result from a grammaticalrole-driven centering algorithm and from a functional centering algorithm.
    The second study deals with a new cost-based evaluation methodology for the assessment of centering data, one which can be directly derived from and justified by the cognitive load premises of the centering model.
  
  
    The problem of establishing referential coherence in discourse can be rephrased as the problem of determining the proper antecedent of a given anaphoric expression in the current or the preceding utterance(s) and the rendering of both as referentially identical (coreferential).
    This task can be approached in a very principled way by stating general constraints on the grammatical compatibility of the expressions involved (e.g., Haddock 1987; Alshawi 1992).
    Linguists have devoted a lot of effort to identifying conclusive syntactic and semantic criteria to reach this goal, e.g., for intrasentential anaphor
