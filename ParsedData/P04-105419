or A = {.9,.5,.1}, but obtained no improvement.
    The second result of interest is that all tree kernels outperform the bag-of-words kernel, K2, most noticeably in recall performance, implying that the and C denote the kernel used for relation detection and classification, respectively. structural information the tree kernel provides is extremely useful for relation detection.
    Note that the average results reported here are representative of the performance per relation, except for the NEAR relation, which had slightly lower results overall due to its infrequency in training.
  
  
    We have shown that using a dependency tree kernel for relation extraction provides a vast improvement over a bag-of-words kernel.
    While the dependency tree kernel appears to perform well at the task of classifying relations, recall is still relatively low.
    Detecting relations is a difficult task for a kernel method because the set of all non-relation instances is extremely heterogeneous, and is therefore difficult
