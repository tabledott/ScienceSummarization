andidate model for coreference resolution is to recast the resolution as a binary classification problem.
    During training, a set of training instances is generated for each anaphor in an annotated text.
    An instance is formed by the anaphor and one of its antecedent candidates.
    It is labeled as positive or negative based on whether or not the candidate is tagged in the same coreferential chain of the anaphor.
    After training, a classifier is ready to resolve the NPs1 encountered in a new document.
    For each NP under consideration, every one of its antecedent candidates is paired with it to form a test instance.
    The classifier returns a number between 0 and 1 that indicates the likelihood that the candidate is coreferential to the NP.
    The returned confidence value is commonly used as the competition criterion to rank the candidate.
    Normally, the candidates with confidences less than a selection threshold (e.g.
    0.5) are discarded.
    Then some algorithms are applied to choose o
