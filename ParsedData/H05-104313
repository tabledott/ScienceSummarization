with a product feature will occur in its vicinity.
			This idea is similar to that of (Kim and Hovy, 2004) and (Hu and Liu, 2004), but instead of using a window of size k or the output of a noun phrase chunker, OPINE takes advantage of the syntactic dependencies computed by theMINIPAR parser.
			Our intuition is embodied by 10 ex traction rules, some of which are shown in Table 4.
			If an explicit feature is found in a sentence, OPINE applies the extraction rules in order to find the heads of potentialopinion phrases.
			Each head word together with its modi 341 fiers is returned as a potential opinion phrase1.
			Extraction Rules Examples if ?(M,NP = f)?
			po = M (expensive) scanner if ?(S = f, P,O)?
			po = O lamp has (problems) if ?(S, P,O = f)?
			po = P I (hate) this scanner if ?(S = f, P,O)?
			po = P program (crashed) Table 4: Examples of Domain-independent Rules forthe Extraction of Potential Opinion Phrases.
