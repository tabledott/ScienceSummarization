icantly different from 0 (t = 0.29, df = 92, p = 0.39), ParCos on McRae is significant at &#945; = .05 (t = 2.134, df = 89, p = 0.018), and all other models on either data set are significant at &#945; = .01 and below.
    TypeDM emerges as an excellent model to tackle selectional preferences, and as the overall winner on this task.
    On the Pad&#180;o data set, it is as good as Pad&#180;o&#8217;s (2007) FrameNet based model, and it is outperformed only by the supervised BagPack approach.
    On the McRae data set, all three DM models do very well, and TypeDM is slightly worse than the other two models.
    On this data set, the DM models are outperformed by Pad&#180;o&#8217;s FrameNet model in terms of correlation, but the latter has a much lower coverage, suggesting that for practical purposes the DM models are a better choice.
    According to Raghunathan&#8217;s test (see Section 6.1.1), the difference in correlation with human ratings among the three DM models is not significant on the McRae data, wher
