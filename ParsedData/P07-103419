a, At,l and At,,,.
    In the first set of experiments, we gradually remove &#8220;misleading&#8221; labeled instances from the source domain, using the small number of labeled target instances we have.
    We follow the heuristic we described in Section 3.1, which sets the a for the top k misclassified source instances to 0, and the a for all the other source instances to 1.
    We also set At,l and At,l to 0 in order to focus only on the effect of removing &#8220;misleading&#8221; instances.
    We compare with a baseline method which uses all source instances with equal weight but no target instances.
    The results are shown in Table 1.
    From the table, we can see that in most experiments, removing these predicted &#8220;misleading&#8221; examples improved the performance over the baseline.
    In some experiments (Oncology, CTS, u00, u01), the largest improvement was achieved when all misclassified source instances were removed.
    In the case of weblog NE type classification, however, removing the
