			We follow Clark (2002) in ignoring the featuresbased on the previously assigned categories; there fore every tagging decision is local and the Viterbi algorithm is not required.
			This simple approach has the advantage of being very efficient, and we findthat it is accurate enough to enable highly accu rate parsing.
			However, a method which used theforward-backward algorithm to sum over all possi ble sequences, or some other method which took into account category sequence information, may well improve the results.
			For words seen at least k times in the trainingdata, the tagger can only assign categories a
