    Although the mutual have obtained using terminology lexicons. information results seem to be almost in a class of If our gold standard contains K MWUs with their own, they actually are similar overall to the corpus frequencies satisfying threshold (T=10), our first four sets of results; therefore, we will refer to figure of merit (FOM) is given by where Pi (precision at i) equals i/Hi , and Hi is the number of hypothesized MWUs required to find the ith correct MWU.
    This FOM corresponds to area under a precision-recall curve.
    WordNet has definite advantages as an evaluation resource.
    It has in excess of 50,000 MWUs, is freely accessible, widely used, and is in electronic form.
    Yet, it obviously cannot contain every MWU.
    For instance, our corpus contains 177,331 n-grams (for 2&lt;n&lt;10) satisfying T&gt;_10, but WordNet contains only 2610 of these.
    It is unclear, therefore, if algorithms are wrong when they propose MWUs that are not in WordNet.
    We will as
