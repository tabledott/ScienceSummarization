he phrase structure output of the parser and run the automatic head rules over it to extract the dependencies, we call this system Collins-rules.
    Table 3 shows the results comparing our system, MIRA-Normal, to the Collins parser for English.
    All systems are implemented in Java and run on the same machine.
    Interestingly, the dependencies that are automatically produced by the Collins parser are worse than those extracted statically using the head rules.
    Arguably, this displays the artificialness of English dependency parsing using dependencies automatically extracted from treebank phrase-structure trees.
    Our system falls in-between, better than the automatically generated dependency trees and worse than the head-rule extracted trees.
    Since the dependencies returned from our system are better than those actually learnt by the Collins parser, one could argue that our model is actually learning to parse dependencies more accurately.
    However, phrase structure parsers are built to maximi
