widely accepted classical solutions to the problem of are of this flavor.
    For Frege (1892) 'the Evening in sentence (14) does not refer to the Evening Star but to the the phrase 'the Evening Star'.
    In a more recent approach.
    Zalta (1983) takes such noun phrases to refer to 'abstract objects' related to the real object.
    In both approaches noun phrases in intensional contexts refer to senses or abstract objects, while other noun phrases refer to actual entities, and so it is necessary to specify which predicates are intensional.
    In a Montagovian approach, 'the Evening Star' would be taken to refer to the intension of the Evening Star, .not its eztenaion in real world, and noun phrases would to refer to intensions, although for nonintensional predicates there would be meaning postulates that make this equivalent to reference to extensions.
    Thus, in all these approaches intensional and extensional predmust be distinguished explicitly, and noun phrases in intensional contexts are systematic
