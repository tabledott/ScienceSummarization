 if an &#945; value as low as 0.0005 were being used (for which the critical value is 27.9 for eight degrees of freedom), the null hypothesis would still be rejected.
    For X2, the null hypothesis is rejected for &#945; values greater than 0.005.
    This seems reasonable, since the probabilities associated with the children of (liquid) and the object position of drink would be expected to show a lot of variation across the children.
    A key question is how to select the appropriate value for &#945;.
    One solution is to treat &#945; as a parameter and set it empirically by taking a held-out test set and choosing the value of &#945; that maximizes performance on the relevant task.
    For example, Clark and Weir (2000) describes a prepositional phrase attachment algorithm that employs probability estimates obtained using the WordNet method described here.
    To set the value of &#945;, the performance of the algorithm on a development set could be compared across different values of &#945;, and the val
