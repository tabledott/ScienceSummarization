cessary to firmly establish this result, but it does lend support to the conjecture that multi-paragraph subtopicsized segments, such as those produced by TextTiling, are useful for similarity-based comparisons in information retrieval.
    It will not be surprising if motivated subtopic segments are not found to perform significantly better than appropriately sized, but arbitrarily segmented, units in a coarse-grained information retrieval evaluation.
    At TREC, the most prominent information retrieval evaluation platform (Harman 1993), the top 1,000 documents are evaluated for each query, and the best-performing systems tend to use very simple statistical methods for ranking documents.
    In this kind of evaluation methodology, subtle distinctions in analysis techniques tend to be lost, whether those distinctions be how accurately words are reduced to their roots (Hull and Grefenstette 1995; Harman 1991), or exactly how passages are subdivided.
