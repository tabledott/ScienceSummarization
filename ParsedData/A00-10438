hows that 81.3% of reduction decisions made by the system agreed with those of humans.
    In the future, we would like to integrate our sentence reduction system with extraction-based summarization systems other than the one we have developed, improve the performance of the system further by introducing other sources of knowledge necessary for reduction, and explore other interesting applications of the reduction system.

    Current automatic summarizers usually rely on sentence extraction to produce summaries.
    Human professionals also often reuse the input documents to generate summaries; however, rather than simply extracting sentences and stringing them together, as most current summarizers do, humans often &amp;quot;edit&amp;
