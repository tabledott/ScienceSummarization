    We considered adapting our method to use Bojar (2004)&#8217;s dependency parser for Czech, but did not have the time.
  
  
    The past two ACL workshops on machine translation used Bleu as the sole automatic measure of translation quality.
    Bleu was used exclusively since it is the most widely used metric in the field and has been shown to correlate with human judgments of translation quality in many instances (Doddington, 2002; Coughlin, 2003; Przybocki, 2004).

    The results of last year&#8217;s workshop further suggested that Bleu systematically underestimated the quality of rule-based machine translation systems (Koehn and Monz, 2006).
    We used the manual evaluation data as a means of testing the cor
