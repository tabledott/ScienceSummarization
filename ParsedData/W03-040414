ve because the expression &#8220;raised eyebrows&#8221; probably occurs more often in our corpus than literal references to &#8220;eyebrows&#8221;.
    Table 5 shows examples of learned words that were classified as StrongSubjective or WeakSubjective.
    Once the words had been manually classified, we could go back and measure the effectiveness of the algorithms.
    The graph in Figure 1 tracks their accuracy as the bootstrapping progressed.
    The X-axis shows the number of words generated so far.
    The Y-axis shows the percentage of those words that were manually classified as subjective.
    As is typical of bootstrapping algorithms, accuracy was high during the initial iterations but tapered off as the bootstrapping continued.
    After 20 words, both algorithms were 95% accurate.
    After 100 words Basilisk was 75% accurate and MetaBoot was 81% accurate.
    After 1000 words, accuracy dropped to about 28% for MetaBoot, but Basilisk was still performing reasonably well at 53%.
    Although 53% accur
