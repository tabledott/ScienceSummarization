    As the text databases available to users become larger and more heterogeneous, genre becomes increasingly important for computational linguistics as a complement to topical and structural principles of classification.
    We propose a theory of genres as of correlate with various surface cues, and argue that genre detection based on surface cues is as successful as detection based on deeper structural properties.
  
  
    Computational linguists have been concerned for the most part with two aspects of texts: their structure and their content.
    That is. we consider texts on the one hand as formal objects, and on the other as symbols with semantic or referential values.
    In this paper we want to consider texts from the point of view of genre: that is. according to the various functional roles they play.
    Genre is necessarily a heterogeneous classificatory principle, which is based among other things on the way a text was created. the way it is distributed,
