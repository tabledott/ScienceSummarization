 science and NLP.
    We intend to assess the potential of our composition models on context sensitive semantic priming (Till et al., 1988) and inductive inference (Heit and Rubinstein, 1994).
    NLP tasks that could benefit from composition models include paraphrase identification and context-dependent language modeling (Coccaro and Jurafsky, 1998).
