im ilarity measure to analysing the statistical and linguistic properties of sets of distributionally similar words returned by different measures.
			This will make it possible to predict in advanceof any experimental evaluation which distributional similarity measures might be most appro priate for a particular application.
			Further, we explore a problem faced by the automatic thesaurus generation community, which is that distributional similarity methodsdo not seem to offer any obvious way to distinguish between the semantic relations of syn onymy, antonymy and hyponymy.
			Previous work on this problem (Caraballo, 1999; Lin et al., 2003) involves identifying specific phrasal patterns within text e.g., ?Xs and other Ys?
			is used as evidence that X is a hyponym of Y. Our work explores the connection between relativefrequency, distributional generality and seman tic generality with promising results.
			The rest of this paper is organised as follows.In Section 2, we present ten distributional simi larity
