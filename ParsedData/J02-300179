rization of the verb.
    For example, the verb open seems to be more likely to assign the role PATIENT to its subject in an intransitive context and AGENT to its subject in a transitive context.
    Our use of a subcategorization feature was intended to differentiate between transitive and intransitive uses of a verb.
    The feature used was the identity of the phrase structure rule expanding the target word&#8217;s parent node in the parse tree, as shown in Figure 12.
    For example, for He closed the door, with close as the target word, the subcategorization feature would be &#8220;VP &#8594; VB NP.&#8221; The subcategorization feature was used only when the target word was a verb.
    The various part-of-speech tags for verb forms (VBD for past-tense verb forms, VBZ for third-person singular present tense, VBP for other present tense, VBG for present participles, and VBN for past participles) were collapsed into a single tag VB.
    It is important to note that we are not able to distinguish complements
