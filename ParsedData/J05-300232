d sentences, we insert only subtrees whose top node aligns with one of the nodes in a basis tree.8 We further constrain the insertion procedure by inserting only trees that appear in at least half of the sentences of a theme.
    These two constituent-level restrictions prevent the algorithm from generating overly long, unreadable sentences.9 Finally, subtrees which are not part of the intersection are pruned off the basis tree.
    However, removing all such subtrees may result in an ungrammatical or semantically flawed sentence; for example, we might create a sentence without a subject.
    This overpruning may happen if either the input to the fusion algorithm is noisy or the alignment has failed to recognize similar subtrees.
    Therefore, we perform a more conservative pruning, deleting only the self-contained components which can be removed without leaving ungrammatical sentences.
    As previously observed in the literature (Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999; Jing and McKeown 2000), such components inclu
