course relations in the text under a multinomial model is very highly and significantly correlated with readability ratings, especially after text length is taken into account.
    Correlations are 0.48 and 0.54 respectively.
    The probability of the explicit relations alone is not a sufficiently strong indicator of readability.
    This fact is disappointing as the explicit relations can be identified much more easily in unannotated text (Pitler et al., 2008).
    Note that the sequence of just the implicit relations is also not sufficient.
    This observation implies that the proportion of explicit and implicit relations may be meaningful but we leave the exploration of this issue for later work.
    So far, we introduced six classes of factors that have been discussed in the literature as readability correlates.
    Through statistical tests of associations we identified the individual factors significantly correlated with readability ratings.
    These are, in decreasing order of association strength:
