r every quantifier q in g, there is either a quantifier in a or a complex term in a that binds the same variable.
    Proof of these five statements does not constitute a proof of correctness, but provides motivation for assuming the correctness of the algorithm.
    As unbound variables in the output are the prime symptom of problems with previous algorithms, we take these criteria to be the most critical for indicating correctness.
    The first criterion follows directly from Corollary 1.
    The second and third criteria are a consequence of the following theorem which we prove informally.
    Theorem 2 For all expressions such that U(a) = u = , um' and V(a) = v = , v,j, and for b E {true, falsel and for 0 any of gen(a), pull(a, b), pull-opaque-args(a), apply-terms(a, b), and apply(applicable-term(a), a), u(g) = u and V(P) = v. Proof: Again, the proof is by induction on p(a), but we will be less formal in demonstrating the well-foundedness of the induction.
    The base case is trivial because, as shown i
