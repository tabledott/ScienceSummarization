paradigm, and in particular, on clarifying the assumptions needed to ensure the effectiveness of the CT algorithm.
    Blum and Mitchell (1998) presented a PAC-style analysis of co-training, introducing the concept of compatibility between the target function and the unlabeled data: that is, the target function should assign the same label to an instance regardless of which view it sees.
    They made two additional important points: first, that each view of the data should itself be sufficient for learning the classification task; and repeat until done train classifier h1 on view V1 of L train classifier h2 on view V2 of L allow h1 to posit labels for examples in U allow h2 to posit labels for examples in U add hi's most confidently labeled examples to L add h2's most confidently labeled examples to L second, that the views should be conditionally independent of each other in order to be useful.
    They proved that under these assumptions, a task that is learnable with random classification noise is learnab
