redicting a single link rela tion whose source and opinion expression both overlap withevery token of a document would achieve 100% overlap precision and recall.
			We can ensure this does not happen by mea suring the average number of (source, opinion) pairs to which each correct or predicted pair is aligned (excluding pairs not aligned at all).
			In our data, this does not exceed 1.08, (except for baselines), so we can conclude these evaluation measures are behaving reasonably.
