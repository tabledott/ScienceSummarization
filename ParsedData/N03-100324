ribution is the induction of MSA lattices from non-parallel data.
    Lattices have proven advantageous in a number of NLP contexts (Mangu et al., 2000; Bangalore et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2002; Pang et al., 2003), but were usually produced from (multi-)parallel data, which may not be readily available for many applications.
    We showed that word lattices can be induced from a type of corpus that can be easily obtained for many domains, broadening the applicability of this useful representation.
  
  
    We are grateful to many people for helping us in this work.
    We thank Stuart Allen, Itai Balaban, Hubie Chen, Tom Heyerman, Evelyn Kleinberg, Carl Sable, and Alex Zubatov for acting as judges.
    Eric Breck helped us with translating the output of the DIRT system.
    We had numerous very useful conversations with all those mentioned above and with Eli Barzilay, Noemie Elhadad, Jon Kleinberg (who made the &#8220;pigeonhole&#8221; observation), Mirella Lapata, Smaranda Muresan and Bo Pang.
