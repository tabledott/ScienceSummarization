    Precision for three different feature sets (lexical features, syntactic features, and both) is reported at recall levels from 10 to 100,000.
    At the 100,000 recall level, we classify most of the instances into three relations: 60% as location-contains, 13% as person-place-of-birth, and 10% as person-nationality. are in fact related but are wrongly omitted from the Freebase data, we expect that on average these false negatives will have a small effect on the performance of the classifier.
    For performance reasons, we randomly sample 1% of such entity pairs for use as negative training examples.
    By contrast, in the actual test data, 98.7% of the entity pairs we extract do not possess any of the top 102 relations we consider in Freebase.
    We use a multi-class logistic classifier optimized using L-BFGS with Gaussian regularization.
    Our classifier takes as input an entity pair and a feature vector, and returns a relation name and a confidence score based on the probability of the entity pa
