    This is a measure of the coders&#8217; ability to agree on the rare category.
  
  
    In this section we review the use of intercoder agreement measures in CL since Carletta&#8217;s original paper in light of the discussion in the previous sections.
    We begin with a summary of Krippendorff&#8217;s recommendations about measuring reliability (Krippendorff 2004a, Chapter 11), then discuss how coefficients of agreement have been used in CL to measure the reliability of annotation schemes, focusing in particular on the types of annotation where there has been some debate concerning the most appropriate measures of agreement
