    Combining raw language data with linguistic information offers a promising basis for the development of new efficient and robust NLP methods.
    Realworld texts annotated with different strata of linguistic information can be used for grammar induction.
    The data-drivenness of this approach presents a clear advantage over the traditional, idealised notion of competence grammar.
    Corpora annotated with syntactic structures are commonly referred to as trctbank.5.
    Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture, as they all have to meet the same basic requirements, namely: Descriptivity: Grammatical phenomena are to be described rather than explained.
    Theory-independence: Annotations should not be influenced by theory-specific considerations.
    Nevertheless, different theory-specific representations s
