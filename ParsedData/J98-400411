PP modification, in addition to the two-level representations used in the treebank.
    (Note that this is not a criticism of the use of this representation in a treebank, but of modeling such a representation with a PCFG).
    This raises the question: how should a parse tree be interpreted that does not fit the representational scheme used to construct the treebank training data?
    As noted above, the WSJ corpus represents PP modification to NPs using the twolevel representation.
    The PCFG estimated from sections 2-21 of this corpus contains the following two productions: These productions generate the two-level representations of one and two PP adjunctions to NP, as explained above.
    However, the second of these productions will never be used in a maximum-likelihood parse, as the parse of sequence NP PP PP involving two applications of the first rule has a higher estimated likelihood.
    In fact, all of the productions of the form NP NP Pr where n&gt; 1 in the PCFG induced from sections 2-21 of th
