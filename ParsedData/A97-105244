r to recognize and calculate the relative frequency of six subcategorization classes.
    They report an accuracy rate of 83% (254 errors) at classifying 1565 classifiable tokens of 33 distinct verbs in running text and suggest that incorrect noun phrase boundary detection accounts for the majority of errors.
    They report that for 32 verbs their system correctly predicts the most frequent class, and for 30 verbs it correctly predicts the second most frequent class, if there was one.
    Our system rankings include all classes for each verb, from a total of 160 classes, and average 81.4% correct.
    Manning (1993) conducts a larger experiment, also using a PoS tagged corpus and a finite-state NP parser, attempting to recognize sixteen distinct complementation patterns.
    He reports that for a test sample of 200 tokens of 40 verbs in running text, the acquired subcategorization dictionary listed the appropriate entry for 163 cases, giving a token recall of 82% (as compared with 80.9% in our experiment).
