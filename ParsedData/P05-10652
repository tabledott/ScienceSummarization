    Information retrieval systems successfully find topical materials and even answer complex queries in text databases and on the World Wide Web.
    However, an effective automated way to assess the reading level of the retrieved text is still needed.

    The results presented here on reading level assessment are part of a larger project to develop teacher-support tools for bilingual education instructors.
    The larger project will include a text simplification system, adapting paraphrasing and summarization techniques.
