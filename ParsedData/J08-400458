disagreement.&#8221; This is clearly a fundamental issue.
    Ideally we would want to establish thresholds which are appropriate for the field of CL, but as we will see in the rest of this section, a decade of practical experience hasn&#8217;t helped in settling the matter.
    In fact, weighted coefficients, while arguably more appropriate for many annotation tasks, make the issue of deciding when the value of a coefficient indicates sufficient agreement even Kappa values and strength of agreement according to Landis and Koch (1977). more complicated because of the problem of determining appropriate weights (see Section 4.4).
    We will return to the issue of interpreting the value of the coefficients at the end of this article.
    4.1.4 Agreement and Machine Learning.
    In a recent article, Reidsma and Carletta (2008) point out that the goals of annotation in CL differ from those of content analysis, where agreement coefficients originate.
    A common use of an annotated corpus in CL is not to confirm
