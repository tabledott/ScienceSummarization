e corpus, the frequency of occurrence of true translates of f in corresponding English sentences would overwhelm that of other candidates whose appearance in those sentences i accidental?
  This belief is obviously flawed.
  In particular, the article "the" would get the highest count since it would appear multiply in practically every English sentence, and similar problems would exist with other function words as well.
  What needs to bedone is to introduce some sort of normalization that would appropriately discount for the expected frequency of occurrence of words.
  Let P(e~) denote the probability (based on ttle above procedure) that the word e, is a translate of a randomly chosen Frenchword.
  P(e~) is given by Pie i) = ~f P(e i l f  ) r ( f  )  = ~f P(e~ l f  )M( f  ) /M  (3.i) where M is the total length of the French text, and M(f  )  is the number of occurrences o f f  t in that text (as before).
  The fraction P(e, I f )  / P(e,) is an indicator of the strength of association of e, with f, since P(
