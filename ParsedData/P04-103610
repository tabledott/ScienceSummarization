rmation content&#8221; (IC) of a class .
    Jiang and Conrath specify a distance measure: , where the third class ( ) is the most informative, or most specific, superordinate synset of the two senses and .
    This is transformed from a distance measure in the WN-Similarity package by taking the reciprocal:
  
  
    In order to evaluate our method we use the data in SemCor as a gold-standard.
    This is not ideal since we expect that the sense frequency distributions within SemCor will differ from those in the BNC, from which we obtain our thesaurus.
    Nevertheless, since many systems performed well on the English all-words task for SENSEVAL-2 by using the frequency information in SemCor this is a reasonable approach for evaluation.
    We generated a thesaurus entry for all polysemous nouns which occurred in SemCor with a frequency 2, and in the BNC with a frequency 10 in the grammatical relations listed in section 2.1 above.
    The jcn measure uses corpus data for the calculation of IC.
