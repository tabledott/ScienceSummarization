resentation orderings within that domain.
			We first describe an efficient, knowledge-lean methodfor learning both a set of topics and the relations be tween topics directly from un-annotated documents.
			Our technique incorporates a novel adaptation of the standard HMM induction algorithm that is tailored to the task of modeling content.
			Then, we apply techniques based on content models totwo complex text-processing tasks.
			First, we consider in formation ordering, that is, choosing a sequence in whichto present a pre-selected set of items; this is an essen tial step in concept-to-text generation, multi-document summarization, and other text-synthesis problems.
			In our experiments, content models outperform Lapata?s (2003) state-of-the-art ordering method by a wide margin ? forone domain and performance metric, the gap was 78 percentage points.
			Second, we consider extractive summa 1But ?formulaic?
