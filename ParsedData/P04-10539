rated by at most N intervening words.
    We collect the intervening words between two named entities for each co-occurrence.
    These words, which are stemmed, could be regarded as the context of the pair of named entities.
    Different orders of occurrence of the named entities are also considered as different contexts.
    For example, and are collected as different contexts, where and represent named entities.
    Less frequent pairs of NEs should be eliminated because they might be less reliable in learning relations.
    So we have set a frequency threshold to remove those pairs.
    We adopt a vector space model and cosine similarity in order to calculate the similarities between the set of contexts of NE pairs.
    We only compare NE pairs which have the same NE types, e.g., one PERSON &#8211; GPE pair and another PERSON &#8211; GPE pair.
    We define a domain as a pair of named entity types, e.g., the PERSON-GPE domain.
    For example, we have to detect relations between PERSON and GPE in the PER
