lated into an English string e / = el...ei...cl. Among all possible English strings, we will choose the one with the highest probability which is given by Bayes' decision rule: a{ = argmax{P,.(c{lAa)} q = argmax {Pr(ejt) . l ' r ( f  le\[)} el ~ Pr(e{) is the language model of the target lan- guage, whereas Pr(fJle{) is the string translation model.
			The argmax operation denotes the search problem.
			In this paper, we address the problem of introducing structures into the probabilistic de- pendencies in order to model the string translation probability Pr(f~ le{).
	
	
			A key issne in modeling the string translation probability Pr(J'~le I) is the question of how we define the correspondence b tween the words of the English sentence and the words of the French sentence.
			In typical cases, we can assume a sort of pairwise dependence by considering all word pairs (fj, ei) for a given sentence pair I.-/1\[~'J', elqlj' We fur- ther constrain this model by assigning each French word to exactly one English wo
