the questions that TextMap answered incorrectly, were answered entirely correctly using the extracted pairs.
    This suggests that over half of the questions that TextMap got wrong could have benefited from information in the concept-instance pairs.
    Finally, while the look-up of extracted pairs took approximately ten seconds for all 100 questions, TextMap took approximately 9 hours.
    This difference represents a time speed up of three orders of magnitude.
    There are a number of reasons why the state of the art system performed poorly compared to the simple extraction method.
    First, as mentioned above, the lack of newspaper text on the web means that TextMap did not have access to the same information-rich resources that the extraction method exploited.
    Further, the simplicity of the extraction method makes it more resilient to the noise (such as parser error) that is introduced by the many modules employed by TextMap.
    And finally, because it is designed to answer any type of question, n
