    CogNIAC as a set of seven or so high precision rules would act as an effective filter on what a more knowledge rich application would have to resolve.
    But the essential component behind CogNIAC is not the rules themselves, but the control structure of behind its coreference resolution algorithm.
    This control structure could control general inference techniques as well.
    An interesting way to look at CogNIAC is as a search procedure.
    The Naive Algorithm can be over simplified as depth first search over parse trees.
    Depth first search is also a perfectly reasonable control structure for an inference engine-- as it is with PROLOG.
    The search structure of CogNIAC could be characterized as parallel iterative deepening with solutions being accepted only if a unique solution is found to the depth of the parallel search.
    But there is not enough room in this paper to explore the general properties of CogNIAC's search and evaluation strategy.
