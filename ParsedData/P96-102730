ng edges by the vertices that they are incident from, is given in (16).
    The grammar is consulted only for the purpose of creating active edges and all interactions in the chart are between active and inactive pairs of edges incident from the d the dog np(d) d: dog(d), def(d) saw the vp(s, d)/np(d) s: see(s), past(s), cat argl(s, d), arg2(s, c), cat(c), def(c) c the cat np(c) c: cat(c), def(c) s saw the vp(s, d) s: see(s), past(s), cat argl(s, d), arg2(s, c), cat(c), def(c) Among the edges in (16), there are two interactions, one at vertices c and d. They cause the first and third edges in (17) to be added to the agenda.
    The first interacts with the active edge originally introduced by the verb &amp;quot;saw&amp;quot; producing the fourth entry in (17).
    The label on this edge matches the first item on the right-hand side of rule (12) and the active edge that we show in the second entry is also introduced.
    The final interaction is between the first and second edges in (17) which give rise to the
