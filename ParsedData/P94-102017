igure 1 for Model 4 of Table 2.
    In both Figures 1 and 2, each of the variables short, in, pursue, rate(s), percent (i.e., the sign &amp;quot;70') is the presence or absence of that spelling form.
    Each of the variables rlpos, r2pos, Ilpos, and 12pos is the POS tag of the word 1 or 2 positions to the left (/) or right (r).
    The variable ending is whether interest is in the singular or plural, and the variable tag is the sense tag assigned to interest.
    The graphical representation of Model 4 is such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the nodes of the graph and the sets of conditionally independent variables in the model.
    The semantics of the graph topology is that all variables that are not directly connected in the graph are conditionally independent given the values of the variables mapping to the connecting nodes.
    For example, if node a separates node b from node c in the graphical representation of a markov field, then the variables mapping to node b are conditionally in
