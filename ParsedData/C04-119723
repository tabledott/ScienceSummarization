8, the development set,used in tuning parameters of the system, from sec tion 20, and the test set from section 21.
			We first compare this system with the basic taggerthat we have, the CSCL shallow parser from (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001), which is equivalent to us ing the scoring function from the first phase with only the non-overlapping/embedding constraints.
