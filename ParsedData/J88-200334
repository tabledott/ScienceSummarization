ch that reference time (R) and event time (E) are identical, while progressives and perfects are such that R and E are not identical.3 The only coherent generalisation of his scheme to durative events is to maintain this pattern and assume that R and E are coextensive for an utterance like: 42.
    Harry ran a mile.
    It follows that R may be an extended period (cf.
    Steedman 1982).
    R may also be an extended period for a state such as a progressive, although in this case the corresponding event time is still quite separate, of course.
    What is the nature of this referent, and how is it established?
    The anaphoric quality of tense has often been specifically compared to pronominal anaphora (cf.
    McCawley 1971; Partee 1973; Isard 1974).
    However, in one respect, the past tense does not behave like a pronoun: use of a pronoun such as &amp;quot;she&amp;quot; does not change the referent to which a subsequent use of the same pronoun may refer, whereas using a past tense may.
