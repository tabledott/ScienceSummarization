 as input to the statistical modeler, which ultimately decides whether the accumulated evidence that a particular verb manifests a particular syntactic frame in the input is reliable enough to warrant a conclusion.
    To the best of my knowledge, this is the first attempt to design a system that autonomously learns syntactic frames from naturally occurring text.
    The goal of learning syntactic frames and the learning framework described above lead to three major differences between the approach reported here and most recent work in learning grammar from text.
    First, this approach leverages a little a priori grammatical knowledge using statistical inference.
    Most work on corpora of naturally occurring language either uses no a priori grammatical knowledge (Brill and Marcus 1992; Ellison 1991; Finch and Chater 1992; Pereira and Schabes 1992), or else it relies on a large and complex grammar (Hindle 1990, 1991).
    One exception is Magerman and Marcus (1991), in which a small grammar is used to aid
