    If it is, we have managed to find a distinguishing graph, which is subsequently stored in the variable bestGraph.
    In the first iteration, this is obviously not the case, and we continue, recursively trying to extend H by adding Three values for H in the generation process for d1. adjacent (neighboring) edges until either a distinguishing graph has been constructed (all distractors are ruled out) or the costs of H exceed the costs of the bestGraph found so far.
    While bestGraph is still the null graph, the algorithm continues until H is a distinguishing graph.
    Which is the first distinguishing graph to be found (if more than one exists) depends on the order in which the adjacent edges are tried (see also Section 5.1).
    Suppose for the sake of argument that the first distinguishing graph to be found is (ii) in Figure 7.
    This graph is returned and stored in bestGraph.
    The costs associated with this graph are five points (two vertices and three edges).
