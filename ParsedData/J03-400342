 Pcc parameters.) and (3) It must be dominated by the correct nonterminal label.
    For example, in Figure 7, the trace is an argument to bought, which it follows, and it is dominated by a VP.
    Of the 437 cases, 341 were string-vacuous extraction from subject position, recovered with 96.3% precision and 98.8% recall; and 96 were longer distance cases, recovered with 81.4% precision and 59.4% recall.16
  
  
    This section discusses some aspects of the models in more detail.
    Section 7.1 gives a much more detailed analysis of the parsers&#8217; performance.
    In section 7.2 we examine 16 We exclude infinitival relative clauses from these figures (for example, I called a plumber TRACE to fix the sink, where plumber is coindexed with the trace subject of the infinitival).
    The algorithm scored 41% precision and 18% recall on the 60 cases in section 23&#8212;but infinitival relatives are extremely difficult even for human annotators to distinguish from purpose clauses (in this case, the infinitival
