negative number: where pos(tx) is the numeric position of the unigram tx in the system translation string, and pos(ry) is the numeric position of the unigram ry in the reference string* For a given alignment, every pair of unigram mappings is evaluated as a cross or not, and the alignment with the least total crosses is selected in this second phase* Note that these two phases together constitute a variation of the algorithm presented in (Turian et al, 2003)* Each stage only maps unigrams that have not been mapped to any unigram in any of the preceding stages* Thus the order in which the stages are run imposes different priorities on the mapping modules employed by the different stages* That is, if the first stage employs the &amp;quot;exact&amp;quot; mapping module and the second stage employs the &amp;quot;porter stem&amp;quot; module, METEOR is effectively preferring to first map two unigrams based on their surface forms, and performing the stemming only if the surface forms do not match (or if the mapping
