parses for all the sentences in the corpus in the pre-processing step.
    Algorithm 2 provides the details of the rest of the process: Steps 1 and 2 extract the paths and compute their distributional properties, and Steps 3&#8211;14 extract pairs of paths which are Two different dependency tree paths (a and b) that are considered paraphrastic because the same words (John and problem) are used to fill the corresponding slots (shown co-indexed) in both the paths.
    The implied meaning of each dependency path is also shown. similar, insofar as such properties are concerned.5 At the end, we have sets of paths (or inference rules) that are considered to have similar meanings by the algorithm.
    The performance of their dependency-path based algorithm depends heavily on the root of the extracted path.
    For example, whereas verbs frequently tend to have several modifiers, nouns tend to have no more than one.
    However, if a word has any fewer than two modifiers, no path can go through it as the root.
