e maximum-entropy model would be to introduce new features which indicated whether the tagging decision in the history creates a particular global feature.
    For example, we could introduce a feature if t = N and this decision creates an LWLC=1 feature otherwise As an example, this would take the value if its was tagged as N in the following context,
  
  
    because tagging its as N in this context would create an entity whose last word was not capitalized, i.e., University for.
    Similar features could be created for all of the global features introduced in this paper.
    This example also illustrates why this approach is unlikely to improve the performance of the maximum-entropy tagger.
    The parameter associated with this new feature can only affect the score for a proposed sequence by modifying at the point at which .
    In the example, this means that the LWLC=1 feature can only lower the score for the segmentation by lowering the probability of tagging its as N. But its has almost probably of
