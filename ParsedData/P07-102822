he similarities we compute by the choice of text domain for the generalization corpus.
    In this paper we have used the model to compute sense-specific selectional preferences for semantic roles.
    In a pseudo-disambiguation task the similarity-based model showed error rates down to 0.16, far lower than both EM-based clustering and Resnik's WordNet model.
    However its coverage is considerably lower than that of EMbased clustering, comparable to Resnik's model.
    The most probable reason for this is the sparsity of the underlying vector space.
    The choice of similarity metric is critical in similarity-based models, with Jaccard and Lin achieving the best performance, and Cosine surprisingly bringing up the rear.
    Next steps will be to test the similarity-based model &#8220;in vivo&#8221;, in an SRL task; to test the model in a WSD task; to evaluate the model on a primary corpus that is not semantically analyzed, for greater comparability to previous approaches; to explore other vector spaces to
