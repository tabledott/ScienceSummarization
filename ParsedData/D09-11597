rini and Kroch, 2007), and it is acceptable to substitute a single word by a phrase with same syntactic category in a sentence.
    Formally, we define the dependency parsing with phrase nodes as phrase dependency parsing.
    A dependency relationship which is an asymmetric binary relationship holds between two phrases.
    One is called head, which is the central phrase in the relation.
    The other phrase is called dependent, which modifies the head.
    A label representing the relation type is assigned to each dependency relationship, such as subj (subject), obj (object), and so on.
    Fig.2(c) shows an example of phrase dependency parsing result.
    By comparing the phrase dependency tree and the word level dependency tree in Fig.2, the former delivers a more succinct tree structure.
    Local words in same phrase are compacted into a single node.
    These words provide local syntactic and semantic effects which enrich the phrase they belong to.
    But they should have limited influences on the glo
