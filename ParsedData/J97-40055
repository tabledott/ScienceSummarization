ce between two rules, X &#8212;&gt; yes and X no, where X is the type of the node being considered for re-entrancy.
    In Eisele's case, expanding a goal term can be viewed as a stochastic choice among a finite set of rules X &#8212;&gt; where X is the predicate of the goal term and each 6 is a program clause whose head has predicate X.
    The parameters of the models are essentially weights on such rules, representing the probability of choosing 6 when making a choice of type X.
    In these terms, Brew and Eisele propose estimating parameters as the empirical relative frequency of the corresponding rules.
    That is, the weight of the rule X &#8212;&gt; is obtained by counting the number of times X rewrites as 6 in the training corpus, divided by the total number of times X is rewritten in the training corpus.
    For want of a standard term, let us call these estimates Empirical Relative Frequency (ERF) estimates.
    To deal with incomplete data, both Brew and Eisele appeal to the Expectation-Maximizat
