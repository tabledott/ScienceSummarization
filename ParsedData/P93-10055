    Conclusions The success of the HBG model encourages future development of general history-based grammars as a more promising approach than the usual P-CFG.
    More experimentation is needed with a larger Treebank than was used in this study and with different aspects of the derivation history.
    In addition, this paper illustrates a new approach to grammar development where the parsing problem is divided (and hopefully conquered) into two subproblems: one of grammar coverage for the grammarian to address and the other of statistical modeling to increase the probability of picking the correct parse of a sentence.
  
  
    Almost any natural language sentence is ambiguous in structure, reference, or nuance of meaning.
    Humans overcome these apparent ambiguities by examining the context of the sentence.
    But what exactly is context?
    Frequently, the correct interpretation is apparent from the words or constituents immediately surrounding the phrase in question.
