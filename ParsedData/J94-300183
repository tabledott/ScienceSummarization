nts of the different subrules to avoid (as much as possible) confusion with our other notational conventions.
    A crucial part of our treatment of an ordinary rule is to introduce special bracket symbols to mark the appearance of its left and right contexts so that its replacements are carried out only in the proper (possibly overlapping) environments.
    We do the same thing for each of the subrules of a batch, but we use a different set of brackets for each of them.
    These brackets permit us to code in a single string the context occurrences for all the different subrules with each subrule's contexts distinctively marked.
    Let &lt;k be the set{ &lt; k &lt;k &lt;k of left-context brackets for the kth subrule I a c /k /).k pk of the batch, let &gt;k be the corresponding set of right-context brackets, and let mk be the set &lt;k U &gt;k.
    We also redefine the generic cover symbols &lt;, &gt;, and m to stand for the respective collections of all brackets: &lt; = Uk&lt;k, &gt; = Uk&gt;k, m = &lt;U&gt
