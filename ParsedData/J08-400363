 the average over all languages, with the top score in each row set in boldface.
    For comparison, we also include the results of the two top scoring systems in the CoNLL-X shared task, those of McDonald, Lerman, and Pereira (2006) and Nivre et al. (2006).
    Starting with the LAS, we see that the multilingual average is very similar across the seven parsers, with a difference of only 0.58 percentage points between the best and the worst result, obtained with the non-projective and the strictly projective version of the list-based parser, respectively.
    However, given the large amount of data, some of the differences are nevertheless statistically significant (according to McNemar&#8217;s test, &#945; = .05).
    Broadly speaking, the group consisting of the non-projective, list-based parser and the three pseudo-projective parsers significantly outperforms the group consisting of the three projective parsers, whereas there are no significant differences within the two groups.10 This shows that the capac
