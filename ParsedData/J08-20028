del that does not add any dependency arcs among the random variables.
    To tackle the efficiency problem, we adopt dynamic programming and re-ranking algorithms.
    To avoid overfitting we encode only a small set of linguistically motivated dependencies in features over sets of the random variables.
    Our re-ranking approach, like the approach to parse re-ranking of Collins (2000), employs a simpler model&#8212;a local semantic role labeling algorithm&#8212;as a first pass to generate a set of n likely complete assignments of labels to all parse tree nodes.
    The joint model is restricted to these n assignments and does not have to search the exponentially large space of all possible joint labelings.
  
  
    There has been a substantial amount of work on automatic semantic role labeling, starting with the statistical model of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).
    Researchers have worked on defining new useful features, and different system architectures and models.
    Here we review the work most closely
