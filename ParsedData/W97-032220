    Figure 5 shows the average accuracy and standard deviation of disambiguation over 25 random trials for each combination of word, feature set and learning algorithm.
    Those cases where the average accuracy of one algorithm for a particular feature set is significantly higher than another algorithm, as judged by the t-test (p=.01), are shown in bold face.
    For each word, the most accurate overall experiment (i.e., algorithm/feature set combination), and those that are not significantly less accurate are underlined.
    Also included in Figure 5 is the percentage of each sample that is composed of the majority sense.
    This is the accuracy that can be obtained by a majority classifier; a simple classifier that assigns each ambiguous word to the most frequent sense in a sample.
    However, bear in mind that in unsupervised experiments the distribution of senses is not generally known.
    Perhaps the most striking as
