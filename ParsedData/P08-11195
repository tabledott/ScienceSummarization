g., (Caraballo, 1999; Cimiano and Volker, 2005; Mann, 2002)), and learning semantic relations such as meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Girju et al., 2003).
    Our research focuses on semantic lexicon induction, which aims to generate lists of words that belong to a given semantic class (e.g., lists of FISH or VEHICLE words).
    Weakly supervised learning methods for semantic lexicon generation have utilized co-occurrence statistics (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998), syntactic information (Tanev and Magnini, 2006; Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004; Phillips and Riloff, 2002), lexico-syntactic contextual patterns (e.g., &#8220;resides in &lt;location&gt;&#8221; or &#8220;moved to &lt;location&gt;&#8221;) (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Thelen and Riloff, 2002), and local and global contexts (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002).
    These methods have been evaluated only on fixed corpora1, although (Pantel et al., 2004) demonstrated how to scale up their algorithms for the web.
