  Since each structure ( rule) corresponds to a token in the ?We put indices on categories to express syntactic roles (0 for subject, 1 for object).
  sentence, it can be used only once.
  Rules are now differen- tiated by their realization in the sentence.
  The number of rules that can be used for a given sentence is bounded and is proportional to the length of the sentence.
  Since each rule can be used once, recursion does not lead to the usual non-termination problem.
  Once a structure has been cho~ sen for a given token, the other possible structures for the same token do not participate in t
