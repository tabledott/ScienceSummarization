 of paths in lieu of derivations.
    The probability P(P) of a path P is the product of the probabilities of all rules used in the predicted states occurring in P. Lemma 2 Note that when summing over all paths &amp;quot;starting with the initial state,&amp;quot; summation is actually over all paths starting with S, by definition of the initial state 0 &#8212;&gt; .S.
    (a) follows directly from our definitions of derivation probability, string probability, path probability, and the one-to-one correspondence between paths and derivations established by Lemma 1.
    (b) follows from (a) by using S as the start nonterminal.
    To obtain the prefix probability in (c), we need to sum the probabilities of all complete derivations that generate x as a prefix.
    The constrained paths ending in scanned states represent exactly the beginnings of all such derivations.
    Since the grammar is assumed to be consistent and without useless nonterminals, all partial derivations can be completed with probability one.
