ote that Lattice MBR is operating over lattices which are gigantic in comparison to the number of paths in an N-best list.
    At a lattice density of 30, the lattices in aren contain on an average about 1081 hypotheses!
    We next examine the role of the scale factor &#945; in lattice MBR decoding.
    The MBR scale factor determines the flatness of the posterior distribution (Equation 3).
    It is chosen using a grid search on the dev2 set (Table 1).
    Figure 3 shows the variation in BLEU scores on eval08 as this parameter is varied.
    The results show that it is important to tune this factor.
    The optimal scale factor is identical for all three language pairs.
    In experiments not reported in this paper, we have found that the optimal scaling factor on a moderately sized development set carries over to unseen test sets.
    Lattice MBR Decoding (Equation 6) involves computing a posterior probability for each n-gram in the lattice.
    We would like to speed up the Lattice MBR computation (Sectio
