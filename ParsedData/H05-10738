 the TEP problem and explore features which may be useful.We explore two cases of flat classification, using a variation of the Winnow update rule implemented in the SNoW learning architecture (Carl son et al, 1999),1 which learns a linear classifierin feature space, and has been successful in sev eral NLP applications, e.g. semantic role labeling (Koomen, Punyakanok, Roth and Yih, 2005).
			In the first case, the set of emotion classes E consists of EMOTIONAL versus non-emotional or NEUTRAL, i.e. E = {N,E}.
			In the second case, E has been incremented with emotional distinctions accordingto the valence, i.e. E = {N,PE,NE}.
			Experi ments used 10-fold cross-validation, with 90% train and 10% test data.2 4.3 Data.
			The goal of our current data annotation project is to annotate a corpus of approximately 185 children stories, including Grimms?, H.C. Andersen?s and B.Potter?s stories.
			So far, the annotation process pro ceeds as follows: annotators work in pairs on the same stories.
