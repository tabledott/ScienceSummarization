    We try to investigate the impact of unlabeled data on the performance of unseen data.
    We divide the test set (or the development set) into two disjoint sets: L.app and L.neg app.
    L.app is a set of sentences constructed by words that all appeared in the Labeled training data.
    L.-,app is a set of sentences that have at least one word that does not appear in the Labeled training data.
    Table 5 shows the performance with these two sets obtained from both supervised CRF and JESSCM with 1G-word unlabeled data.
    As the supervised CRF results, the performance of the L.-,app sets is consistently much lower than that of the corresponding L.app sets.
    Moreover, we can observe that the ratios of L.&#172;app are not so small; nearly half (46.1% and 40.4%) in the PTB III data, and more than half (70.7%, 54.3% and 64.3%) in CoNLL&#8217;00 and &#8217;03 data, respectively.
    This indicates that words not appearing in the labeled training data are really harmful for supervised learning.
