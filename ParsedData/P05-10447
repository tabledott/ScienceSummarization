ons are likely to violate word order requirements&#8212;both of which have something to do with syntax. x was the most grammatical option that conveyed the speaker&#8217;s meaning, hence (we hope) roughly the most grammatical option in the neighborhood N(x), and the syntactic model should make it so.
  
  
    We have not yet specified the form of our probabilistic model, only that it is parameterized by B&#65533; E Rn.
    Log-linear models, which we will show are a natural fit for CE, assign probability to an (example, label) pair (x, y) according to where the &#8220;unnormalized score&#8221; u(x, y |0) is and B E Rn are the corresponding feature weights (the model&#8217;s parameters).
    Because the features can take any form and need not be orthogonal, log-linear models can capture arbitrary dependencies in the data and cleanly incorporate them into a model.
    Z(&#65533;B) (the partition function) is chosen so that E(x,y) p(x, y  |0) = 1; i.e., Z(B) = E(x,y) u(x, y | 0). u is typically easy to compute
