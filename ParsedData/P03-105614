 local context, such as sisters, daughters, or cousins, quickly leads to unacceptable sparseness under MLE.
    To begin development, we tested the interaction of complete parent and/or grandparent annotation with PCFG markovization (see (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) for discussion).
    The indications for the utility of parent annotation in CTB parsing are mixed.
    The CTB is smaller and thus more susceptible to grammar fragmentation, but it is also less flat (see Table 1).
    We found that first-order markovization was superior to zero-order, second-order, and unmarkovized PCFGs for all levels of ancestor annotation, and that within first-order markovization parent annotation was slightly superior to no annotation, with grandparent annotation decidedly worse.
  
  
    Keeping in mind that less fragmented grammars are more robust to further category-splitting, we systematically investigated the major sources of error for the factored model with an unannotated first-order markov PCFG grammar whose only
