ogue structures yielded by the two tagging schemes.
    First, in our scheme (Figure 6), the greetings (turns 1 and 2) are tagged with all the attributes.
    Second, Smith and Gordon's single tag A corresponds to two attribute tags in Table 7, which in our scheme defines an extra level of structure within assessment subdialogues.
  
  
    This paper presented the PARADISE framework for evaluating spoken dialogue agents.
    PARADISE is a general framework for evaluating spoken dialogue agents that integrates and enhances previous work.
    PARADISE supports comparisons among dialogue strategies with a task representation that decouples what an agent needs to achieve in terms of the task requirements from how the agent carries out the task via dialogue.
    Furthermore, this task representation supports the calculation of performance over subdialogues as well as whole dialogues.
    In addition, because PARADISE's success measure normalizes for task complexity, it provides a basis for comparing agents perfor
