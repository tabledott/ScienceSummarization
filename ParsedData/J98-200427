e 13, the relationship between the two estimates is quite similar.
  
  
    In an earlier version of this paper (Caraballo and Charniak 1996), we presented the results for several of these models using our original grammar.
    The treebank grammar was introduced in Charniak (1996), and the parser in, that paper is a best-first parser using the boundary trigram figure of merit.
    The literature shows many implementations of best-first parsing, but none of the previous work shares our goal of explicitly comparing figures of merit.
    Bobrow (1990) and Chitrao and Grishman (1990) introduced statistical agendabased parsing techniques.
    Chitrao and Grishman implemented a best-first probabilistic parser and noted the parser's tendency to prefer shorter constituents.
    They proposed a heuristic solution of penalizing shorter constituents by a fixed amount per word.
    Miller and Fox (1994) compare the performance of parsers using three different types of grammars, and show that a probabilistic context-fre
