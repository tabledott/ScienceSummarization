n (e.g. SPORTS training data for SPORTS test data) are indicated with ?APPR?
			and contrasted with the results using SemCor data, indicated with ?SC?.
			8We see that for words which are pertinent to the do main of the test text, it pays to use domain specific training data.
			In some other cases, e.g. F sal tested on SPORTS, it is better to use SemCor data.
			For the eq sal words, accuracy is highest when FINANCEdata is used for training, reflecting their bias to fi nancial senses as noted in section 3.3.
	
	
			We are not aware of any other domain-specific man ually sense tagged corpora.
			We have created sensetagged corpora from two specific domains for a sam ple of words, and a similar resource from a balanced corpus which covers a wide range of domains.
			Wehave used these resources to do a quantitative evaluation which demonstrates that automatic acquisi tion of predominant senses outperforms the SemCor baseline for this sample of words.The domain-specific manually sense tagged resource is an inter
