t in the same way as the other loglinear parameters when performing cross-domain adaptation.
    Loglinear mixture models were not used for dynamic adaptation.
    For both adaptive settings, linear mixture weights were set as a function of the distance metrics described in section 3.4.
    Given a set of metrics {D1, ... , Dm}, let di,c be the distance from the current text to component c according to metric Di.
    A simple approach to weighting is to choose a single metric Di, and set the weights in (2) to be proportional to the corresponding distances: Because different distance metrics may capture complementary information, and because optimal weights might be a non-linear function of distance, we also experimented with a linear combination of metrics transformed using a sigmoid function: where Qi reflects the relative predictive power of Di, and the sigmoid parametes ai and bi can be set to selectively suppress contributions from components that are far away.
    Here we assume that Qi absorbs a normali
