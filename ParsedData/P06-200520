    Error analysis shows that the challenge of the model lies in the proper insertion of subject pronoun and auxiliary or copula verb, which serves to give further semantic information about the main verb, however this requires significant context understanding.
    For example, a message such as &#8220;u smart&#8221; gives little clues on whether it should be normalized to &#8220;Are you smart?&#8221; or &#8220;You are smart.&#8221; unless the full conversation is studied.
