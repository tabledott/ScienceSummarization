Here, we show the number of 1-, 2-, and 3-grams appearing with various frequencies in a sample of 365,893,263 words of English text from a variety of sources.
    The vocabulary consists of the 260,740 different words plus a special Number of n-grams with various frequencies in 365,893,263 words of running text. unknown word into which all other words are mapped.
    Of the 6.799 x 1010 2-grams that might have occurred in the data, only 14,494,217 actually did occur and of these, 8,045,024 occurred only once each.
    Similarly, of the 1.773 x 1016 3-grams that might have occurred, only 75,349,888 actually did occur and of these, 53,737,350 occurred only once each.
    From these data and Turing's formula (Good 1953), we can expect that maximum likelihood estimates will be 0 for 14.7 percent of the 3-grams and for 2.2 percent of the 2-grams in a new sample of English text.
    We can be confident that any 3-gram that does not appear in our sample is, in fact, rare, but there are so many of them that their agg
