 the outset is to try to limit supervision.
    Thus, the lack of natural stopping criteria renders these algorithms less unsupervised than one would hope.
    More importantly, this lack makes the algorithms difficult to use in settings where training must be completely automatic, such as in a generalpurpose information extraction system, where the topic may not be known in advance.
    At the same time, certain unsupervised learning algorithms in other domains exhibit inherently natural stopping criteria.
    One example is the algorithm for word sense disambiguation in (Yarowsky, 1995).
    Of particular relevance to our method are the algorithms for semantic classification of names or NPs described in (Thelen and Riloff, 2002; Yangarber et al., 2002).
    Inspired in part by these algorithms, we introduce the counter-training technique for unsupervised pattern acquisition.
    The main idea behind countertraining is that several identical simple learners run simultaneously to compete with one another in d
