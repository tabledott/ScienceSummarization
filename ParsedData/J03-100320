ical complexity.
    Note that this characterization of the worst-case complexity holds for graphs in which all edges have the same label; in that case each edge from H can potentially be matched to any edge from G. The bestcase complexity is given when each edge is uniquely labeled.
    In practice, the situation will most often be somewhere between these extremes.
    In general, we can say that the more diverse the labeling of edges in the graph of a particular scene is, the sooner a distinguishing vertex-graph pair will be found.
    It is worth pointing out that there are various alternatives to full subgraph isomorphism that have a lower complexity.
    For instance, as soon as an upper bound K is defined on the number of edges in a distinguishing graph, the problem loses its intractability (for relatively small K) and becomes solvable, in the worst case, in polynomial O(nK) time, where n is number of edges in the graph G. Restricting the problem in such a way is rather harmless for our current purposes
