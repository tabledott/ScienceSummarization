  We have implemented a version that accepts ITGs rather than BTGs, and plan to experiment with more heavily structured models.
    However, it is important to note that the search complexity rises exponentially rather than polynomially with the size of the grammar, just as for context-free parsing (Barton, Berwick, and Ristad, 1987).
    This is not relevant to the BTG-based model we have described since its grammar size is fixed; in fact the BTG's minimal grammar size has been an important advantage over more linguistically-motivated ITG-based models.
    157 We have also implemented a generalized version that accepts arbitrary grammars not restricted to normal form, with two motivations.
    The pragmatic benefit is that structured grammars become easier to write, and more concise.
    The expressiveness benefit is that a wider family of probability distributions can be written.
    As stated earlier, the normal form theorem guarantees that the same set of shapes will be explored by our search algorithm, r
