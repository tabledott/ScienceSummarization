Net itself.
    The cut produced 1287 semantic classes, a number similar to the classes in CBC.
    To properly test WordNet as a source of semantic classes for our selectional preferences, we would need to experiment with different extraction algorithms.
    The goal of the filtering task is to minimize false positives (incorrectly accepted inferences) and false negatives (incorrectly rejected inferences).
    A standard methodology for evaluating such tasks is to compare system filtering results with a gold standard using a confusion matrix.
    A confusion matrix captures the filtering performance on both correct and incorrect inferences: where A represents the number of correct instances correctly identified by the system, D represents the number of incorrect instances correctly identified by the system, B represents the number of false positives and C represents the number of false negatives.
    To compare systems, three key measures are used to summarize confusion matrices: probability of a filter bein
