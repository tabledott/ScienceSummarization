s such as hypernymy (e.g. apple kind-of edible fruit), meronymy (e.g. computer has-part CPU), etc.

    Each polysemous sense is further divided into a core sense and a set of subsenses.
    For each sense (both core and subsenses), the ODE provides a textual definition, and possibly hypernyms and domain labels.
    Excluding monosemous senses, the ODE has an average number of 2.56 senses per word compared to the average polysemy of 3.21 in WordNet on the same words (with peaks for verbs of 2.73 and 3.75 senses, respectively).
    In Table 1 we show an excerpt of the sense inventories of the noun race as provided by both dictionaries2.
    The ODE identifies 3 homonyms and 3 polysemous senses for the first homonym, wh
