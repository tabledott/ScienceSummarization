ependent on the exact path chosen, it can be computed in advance of decoding using an allpairs shortest path algorithm (Cormen et al., 1989).
    We tested the effect of the distance metric on translation quality using Chinese word segmentation lattices (Section 4.1, below) using both a hierarchical and phrase-based system modified to translate word lattices.
    We compared the shortest-path distance metric with a baseline which uses the difference in node number as the distortion distance.
    For an additional datapoint, we added a lexicalized reordering model that models the probability of each phrase pair appearing in three different orientations (swap, monotone, other) in the training corpus (Koehn et al., 2005).
    Table 2 summarizes the results of the phrasebased systems.
    On both test sets, the shortest path metric improved the BLEU scores.
    As expected, the lexicalized reordering model improved translation quality over the baseline; however, the improvement was more substantial in the model t
