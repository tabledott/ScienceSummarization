 of a structure includes the predications that X dominates Y, Y dominates Z and X also dominates Z. then the semantic interpreter will assume that X directly dominates Y and that Y directly dominates Z.
    We will call such an interpretation of a D-theoretic analysis the standard referent of the analysis.
    (We further assume that the description produced by a D-theory parser will have at each stage of the analysis one and only one standard referent, and the complex situation where two or more chains of domination Must be merged to arrive at a single standard referent will not arise in the operation of a Dtheory parser.
    Substantiation of these assumptions awaits the construction of a parser and a sizable grammar.)
    This notion of &amp;quot;standard referent&amp;quot; means that adding predications to the (partial) analysis of a sentence may very well change the standard referent of that analysis as viewed by the semantic interpreter.
    The key idea here is that from the point of view of semantics,
