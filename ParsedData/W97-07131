s to evaluate not only a representative set of automatically generated outputs (a highly difficult problem by itself), but also the adequacy of the assumptions that these programs use That way, one is able to distinguish the problems that pertain to a particular implementation from those that pertain to the underlying theoretical framework and explore new ways to improve each With few exceptions, automatic approaches to summarization have primarily addressed possible ways to determine the most important parts of a text (see Paice (1990) for an excellent overview) Determining the salient parts is considered to be achievable because one or more of the following assumptions hold (i) important sentences in a text contain words that are used frequently (Lahn, 1958, Edmundson, 1968), (n) important sentences contain words that are used in the tide and section headings (Edmundson, 1968), (in) important sentences are located at the beginning or end of paragraphs (Baxendale, 1958), (Iv) important sentences are located
