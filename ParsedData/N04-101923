and ideally it should never happen&#8211;the two summaries appear with scores opposite to what they really are.7 The probabilities p1, p2 and p3 can be computed directly by counting how many times the particular error occurs for all possible pyramids of order n. By taking each pyramid that does not contain either of sum1 or sum2 and comparing the scores they are assigned, the probabilities in Table 3 are obtained.
    We computed probabilities for pairs of summaries for the same set, then summed the counts for error occurrence across sets.
    The order of the pyramid is shown in column n. &#8220;Data points&#8221; shows how many pyramids of a given order were examined when computing the probabilities.
    The total probability of error p = p1 * P(|sum1 |==9 |sum2|) + (p2 + p3) * (1 &#8722; P(|sum1 |==9 |sum2|)) is also in Table 3.
    Table 3 shows that for order-4 pyramids, the errors of type E3 are ruled out.
    At order-5 pyramids, the total probability of error drops to 0.1 and is mainly due to error E2
