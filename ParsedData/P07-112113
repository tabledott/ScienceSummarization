ction operator (,), are both associative (a,(b,c) = (a,b),c = a,b,c) and commutative (a,b = b,a).
    Hence, conjuncts can be reordered and regrouped without changing the meaning of a conjunction.
    For example, rule extraction would be possible if the positions of the next to and state conjuncts were switched.
    We present a method for regrouping conjuncts to promote isomorphism between NL and MR parse trees.2 Given a conjunction, it does the following: (See Figure 6 for the pseudocode, and Figure 5 for an illustration.)
    Step 1.
    Identify the MRL productions that correspond to the conjuncts and the meta-predicate that takes the conjunction as an argument (count in Figure 5), and figure them as vertices in an undi2This method also applies to any operators that are associative and commutative, e.g. disjunction.
    For concreteness, however, we use conjunction as an example. rected graph, F. An edge (pi7 pj) is in F if and only if pi and pj contain occurrences of the same logical variables.
