iptions, of which Donnellan (1966) gives examples, demonstrate cases in which the &amp;quot;referential intentions&amp;quot; of the speaker in his use of the description play a role in determining Cb(U).
    For example, consider the following sequence: In these examples,' the speaker uses a description to refer to something other than the semantic denotation of that description, i.e. the unique thing that satisfies the description (if there is one).
    There are several alternative explanations of such examples, involving various accounts of speaker's intentions, mutual belief, and the like.
    A complete discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper.

    In this case, the noun phrase &amp;quot;her husband&amp;quot; contributes two individuals, the husband and the lover, to Cf(32a) and Cf(33a).
    This can be seen by observing that both discourses seem equal
