re 7 shows how to build and use a rudimentary MTSMT system, starting from some multitext and one or more monolingual treebanks.
    The recipe follows: T1.
    Induce a word-to-word translation model.
    T2.
    Induce PCFGs from the relative frequencies of productions in the monolingual treebanks.
    T3.
    Synchronize some multitext, e.g. using the approximations in Section 5.
    T4.
    Induce an initial PMTG from the relative frequencies of productions in the multitreebank.
    T5.
    Re-estimate the PMTG parameters, using a synchronous parser with the expectation semiring.
    A1.
    Use the PMTG to infer the most probable multitree covering new input text.
    A2.
    Linearize the output dimensions of the multitree.
    Steps T2, T4 and A2 are trivial.
    Steps T1, T3, T5, and A1 are instances of the generalized parsers described in this paper. complexity and generalization error stand in the way of its practical implementation.
    Nevertheless, it is satisfying to note that all the non-trivial
