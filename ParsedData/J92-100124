    (Section 3.3 discusses collocations and their representation in more detail.)
    Concretions activate specializations of the abstract sense of a word when it occurs with an object of a specific type.
    For example, in the core lexicon, the verb project has the abstract sense 'transfer'; however, if its object is a sound, the system activates a sense corresponding to a 'communication event,' as in She projected her voice.
    Encoding these specializations in the core lexicon would be problematic, because then a system would be forced to resolve such nuances of meaning even when there was not enough information to do so.
    Dynamic lexicons can provide much finer distinctions among senses than the core lexicon, because they do not increase the amount of ambiguity when their triggering context is inactive.
    Together, the core and dynamic lexicons provide the information necessary to recognize morphological preferences, sense preferences, and syntactic cue
