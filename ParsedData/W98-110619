    The first section of this paper begins with background about AutoSlog-TS, a corpus-based system for generating extraction patterns automatically, and the extraction patterns that it generates.
    The following section presents a new corpus-based algorithm that uses the extraction patterns as a building block for constructing conceptual case frame structures.
    We then show several examples of case frames that were generated automatically using this method.
    Finally, we present experimental results that compare the performance of the case frames with the extraction patterns.
    Our results show that the conceptual case frames produce substantially fewer false hits than the extraction patterns.
  
  
    In the past few years, several systems have been developed to generate structures for information extraction automatically.
    However, these systems usually need special training resources that are expensive to obtain.
    One of the first such system
