E-W.
    Using Equation 15 and f(k)=k2 as the weighting function, the ROUGE-W scores for sequences Y1 and Y2 are 0.571 and 0.286 respectively.
    Therefore, Y1 would be ranked higher than Y2 using WLCS.
    We use the polynomial function of the form ka in the ROUGE evaluation package.
    In the next section, we introduce the skip-bigram co-occurrence statistics.
  
  
    Skip-bigram is any pair of words in their sentence order, allowing for arbitrary gaps.
    Skip-bigram cooccurrence statistics measure the overlap of skipbigrams between a candidate translation and a set of reference translations.
    Using the example given in Section 3.1: each sentence has C(4,2)1 = 6 skip-bigrams.
    For example, S1 has the following skip-bigrams: (&#8220;police killed&#8221;, &#8220;police the&#8221;, &#8220;police gunman&#8221;, &#8220;killed the&#8221;, &#8220;killed gunman&#8221;, &#8220;the gunman&#8221;) S2 has three skip-bigram matches with S1 (&#8220;police the&#8221;, &#8220;police gunman&#8221;, &#8220;the gu
