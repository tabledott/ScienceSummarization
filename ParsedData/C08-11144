e psychology.We discuss the results of the experiments in Section 4.
			The accuracy of the algorithm is competitive with other systems, but the strength of the al gorithm is that it is able to handle all four tasks, with no tuning of the learning parameters to the particular task.
			It performs well, although it iscompeting against specialized algorithms, devel oped for single tasks.Related work is examined in Section 5 and limitations and future work are considered in Sec tion 6.
			We conclude in Section 7.
	
	
			An analogy, A:B::C:D, asserts that A is to B as C is to D; for example, traffic:street::water:riverbed asserts that traffic is to street as water is to riverbed; that is, the semantic relations between traffic and street are highly similar to the semantic relations between water and riverbed.
			We may view the task of recognizing word analogies as a problem of classifying word pairs (see Table 1).
