 items were spuriously tagged as time expressions (extra TIMEX).
    One source of this that should be at least partially correctable is in the tagging of apparent dates in proper names, e.g.
    &#8220;The July 26 Movement&#8221;, &#8220;The Tonight Show&#8221;, &#8220;USA Today&#8221;.
    The time expression identifying rules assumed that these had been tagged as lexical items, but this lexicalization has not yet been implemented.
    A total of 94 errors were made in the assignment of values to time expressions that had been correctly identified.
    Generic/Specific: In the combined data, 25 expressions were assigned a value when they should have received none because the expression was a generic usage that could not be placed on a time line.
    This is the single biggest source of errors in the value assignments.
  
  
    Our approach has been to develop initial rules by hand, conduct an initial evaluation on an unseen test set, determine major errors, and then handling those errors by augmenting the
