			The last two columns report unlabelled (UAS) and labelled (LAS) attachment scores on test data.
			days of computation, or a maximum of 15 epochs.
			For Basque, Chinese and Turkish we could complete the 15 epochs.
			For Arabic and Catalan, we couldonly complete 2 epochs.
			Table 3 reports the perfor mance of the higher-order projective models on the ten languages of the multilingual track.
	
	
			We have presented dependency parsing models that exploit higher-order factorizations of trees.
			Such factorizations allow the definition of second-order features associated with sibling and grand-parental relations.
			For some languages, our models obtain state-of-the-art results.One drawback of our approach is that the inference algorithms for higher-order models are very expensive.
			For languages with many dependency la bels or long sentences, training and parsing becomes impractical for current machines.
			Thus, a promising line
