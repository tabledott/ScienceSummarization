, abandoned or ignored utterances; backchannels; APs with multiple second elements, e.g. a question followed by answers of multiple speakers).2 Information provided by adjacency pairs can be used to identify the target of an agreeing or disagreeing utterance.
    We define the problem of AP identification as follows: given the second element (B) of an adjacency pair, determine who is the speaker of the first element (A).
    A quite effective baseline algorithm is to select as speaker of utterance A the most recent speaker before the occurrence of utterance B.
    This strategy selects the right speaker in 79.8% of the cases in the 50 meetings that were annotated with adjacency pairs.
    The next subsection describes the machine learning framework used to significantly outperform this already quite effective baseline algorithm.
    We view the problem as an instance of statistical ranking, a general machine learning paradigm used for example in statistical parsing (Collins, 2000) and question answering (Ravi
