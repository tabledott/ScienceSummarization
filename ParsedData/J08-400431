ach other as either the number of items or the number of coders approaches infinity.
    Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945; will work with any distance metric, provided that identical categories always have a distance of zero (dkk = 0 for all k).
    Another useful constraint is symmetry (dab = dba for all a, b).
    This flexibility affords new possibilities for analysis, which we will illustrate in Section 4.
    We should also note, however, that the flexibility also creates new pitfalls, especially in cases where it is not clear what the natural distance metric is.
    For example, there are different ways to measure dissimilarity between sets, and any of these measures can be justifiably used when the category labels are sets of items (as in the annotation of anaphoric relations).
    The different distance metrics yield different values of &#945; for the same annotation data, making it difficult to interpret the resulting values.
    We will return to this problem in Section 4.4.
