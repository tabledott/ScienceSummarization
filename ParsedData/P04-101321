    Modifying the training method to systematically optimize the decision boundary (as in large margin methods such as Support Vector Machines) is an area of future research.
  
  
    The complete parsing system uses the probability estimates computed by the SSN to search for the most probable parse.
    The search incrementally constructs partial parses d1,..., di by taking a parse it has already constructed d1,..., di&#8722;1 and using the SSN to estimate a probability distribution P(di|d1,..., di&#8722;1, ...) over possible next decisions di.
    These probabilities are then used to compute the probabilities for d1,..., di.
    In general, the partial parse with the highest probability is chosen as the next one to be extended, but to perform the search efficiently it is necessary to prune the search space.
    The main pruning is that only a fixed number of the most probable derivations are allowed to continue past the shifting of each word.
