ormalism is an extension of the definite clause grammar (DCG) [6] formalism, which is itself a restriction of Colmerauer's formalism of metamorphosis grammars (MGs) [2].
    Thus XGs and MGs may be seen as two alternative extensions of the same basic formalism, DCGs.
    The argument for XGs will start with a comparison with DCGs.
    I should point out, however, that the motivation for the development of XGs came from studying large MGs for natural language [4,7].
    The relationship between MGs and DCGs is analogous to that between type-0 grammars and contextfree grammars.
    So, some of the linguistic phenomena which are seen as rewriting one sequence of constituents into another might be described better in a MG than in a DCG.
    However, it will be shown that rewritings such as the one involved in left extraposition cannot easily be described in either of the two formalisms.
    Left extraposition has been used by grammarians to describe the form of interrogative sentences and relative clauses, at lea
