irst compared the parser with (Hwa, 1998): we trained the model on sentences of length 40 or less in sections 02{09 of the Penn Treebank, down to parts of speech only, and then tested on sentences of length 40 or less in section 23, parsing from part-of-speech tag sequences to fully bracketed parses.
    The metric used was the percentage of guessed brackets which did not cross any correct brackets.
    Our parser scored 84.4% compared with 82.4% for (Hwa, 1998), an error reduction of 11%.
    Next we compared our parser against lexicalized PCFG parsers, training on sections 02{21 and testing on section 23.
    The results are shown in Figure 6.
    These results place our parser roughly in the middle of the lexicalized PCFG parsers.
    While the results are not state-of-the-art, they do demonstrate the viability of TAG as a framework for statistical parsing.
    With improvements in smoothing and cleaner handling of punctuation and coordination, perhaps these results can be brought more upto-date.
