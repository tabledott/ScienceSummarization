p;quot;ripe&amp;quot;, and ppl the PP &amp;quot;from local orchards.&amp;quot; The analysis will also include predications about the left-to-right order of the terminal string, which has been informally represented in (12.9); &amp;quot;X &lt; Y&amp;quot; is to be read &amp;quot;X is the left of Y&amp;quot;.
    We indicate the order of nonterminals here only for the sake of brevity; we use n1 &lt; n2 as a shorthand for D(n 1, 'cheese'); D(n2, 'bread'); 'cheese' &lt; 'bread'.
    In particular, a D-theory analysis contains no explicit predications about left-right order of non-terminals.
    But given only the predications in (12), what can be said about the identities of the nodes named npl, np2, and np3?
    Under this description, the descriptions of npl, np2 and np3 are compatible descriptions; they are potentially descriptions of the same individual.
    They are all dominated by vp I, and each is an NP, so there is no conflict here.
    Each dominates a different noun, but several constituents of the sam
