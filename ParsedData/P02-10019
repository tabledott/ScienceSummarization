led through a regexp (to be compiled into E:E/2.7 &#8722;)arcs).
    A more subtle example is weighted FSAs that approximate PCFGs (Nederhof, 2000; Mohri and Nederhof, 2001), or to extend the idea, weighted FSTs that approximate joint or conditional synchronous PCFGs built for translation.
    These are parameterized by the PCFG&#8217;s parameters, but add or remove strings of the PCFG to leave an improper probability distribution.
    Fortunately for those techniques, an FST with positive arc weights can be normalized to make it jointly or conditionally probabilistic: ization, which simply divides each f(x, y) by Ex,,y, f(x', y') (joint case) or by Ey, f(x, y') (conditional case).
    To implement the joint case, just divide stopping weights by the total weight of all paths (which &#167;4 shows how to find), provided this is finite.
    In the conditional case, let g be a copy of f with the output labels removed, so that g(x) finds the desired divisor; determinize g if possible (but this fails for some weigh
