ponent methods, and to then solve a target problem by applying the single strongest piece of evidence, whatever type it happens to be.
    Yarowsky applied his method to the task of restoring missing accents in Spanish and French, and found that it outperformed both the method based on context words, and one based on local syntax.
    This paper takes Yarowsky's method as a starting point, and hypothesizes that further improvements can be obtained by taking into account not only the single strongest piece of evidence, but all the available evidence.
    A method is presented for doing this, based on Bayesian classifiers.
    The work reported here was applied not to accent restoration, but to a related lexical disambiguation task: context-sensitive spelling correction.
    The task is to fix spelling errors that happen to result in valid words in the lexicon; for example: I'd like the chocolate cake for *desert. where dessert was misspelled as desert.
    This goes beyond the capabilities of conventional spel
