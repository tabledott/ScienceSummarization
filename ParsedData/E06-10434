iomaticity.
    In Section 3, we propose two linguistically-motivated statistical measures for quantifying the degree of lexical and syntactic inflexibility (or fixedness) of verb+noun combinations.
    Section 4 presents an evaluation of the proposed measures.
    In Section 5, we put forward a technique for determining the syntactic variations that a VNIC can undergo, and that should be included in its lexical representation.
    Section 6 summarizes our contributions.
  
  
    Although syntactically well-formed, VNICs involve a certain degree of semantic idiosyncrasy.
    Unlike compositional verb+noun combinations, the meaning of VNICs cannot be solely predicted from the meaning of their parts.
    There is much evidence in the linguistic literature that the semantic idiosyncrasy of idiomatic combinations is reflected in their lexical and/or syntactic behaviour.
    A limited number of idioms have one (or more) lexical variants, e.g., blow one&#8217;s own trumpet and toot one&#8217;s own horn (examples f
