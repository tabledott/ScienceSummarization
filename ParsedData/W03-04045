 began with a strict measure of agreement at the sentence level by first considering whether the annotator marked any private-state expression, of any strength, anywhere in the sentence.
    If so, the sentence should be subjective.
    Otherwise, it is objective.
    Table 1 shows the contingency table.
    The percentage agreement is 88%, and the rc value is 0.71.
    One would expect that there are clear cases of objective sentences, clear cases of subjective sentences, and borderline sentences in between.
    The agreement study supports this.
    In terms of our annotations, we define a sentence as borderline if it has at least one privatestate expression identified by at least one annotator, and all strength ratings of private-state expressions are low.
    Table 2 shows the agreement results when such borderline sentences are removed (19 sentences, or 11% of the agreement test corpus).
    The percentage agreement increases to 94% and the rc value increases to 0.87.
    As expected, the majority of dis
