e majority of those popular cases; and (3) discover what supplementary knowledge is needed for remaining, more difficult cases.
    To analyze coreference data we use a corpus of annotated texts.
    To devise minimalist coreference resolution rules we consider (1) strong indicators of cohesion, such as repetitions, name aliases or appositions; and (2) gender, number and class agreements.
    WordNet (Miller 1995), the vast semantic knowledge base, provides suplementary knowledge in the form of semantic consistency between coreferring nouns.
    Additional semantic consistency knowledge is generated by a bootstrapping mechanism when our coreference resolution system, COCKTAIL', processes new texts.
    This bootstrapping mechanism inspired by the technique presented in (Riloff and Jones 1999) targets one of the most problematic forms of knowledge needed for coreference resolution: the semantic consistency of corefering nominals.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
