11+113.
    Thus, if 100 analyses have already been pushed onto then a candidate analysis must have a probability above 10-5/3 to avoid being pruned.
    After 1,000 candidates, the beam has narrowed to 10-2p.
    There is also a maximum number of allowed analyses on H&#8222; in case the parse fails to advance an analysis to H1&#177;1.
    This was typically 10,000.
    As mentioned in Section 2.1, we left-factor the grammar, so that all productions are binary, except those with a single terminal on the right-hand side and epsilon productions.
    The only c-productions are those introduced by left-factorization.
    Our factored grammar was produced by factoring the trees in the training corpus before grammar induction, which proceeded in the standard way, by counting rule frequencies.
  
  
    The empirical results will be presented in three stages: (i) trials to examine the accuracy and efficiency of the parser; (ii) trials to examine its effect on test corpus perplexity and recognition performance; and (
