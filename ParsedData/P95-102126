    In the composed d-tree 7 the component a(5) is substituted at a substitution node in /3.
    The components, a(1), a(2), and a(4) of a above a(5) drift up the path in which runs from the substitution node.
    These components are then inserted into d-edges in # or above the root of #.
    In general, when a component a(i) of some d-tree a is inserted into a d-edge between nodes ni and 772 two new d-edges are created, the first of which relates and the root node of a(i), and the second of which relates the frontier node of a(i) that dominates the substituted component to 772.
    It is possible for components above the substituted node to drift arbitrarily far up the d-tree and distribute themselves within domination edges, or above the root, in any way that is compatible with the domination relationships present in the substituted d-tree.
    DTG provide a mechanism called subsertion-insertion constraints to control what can appear within d-edges (see below).
    The second compositi
