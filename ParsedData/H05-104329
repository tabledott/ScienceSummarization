e, sentence) tuple, PMI++ ignores the sentence, generates a phrase based on the word and the fea ture (e.g., (clean, room): ?clean room?)
			and finds its SO label using PMI statistics.
			If unsure of the label, PMI++ tries to find the orientation of the potential opinion word instead.
			The search engine queries use domain-specific keywords (e.g., ?scanner?), which are dropped if they 344 lead to low counts.
			Hu++ is a WordNet-based method for finding a word?s context-independent semantic orientation.
			It extends Hu?s adjective labeling method in a number of ways in order to handle nouns, verbs and adverbs in addition to adjectives and in order to improve coverage.
			Hu?s method starts with two sets of positive and negative words and iteratively grows each one by including synonyms andantonyms from WordNet.
			The final sets are used to pre dict the orientation of an incoming word.
