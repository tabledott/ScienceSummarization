iguous word to the most frequent sense in the training data.
    Once the individual classifiers are trained they are evaluated using previously held-out test data.
    The crucial step in building an ensemble is selecting the classifiers to include as members.
    The approach here is to group the 81 Naive Bayesian classifiers into general categories representing the sizes of the windows of context.
    There are three such ranges; narrow corresponds to windows 0, 1 and 2 words wide, medium to windows 3, 4, and 5 words wide, and wide to windows 10, 25, and 50 words wide.
    There are nine possible range categories since there are separate left and right windows.
    For example, Naive_Bayes(1,3) belongs to the range category (narrow, medium) since it is based on a one word window to the left and a three word window to the right.
    The most accurate classifier in each of the nine range categories is selected for inclusion in the ensemble.
    Each of the nine member classifiers votes for the most probable
