hich for all their complications involve well-explored territory.
    In order to do systematic work on automatic genre classification. by contrast, we require the answers to some basic theoretical and methodological questions.
    Is genre a single property or attribute that can be neatly laid out in some hierarchical structure?
    Or are we really talking about a multidimensional space of properties that have little more in common than that they are more or less orthogonal to topicality?
    And once we have the theoretical prerequisites in place, we have to ask whether genre can be reliably identified by means of computationally tractable cues.
