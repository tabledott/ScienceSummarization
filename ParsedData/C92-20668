ted LIG generates tile same language as Gtag and each deriva- tion of Gtaa corresponds to a unique LIG derivation corresponds to a unique derivation in G,ua (and con- versely).
			In addition, a probability is assigned to each production of the LIG.
			For simplicity of explanation and without loss of generality we assume that each node in an elementary tree in Gt,9 is either a leaf node (i.e. either a foot node or a non-empty terminal node) or binary branching, a The construction of the equivalent SLIG follows.
			The non-terminal symbols of Gstia are the two sym- bols 'top' (t) and 'bottom' (b), tile set of terminal sym- bols is the same as the one of Gta9, the set of stack symbols is the set of nodes (not node labels) found in the elementary trees of Gla~ augmented with the bot- tom of tile stack ($), and tile start symbol is ' top' (t).
			For "all root nodes ~10 of an initial tree whose root is labeled by S, the following starting rules are added: t\[$\] ~ t\[$,t0\] (1) These rules state that a derivatio
