 data, and secondly, the computed results are more statistically reliable than those obtained by simply setting aside a single portion of the data for testing.
    The choice of scoring metric is an important one in the evaluation of WSD algorithms.
    The most commonly used metric is the ratio of words for which the system has assigned the correct sense compared to those which it attempted to disambiguate.
    Resnik and Yarowsky (1997) dubbed this the exact match metric, which is usually expressed as a percentage calculated according to the formula in (12).
    Number of correctly assigned senses Exact match = x 100% (12) Number of senses assigned Resnik and Yarowsky criticize this metric because it assumes a WSD system commits to a particular sense.
    They propose an alternative metric based on cross-entropy that compares the probabilities for each sense as assigned by a WSD system against those in the gold standard text.
    The formula in (13) shows the method for computing this metric, where the WSD
