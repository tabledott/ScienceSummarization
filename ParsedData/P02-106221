ractive property of the voted perceptron is that it can be used with kernels, for example the kernels over parse trees described in (Collins and Duffy 2001; Collins and Duffy 2002).
    (Collins and Duffy 2002) describe the voted perceptron applied to the named-entity data in this paper, but using kernel-based features rather than the explicit features described in this paper.
    See (Collins 2002) for additional work using perceptron algorithms to train tagging models, and a more thorough description of the theory underlying the perceptron algorithm applied to ranking problems.
  
  
    A question regarding the approaches in this paper is whether the features we have described could be incorporated in a maximum-entropy tagger, giving similar improvements in accuracy.
    This section discusses why this is unlikely to be the case.
    The problem described here is closely related to the label bias problem described in (Lafferty et al. 2001).
    One straightforward way to incorporate global features into th
