atistical word usage information, that should be integrated with this work.
    As an anonymous referee pointed out to us, Volks and Volkswagen were not included in the chain containing driving and car.
    These words were not in a general thesaurus, and were also missed by the authors!
    Section 1 mentioned that lexical chains would be also useful in providing a context for word sense disambiguation and in narrowing to specific word meanings.
    As an example of a chain providing useful information for word sense disambiguation, consider words 1 to 15 of chain 2.1 of the example: {afflicted, darkness, panicky, mournful, exciting, deadly, hating, aversion, cruel, relentless, weird, eerie, cold, barren, sterile, ... }.
    In the context of all of these words, it is clear that barren and sterile do not refer to an inability to reproduce, but to a cruel coldness.
    The use of lexical chains for ambiguity resolution is a promising area for further research.
