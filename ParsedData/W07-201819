approaches, such as SRL with PropBank roles (Pradhan et al, 2004) is that by identifying relations as part of a frame, you have identified a gestalt of relations that enables far more inference, and sentences from the same passage that use other words from the same frame will be easier to link together.
			Thus, the FN SRL results are translatable fairly directly intoformal representations which can be used for rea soning, question answering, etc.
			(Scheffczyk et al., 2006; Frank and Semecky, 2004; Sinha and Narayanan, 2005).
			Despite the problems with recall, the participants have expressed a determination to work to improvethese results, and the FN staff are eager to collabo rate in this effort.
			A project is now underway at ICSI to speed up frame and LU definition, and another tospeed up the training of SRL systems is just begin ning, so the prospects for improvement seem good.This material is based in part upon work sup ported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No.
