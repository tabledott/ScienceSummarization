hes to the first or the second.
    Because we are ultimately interested in predicting the correct target string, regardless of its structure, we do not assign probabilities to these steps.
    The nonterminals on the target side are ignored entirely, and while the alignment algorithm considers possible pairs of nodes as elementary trees on the target side during training, Allowing m-to-n matching of up to two nodes on either side of the parallel treebank allows for limited non-isomorphism between the trees, as in Haji&#711;c et al. (2002).
    However, even given this flexibility, requiring alignments to match two input trees rather than one often makes tree-to-tree alignment more constrained than tree-to-string alignment.
    For example, even alignments with no change in word order may not be possible if the structures of the two trees are radically mismatched.
    This leads us to think it may be helpful to allow departures from Tree-to-String Tree-to-Tree the constraints of the parallel bracketing, if it
