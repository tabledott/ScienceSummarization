uality of current linguistic processors is sufficient for the task of coreference resolution.
    On the other hand, using gold mentions raises the overall score by 15 points.
    This clearly indicates that pipeline architectures where mentions are identified first are inadequate for this task, and that coreference resolution might benefit from the joint modeling of mentions and coreference chains.
    Finally, Table 4 lists our results on the held-out testing partition.
    Note that in this dataset, the gold mentions included singletons and generic mentions as well, whereas in development (lines 6 and 7 in Table 3), gold mentions included only mentions part of an actual coreference chain.
    This explains the large difference between, say, line 6 in Table 3 and line 4 in Table 4.
    Our scores are comparable to previously reported state-of-the-art results for coreference resolution with predicted mentions.
    For example, Haghighi and Klein (2010) compare four state-of-the-art systems on three different
