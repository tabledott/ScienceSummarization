 every member of L into itself is regular; it is characterized by the fst obtained from an fsm M(L) by changing all transition labels a to a:a.
    Clearly, for all languages L, L = Dom (Id(L)) = Range(Id(L)).
    The inverse R-1 of a regular relation R is regular, since it is accepted by a transducer formed from T(R) by changing all labels a:b to b:a.
    The reversal Rev(R), consisting of pairs containing the reversal of strings in R's pairs, is also regular; its accepting transducer is derived from T(R) by generalizing the standard one-tape fsm construction for regular language reversal.
    Given a pair of regular languages L1 and L2 whose alphabets can, without loss of generality, be assumed equal, the relation L1 x L2 containing their Cartesian product is regular.
    To prove this proposition, we let M1 =- (E, Qi, qi , F1, Si) and M2 = (E, Q2, q2, F2, 62) be fsms accepting L1 and L2 respectively and define the fst where for any s1 EQi, S2 E Q2 and a,b E E&#8364; This result holds trivially when x and y
