    Following Miyao and Tsujii (2002), we showed how the estimation can be performed efficiently by applying the inside-outside algorithm to a packed chart.
    We also showed how the complete WSJ Penn Treebank can be used for training by developing a parallel version of Generalised Iterative Scaling (GIS) to perform the estimation.
    This paper significantly extends our earlier work in a number of ways.
    First, we evaluate a number of log-linear models, obtaining results which are competitive with the state-of-the-art for CCG parsing.
    We also compare log-linear models which use all CCG derivations, including non-standard derivations, with normal-form models.
    Second, we find that GIS is unsuitable for estimating a model of the size being considered, and develop a parallel version of the L-BFGS algorithm (Nocedal and Wright, 1999).
    And finally, we show that the parsing algorithm described in Clark and Curran (2003) is extremely slow in some cases, and suggest an efficient alternative ba
