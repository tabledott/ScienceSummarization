ble adjectives, as well as for unions and intersections of lhose sets.
  Nole fliat these four sets have been extracted lrom comparable but different cor- pora (different years of the Wall Street Journal), therefore sometimes adjectives in one corpus may not be present in the other corpus, reducing the size of intersection sets.
  Also, for gradability, we worked with a sample set of 100 adjectives rather than all possible adjectives we could automatically calcuhtte gladabiliiy vahles for, since our goal in the present work is to measure correlations be- tween these sets and sul~jeciivity, rather than building a system for predicling subjectivity for as many ac[iectives as possible.
  In Table 3, the second cohmm identifies 8, the set of ac[iective types in question.
  The third cohimn gives the number of subjective sentences that contain one or more instances of members of S, and the fourth colunul gives lhe same ligure for ol~jective sentences.
  Therefore these two cohinuls together specify lhe coverage of
