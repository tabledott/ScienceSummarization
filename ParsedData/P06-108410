sifiers of individual morphological features.
    The accuracy of their analyzer is 94.8% &#8211; 96.2% (depending on the test corpus).
    An unsupervised HMM model for dialectal Arabic (which is harder to be tagged than written Arabic), with accurracy of 69.83%, was presented by Duh and Kirchhoff (2005).
    Their supervised model, trained on a manually annotated corpus, reached an accuracy of 92.53%.
    Arabic morphology seems to be similar to Hebrew morphology, in term of complexity and data sparseness, but comparison of the performances of the baseline tagger used by Habash and Rambow &#8211; which selects the most frequent tag for a given word in the training corpus &#8211; for Hebrew and Arabic, shows some intriguing differences: 92.53% for Arabic and 71.85% for Hebrew.
    Furthermore, as mentioned above, even the use of a sophisticated context-free tagger, based on (Levinger et al., 1995), gives low accuracy of 78.2%.
    This might imply that, despite the similarities, morphological disambiguation
