f 582 (set A) by 687 (set B) single words with mid-range frequency from the WSJ texts.
    We computed the WoRM feature for each of these test words and computed the Euclidean Distance between every word in these sets.
    We then calculated the accuracy by counting the number of words whose top one candidate is identical to itself, obtaining a precision of 29%.
    By allowing N-top candidates, the accuracy improves as shown in the graphs for 582 words output in Figure 5 (i.e. a translation is correct if it appears among the first N candidates).
    If we find the correct translation among the top 100 candidates, we obtain a precision of around 58%.
    N-top candidates are useful as translator aids.
    Meanwhile, precisions for translating less polysemous content words are higher.
    If only the 445 content words (manually selected) are kept from the 582-word set, the precisions at different top N candidates for the 445-word set are higher as shown in Figure 5 by the dotted line.
    We believe the accura
