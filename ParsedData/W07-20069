(0 otherwise).
			Notice that our calculation of the MFS is based on the frequencies in the SemCor corpus (Miller et al, 1993), as we exploit WordNet sense rankings.
	
	
			12 teams submitted 14 systems overall (plus two systems from a 13th withdrawn team that we will not report).
			According to the SemEval policy for task organizers, we remark that the system labelled as UOR-SSI was submitted by the first author (thesystem is based on the Structural Semantic Inter connections algorithm (Navigli and Velardi, 2005)with a lexical knowledge base composed by Word Net and approximately 70,000 relatedness edges).Even though we did not specifically enrich the al gorithm?s knowledge base on the task at hand, we list the system separately from the overall ranking.The results are shown in Table 3.
			We calculated a MFS baseline of 78.89% and a random baseline of 52.43%.
			In Table 4 we report the F1 mea sures for all systems where we used the MFS as abackoff strategy when no sense assignment was at tempted (this pos
