s, we find the methods giving broadly similar results.
    Both methods give results with sufficient accuracy to use the resulting alignments, or selected portions thereof, for acquisition of lexical information.
    And neither method achieves human accuracy on the task.
    (Note that one difference between their method and ours is that they never find 2-2 alignments.
    This would give their method a minimum overall error rate of 1.4% on the UBS corpus, three times the human error rate on hard paragraphs.)
    We conclude that a sentence alignment method that achieves human accuracy will need to have lexical information available to it.
    It is interesting to consider what happens if we change our definition of length to count words rather than characters.
    It might seem that a word is a more natural linguistic unit than a character.
    However, we have found that words do not perform as well as characters.
    In fact, the &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; variation increases the number of errors dramatica
