    Tables 19&#8211;38 show pairwise comparisons between systems for each language pair.
    The numbers in each of the tables&#8217; cells indicate the percentage of times that the system in that column was judged to be better than the system in that row.
    Bolding indicates the winner of the two systems.
    The difference between 100 and the sum of the complementary cells is the percent of time that the two systems were judged to be equal.
    Because there were so many systems and data conditions the significance of each pairwise comparison needs to be quantified.
    We applied the Sign Test to measure which comparisons indicate genuine differences (rather than differences that are attribu
