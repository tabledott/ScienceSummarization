    3.3 MUMIS The MUMIS (MUltiMedia Indexing and Searching environment) system uses Information Extraction components developed within GATE to produce formal annotations about essential events in football video programme material.
    This IE system comprises versions of the tokenisation, sentence detection, POS-tagging, and semantic tagging modules developed as part of GATE's standard resources, but also includes morphological analysis, full syntactic parsing and discourse interpretation modules, thereby enabling the production of annotations over text encoding structural, lexical, syntactic and semantic information.
    The semantic tagging module currently achieves around 91% precision and 76% recall, a significant improvement on a baseline named entity recognition system evaluated against it.
