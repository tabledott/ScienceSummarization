 make sure the categories can connect chained_nodes(Parent, Root).
    The information needed to guide the generation (given as the predicates chain_rule, non_chain_rule, and chained_nodes) can be computed automatically from the grammar; a program to compile a DCG into these tables has in fact been implemented.
    The details of the process will not be discussed further.
    The careful reader will have noticed, however, that no attention has been given to the issue of terminal symbols on the right-hand sides of rules.
    During the compilation process, the right-hand side of a rule is converted from a list of categories and terminal strings to a list of nodes connected together by the difference-list threading technique used for standard DCG compilation.
    At that point, terminal strings can be introduced into the string threading and need never be considered further.
    We turn now to a simple example to give a sense of the order of processing pursued by this generation algorithm.
