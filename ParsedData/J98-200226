us in Figure 3 and frequency data in Figure 1, we would 7 The process of finding the MDL model tends to be computationally demanding and is often intractable.
    When the model class under consideration is restricted to tree structures, however, dynamic programming is often applicable and the MDL model can be efficiently found.
    For example, Rissanen (1995) has devised an algorithm for learning decision trees.
    8 Consider, for example, the case when the co-occurrence data is given as f(swallow) = 2f (crow) -= 2,f(eagle) = 2,f(bird) = 2 for the problem in Section 2. like our system to judge that the class BIRD and the noun bee can be the subject slot of the verb fly.
    The problem of deciding whether to stop generalizing at BIRD and bee, or generalizing further to ANIMAL has been addressed by a number of authors (Webster and Marcus 1989; Velardi, Pazienza, and Fasolo 1991; Nomiyama 1992).
    Minimization of the total description length provides a disciplined criterion to do this.
