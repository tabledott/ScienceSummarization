entences forms the syntactic signature for the verb.
  So although the signature for the Change of State class has 13 frames, the verb break has 39 frames from the other classes it appears in.
  Conceptually, it is helpful to consider the difference between the intension of a function versus its exten- sion.
  In this case, we are interested in the functions that group the verbs syntactically and semantically.
  In- tensionally speaking, the definition of the function that groups verbs semantically would have something to do with the actual meaning of the verbs.
  ~ Likewise, the in- tension of the function that groups verbs syntactically would be defined in terms of something strictly syntac- tic, such as subcategorization frames.
  But the inten- sions of these functions are matters of significant he- oretical investigation, and although much has been ac- complished in this ~rea, the question of mapping syntax to semantics and vice versa is an open research topic.
  Therefore, we can turn to the extensions
