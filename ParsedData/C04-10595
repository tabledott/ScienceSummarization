			?+= (1) The interpolation factor ? can be simply estimated using cross validation or a grid search.
			As an alternative to using translations for the baseline system, we will also describe an approach, which uses partial translations of the source sentence, using the translation model only.
			In this case, no full translation needs to be carried out in the first step; only information from the translation model is used.
			Our approach focuses on query model building, using different levels of knowledge representations from the hypothesis set or from the translation model itself.
			The quality of the query models is crucial to the adapted language model?s
