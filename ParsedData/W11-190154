ng the scorer with the bug, which double-credited duplicate mentions.
    To find out for sure, one would have to re-tune the system using the modified scorer.
    One difficulty with this supplementary evaluation using gold mention boundaries is that those boundaries alone provide only very partial information.
    For the roughly 10% of mentions that the automatic parser did not correctly identify, while the systems knew the correct boundaries, they had no hierarchical parser or semantic role label information, and they also had to further approximate the already heuristic head word identification.
    This incomplete data complicated the systems&#8217; task and also complicates interpretation of the results.
    The final supplementary condition that we explored was if the systems were supplied with the manuallyannotated spans for exactly those mentions that did participate in the gold standard coreference chains.
    This supplies significantly more information than the previous case, where exact spans we
