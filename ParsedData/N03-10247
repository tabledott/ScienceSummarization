 V P, it is reasonable to assume that NP1 is a paraphrase of NP2 and V P1 is a paraphrase of V P2.
    We merge NP1 with NP2 and V P1 with V P2 and continue the merging process on each of the subtrees recursively, until we either reach the leaves of the trees or the two nodes that we examine are expanded using different syntactic rules.
    When we apply this process to the trees in Figure 5, the NP nodes are merged all the way down to the leaves, and we get &#8220;12&#8221; as a paraphrase of &#8220;twelve&#8221; and &#8220;people&#8221; as a paraphrase of &#8220;persons&#8221;; in contrast, the two VPs are expanded in different ways, so no merging is done beyond this level, and we are left with the information that &#8220;were killed&#8221; is a paraphrase of &#8220;died&#8221;.
    We repeat this top-down merging procedure with each of the 11 parse trees in a sentence group.
    So far, only constituents with same syntactic type are treated as paraphrases.
    However, later we shall see that we can match
