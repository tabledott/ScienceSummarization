    As illustrated in Figure 1, translation models suffer from sparse data.
    When only a very small parallel corpus is available for training, translations are learned for very few of the unique phrases in a test set.
    If we exclude 451 words worth of names, numbers, and foreign language text in 2,000 sentences that comprise the Spanish portion of the Europarl test set, then the number of unique n-grams in text are: 7,331 unigrams, 28,890 bigrams, 44,194 trigrams, and 48,259 4-grams.
    Table 5 gives the percentage of these which have translations in each of the three training corpora, if we do not use paraphrasing.
    In contrast after expanding the phrase table using the translations of paraphrases, the coverage of the unique test set phrases goes up dramatically (shown in Table 6).
    For the first training corpus with 10,000 sentence pairs and roughly 200,000 words of text in each language, the coverage goes up from less than 50% of the vocabulary items being covered to 90%.
