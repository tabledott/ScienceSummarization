reported, we only include our character and Pinyin error rates for easy reference.
    The reference data are extracted from Table 1 and 3 of (Virga and Khudanpur 2003).
    As we have not found any C2E result in the literature, only E2C results are compared here.
    The first 4 setups by Virga et al all adopted the phoneme-based approach in the following steps: It is obvious that the n-gram TM compares favorably to other techniques. n-gram TM presents an error reduction of 74.6%=(42.5-10.8)/42.5% for Pinyin over the best reported result, Huge MT (Big MT) test case, which is noteworthy.
    The DOM framework shows a quantum leap in performance with n-gram TM being the most successful implementation.
    The n-gram TM and ID3 under direct orthographic mapping (DOM) paradigm simplify the process and reduce the chances of conversion errors.
    As a result, n-gram TM and ID3 do not generate Chinese Pinyin as intermediate results.
    It is noted that in the 374 legitimate Chinese characters for transliteration,
