iterion as previous systems (Och and Ney, 2004; Koehn et al., 2003): Definition 1.
    Given a word-aligned sentence pair hf, e, &#8764;i, a rule hfij, ej0 i0 i is an initial phrase pair of hf, e, &#8764;i iff: Next, we form all possible differences of phrase pairs: Definition 2.
    The set of rules of hf, e, &#8764;i is the smallest set satisfying the following: is a rule, where k is an index not used in r. The above scheme generates a very large number of rules, which is undesirable not only because it makes training and decoding very slow, but also because it creates spurious ambiguity&#8212;a situation where the decoder produces many derivations that are distinct yet have the same model feature vectors and give the same translation.
    This can result in nbest lists with very few different translations or feature vectors, which is problematic for the algorithm we use to tune the feature weights.
    Therefore we filter our grammar according to the following principles, chosen to balance grammar size and
