    A number of researchers have worked on mining collocations from text to extend lexicographic resources for machine translation and word sense disambiguation (e.g., Smajda 1993; Lin 1999; Biber 1993).
    In Samuel, Carberry, and Vijay-Shanker&#8217;s (1998) work on identifying collocations for dialog-act recognition, a filter similar to ours was used to eliminate redundant n-gram features: n-grams were eliminated if they contained substrings with the same entropy score as or a better entropy score than the n-gram.
    While it is common in studies of collocations to omit low-frequency words and expressions from analysis, because they give rise to invalid or unrealistic statistical measures (Church and Hanks, 1990), we are able to identify higher-precision collocations by including placeholders for unique words (i.e., the ugen-n-grams).
    We are not aware of other work that uses such collocations as we do.
    Features identified using distributional similarity have previously b
