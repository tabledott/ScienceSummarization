r those words that do have more than one possi- ble sense, it rarely takes anywhere near log2senses bits to select the appropriate sense since the distribution of senses is generally quite skewed.
  Perhaps the word-sense disambiguation problem is not as difficult as we might have thought.

  CONCLUSION In conclusion, it appears that our hypothesis correct; well-written discourses tend to avoid multiple senses of a polysemous word.
  This result can be used in two basic ways: (1) as an additional source of constraint for im- proving the performance ofa word-sense disambiguation algorithm, and (2) as an aide in collecting annotated test materials for evaluating disamhiguation algorithms.
