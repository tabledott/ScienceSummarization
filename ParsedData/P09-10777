xplicit relation is annotated with a sense.
    The senses are arranged in a hierarchy, allowing for annotations as specific as Contingency.Cause.reason.
    In our experiments, we use only the top level of the sense annotations: Comparison, Contingency, Expansion, and Temporal.
    Using just these four relations allows us to be theory-neutral; while different frameworks (Hobbs, 1979; McKeown, 1985; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Knott and Sanders, 1998; Asher and Lascarides, 2003) include different relations of varying specificities, all of them include these four core relations, sometimes under different names.
    Each relation in the PDTB takes two arguments.
    Example (1) can be seen as the predicate Contingency which takes the two sentences as arguments.
    For implicits, the span in the first sentence is called Arg1 and the span in the following sentence is called Arg2.
