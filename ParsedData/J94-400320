 word.
    In our model, the plausibility of selecting a target word is determined by the plausibility of the tuples that are obtained from it.
    The plausibility of alternative target tuples is in turn determined by their relative frequency in the corpus.
    Target syntactic tuples are identified in the corpus similarly to source language tuples, i.e., by a target language parser and a companion routine as described in Section 2.1.
    The right column of Table 1 shows the counts obtained for the syntactic tuples of our example in the corpora we used.
    The table reveals that the tuples containing the correct target word ('talk,' progress,' and 'increase') are indeed more frequent.
    However, we still need a decision algorithm to analyze the statistical significance of the data and choose the appropriate word accordingly.
  
  
    As seen in the previous section, the linguistic model maps each source language syntactic tuple to several alternative target tuples, in which each alternative corresponds
