 to the CCG analysis, we need to transform the tree before we can translate it.
    During preprocessing, we create a copy of the entire argument cluster which corresponds to the constituent structure of the CCG analysis.
    During normal category assignment, we use the first conjunct in its original form to obtain the correct categories of all constituents.
    In a later stage, we use type-raising and composition to combine the constituents within each argument cluster.
    For a detailed description of this algorithm and a number of variations on the original Treebank annotation that we did not attempt to deal with, the interested reader is referred to the CCGbank manual.
    There are 226 instances of argument-cluster coordination in the entire Penn Treebank.
    The algorithm delivers a correct CCG derivation for 146 of these.
    Translation failures are due to the fact that the algorithm can at present only deal with this construction if the two conjuncts are isomorphic in structure, which is not alwa
