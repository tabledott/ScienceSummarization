 (System C) improved the performance on both test sets, which confirms that both the variability across answer tagged sentences (Trec9-10Web) and the abundance of distinct questions (Quiz-Zone) contribute to the diversity of a QA training corpus, and implicitly to the performance of our system.
  
  
    Another characteristic of our framework is its flexibility.
    We can easily extend it to span other question-answering resources and techniques that have been employed in state-of-the art QA systems.
    In the rest of this section, we assess the impact of such resources and techniques in the context of three case studies.
    The LCC TREC-2002 QA system (Moldovan et al., 2002) implements a reasoning mechanism for justifying answers.
    In the LCC framework, questions and answers are first mapped into logical forms.
    A resolution-based module then proves that the question logically follows from the answer using a set of axioms that are automatically extracted from the WordNet glosses.
    For example, t
