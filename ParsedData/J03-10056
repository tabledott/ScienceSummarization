the proposed techniques, we report and analyze results for two translation tasks: the German to English Verbmobil task and French to English Canadian Hansards task.
    The article is structured as follows.
    Section 2 gives a short introduction to the translation model used and reports on other approaches to the search problem in statistical MT.
    In Section 3, a DP-based search approach is presented, along with appropriate pruning techniques that yield an efficient beam search algorithm.
    Section 4 reports and analyzes translation results for the different translation directions.
    In Section 5, we conclude with a discussion of the achieved results.
  
  
    In this article, we use the translation model presented in Brown et al. (1993), and the mathematical notation we use here is taken from that paper as well: a source string fJ1 = f1 &#183; &#183; &#183; fj &#183; &#183; &#183; fJ is to be translated into a target string eI1 = e1 &#183; &#183; &#183; ei &#183; &#183; &#183; eI.
    Here, I is th
