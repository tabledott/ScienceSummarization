 clause grammar[Pereira19801 can parse part numbers, as in awaiting part 2155614 7, or complex date and time expressions, as in disk drive up at 11/17-1236.
    During parsing, the forms grammar performs a well-formedness check on these expressions and assigns them their appropriate lexical category.
  
  
    There are two separate components that perform semantic analysis, NOUN PHRASE SEMANTICS and CLAUSE SEMANTICS.
    They are each called after parsing the relevant syntactic structure to test semantic well-formedness while producing partial semantic representations.
    Clause semantics is based on Inference Driven Semantic Analysis [Palmer19851 which decomposes verbs into component meanings and fills their semantic roles with syntactic constituents.
    A KNOWLEDGE BASE, the formalization of each domain into logical terms, SEMANTIC PREDICATES, is essential for the effective application of Inference Driven Semantic Analysis, and for the final production of a text representation.
