    There is a (costless) transition between the NC node and The transition from to a final state transduces c to the grammatical tag PI.. with cost cost(unseen(19)): cost(t)jjfi) cost(t)11)+ cost(unseen(fl)), as desired.
    For the seen word pm 'generals,' there is an c:NC transduction from gi to the node preceding ill; this arc has cost cost(M1) &#8212; cost(unseen(f1)), so that the cost of the whole path is the desired cost(14 111).
    This representation gives 14f9 an appropriate morphological decomposition, preserving information that would be lost by simply listing Wfl as an unanalyzed form.
    Note that the backoff model assumes that there is a positive correlation between the frequency of a singular noun and its plural.
    An analysis of nouns that occur in both the singular and the plural in our database reveals that there is indeed a slight but significant positive correlation&#8212;R2 = 0.20, p &lt; 0.005; see Figure 6.
    This suggests that the backoff model i
