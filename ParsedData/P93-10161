too many illicit structures is called overgeneration and has been recognized as the culprit of computational difficulties in principle-based parsing (Berwick, 1991).
    Many methods have been proposed to alleviate the overgeneration problem by detecting illicit structures as early as possible, such as optimal ordering of principles (Fong, 1991), coroutining (Dorr, 1991; Johnson, 1991).
    This paper presents a principle-based parser that avoids the overgeneration problem by applying principles to descriptions of the structures, instead of the structures themselves.
    A structure for the input sentence is only constructed after its description has been found to satisfy all the principles.
    The structure can then be retrieved in time linear to its size and is guaranteed to be consistent with the principles.
    Since the descriptions of structures are constantsized attribute vectors, checking whether a structural description satisfy a principle takes constant amount of time.
    This compares favorably t
