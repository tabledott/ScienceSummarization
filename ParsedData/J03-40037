e three probabilistic models.
    Section 4 describes various refinments to these models.
    Section 5 discusses issues of parameter estimation, the treatment of unknown words, and also the parsing algorithm.
    Section 6 gives results evaluating the performance of the models on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).
    Section 7 investigates various aspects of the models in more detail.
    We give a detailed analysis of the parser&#8217;s performance on treebank data, including results on different constituent types.
    We also give a breakdown of precision and recall results in recovering various types of dependencies.
    The intention is to give a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the parsing models.
    Section 7 goes on to discuss the distance features in the models, the implicit assumptions that the models make about the treebank annotation style, and the way that context-free rules in the original treebank are broken down, allowing the mode
