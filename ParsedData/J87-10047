;quot;re n&amp;quot; indicate the action &amp;quot;reduce constituents on the stack using rule n&amp;quot;.
    The entry &amp;quot;acc&amp;quot; stands for the action &amp;quot;accept&amp;quot;, and blank spaces represent &amp;quot;error&amp;quot;.
    The goto table (the right part of the table) decides to what state the parser should go after a reduce action.
    These operations shall become clear when we trace the algorithm with example sentences in section 4.
    The exact definition and operation of the LR parser can be found in Aho and Ullman (1977).
    We can see that there are two multiple entries in the action table; on the rows of state 11 and 12 at the column labeled &amp;quot;prep&amp;quot;.
    Roughly speaking, this is the situation where the parser encounters a preposition of a PP right after a NP.
    If this PP does not modify the NP, then the parser can go ahead to reduce the NP into a higher nonterminal such as PP or VP, using rule 6 or 7, respectively (re&amp; and re7 in the multiple en
