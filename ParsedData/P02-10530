  Thumbs Up Or Thumbs Down? Semantic Orientation Applied To Unsupervised Classification Of Reviews
  
    This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews up) or recdown).
    The classification of a review is predicted by the orientation the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs.
    A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., &#8220;subtle nuances&#8221;) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., &#8220;very cavalier&#8221;).
    In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word &#8220;excellent&#8221; minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word &#8220;poor&#8221;.
    A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive.
    The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four
