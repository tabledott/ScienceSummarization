ly to unrestricted language.
    Is-a hierarchies are expensive to acquire by hand for anything but highly restricted domains, while attempts to automatically derive these hierarchies from existing dictionaries have been only partially successful (Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidom 1985).
    This paper describes an approach to classifying English words according to the predicate-argument structures they show in a corpus of text.
    The general idea is straightforward: in any natural language there are restrictions on what words can appear together in the same construction, and in particular, on what can be arguments of what predicates.

    For example, wine may be drunk, produced, and sold but not pruned.
    Each noun may therefore be characterized according to the verbs that it occurs with.
    Nouns may then be grouped according to the extent to which they appear in similar environments.
    This basic idea of the distr
