data ([21), that is, the interactions among variables as evidenced by the frequency with which the values of the variables co-occur.
    Given a data sample of objects, where each object is described by d discrete variables, let x=(xi , x2, ... , xg) be a q-dimensional vector of counts, where each xi is the frequency with which one of the possible combinations of the values of the d variables occurs in the data sample (and the frequencies of all such possible combinations are included in x).
    The log-linear model expresses the logarithm of E[x] (the mean of x) as a linear sum of the contributions of the &amp;quot;effects&amp;quot; of the variables and the interactions among the variables.
    Assume that a random sample consisting of N independent and identical trials (i.e., all trials are described by the same probability density function) is drawn from a discrete d-variate distribution.
    In such a situation, the outcome of each trial must be an event corresponding to a particular combination of the va
