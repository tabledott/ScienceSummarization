y combining specialized constraint-based parsing techniques for LFG grammars with partial parsing techniques.
    Furthermore, a maximal exploitation of treebank annotations for estimating a distribution on fine-grained LFG parses is achieved by letting grammar analyses which are consistent with the WSJ labeled bracketing define a gold standard set for discriminative estimation.
    The combined system trained on WSJ data achieves full grammar coverage and disambiguation performance of 79% F-score on WSJ data, and 76% F-score on the Brown corpus test set.
    While disambiguation performance of around 79% F-score on WSJ data seems promising, from one perspective it only offers a 3% absolute improvement over a lower bound random baseline.
    We think that the high lower bound measure highlights an important aspect of symbolic constraintbased grammars (in contrast to treebank grammars): the symbolic grammar already significantly restricts/disambiguates the range of possible analyses, giving the disambiguator a
