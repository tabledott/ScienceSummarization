    In valency theory, usually, complements (obligatory) and adjuncts (optional) are distinguished.
    Our notation makes a difference between valency (rule-based) and subcategorisation (lexical): the valency tells which arguments are expected; the subcategorisation tells which combinations are legitimate.
