et during three-fold crossvalidation is also listed as an example of the coverage one would expect from a better-performing sentiment classifier.
    The Emoticon-trained classifier has much worse coverage in the test sets.
    We analysed the change in coverage of the Emoticon-trained classifiers on the Polarity 1.0 dataset.
    We found that the coverage continued to improve as more training data was provided; the coverage of unique token types was improving by about 0.6% per 1,000 training examples when the Emoticons dataset was exhausted.
    It appears possible that more training data will improve the performance of the Emoticon-trained classifiers by increasing the coverage.
    Potential sources for this include online bulletin boards, chat forums, and further newsgroup data from Usenet and Google Groups5.
    Future work will utilise these sources to collect more examples of emoticon use and analyse any improvement in coverage and accuracy.
