make sure all and only derivable items are considered (using triggering techniques described by Shieber, Schabes, and Pereira) in order to achieve optimal performance.
    Once we have the bucketing, the parsing step is fairly simple.
    The basic algorithm appears in Figure 10.
    We simply loop over each item in each bucket.
    There are two types of buckets: looping buckets, and nonlooping buckets.
    If the current bucket is a looping bucket, we compute the infinite sum needed to determine the bucket's values; in a working system, we substitute semiring-specific code for this section, as described in Section 3.2.
    If the bucket is not a looping bucket, we simply compute all of the possible instantiations that could contribute to the values of items in that bucket.
    Finally, we return the value of the goal item.
    The reverse semiring parser interpreter is very similar to the forward semiring parser interpreter.
    The differences are that in the reverse semiring parser interpreter, we travers
