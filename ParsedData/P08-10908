a set of narrative events {e1, e2, ..., en}, where n is the size of the chain, and a relation B(ei, ej) that is true if narrative event ei occurs strictly before ej in time.
    The notion of a protagonist motivates our approach to narrative learning.
    We make the following assumption of narrative coherence: verbs sharing coreferring arguments are semantically connected by virtue of narrative discourse structure.
    A single document may contain more than one narrative (or topic), but the narrative assumption states that a series of argument-sharing verbs is more likely to participate in a narrative chain than those not sharing.
    In addition, the narrative approach captures grammatical constraints on narrative coherence.
    Simple distributional learning might discover that the verb push is related to the verb fall, but narrative learning can capture additional facts about the participants, specifically, that the object or patient of the push is the subject or agent of the fall.
