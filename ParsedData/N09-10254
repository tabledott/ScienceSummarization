ucer (Knight and Graehl, 2005).
    It is obtained from bilingual text that has been word-aligned and whose English side has been syntactically parsed.
    From this data, we use the the GHKM minimal-rule extraction algorithm of (Galley et al., 2004) to yield rules like: Though this rule can be used in either direction, here we use it right-to-left (Chinese to English).
    We follow Galley et al. (2006) in allowing unaligned Chinese words to participate in multiple translation rules, and in collecting larger rules composed of minimal rules.
    These larger rules have been shown to substantially improve translation accuracy (Galley et al., 2006; DeNeefe et al., 2007).
    We apply Good-Turing discounting to the transducer rule counts and obtain probability estimates: When we apply these probabilities to derive an English sentence e and a corresponding Chinese sentence c, we wind up with the joint probability P(e, c).
    The baseline model includes log P(e, c), the two n-gram language models log P(e), and ot
