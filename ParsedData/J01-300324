hich is predicted to have low [detectable] overlap of subjects and objects).
    Animacy Finally, considering the roles in the first and last columns of thematic assignments in Table 3, we observe that unergative and object-drop verbs assign an agentive role to their subject in both the transitive and intransitive, while unaccusatives assign an agentive role to their subject only in the transitive.
    Under the assumption that the intransitive use of unaccusatives is not rare, we then expect that unaccusatives will occur less often overall with an agentive subject than will the other two verb classes.
    (The assumption that unaccusatives are not rare in the intransitive is based on the linguistic complexity of the causative transitive alternant, and is borne out in our corpus analysis.)
    On the further assumption that Agents tend to be animate entities more so than Themes are, we expect that unaccusatives will occur less frequently with an animate subject compared to unergative and object-drop verbs.
