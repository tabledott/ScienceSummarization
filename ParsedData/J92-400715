pproach cannot succeed, for several reasons.
    First, as we have argued, there is not a fixed, one-to-one mapping between intentional and informational level relations.
    We showed, for example, that a CONDITION relation may hold at the informational level between consecutive discourse elements at the same time as either an ENABLEMENT or a MOTIVATION relation holds at the intentional level.
    Similarly, we illustrated that either a CONDITION or an OTHERWISE relation may hold at the informational level at the same time as a MOTIVATIONAL relation holds at the intentional level.
    Thus, an approach such as Hovy's that is based on multi-relation definitions will result in a proliferation of definitions.
    Indeed, there will be potentially n x m relations created from a theory that initially includes n informational relations and m intentional relations.
    Moreover, by combining informational and intentional relations into single definitions, one makes it difficult to perform the discourse analysis in
