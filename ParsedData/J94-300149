he necessary context was not destroyed by an application further to the left.
    Kenstowicz and Kisseberth (1979), who discuss a number of rule application strategies in great detail, cite a case in which one rule seems to be required in the grammars of two languages.
    However, it must be applied left to right in one, but right to left in the other.
    In the Australian language Gidabal, the long vowel of certain suffixes becomes short if the vowel of the preceding syllable is long.
    We find, for example, yaga+ya 'should fix' where we would otherwise expect yaga+ya.
    (We use + to mark the point at which the suffix begins and a bar over a vowel to show that it is long.)
    The interesting question concerns what happens when several of these suffixes are added to the same stem.
    Some examples are: 'is certainly right on the fish' gunam+ba-Fdeiang+be gunam+ba+dang+be 'is certainly right on the stump' The rule that Kenstowicz and Kisseberth propose is essentially the following: This produces the de
