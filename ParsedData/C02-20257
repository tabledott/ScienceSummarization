 the functor ?
  argument (or tectogrammati- cal) structure advocated in the Prague Dependency Tree- bank or the German TiGer corpus.
  Most importantly, however, representation (i) provides all the information required to replay the full HPSG analysis (using the orig- inal grammar and one of the open-source HPSG process- ing environments, e.g., the LKB or PET, which already have been interfaced to [incr tsdb()]).
  Using the latter ap- proach, users of the treebank are enabled to extract infor- mation in whatever representation they require, simply by reconstructing full analyses and adapting the exist- ing mappings (e.g., the inventory of node labels used for phrase structure trees) to their needs.
  Likewise, the ex- isting [incr tsdb()] facilities for comparing across compe- tence and performance profiles can be deployed to evalu- ate results of a (stochastic) parse disambiguation system, essentially using the preferences recorded in the treebank as a ?gold standard?
  target for comparison.
