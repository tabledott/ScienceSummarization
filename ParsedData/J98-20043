y will appear in a correct parse, rather than simply popping constituents off of a stack.
    Some probabilistic figure of merit is assigned to the constituents on the agenda, and the constituent maximizing this value is the next to be added to the chart.
    In this paper we consider probabilities primarily based on probabilistic contextfree grammars, though in principle, other, more complicated schemes could be used.
    The purpose of this work is to compare how well several figures of merit select Constituent Nj'A in a sentence ton. constituents to be moved from the agenda to the chart.
    Ideally, we would like to use as our figure of merit the conditional probability of that constituent, given the entire sentence, in order to choose a constituent that not only appears likely in isolation, but is most likely given the sentence as a whole; that is, we would like to pick the constituent that maximizes the following quantity: where to, is the sequence of the n tags, or parts of speech, in the sentence (num
