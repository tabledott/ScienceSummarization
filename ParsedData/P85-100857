f discourse D be the class of finite sets built out of a finite set of urelements.
    The interpretation of a constant X will be some element of D; call it I(X).
    The interpretation of a monadic predicate p will a subset of D; call it I(p).
    Then if E is such that plE, X), we define the interpretation of E to be &lt; 1(p), 1(X) &gt;.
    Now suppose we have a functional F mapping predicates into predicates.
    We can define the corresponding predicate q to be such that q(E) is true if there are a predicate p and a constant X where the interpretation of E is &lt; 1(p), I(X) &gt; and F(p)(X) is true.
    The fact that we can define such a predicate q in a moderately rich model means that we are licensed to treat opaque adverbials as properties of events and conditions.
    The purpose of this exercise is only to show the viability of the approach.
    I am not claiming that a running event is an ordered pair of the runner and the set of all runners, although it should be harmless enough for those irrede
