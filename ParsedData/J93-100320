nt (the first row of the table) is the same as the distribution of A given that B is not present (the second row of the table).
    In fact, of course, we are not really doing a statistical test to see if A and B are independent; we know that they are generally not independent in text.
    Instead we just want to use the test statistic as a measure that will help highlight particular As and Bs that are highly associated in text.
    These counts were analyzed using the test for binomials described earlier, and the 50 most significant are tabulated in Table 2.
    This table contains the most significant 200 bigrams and is reverse sorted by the first column, which contains the quantity &#8212;2 log A.
    Other columns contain the four counts from the contingency table described above, and the bigram itself.
    Examination of the table shows that there is good correlation with intuitive feelings about how natural the bigrams in the table actually are.
    This is in distinct contrast with Table 3, which conta
