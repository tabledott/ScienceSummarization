is is that NPBs are never considered to be coordinated phrases (as mentioned in Section 4.12), and thus CCs dominated by NPB are never generated using a PCC parameter; instead, they are generated using a normal modifying-nonterminal parameter.
    Punctuation dominated by NPB, on the other hand, is still, as always, generated via Ppunc parameters, but crucially, the modifier is always conjoined (via the punctuation mark) to the &#8220;pseudohead&#8221; that is the previously generated modifier.
    Consequently, when some right modifier Ri is generated, the previously generated modifier on the right side of the head, Ri&#8722;1, is never a punctuation preterminal, but always the previous &#8220;real&#8221; (i.e., nonpunctuation) preterminal.24 Base NPs are also exceptional with respect to determining chart item equality, the comma-pruning rule, and general beam pruning (see Section 7.2 for details).
    Two parameter classes that make their appearance only in Appendix E of Collins&#8217; thesis are those that
