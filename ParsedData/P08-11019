supervised learning, using the averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002), given in Figure 1.
    1 We take the union of feature templates from the baseline segmentor (Table 1) and POS tagger (Table 2) as the feature templates for the joint system.
    All features are treated equally and processed together according to the linear model, regardless of whether they are from the baseline segmentor or tagger.
    In fact, most features from the baseline POS tagger, when used in the joint model, represent segmentation patterns as well.
    For example, the aforementioned pattern &#8220;number word&#8221; + &#8220;^&#8221;, which is Inputs: training examples (xi, yi) Initialization: set w&#65533; = 0 Algorithm: for t = 1..T, i = 1..N calculate zi = arg maxyEGEN(xi) &#934;(y) - w&#65533; if zi =&#65533; yi useful only for the POS &#8220;number word&#8221; in the baseline tagger, is also an effective indicator of the segmentation of the two words (especially &#8220;^&#8221;) in the joint model.
