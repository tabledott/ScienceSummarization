andidate parses.
    A discriminative model is then used to choose between these candidates.
    In dynamic programming methods, a large number of candidate parse trees are represented compactly in a parse tree forest or chart.
    Given sufficiently &#8220;local&#8221; features, the decoding and parameter estimation problems can be solved using dynamic programming algorithms.
    For example, (Johnson, 2001; Geman and Johnson, 2002; Miyao and Tsujii, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004; Kaplan et al., 2004) describe approaches based on conditional log-linear (maximum entropy) models, where variants of the inside-outside algorithm can be used to efficiently calculate gradients of the log-likelihood function, despite the exponential number of trees represented by the parse forest.
    In this paper, we describe a dynamic programming approach to discriminative parsing that is an alternative to maximum entropy estimation.
    Our method extends the maxmargin approach of Taskar et al. (2003) to the case of context-free
