 and for an object or a modifier (e.g.
    &#8216;X s+_ prevent &#65533; Y&#8217;).
    STEP (2) constructs asample corpus, denoted S, for the pivot template.
    STEP (2.A) utilizes a Web search engine to initialize S by retrieving sentences containing P. The sentences are parsed by the MINIPAR dependency parser (Lin, 1998), keeping only sentences that contain the complete syntactic template Tp (with all the variables instantiated).
    STEP (2.B) identifies phrases that are statistically associated with Tp in S. We test all noun-phrases in S , discarding phrases that are too common on the Web (absolute frequency higher than a threshold MAXPHRASEF), such as &#8220;desire&#8221;.
    Then we select the N phrases with highest tf &#183;idf score1.
    These phrases have a strong collocation relationship with the pivot P and are likely to indicate topical (rather than anecdotal) occurrences of P. For example, the phrases &#8220;patient&#8221; and &#8220;American Dental Association&#8221;, which indicate contexts
