 gazetteers did not make that much of a difference to their system.
    Nevertheless, in a recent article Cucchiarelli et al. (1998) report that one of the bottlenecks in designing NE recognition systems is the limited availability of large gazetteers, particularly gazetteers for different languages (Cucchiarelli et al.
    1998: 291).
    People also use gazetteers of very different sizes.
    The basic gazetteers in the Isoquest system for muc-7 contain 110,000 names, but Krupka and Hausman (1998) show that system performance does not degrade much when the Proceedings of EACL '99 gazetteers are reduced to 25,000 and 9,000 names; conversely, they also show that the addition of an extra 42 entries to the gazetteers improves performance dramatically.
    This raises several questions: how important are gazetteers? is it important that they are big? if gazetteers are important but their size isn't, then what are the criteria for building gazetteers?
    One might think that Named Entity recognition could be don
