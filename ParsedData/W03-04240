  Language Independent NER Using A Maximum Entropy Tagger
  
    Entity Recognition systems need to integrate a wide variety of information for optimal performance.
    This paper demonstrates that a maximum entropy tagger can effectively encode such information and identify named entities with very high accuracy.
    The tagger uses features which can be obtained for a variety of languages and works effectively not only for English, but also for other languages such as German and Dutch.
  
  
    Named Entity Recognition1 (NER) can be treated as a tagging problem where each word in a sentence is assigned a label indicating whether it is part of a named entity and the entity type.
    Thus methods used for part of speech (POS) tagging and chunking can also be used for NER.
    The papers from the CoNLL-2002 shared task which used such methods (e.g.
    Malouf (2002), Burger et al. (2002)) reported results significantly lower than the best system (Carreras et al., 2002).
    However, Zhou and Su (2002) have r
