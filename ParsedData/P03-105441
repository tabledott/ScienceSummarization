 whose presence actually erased a useful internal indicator &#8211; base NPs are more frequent in subject position than object position, for example.
    In isolation, the Collins method actually hurt the baseline (absolute cost to F1 of 0.37%), while skipping the unary insertion added an absolute 0.73% to the baseline, and brought the cumulative F1 to 86.04%.
    In the case of attachment of a PP to an NP either above or inside a relative clause, the high NP is distinct from the low one in that the already modified one contains a verb (and the low one may be a base NP as well).
    This is a partial explanation of the utility of verbal distance in Collins (1999).
    To 13The inability to encode distance naturally in a naive PCFG is somewhat ironic.
    In the heart of any PCFG parser, the fundamental table entry or chart item is a label over a span, for example an NP from position 0 to position 5.
    The concrete use of a grammar rule is to take two adjacent span-marked labels and combine them (for example
