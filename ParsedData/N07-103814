erceptron or SVM optimization.
    Ranking Models Following previous work on sentiment classification (Pang et al., 2002), we represent each review as a vector of lexical features.
    More specifically, we extract all unigrams and bigrams, discarding those that appear fewer than three times.
    This process yields about 30,000 features.
    Agreement Model The agreement model also operates over lexicalized features.
    The effectiveness of these features for recognition of discourse relations has been previously shown by Marcu and Echihabi (2002).
    In addition to unigrams and bigrams, we also introduce a feature that measures the maximum contrastive distance between pairs of words in a review.
    For example, the presence of &#8220;delicious&#8221; and &#8220;dirty&#8221; indicate high contrast, whereas the pair &#8220;expensive&#8221; and &#8220;slow&#8221; indicate low contrast.
    The contrastive distance for a pair of words is computed by considering the difference in relative weight assigned to t
