ation process, relying on shallow analysis of the input and statistics derived from a corpus.
    Clearly, the difference in the nature of both tasks and in the type of input they expect (single sentence versus multiple sentences) dictates the use of different methods.
    Having multiple sentences in the input poses new challenges&#8212;such as a need for sentence comparison&#8212;but at the same time it opens up new possibilities for generation.
    While the output of existing compression algorithms is always a substring of the original sentence, sentence fusion may generate a new sentence which is not a substring of any of the input sentences.
    This is achieved by arranging fragments of several input sentences into one sentence.
    The only other text-to-text generation approach able to produce new utterances is that of Pang, Knight, and Marcu (2003).
    Their method operates over multiple English translations of the same foreign sentence and is intended to generate novel paraphrases of the input sen
