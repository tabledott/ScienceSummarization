he responsibility of linguistic theory, hence &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; in the complexity competition between G1 and G2.
    That is, the proponent of the generative view must be willing to acknowledge that overall complexity of the grammar of a language may be greater than logically necessary due to evolution's investment in one particular style of programming language.
    Goldsmith Unsupervised Learning of the Morphology of a Natural Language (7)-(11) as offering us an exact and explicit statement of how a morphology can be improved.
    The notation can be considerably simplified if we take some care in advance.
    Note first that in (7) and below, several items are subscripted to indicate whether they should be counted as in Si or S2.
    Much of the simplification comes from observing, first, that second, that this difference is generally computed inside a summation over a set of morphemes, and hence the first term simplifies to a constant times the type count of the morphemes in the set in question.
