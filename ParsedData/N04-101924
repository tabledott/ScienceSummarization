, which is the mildest one.
    Choosing a desirable order of pyramid involves balancing the two desiderata of having less data to annotate and score stability.
    Our data suggest that for this corpus, 4 or 5 summaries provide an optimal balance of annotation effort with reliability.
    This is reconfirmed by our following analysis of ranking stability.
    In order to study the issue of how the pyramid scores behave when several summarizers are compared, not just two, for each set we randomly selected 5 peer summaries and constructed pyramids consisting of all possible subsets of the remaining five.
    We computed the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient for the ranking of the 5 peer summaries compared to the ranking of the same summaries given by the order-9 pyramid.
    Spearman coefficent rs (Dixon and Massey, 1969) ranges from -1 to 1, and the sign of the coefficent shows whether the two rankings are correlated negatively or positively and its absolute value shows the strength of the correlation.
