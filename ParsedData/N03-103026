level discourse structures.
    Our model defines and exploits a set of syntactically motivated lexico-grammatical dominance relations that fall naturally from a syntactic representation of sentences.
    The most interesting finding is that these dominance relations encode sufficient information to enable the derivation of discourse structures that are almost indistinguishable from those built by human annotators.
    Our experiments empirically show that, at the sentence level, there is an extremely strong correlation between syntax and discourse.
    This is even more remarkable given that the discourse corpus (RST-DT, 2002) was built with no syntactic theory in mind.
    The annotators used by Carlson et al. (2003) were not instructed to build discourse trees that were consistent with the syntax of the sentences.
    Yet, they built discourse structures at sentence level that are not only consistent with the syntactic structures of sentences, but also derivable from them.
