are conditional.
			proportions based on the sub-corpora.
			To calculate the overall proportions in the test cor pus, it is necessary to multiply each value by the relative size of its sub-corpus.
			This is shown in Table 3, where the proportion ofHits in the ?Error?
			sub-corpus (0.80) is multiplied by the relative size of the ?Error?
			sub corpus (0.10) to produce an overall Hit rate (0.08).
			Overall rates for FPs and Misses are calculated in a similar manner.

			Using the values from step 6, calculate Preci-.
			sion (Hits/(Hits + FP)) and Recall (Hits/(Hits + Misses)).
			These are shown in the last two rows of Table 3.
			Estimated Overall Rates Sample Proportion * Sub-Corpus Proportion Hits 0.80 * 0.10 = 0.08 FP 0.20 * 0.10 = 0.02 Misses 0.30 * 0.90 = 0.27 Precision 0.08/(0.08 + 0.02) = 0.80 Recall 0.08/(0.08 + 0.27) = 0.23 Table 3: Sampling Calculations (Hypothetical) 870 This method is similar in spirit to active learning ((Dagan and Engelson, 1995) and (Engelson and Dagan, 1996)), which h
