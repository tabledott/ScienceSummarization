 within the target word's scope.
    Critical values for the statistical measures were set during this development phase.
    The settings were based empirically on ALEK's performance so as to optimize precision and recall on the three development words.
    Candidate errors were those local context sequences that produced a mutual information value of less than &#8212;3.60 based on the general corpus; mutual information of less than &#8212;5.00 for the specific/general comparisons; or a x2 value greater than 12.82 with an effect size greater than 0.30.
    Precision and recall for the three words are shown below.
  
  
    ALEK was tested on 20 words.
    These words were randomly selected from those which met two criteria: (1) They appear in a university word list (Nation, 1990) as words that a student in a US university will be expected to encounter and (2) there were at least 1,000 sentences containing the word in the TOEFL essay pool.
    To build the usage model for each target word, 10,000 sentences co
