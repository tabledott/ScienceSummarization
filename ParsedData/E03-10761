plitting of an unknown compound into its parts enables the translation of the compound by the translation of its parts.
    Take the word Aktionsplan in German (see Figure 1), which was created by joining the words Aktion and Plan.
    Breaking up this compound would assist the translation into English as action plan.
    Compound splitting is a well defined computational linguistics task.
    One way to define the goal of compound splitting is to break up foreign words, so that a one-to-one correspondence to English can be established.
    Note that we are looking for a one-to-one correspondence to English content words: Say, the preferred translation of Aktionsplan is plan for action.
    The lack of correspondence for the English word for does not detract from the definition of the task: We would still like to break up the German compound into the two parts Aktion and Plan.
    The insertion of function words is not our concern.
    Ultimately, the purpose of this work is to improve the quality of machine
