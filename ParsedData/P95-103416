nd specifies a choice point in the search and causes the creation of a state in the lattice; all continuations of alternative lexicalizations for this island become paths that leave this state.
    Choices between alternative lexical islands for the same concept also become states in the lattice, with arcs leading to the sub-lattices corresponding to each island.
    Once the semantic input to the generator has been transformed to a word lattice, a search component identifies the N highest scoring paths from the start to the final state, according to our statistical language model.
    We use a version of the N-best algorithm (Chow and Schwartz, 1989), a Viterbistyle beam search algorithm that allows extraction of more than just the best scoring path.
    (Hatzivassiloglou and Knight, 1995) has more details on our search algorithm and the method we applied to estimate the parameters of the statistical model.
    Our approach differs from traditional top-down generation in the same way that top-down and bottom
