es which had a nonzero empirical count, that is, those features which occured on at least one correct derivation.
    These feature types and frequency cutoffs led to 475,537 features for the normal-form model and 632,591 features for the dependency model.
  
  
    Parsing with lexicalized grammar formalisms such as CCG is a two-step process: first, elementary syntactic structures&#8212;in CCG&#8217;s case lexical categories&#8212;are assigned to each word in the sentence, and then the parser combines the structures together.
    The first step can be performed by simply assigning to each word all lexical categories the word is seen with in the training data, together with some strategy for dealing with rare and unknown words (such as assigning the complete lexical category set; Hockenmaier 2003a).
    Because the number of lexical categories assigned to a word can be high, some strategy is needed to make parsing practical; Hockenmaier, for example, uses a beam search to discard chart entries with low scores
