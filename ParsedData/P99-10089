el the metric should be something like p(w Ip).
    (Here and in what follows w denotes the outcome of the random variable generating wholes, and p the outcome for parts.
    W(w) states that w appears in the patterns AB as a whole, while P(p) states that p appears as a part.)
    Metrics of the form p(w I p) have the desirable property that they are invariant over p with radically different base frequencies, and for this reason have been widely used in corpus-based lexical semantic research [3,6,9].
    However, in making this intuitive idea someone more precise we found two closely related versions: We call metrics based on the first of these &amp;quot;loosely conditioned&amp;quot; and those based on the second &amp;quot;strongly conditioned&amp;quot;.
    While invariance with respect to frequency is generally a good property, such invariant metrics can lead to bad results when used with sparse data.
    In particular, if a part word p has occurred only once in the data in the AB patterns, then perforce p(
