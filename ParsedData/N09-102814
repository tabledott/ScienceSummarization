; in Figure 3.
    It corresponds to &#8220;4ol-01 (a bat) (with)&#8221;.
    We handle these types of reordering by the noun and preposition precedence rules in the third and fourth panel of Table 1.
    With the rules defined in Table 1, we now show a more complex example in Figure 4.
    First, the ROOT node matches an adjective rule, with four children nodes labeled as (csubj, cop, advcl, p), and with precedence weights of (0, -2, 1, 0).
    The ROOT node itself has a weight of -1.
    After reordering, the sentence becomes: &#8220;because we do n&#8217;t know what the future has Living exciting is .&#8221;.
    Note that the whole adverbial phrase rooted at &#8220;know&#8221; is moved to the beginning of the sentence.
    After that, we see that the child node rooted at &#8220;know&#8221; matches a verb rule, with five children nodes labeled as (mark, nsubj, aux, neg, ccomp), with weights (0, 0, -2, -2, 0).
    In this case, the verb itself also has weight -2.
    Now we have two groups of nodes, with we
