orted by frequency) PT B V B EM EM 25 Figure 3: The average number of words labeled with each hidden state or tag for the EM, VB (with ?x = ?y = 0.1) and EM-25 estimators (EM-25 is the EM estimator with 25 hidden states).
			lihoods were significantly higher (i.e., the models fit better) than those found without annealing.
			The evaluation of the models produced by the EM and other estimators is presented in Table 1.
			It is difficult to compare these with previous work, but Haghighi and Klein (2006) report that in a completely unsupervised setting, their MRF model, which uses a large set of additional features and amore complex estimation procedure, achieves an average 1-to-1 accuracy of 41.3%.
			Because they provide no information about the variance in this accuracy it is difficult to tell whether there is a signifi cant difference between their estimator and the EM estimator, but it is clear that when EM is run longenough, the performance of even very simple models like the bitag HMM is better than gene
