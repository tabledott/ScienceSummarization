 car.
    This is written relation(arg1, ... ,argn).
    For instance, like(e, x, y) is a well-formed SEP.
    Equality Conditions: Where i1 and i2 are indices, i1 = i2 is an equality condition.
    We write a SSEMENT as: [i1][i2][SEPs]{EQs}.
    Note for convenience we omit the set markers {} from the hook and hole when there is no possible confusion.
    The SEPs, and EQs are (partial) descriptions of the fully specified formulae of first order logic.
    Definition 3 The Semantic Algebra A Semantic Algebra defined on vocabulary V is the algebra (E, op) where: where Tr stands for transitive closure (i.e., if S = {x = y, y = z}, then This definition makes a2 the equivalent of a semantic functor and a1 its argument.
    Theorem 1 op is a function If a1 = a3 and a2 = a4, then a5 = op(a1, a2) = op(a3, a4) = a6.
    Thus op is a function.
    Furthermore, the range of op is within E. So (E, op) is an algebra.
    We can assume that semantic composition always involves two arguments, since we can define compositi
