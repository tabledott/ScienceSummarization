o spatial statistics, Besag introduced a &amp;quot;pseudolikelihood&amp;quot; estimator to address these difficulties (Besag, 1974; Besag, 1975), and in fact our proposal here is an instance of his method.
    In general, the likelihood function is replaced by a more manageable product of conditional likelihoods (a pseudo-likelihood&#8212;hence the designation PLO, which is then optimized over the parameter vector, instead of the likelihood itself.
    In many cases, as in our case here, this substitution side steps much of the computational burden without sacrificing consistency (more on this shortly).
    What are the asymptotics of optimizing a pseudo-likelihood function?
    Look first at the likelihood itself.
    For large n: where 00 is the true (and unknown) parameter vector.
    Up to a constant, (8) is the negative of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and estimated distributions of syntactic analyses.
    As sample size grows, maximizing likelihood amounts to minimizing divergence.
