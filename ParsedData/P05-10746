    We find these alignments using recent phrase-based approaches to statistical machine translation.
    The original formulation of statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) was defined as a word-based operation.
    The probability that a foreign sentence is the translation of an English sentence is calculated by summing over the probabilities of all possible word-level alignments, a, between the sentences: Thus Brown et al. decompose the problem of determining whether a sentence is a good translation of another into the problem of determining whether there is a sensible mapping between the words in the sentences.
    More recent approaches to statistical translation calculate the translation probability using larger blocks of aligned text.
    Koehn (2004), Tillmann (2003), and Vogel et al. (2003) describe various heuristics for extracting phrase alignments from the Viterbi word-level alignments that are estimated using Brown et al.
    (1993) models.
    We use the heuristic for phrase align
