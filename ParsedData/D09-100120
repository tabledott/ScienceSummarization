 which can be solved in linear time (Kilpelainen, 1992).
    Inverted indexes (e.g., from p to eligible core forms) are used to further improve the efficiency.
    For a new part p and a cluster that contains p&#8217;s core form, there are km ways of assigning p&#8217;s m arguments to the k argument types of the cluster.
    For larger k and m, this is very expensive.
    We therefore approximate it by assigning each argument to the best type, independent of other arguments.
    This algorithm is very efficient, and is used repeatedly in learning.
  
  
    The learning problem in USP is to maximize the log-likelihood of observing the QLFs obtained from the dependency trees, denoted by Q, summing out the unobserved semantic parses: Here, L are the semantic parses, 0 are the MLN parameters, and PB(Q, L) are the completion likelihoods.
    A serious challenge in unsupervised learning is the identifiability problem (i.e., the optimal parameters are not unique) (Liang and Klein, 2008).
    This problem is particu
