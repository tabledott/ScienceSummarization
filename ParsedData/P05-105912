 2The experimental difference of the two alternatives was small.
    For our results, we used the max version. with a cell of width one: Figure 3(b) and (c) illustrate the inductive computation indicated by the two equations.
    Each of the O(n4) inductive steps takes one additive or multiplicative computation.
    A similar dynammic programing technique can be used to efficiently compute the outside component of the figure of merit.
    Hence, the algorithm takes just O(n4) steps to compute the figure of merit for all cells in the chart.
    Once the cells have been scored, there can be many ways of pruning.
    In our experiments, we applied beam ratio pruning to each individual bucket of cells sharing a common source substring.
    We prune cells whose probability is lower than a fixed ratio below the best cell for the same source substring.
    As a result, at least one cell will be kept for each source substring.
    We safely pruned more than 70% of cells using 10&#8722;5 as the beam ratio for sentence
