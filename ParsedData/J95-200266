efix probability problem, with the added advantage that it is not restricted to CNF grammars.
    Algorithms for probabilistic CFGs can be broadly characterized along several dimensions.
    One such dimension is whether the quantities entered into the parser chart are defined in a bottom-up (CYK) fashion, or whether left-to-right constraints are an inherent part of their definition.19 The probabilistic Earley parser shares the inherent left-to-right character of the LRI algorithm, and contrasts with the bottom-up I/O algorithm.
    Probabilistic parsing algorithms may also be classified as to whether they are formulated for fully parameterized CNF grammars or arbitrary context-free rules (typically taking advantage of grammar sparseness).
    In this respect the Earley approach contrasts with both the CNF-oriented I/O and LRI algorithms.
    Another approach to avoiding the CNF constraint is a formulation based on probabilistic Recursive Transition Networks (RTNs) (Kupiec 1992).
