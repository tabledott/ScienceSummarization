ena (Steedman, 1996; Steedman, 2000).
			The core of a CCG grammar is a lexicon ?.
			For example, consider the lexicon flights := N : ?x.flight(x) to := (N\N)/NP : ?y.?f.?x.f(x) ? to(x, y) boston := NP : boston Each entry in the lexicon is a pair consisting of aword and an associated category.
			The category con tains both syntactic and semantic information.
			For example, the first entry states that the word flightscan have the category N : ?x.flight(x).
			This cat egory consists of a syntactic type N , together withthe semantics ?x.flight(x).
			In general, the seman tic entries for words in the lexicon can consist of anylambda-calculus expression.
			Syntactic types can ei ther be simple types such as N , NP , or S, or can be more complex types that make use of slash notation, for example (N\N)/NP . CCG makes use of a set of combinators which are used to combine categories to form larger pieces of syntactic and semantic structure.
			The simplest such rules are the functional application rules: A/B : f
