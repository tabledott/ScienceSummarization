 gives equal weight to all n-grams, NIST gives more importance to less frequent (hence more informative) n-grams.
    BLEU&#8217;s ability to detect subtle but important differences in translation quality has been questioned, some research showing NIST to be more sensitive (Doddington, 2002; Riezler and Maxwell III, 2005).
    The ROUGE metric (Lin and Hovy, 2003) was conceived as document summarisation&#8217;s answer to BLEU, but it does not appear to have met with the same degree of enthusiasm.
    There are several different ROUGE metrics.
    The simplest is ROUGE-N, which computes the highest proportion in any reference summary of n-grams that are matched by the system-generated summary.
    A procedure is applied that averages the score across leave-oneout subsets of the set of reference texts.
    ROUGEN is an almost straightforward n-gram recall metric between two texts, and has several counterintuitive properties, including that even a text composed entirely of sentences from reference texts cannot s
