ises to 0.90.
    Thus, annotator agreement is especially high when both are certain.
    Considering only the 16-word subset with both S and O senses (according to Judge 1), r. is .75, and for the 16-word subset for which Judge 1 gave only S or only O senses, r. is .73.
    Thus, the two subsets are of comparable difficulty.
    The two annotators also independently annotated the 20 ambiguous nouns (117 senses) of the SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sample task used in Section 5.
    For this tagging task, U tags were not allowed, to create a definitive gold standard for the experiments.
    Even so, the r. value for them is 0.71, which is not substantially lower.
    The distributions of Judge 1&#8217;s tags for all 20 words can be found in Table 3 below.
    We conclude this section with examples of disagreements that illustrate sources of uncertainty.
    First, uncertainty arises when subjective senses are missing from the dictionary.
    The labels for the senses of noun assault are (O:O,O:O,O:O,O:UO).4 For
