he node, 0, then we unify t s With b,.
  At the end of a derivation, the tree generated must not have any nodes with OA constraints.
  We cheek that by unifying the t and b feature structures of every node.?
  More details of the definition of FTAG may be found in [Vijayashanker 1987].
  We now give an example of an initial tree and an auxiliary tree.
  We would like to note that, just as in a TAG, the elementary trees which are the domain of co-occurenee r strictions i available as a single unit during each step of the derivation.
  Thus, most of these co-occurence constraints can be eheckcd even before the tree is used in a derivation, and this checking need not be linked to the derivation process.
  2.2 Un i f i ca t ion  and  Const ra in ts Since we expect hat there are linguistic reasons determining why some auxiliary tree can be adjoined at a tree and why some cannot, or why some nodes have OA constraint, we would like to express these constraints in the feature structm:es associated with nodes.
