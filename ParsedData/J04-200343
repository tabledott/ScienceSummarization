 much easier and cheaper to compile, this corpus might be (substantially) larger than the target language part of C2.
  
  
    Tests were carried out on Verbmobil data and on Nespole! data.
    As usual, the sentences from the test sets were not used for training.
    The training corpora were used for training the parameters of IBM model 4.
    7.1.1 Verbmobil.
    Verbmobil was a project for automatic translation of spontaneously spoken dialogues.
    A detailed description of the statistical translation system within Verbmobil is given by Ney et al. (2000) and by Och (2002).
    Table 5 summarizes the characteristics of the English and German parallel corpus used for training the parameters of IBM model 4.
    A conventional dictionary complements the training corpus (see Table 6 for the statistics).
    The vocabulary in Verbmobil was considered closed: There are official lists of word forms which can be produced by the speech recognizers.
    Such lists exist for German and English (see Table 7).
