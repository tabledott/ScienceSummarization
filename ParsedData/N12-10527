-class transitions (Uszkoreit and Brants, 2008).
    In addition to the clustering model that we make use of in this study, a number of additional word clustering and embedding variants have been proposed.
    For example, Turian et al. (2010) assessed the effectiveness of the word embedding techniques of Collobert and Weston (2008) and Mnih and Hinton (2007) along with the word clustering technique of Brown et al.
    (1992) for syntactic chunking and NER.
    Recently, Dhillon et al. (2011) proposed a word embedding method based on canonical correlation analysis that provides state-of-the art results for wordbased SSL for English NER.
    As an alternative to clustering words, Lin and Wu (2009) proposed a phrase clustering approach that obtained the state-of-the-art result for English NER.
  
  
    Before moving on to the multilingual setting, we conduct a set of monolingual experiments where we evaluate the use of the monolingual word clusters just described as features for dependency parsing and NER.
