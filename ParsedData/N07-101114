to France into xj, since this will turn off the &#8220;All-String-Match&#8221; feature for cluster xj.
    To our knowledge, the best results on this dataset were obtained by the meta-classification scheme of Ng (2005).
    Although our train-test splits may differ slightly, the best B-Cubed F1 score reported in Ng (2005) is 69.3%, which is considerably lower than the 79.3% obtained with our method.
    Also note that the Pairwise baseline obtains results similar to those in Ng and Cardie (2002).
  
  
    There has been a recent interest in training methods that enable the use of first-order features (Paskin, 2002; Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2005b; Richardson and Domingos, 2006).
    Perhaps the most related is &#8220;learning as search optimization&#8221; (LASO) (Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2005b; Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2005a).
    Like the current paper, LASO is also an error-driven training method that integrates prediction and training.
    However, whereas we explicitly use a ranking-based loss funct
