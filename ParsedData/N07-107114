ence rules for &#8220;X solves Y&#8221;: &#8220;Y is solved by X&#8221;, &#8220;X resolves Y&#8221;, &#8220;X finds a solution to Y&#8221; The choice of semantic classes is of great importance for selectional preference.
    One important aspect is the granularity of the classes.
    Too general a class will provide no discriminatory power while too fine-grained a class will offer little generalization and apply in only extremely few cases.
    The absence of an attested high-quality set of semantic classes for this task makes discovering preferences difficult.
    Since many of the criteria for developing such a set are not even known, we decided to experiment with two very different sets of semantic classes, in the hope that in addition to learning semantic preferences, we might also uncover some clues for the eventual decisions about what makes good semantic classes in general.
    Our first set of semantic classes was directly extracted from the output of the CBC clustering algorithm (Pantel and Lin 2002)
