may be substituted for one another, and is consequently an excellent resource for this application.
    WordNet is also a generic resource not associated with a particular domain which means the learning algorithm can make use of that knowledge to acquire patterns for a diverse range of IE tasks.
    This work represents a step towards truly domain-independent IE systems.
    Employing a weakly supervised learning algorithm removes much of the requirement for a human annotator to provide example patterns.
    Such approaches are often hampered by a lack of information but the additional knowledge in WordNet helps to compensate.
