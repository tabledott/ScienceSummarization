ign of the system is as follows: one is required to have an Amazon account to either submit tasks for annotations or to annotate submitted tasks.
    These Amazon accounts are anonymous, but are referenced by a unique Amazon ID.
    A Requester can create a group of Human Intelligence Tasks (or HITs), each of which is a form composed of an arbitrary number of questions.
    The user requesting annotations for the group of HITs can specify the number of unique annotations per HIT they are willing to pay for, as well as the reward payment for each individual HIT.
    While this does not guarantee that unique people will annotate the task (since a single person could conceivably annotate tasks using multiple accounts, in violation of the user agreement), this does guarantee that annotations will be collected from unique accounts.
    AMT also allows a requester to restrict which workers are allowed to annotate a task by requiring that all workers have a particular set of qualifications, such as sufficient accura
