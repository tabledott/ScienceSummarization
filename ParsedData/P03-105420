r to interpret, reason about, and improve than the more complex lexicalized models.
    The grammar representation is much more compact, no longer requiring large structures that store lexicalized probabilities.
    The parsing algorithms have lower asymptotic complexity4 and have much smaller grammar egory is divided into several subcategories, for example dividing verb phrases into finite and non-finite verb phrases, rather than in the modern restricted usage where the term refers only to the syntactic argument frames of predicators.

    An unlexicalized PCFG parser is much simpler to build and optimize, including both standard code optimization techniques and the investigation of methods for search space pruning (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998; Charniak et al., 1998).
    It is not our goal to argue against the use of lexicalized probabilities in high-performance probabilistic par
