trigger and arguments The 2005 ACE evaluation had 8 types of events, with 33 subtypes; for the purpose of this paper, we will treat these simply as 33 distinct event types.
    For example, for a sentence: the event extractor should detect a &#8220;Personnel_End-Position&#8221; event mention, with the trigger word, the position, the person who quit the position, the organization, and the time during which the event happened: We define the following standards to determine the correctness of an event mention: We use a state-of-the-art English IE system as our baseline (Grishman et al., 2005).
    This system extracts events independently for each sentence.
    Its training and test procedures are as follows.
    The system combines pattern matching with statistical models.
    For every event mention in the ACE training corpus, patterns are constructed based on the sequences of constituent heads separating the trigger and arguments.
    In addition, a set of Maximum Entropy based classifiers are trained: In the
