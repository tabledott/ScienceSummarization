ieve this is to include further vectors into the summation.
    These vectors are not arbitrary and ideally they must exhibit some relation to the words of the construction under consideration.
    When modeling predicate-argument structures, Kintsch (2001) proposes including one or more distributional neighbors, n, of the predicate: Note that considerable latitude is allowed in selecting the appropriate neighbors.
    Kintsch (2001) considers only the m most similar neighbors to the predicate, from which he subsequently selects k, those most similar to its argument.
    So, if in the composition of horse with run, the chosen neighbor is ride, ride = [2 15 7 9 1], then this produces the representation horse + run + ride = [3 29 13 23 5].
    In contrast to the simple additive model, this extended model is sensitive to syntactic structure, since n is chosen from among the neighbors of the predicate, distinguishing it from the argument.
    Although we have presented multiplicative and additive models separatel
