s which identify NPs that occur locally to ad- verbs, relative pronouns, and noun-preposition r noun- complementizer sequences over the tagged text in con- junction with the basic NP patterns described above.
			Because the syntactic,patterns are stated as regular ex- pressions, misanalyses are inevitable.
			In practice, how- ever, the extent o which incorrect analyses of syntactic context affect the overall accuracy of the algorithm is not large; we will return to a discussion of this point in section 4.
			A third set of patterns identifies and tags occurrences of "expletive" it.
			These patterns target occurrences of the pronoun it in certain contexts, e.g., as the subject of members of a specific set of verbs (seem, appear, etc.), or as the subject of adjectives with clausal complements.
			Once the extraction procedures are complete and the results unified, a set of discourse referents--abstract ob- jects which represent the participants inthe discourse-- is generated from the set of NP observations.
