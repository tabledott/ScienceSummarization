  Query expansion intends to alleviate the word mismatch lnoblenl in infornmtion retrieval, since documents are normally written in different vocabulary, ttow to atttomati- (ally identify highly e(nrelated terms and use them to improve information retrieval performance has been a main research issue since late 19611s.
  Re- cent advances in the query expansion (Xu and Croft, 1996) can also shed some light on the creation of topic signatures.
  Although we focus the ltse of topic signatures to aid text summarization i this paper, we plan to explore the possibility of applying topic signatures to perform query expansion in the future.
  The results reported are encouraging enough to allo
