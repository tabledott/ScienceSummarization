a lot of noise and may require additional filtering based on other criteria, such as collocations counts from another corpus (or the Web).
    Finally, some techniques may go even further and attempt to generalize the filtered list of paraphrase pairs into templates or rules which may then be applied to other sentences to generate their paraphrases.
    Note that generalization as a post-processing step may not be necessary if the induction process can extract distributionally similar patterns directly.
    One potential disadvantage of relying on distributional similarity is that items that are distributionally similar may not necessarily end up being paraphrastic: Both A general architecture for paraphrasing approaches leveraging the distributional similarity hypothesis. elements of the pairs (boys, girls), (cats, dogs), (high, low) can occur in similar contexts but are not semantically equivalent.
    In this section, we concentrate on paraphrase generation methods that operate on a single monolingual corp
