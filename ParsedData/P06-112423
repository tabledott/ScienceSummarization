wed to be positive and optimized over along with the discount parameters using cross-validation.
    Seating arrangements are Gibbs sampled as in Section 5 with the parameter values fixed.
    We find that HPYCV performs better than MKN (except marginally worse on small problems), and has best performance overall.
    Note that the parameter values in HPYCV are still not the optimal ones since they are obtained by cross-validation using IKN, an approximation to a hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model.
    Unfortunately cross-validation using a hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model inferred using Gibbs sampling is currently too costly to be practical.
    In Figure 2 (right) we broke down the contributions to the cross-entropies in terms of how many times each word appears in the test set.
    We see that most of the differences between the methods appear as differences among rare words, with the contribution of more common words being negligible.
    HPYLM performs worse than MKN on words that occurred only
