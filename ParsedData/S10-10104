    We can now define the six TempEval tasks: B.
    Determine the extent of the events in a text as defined by the TimeML EVENT tag.
    In addition, determine the value of the features CLASS, TENSE, ASPECT, POLARITY, and MODALITY.
    F. Determine the temporal relation between two events where one event syntactically dominates the other event.
    Of these tasks, C, D and E were also defined for TempEval-1.
    However, the syntactic locality restriction in task C was not present in TempEval-1.
    Task participants could choose to either do all tasks, focus on the time expression task, focus on the event task, or focus on the four temporal relation tasks.
    In addition, participants could choose one or more of the six languages for which we provided data: Chinese, English, French, Italian, Korean, and Spanish.
