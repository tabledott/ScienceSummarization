ntity is in focus through a sequence of sentences.
    We propose to use this same intuition to induce narrative chains.
    We assume that although a narrative has several participants, there is a central actor who characterizes a narrative chain: the protagonist.
    Narrative chains are thus structured by the protagonist&#8217;s grammatical roles in the events.
    In addition, narrative events are ordered by some theory of time.
    This paper describes a partial ordering with the before (no overlap) relation.
    Our task, therefore, is to learn events that constitute narrative chains.
    Formally, a narrative chain is a partially ordered set of narrative events that share a common actor.
    A narrative event is a tuple of an event (most simply a verb) and its participants, represented as typed dependencies.
    Since we are focusing on a single actor in this study, a narrative event is thus a tuple of the event and the typed dependency of the protagonist: (event, dependency).
    A narrative chain is
