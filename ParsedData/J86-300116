 an embedding relationship that can hold between them.
    As we discuss in Sections 2.2 and 5, the embedding relationships are a surface reflection of relationships among elements of the intentional structure.
    It is important to recognize that the linguistic structure is not strictly decompositional.
    An individual segment may include a combination of subsegments and utterances only in that segment (and not members of any of its embedded subsegments).
    Both of the examples in Section 3 exhibit such nonstrict decompositionality.
    Because the linguistic structure is not strictly decompositional, various properties of the discourse (most notably the intentional structure) are functions of properties of individual utterances and properties of segments.
    There is a two-way interaction between the discourse segment structure and the utterances constituting the discourse: linguistic expressions can be used to convey information about the discourse structure; conversely, the discourse structure const
