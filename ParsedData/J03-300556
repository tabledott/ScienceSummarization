d).
    For each pair (v, n) a fairly frequent verb v' was randomly chosen such that the pair (v', n) did not occur in the data set.
    Given the set of (v, n, v') triples (a total of 1,337), the task was to decide whether (v, n) or (v',n) was the correct (i.e., seen) pair by comparing the probabilities P(nlv) and P(nlv').
    The probabilities were re-created using Rooth et al.&#8217;s (1999) EM-based clustering model on a training set from which all seen pairs (v, n) had been removed.
    An accuracy of 80% on the pseudodisambiguation task was achieved (see Table 13).
    Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth (2000) evaluated Rooth et al.&#8217;s (1999) EM-based clustering model again using pseudodisambiguation, but on a separate data set using a slightly different method for constructing the pseudobigrams.
    They used a set of 298 (v, n, n') BNC triples in which (v, n) was chosen as in Rooth et al. (1999) but paired with a randomly chosen noun n'.
    Given the set of (v, n, n') triples, the task was to decide w
