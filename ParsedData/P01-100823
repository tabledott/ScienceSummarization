rrounding context.
    Each context was evaluated by two judges (other than the authors).
    The agreement was measured using the Kappa coefficient (Siegel and Castellan, 1988).
    Complete agreement between judges would correspond to K equals ; if there is no agreement among judges, then K equals .
    The judges agreement on the paraphrasing judgment without context was which is substantial agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977).
    The first judge found 439(87.8%) pairs as correct paraphrases, and the second judge &#8212; 426(85.2%).
    Judgments with context have even higher agreement ( ), and judges identified 459(91.8%) and 457(91.4%) pairs as correct paraphrases.
    The recall of our method is a more problematic issue.
    The algorithm can identify paraphrasing relations only between words which occurred in our corpus, which of course does not cover all English tokens.
    Furthermore, direct comparison with an electronic thesaurus like WordNet is impossible, because it is not known a priori which lex
