n an instance of cluster T with arguments of argument types A1, &#183; &#183; &#183; , Ak, its abstract lambda form is given by Ax1 &#183;&#183;&#183; Axk.T(n) &#8743; MI=1 Ai(n, xi).
    Given a sentence and its QLF, semantic parsing amounts to partitioning the atoms in the QLF, dividing each part into core form and argument forms, and then assigning each form to a cluster or an argument type.
    The final logical form is derived by composing the abstract lambda forms of the parts using the A-reduction rule.2 Formally, for a QLF Q, a semantic parse L partitions Q into parts p1, p2, &#183; &#183; &#183; , pn; each part p is assigned to some lambda-form cluster c, and is further partitioned into core form f and argument forms f1, &#183; &#183; &#183; , fk; each argument form is assigned to an argument type a in c. The USP MLN defines a joint probability distribution over Q and L by modeling the distributions over forms and arguments given the cluster or argument type.
