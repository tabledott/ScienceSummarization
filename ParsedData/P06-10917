ang, 2005) the current paper intentionally excludes them.
    The current feature functions are similar to those used in common phrase-based translation systems: for them it has been shown that good translation performance can be achieved 4.
    A systematic analysis of the novel training algorithm will allow us to include much more sophisticated features in future experiments, i.e.
    POSbased features, syntactic or hierarchical features (Chiang, 2005).
    The dimensionality of the feature vector depends on the number of binary features.
    For illustration purposes, the binary features are chosen such that they yield on the example block sequence in Fig.
    1.
    There are phrase-based and word-based features: The feature is a &#8217;unigram&#8217; phrase-based feature capturing the identity of a block.
    Additional phrase-based features include block orientation, target and source phrase bigram features.
    Word-based features are used as well, e.g. feature captures word-to-word translation depende
