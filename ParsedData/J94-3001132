 The range of the intersection of the outer relations for G1 and G2 thus contains strings with the same number of b's and c's but occurring in any order.
    This set is not regular, since intersecting it with the regular language b*c* produces the context-free language bnc&amp;quot;.
    The intersection of the two outer relations is therefore also not regular and so cannot be the outer relation of any regular two-level grammar.
    We have shown how our regular analysis techniques can be applied to two-level systems as well as rewriting grammars, and that grammars in both frameworks denote only regular relations.
    These results open up many new ways of partitioning the account of linguistic phenomena in order to achieve descriptions that are intuitively more satisfying but without introducing new formal power or computational machinery.
    Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen (1992), for example, argued that certain French morphological patterns can be better described as the composition of two separate two-le
