he actual progression of the parse.
    For example, if a structure is found to have incoherent semantics, the parser immediately eliminates it (and all structures that might contain it) from further consideration.
    Also, whenever the semantics of a parse becomes sufficiently better than that of its competitors, the system prunes the semantically inferior parses, reducing the number of ambiguities even further.'
    As suggested above, the system builds semantic interpretations incrementally.
    For each proposed combination of syntactic structures, there is a corresponding combination of semantic structures.
    It is the job of the semantic interpreter to identify the possible relations that link the structures being combined, identify the preferences associated with each possible combination of head, role (relation), and filler (the argument or modifier), and then rank competing semantic interpretations.
