    We maximize over all block segmentations with orientation for which the source phrases yield a segmentation of the input sentence.
    Swapping involves only blocks for which for the successor block , e.g. the blocks and in Fig 1.
    We tried several thresholds for , and performance is reduced significantly only if .
