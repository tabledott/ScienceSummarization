    Figure 2 suggests that a binarization is good if every virtual nonterminal has contiguous spans on both sides.
    We formalize this idea in the next section.
  
  
    A synchronous CFG (SCFG) is a context-free rewriting system for generating string pairs.
    Each rule (synchronous production) rewrites a nonterminal in two dimensions subject to the constraint that the sequence of nonterminal children on one side is a permutation of the nonterminal sequence on the other side.
    Each co-indexed child nonterminal pair will be further rewritten as a unit.2 We define the language L(G) produced by an SCFG G as the pairs of terminal strings produced by rewriting exhaustively from the start symbol.
    As shown in Section 3.2, terminals do not play an important role in binarization.
    So we now write rules in the following notation: where each Xi is a variable which ranges over nonterminals in the grammar and &#960; is the permutation of the rule.
    We also define an SCFG rule as n-ary if its permutatio
