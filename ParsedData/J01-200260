ount for 44% of the errors found for our best tagging system.
    Under the circumstances, we feel quite justified in assuming that inconsistency is the main cause of the low accuracy scores.28 The most important result that has undergone a change between van Halteren, Zavrel, and Daelemans (1998) and our current experiments is the relative accuracy of TagPair and stacked systems such as MBL.
    Where TagPair used to be significantly better than MBL, the roles are now well reversed.
    It appears that our hypothesis at the time, that the stacked systems were plagued by a lack of training data, is correct, since they can now hold their own.
    In order to see at which point TagPair is overtaken, we have trained several systems on increasing amounts of training data from LOB.'
    Each increment is one of the 10% training corpus parts described above.
    The results are shown in Figure 5.
    The accuracy of combiner methods on LOB as a function of the number of tokens of training material.
