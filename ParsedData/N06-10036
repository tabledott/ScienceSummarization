hine translation.
    Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) use bilingual parallel corpora to generate paraphrases.
    Paraphrases are identified by pivoting through phrases in another language.
    The foreign language translations of an English phrase are identified, all occurrences of those foreign phrases are found, and all English phrases that they translate back to are treated as potential paraphrases of the original English phrase.
    Figure 2 illustrates how a German phrase can be used as a point of identification for English paraphrases in this way.
    The method defined in Bannard and CallisonBurch (2005) has several features that make it an ideal candidate for incorporation into statistical machine translation system.
    Firstly, it can easily be applied to any language for which we have one or more parallel corpora.
    Secondly, it defines a paraphrase probability, p(e2|e1), which can be incorporated into the probabilistic framework of SMT.
    The paraphrase probability p(e2|e1) is defined in te
