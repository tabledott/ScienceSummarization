of precision without requiring manual labor per relation, at the expense of recall.
    When relationships in a corpus are not known, or their number is massive, Open IE is essential for RE.
    When higher levels of recall are desirable for a small set of target relations, traditional RE is more appropriate.
    However, in this case, one must be willing to undertake the cost of acquiring labeled training data for each relation, either via a computational procedure such as bootstrapped learning or by the use of human annotators.
    In this section, we explore the performance of HCRF, an ensemble-based extractor that learns to perform RE for a set of known relations based on the individual behaviors of O-CRF and R1-CRF.
    As shown in Table 5, the use of O-CRF as part of H-CRF, improves precision from 73.9% to 79.2% with only a slight decrease in recall.
    Overall, F1 improved from 65.2% to 66.2%.
    One disadvantage of a stacking-based hybrid system is that labeled training data is still required.
