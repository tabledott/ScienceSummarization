es for the Dirichlet priorparameters.
			Interestingly, we obtained our best per formance on 1-to-1 accuracy when the Dirchlet prior?x = 0.1, a relatively large number, but best per formance on many-to-1 accuracy was achieved with a much lower value for the Dirichlet prior, namely ?x = 10?4.
			The Dirichlet prior ?y that controls 302sparsity of the state-to-state transitions had little ef fect on the results.
			We did not have computational resources to fully explore other values for the prior (a set of 10 runs for one set of parameter values takes 25 computer days).
			As Figure 3 shows, VB can produce distributions of hidden states that are peaked in the same way that POS tags are.
			In fact, with the priors used here, VB produces state sequences in which only a subset ofthe possible HMM states are in fact assigned to ob servations.
			This shows that rather than fixing the number of hidden states in advance, the Bayesian prior can determine the number of states; this idea is more fully developed in the
