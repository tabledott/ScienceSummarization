 or semantic category such as person name, country, currency values, numerical expressions etc.
    In this paper lexical items are represented in lower case and semantic categories are capitalised.
    For example, in the pattern COMPANY+fired+ceo, fired and ceo are lexical items and COMPANY a semantic category which could match any lexical item belonging to that type.
    The algorithm described here relies on identifying patterns with similar meanings.
    The approach we have developed to do this is inspired by the vector space model which is commonly used in Information Retrieval (Salton and McGill, 1983) and language processing in general (Pado and Lapata, 2003).
    Each pattern can be represented as a set of pattern element-filler pairs.
    For example, the pattern COMPANY+fired+ceo consists of three pairs: subject COMPANY, verb fired and object ceo.
    Each pair consists of either a lexical item or semantic category, and pattern element.
    Once an appropriate set of pairs has been established a p
