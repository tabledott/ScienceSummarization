 the target structure.
    One such example is the relation between the sentences in (20): CP-T - 279 One way to encode this relation is given in the following lexical entry for just (remember that all the information about the structure of venir in French will come from the lexicon and grammar of French itself): This assigns to just a semantic form that takes an ARG function as its argument and maps it into the French venir.
    This lexical entry is combined with phrase-structure rule (22).
    This rule introduces sentence adverbs and makes the f-structure corresponding to the S node fill the ARG function in the f-structure corresponding to the Acov node.
    Note that the f-structure of the Am/ is not assigned a function within the S-node's f-structure, which is shown in (23).
    This is in keeping with the fact that the adverb has no functional interactions with the material in the main clause.
    The relation between the adverb and the clause is instead represented only in the f-structure associated w
