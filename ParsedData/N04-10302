eriments reported here, we first re placed their statistical classification algorithm with one that uses Support Vector Machines and then added to theexisting feature set.
			We evaluate results using both hand corrected TreeBank syntactic parses, and actual parses from the Charniak parser.
	
	
			We will be reporting on results using PropBank1 (Kingsbury et al, 2002), a 300k-word corpus in which predi cate argument relations are marked for part of the verbsin the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus et al, 1994).
			The arguments of a verb arelabeled ARG0 to ARG5, where ARG0 is the PROTO AGENT (usually the subject of a transitive verb) ARG1 is the PROTO-PATIENT (usually its direct object), etc. PropBank attempts to treat semantically related verbs consistently.
			In addition to these CORE ARGUMENTS, additional ADJUNCTIVE ARGUMENTS, referred to asARGMs are also marked.
			Some examples are ARGMLOC, for locatives, and ARGM-TMP, for temporals.
