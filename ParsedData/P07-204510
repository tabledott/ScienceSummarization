r semantic.
    These additional sources of information have been shown to be valuable when integrated into pre-processing or post-processing steps.
    Moses also integrates confusion network decoding, which allows the translation of ambiguous input.
    This enables, for instance, the tighter integration of speech recognition and machine translation.
    Instead of passing along the one-best output of the recognizer, a network of different word choices may be examined by the machine translation system.
    Efficient data structures in Moses for the memory-intensive translation model and language model allow the exploitation of much larger data resources with limited hardware.

    The toolkit is a complete out-of-the-box translation system for academic research.
    It consists of all the components needed to preprocess data, train the language models
