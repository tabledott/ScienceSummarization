 use the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train a Chinese trigram model with Knesser-Ney smoothing on the Chinese side of the parallel corpus.
    Our evaluation data consists of 140 short sentences (&lt; 25 Chinese words) of the Xinhua portion of the NIST 2003 Chinese-to-English evaluation set.
    Since we are translating in the other direction, we use the first English reference as the source input and the Chinese as the single reference.
    We implemented our system as follows: for each input sentence, we first run Algorithm 1, which returns the 1-best translation and also builds the derivation forest of all translations for this sentence.
    Then we extract the top 5000 non-duplicate translated strings from this forest and rescore them with the trigram model and the length penalty.
    We compared our system with a state-of-the-art phrase-based system Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) on the evaluation data.
    Since the target language is Chinese, we report character-based BLEU score instead of w
