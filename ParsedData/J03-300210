hild pages to which the parent links, or the sibling page together with the page to which it links.
    When all the pages on a site are under consideration, the process is rather different.
    The simplest possibility is to separate the pages on a site into the two languages of interest using automatic language identification (Ingle 1976; Beesley 1988; Cavnar and Trenkle 1994; Dunning 1994), throwing away any pages that are not in either language, and then generate the cross product.
    This potentially leads to a very large number of candidate page pairs, and there is no particular reason to believe that most of them are parallel translations, other than the fact that they appear on the same Web site.
    The spider component of STRAND adds a URL-matching stage, exploiting the fact that the directory structure on many Web sites reflects parallel organization when pages are translations of each other.
    Matching is performed by manually creating a list of substitution rules (e.g., english &#8594; big5),1
