s were extracted from 13 million words of AP news stories.
    The attachment decisions for these triples were unknown, so an unsupervised training method was used (section 5.2 describes the algorithm in more detail).
    Two human judges annotated the attachment decision for 880 test examples, and the method performed at 80% accuracy on these cases.
    Note that it is difficult to compare this result to results on Wall Street Journal, as the two corpora may be quite different.
    The Wall Street Journal Treebank [MSM93] enabled both [RRR94] and [BR94] to extract a large amount of supervised training material for the problem.
    Both of these methods consider the second noun, n2, as well as v, n1 and p, with the hope that this additional information will improve results.
    [BR94] use 12,000 training and 500 test examples.
    A greedy search is used to learn a sequence of 'transformations' which minimise the error rate on training data.
    A transformation is a rule which makes an attachment decision de
