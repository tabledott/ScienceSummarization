e does not work with non-parallel texts, the third clue is useless for the identification of the majority of pairs.
    For unrelated languages, it is not applicable anyway.
    In this situation, Rapp (1995) proposed using a clue different from the three mentioned above: His co-occurrence clue is based on the assumption that there is a correlation between cooccurrence patterns in different languages.
    For example, if the words teacher and school cooccur more often than expected by chance in a corpus of English, then the German translations of teacher and school, Lehrer and Schule, should also co-occur more often than expected in a corpus of German.
    In a feasibility study he showed that this assumption actually holds for the language pair English/German even in the case of unrelated texts.
    When comparing an English and a German co-occurrence matrix of corresponding words, he found a high correlation between the co-occurrence patterns of the two matrices when the rows and columns of both matrices we
