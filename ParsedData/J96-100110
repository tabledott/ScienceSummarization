y are used this way in our work as well.
    Translation can be approached using statistical techniques alone.
    Brown et al. (1990, 1993) use a stochastic language model based on techniques used in speech recognition, combined with translation probabilities compiled on the aligned corpus, to do sentence translation.
    Their system, Candide, uses little linguistic and no semantic information and currently produces good quality translations for short sentences containing high frequency vocabulary as measured by individual human evaluators (see Berger et al. [19941 for information on recent results).
    While they also align groups of words across languages in the process of translation, they are careful to point out that such groups may or may not occur at constituent breaks in the sentence.
    In contrast, our work aims at identifying syntactically and semantically meaningful units, which may be either constituents or flexible word pairs separated by intervening words, and provides the translation of th
