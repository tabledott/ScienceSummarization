methods in some benchmarks (Kre13el, 1998; Hsu and Lin, 2002).
    An input x to an SVM classifier is a feature representation of the word to be classified and its context.
    We use a bit-vector representation, each dimension of which indicates whether the input matches with 4 Named Entity Recognition Using ME a certain feature.
    The following illustrates the well- Model used features for the named entity recognition task.
    The Maximum Entropy method, with which we compare our SVM-based method, defines the probability that the class is c given an input vector x as follows. where Z(x) is a normalization constant, and fi(c, x) is a feature function.
    A feature function is defined in the same way as the features in the SVM learning, except that it includes c in it like f(c, x) = (c is the jth class) &#8743; wi,k(x).
    If x contains previously assigned classes, then the most probable searched by using the Viterbi-type algorithm.
    We use the maximum entropy tagging method described in (Kazama et al
