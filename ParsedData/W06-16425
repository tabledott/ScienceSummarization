    In the next section, we review related work, and Section 3 describes our runtime SA system.
    In Section 4, our assumption for unsupervised learning, context coherency and its key metrics, coherent precision and coherent density are discussed.
    Section 5 describes our unsupervised learning method.
    Experimental results are shown in Section 6, and we conclude in Section 7.
  
  
    Sentiment analysis has been extensively studied in recent years.
    The target of SA in this paper is wider than in previous work.
    For example, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) separated facts from opinions and assigned polarities only to opinions.
    In contrast, our system detects factual polar clauses as well as sentiments.
    Unsupervised learning for sentiment analysis is also being studied.
    For example, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) labeled adjectives as positive or negative, relying on semantic orientation.
    Turney (2002) used collocation with &#8220;excellent&#8221; or &#8220;poor&#8
