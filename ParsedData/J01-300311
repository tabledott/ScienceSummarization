ons, we show that all three hypotheses above are borne out.
    In Section 2, we describe the argument structure distinctions of our three verb classes in more detail.
    In support of the first hypothesis above, we discuss lexical correlates of the underlying differences in thematic assignments that distinguish the three verb classes under investigation.
    In Section 3, we show how to approximate these features by simple syntactic counts, and how to perform these counts on available corpora.
    We confirm the second hypothesis above, by showing that the differences in distribution predicted by the underlying argument structures are largely found in the data.
    In Section 4, in a series of machine learning experiments and a detailed analysis of errors, we confirm the third hypothesis by showing that the differences in the distribution of the extracted features are successfully used for verb classification.
    Section 5 evaluates the significance of these results by comparing the program's accuracy to a
