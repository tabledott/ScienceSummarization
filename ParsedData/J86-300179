nce such as put them away, the pronoun would have to refer deictically, and not anaphorically, to the groceries.
    In this sample discourse, however, D1 is resumed almost immediately.
    The pronoun them in and I put them away cannot refer to the children (the focus space for D2 has been popped from the stack), but only to the groceries.
    For this to be clear to the OCP, the ICP must indicate a return to D1 explicitly.
    One linguistic indicator in this example is the change of mood from imperative.
    Indicators that the stop that utterance is an interruption include the change to imperative mood and the use of the vocative (Polanyi and Scha 1983).
    Two other indicators may be assumed to have been present at the time of the discourse &#8212; a change of intonation (imagine a slightly shrill tone of command with an undercurrent of annoyance) and a shift of gaze (toward and then away from the kids).
    It is also possible that the type of pause present in such cases is evidence of the interruption
