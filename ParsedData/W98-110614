ly preclassified training texts and a few hours of manual filtering to build the intermediate dictionaries.
    Given preclassified texts, it is possible to build a dictionary of conceptual case frames for a new domain in one day.
    Another advantage of our approach is its highly empirical nature; a corpus often reveals important patterns in a domain that are not necessarily intuitive to people.
    By using corpus-based methods to generate all of the intermediate dictionaries and 55 the final case frame structures, the most important words, role assignments, and semantic preferences are less likely to be missed.
    Our empirical approach aims to exploit the text corpus to automatically acquire the syntactic and semantic role assignments that are necessary to achieve good performance in the domain.
  
  
    Conceptual natural language processing typically involves case frame instantiation to recognize events and role objects in text.
    For example, an NLP system designed for a business domain might use
