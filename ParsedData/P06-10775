osed of both terminals (target words) and non-terminals (placeholders).
    An alignment A is defined as a subset of the Cartesian product of source and target symbol positions: 2We use T(&#183;) to denote a parse tree.
    To reduce notational overhead, we use T(z) to represent the parse tree in z.
    Similarly, S(z) denotes the string in z.
    In the following, we formally describe how to introduce tree-to-string alignment templates into probabilistic dependencies to model Pr(ei|fJ1 ) 3.
    In a first step, we introduce the hidden variable T(fJ1 ) that denotes a parse tree of the source senNext, another hidden variable D is introduced to detach the source parse tree T (fJ1 ) into a sequence of K subtrees T 1K with a preorder transversal.
    We assume that each subtree Tk produces a target string 5k.
    As a result, the sequence of subtrees T&#65533;1K produces a sequence of target strings &#65533;5K1 , which can be combined serially to generate the target sentence ei.
    We assume that Pr(e,|D,T(fJ1 )
