eneral the verbs were more difficult than the nouns.
			However, this might just be owing to this particular test sample having more verbs with higher perplexities, and maybe even ones that are indeed difficult to disambiguate ? in spite of highhuman agreement.
			The hope is that better knowledge sources can overcome the gap still existing between the system performance and human agree ment.
			Overall, however, this data indicates that theapproach suggested by (Palmer, 2000) and that is be ing adopted in the ongoing OntoNotes project (Hovyet al, 2006) does result in higher system perfor mance.
			Whether or not the more coarse-grained senses are effective in improving natural language processing applications remains to be seen.
