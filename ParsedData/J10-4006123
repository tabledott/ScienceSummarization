the same way as the manually selected links of Section 6.2.3.
    Simply picking the longest links in the LxW1W2 subspace defined by the example (n, qr) dimensions does not work, because we harvest links that are frequent in general, rather than characteristic of the qualia roles (noun modification, of, etc.).
    For each role r, we construct instead two LxW1W2 subspaces, one positive subspace with the example pairs (n, qr) as unique non-zero dimensions, and a negative subspace with nonzero dimensions corresponding to all (w1,w2) pairs such that w1 is one of the training nominal concepts, and w2 is not a quale qr in the example pairs.
    We then measure the length of each link in both subspaces.
    For example, we measure the length of the obj link in a subspace characterized by (n, qtelic) example pairs, and the length of obj in a subspace characterized by (n, w2) pairs that are probably not Telic examples.
    We compute the pointwise mutual information (PMI) statistic (Church and Hanks 1990) on these le
