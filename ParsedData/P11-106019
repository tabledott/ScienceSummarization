s triggered by x&#8217;s POS tag.
    For GEO, there are 22 prototype words; for JOBS, there are 5.
    Specifying these triggers requires minimal domain-specific supervision.
    Results We first compare our system with Clarke et al. (2010) (henceforth, SEMRESP), which also learns a semantic parser from question-answer pairs.
    Table 2 shows that our system using lexical triggers L (henceforth, DCS) outperforms SEMRESP (78.9% over 73.2%).
    In fact, although neither DCS nor SEMRESP uses logical forms, DCS uses even less supervision than SEMRESP.
    SEMRESP requires a lexicon of 1.42 words per non-value predicate, WordNet features, and syntactic parse trees; DCS requires only words for the domain-independent predicates (overall, around 0.5 words per non-value predicate), POS tags, and very simple indicator features.
    In fact, DCS performs comparably to even the version of SEMRESP trained using logical forms.
    If we add prototype triggers (use L+), the resulting system (DCS+) outperforms both versio
