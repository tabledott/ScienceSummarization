s argument is true, and zero otherwise.
    Assuming these definitions, the algorithm is stated in Figure 2.
    The equations assume a directionality: finding French &amp;quot;target&amp;quot; correspondences for English &amp;quot;source&amp;quot; phrases.
    The algorithm is reversible, by swapping E with F. The model for correspondence is that a source noun phrase in Ei is responsible for producing the various different target noun phrases in Fi with correspondingly different probabilities.
    Two quantities are calculated; C,.
    (s, t) and Pr(s,t).
    Computation proceeds by evaluating Equation (1), Equation (2) and then iteratively applying Equations (3) and (2); r increasing with each successive iteration.
    The argument s refers to the English noun phrase npE(s) having position s in the English index, and the argument t refers to the French noun phrase npF(t) at position t in the French index.
    Equation (1) assumes that each English noun phrase in Ei is initially equally likely to correspond
