he damage this conflation can do is given in figure 7, where one needs to capture the fact that present-tense verbs do not take bare infinitive To allow the finite/non-finite distinction, and other verb distinctions, all with their head tag, merging all finite forms to a sintag In particular, this also accomplished This was extremely bringing the cumulative 85.72%, 2.66% absolute improvement (more than its solo improvement over the baseline). is part of the explanation of why (Charniak, 2000) finds that early generation of head tags as in (Collins, 1999) is so beneficial.
    The rest of the benefit is presumably in the availability of the tags for smoothing purposes.
