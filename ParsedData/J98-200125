he previous section, preliminarily tested the taxonomy by annotating the corpus ourselves, and then asked two annotators to do the same task.
    This first experiment is described in the rest of this section.
    We explain first the classification we developed for this experiment, then the experimental conditions, and, finally, discuss the results.
    The annotation schemes for noun phrases proposed in the literature fall into one of two categories.
    On the one hand, we have what we might call labeling schemes, most typically used by corpus linguists, which involve assigning to each noun phrase a class such as those discussed in the previous section; the schemes used by Fraurud and Prince fall into this category.
    On the other hand, there are what we might call linking schemes, concerned with identifying the links between the discourse entity or entities introduced by a noun phrase and other entities in the discourse; the scheme used in MUC-6 is of this type.
    In our experiments, we tried both a p
