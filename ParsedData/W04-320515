he asymmetric relations, we require not only that exceed a certain threshold, but that there be strong asymmetry of the relation: for symmetric relations.
    Here, hits(S) denotes the number of documents containing the string S, as returned by Google.
    N is the number of words indexed by the search engine is a correction factor to obtain the frequency of the verb V in all tenses from the frequency of the pattern &amp;quot;to V&amp;quot;.
    Based on several verbs, we have estimated = 8.5.
    Because pattern counts, when instantiated with verbs, could not be estimated directly, we have computed the frequencies of the patterns in tagged word corpus and used it to estimate the expected number of hits for each pattern.
    We estimated the a similar method.
    We say that the semantic relation Given a pair of semantic relations from the set we identify, one of three cases can arise: (i) one relation is more specific (strength is more specific than similarity, enablement is more specific than happens-before
