o distinguish sentences used to objectively present factual information from sentences used to present opinions and evaluations.
    There are many applications for which this distinction promises to be important, including text categorization and summarization.
    This research takes a large step toward developing a reliably annotated gold standard to support experimenting with such applications.
    This research is also a case study of analyzing and improving manual tagging that is applicable to any tagging task.
    We perform a statistical analysis that provides information that complements the information provided by Cohen's Kappa (Cohen, 1960; Carletta, 1996).
    In particular, we analyze patterns of agreement to identify systematic disagreements that result from relative bias among judges, because they can potentially be corrected automatically.
    The corrected tags serve two purposes in this work.
    They are used to guide the revision of the coding manual, resulting in improved Kappa scores, an
