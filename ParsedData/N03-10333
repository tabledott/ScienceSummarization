    While modern taggers may be more principled than the classic CLAWS tagger (Marshall, 1987), they are in some respects inferior in their use of lexical information: CLAWS, through its IDIOMTAG module, categorically captured many important, correct taggings of frequent idiomatic word sequences.
    In this work, we incorporate appropriate multiword feature templates so that such facts can be learned and used automatically by 1Rather than subscripting all variables with a position index, we use a hopefully clearer relative notation, where t0 denotes the current position and t_&#8222; and t+&#8222; are left and right context tags, and similarly for words. the bidirectional dependency network. the model.
    Having expressive templates leads to a large number of features, but we show that by suitable use of a prior (i.e., regularization) in the conditional loglinear model &#8211; something not used by previous maximum entropy taggers &#8211; many such features can be added with an overall positive effect o
