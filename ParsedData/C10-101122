est training sets.
			We searched for the reason and found thatthe Hash Kernel provides an overproportional ac curacy gain with less training data compared to MIRA.
			Figure 1 shows the difference between the labeled attachment score of the parser with MIRA and the Hash Kernel for Spanish.
			The decreasing curve shows clearly that the Hash Kernel providesan overproportional accuracy gain with less train ing data compared to the baseline.
			This provides an advantage for small training corpora.However, this is probably not the main rea son for the high improvement, since for languageswith only slightly larger training sets such as Chinese the improvement is much lower and the gra dient at the end of the curve is so that a huge amount of training data would be needed to make the curve reach zero.
	
	
			Current CPUs have up to 12 cores and we will see soon CPUs with more cores.
			Also graphiccards provide many simple cores.
			Parsing algo rithms can use several cores.
			Especially, the tasks to extract th
