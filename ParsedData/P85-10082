 are to be defined primarily in terms of manipulations performed on expressions in the logical notation, the simpler that notation, the easier it will be to define the discourse operations.
    The development of such a logical notation is usually taken to be a very hard problem.
    I believe this is because researchers have imposed upon themselves several additional constraints to adhere to stringent ontological scruples, to explain a number of mysterious syntactic facts as a by-product of the notation, and to encode efficient deduction techniques in the notation.
    Most representational difficulties go away if one rejects these constraints, and there are good reasons for rejecting each of the constraints.
    Ontological scruples: Researchers in philosophy and linguistics have typically restricted themselves to very few (although a strange assortment of) kinds of entities physical objects, numbers, sets, times, possible worlds, propositions, events, and situations and all of these but the first have been
