  SPMT: Statistical Machine Translation With Syntactified Target Language Phrases
  
    We introduce SPMT, a new class of statistical Translation Models that use Syntactified target language Phrases.
    The SPMT models outperform a state of the art phrase-based baseline model by 2.64 Bleu points on the NIST 2003 Chinese-English test corpus and 0.28 points on a humanbased quality metric that ranks translations on a scale from 1 to 5.
  
  
    During the last four years, various implementations and extentions to phrase-based statistical models (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) have led to significant increases in machine translation accuracy.
    Although phrase-based models yield high-quality translations for language pairs that exhibit similar word order, they fail to produce grammatical outputs for language pairs that are syntactically divergent.
    Recent models that exploit syntactic information of the source language (Quirk et al., 2005) have been shown to produce better o
