about previous sisters.The current model differs from all these proposals: it does not use any information about the head sister, but instead includes the category, head word, and head tag of the previous sister, effectively treating it as the head.
    We first trained the original Collins model on a modified versions of the training test from Experiment 1 in which the PPs were split by applying rule (7).
    In a second series of experiments, we tested a range of models that use sister-head dependencies instead of head-head dependencies for different categories.
    We first added sister-head dependencies for NPs (following Collins&#8217;s (1997) original proposal) and then for PPs, which are flat in Negra, and thus similar in structure to NPs (see Section 2.2).
    Then we tested a model in which sister-head relationships are applied to all categories.
    In a third series of experiments, we trained models that use sister-head relationships everywhere except for one category.
    This makes it possible to
