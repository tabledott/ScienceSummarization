ined discourse relations is that it enables us to automatically construct relatively low-noise datasets that can be used for learning.
    For example, by extracting sentence pairs that have the keyword &#8220;But&#8221; at the beginning of the second sentence, as the sentence pair shown in (1), we can automatically collect many examples of CONTRAST relations.
    And by extracting sentences that contain the keyword &#8220;because&#8221;, we can automatically collect many examples of CAUSE-EXPLANATION-EVIDENCE relations.
    As previous research in linguistics (Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Schiffrin, 1987) and computational linguistics (Marcu, 2000) show, some occurrences of &#8220;but&#8221; and &#8220;because&#8221; do not have a discourse function; and others signal other relations than CONTRAST and CAUSE-EXPLANATION.
    So we can expect the examples we extract to be noisy.
    However, empirical work of Marcu (2000) and Carlson et al. (2001) suggests that the majority of occurrences of &#8220;but&#8221;, fo
