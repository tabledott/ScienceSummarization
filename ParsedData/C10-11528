			The first operation is sentence splitting, which wefurther decompose into two subtasks: (i) segmen tation, which decides where and whether to split a sentence and (ii) completion, which makes the new split sentences complete.
			First, we decide where we can split a sentence.
			In our model, the splitting point is judged by the syntactic constituent of the split boundary word in the complex sentence.
			The decision whether a sentence should be split is based on the length of the complex sentence.
			The features used in the segmentation step are shown in Tab.
