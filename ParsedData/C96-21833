plit ication would be of great use.
  This is especially true in dolnains uch as Ina- chine translat ion,  which commonly  have a manual post-processing stage, where semantic  and prag- mat ic  repairs may be &lt;arried out if ne&lt;;essary.
  Parsing: Syntact ical ly  &lt;:omplex sentences arc likely to generate a large number of parses, and may cause parsers to fail altogether.
  Re- solving ambiguit ies in a t tachment  of con- st i tuents is non-tr ivial .
  This ambiguii, y is re- duced for simpler sentences in&lt;e they involve fewer constituents.
  Fhus s impler sentences lead to faster parsing and less parse aml)igu- ity.
  Once the i&gt;arses for the s impler sentences are obtained, the subparses can be assembled to form a full parse, or left as is, depending on the appl icat ion.
  Machine Translat ion (MT): As in the pars- ing case, s impli f ication results in s impler scn- tential  structures and reduced ambiguity.
  As argued in (Chandrasekar,  1994), this conld lead to improvements in the qual
