    Experiments led to the hypothesis that the most improvement came by assigning a boundary if the cue-prosody feature had the value complex, even if the algorithm would not otherwise assign a boundary, as shown in Figure 14.
    See Figure 10 for boundaries assigned by the resulting algorithm (EA, for error analysis).
    Table 6 presents the average IR scores across the narratives in the training set for the NP and EA algorithms.
    The top half of the table reports results for boundaries that at least three subjects agreed upon (T = 3), and the lower half for boundaries using a threshold value of 4 (T = 4), where NP duplicates the figures from Table 4.
    Going by the summed deviations, the overall performance is about the same, although variation around the mean is lower for T =- 4.
    The figures illustrate a typical tradeoff between NP algorithm.
    The test results of EA are, of course, worse than the corresponding training results, particularly f
