 Y/Yi+i &#8226; .. Yi can effectively act as a unit production that links X and Y, if all other nonterminals on the RHS can expand to E. Its contribution to the unit production relation P(X &#8212;&gt; Y,) will then be P(X &#8212;&gt; yiyi+i &#8226; .. y,) ey, koi From the resulting revised Pu matrix we compute the closure Ru as usual.
    The second modification is another instance of spontaneous dot shifting.
    When completing a state X &#8212;&gt; A.Yit and moving the dot to get X &#8212;&gt; AY.it, additional states have to be added, obtained by moving the dot further over any nonterminals in that have nonzero &amp;expansion probability.
    As in prediction, forward and inner probabilities are multiplied by the corresponding &amp;expansion probabilities.
    4.7.4 Eliminating null productions.
    Given these added complications one might consider simply eliminating all &amp;productions in a preprocessing step.
    This is mostly straightforward and analogous to the corresponding procedure for nonproba
