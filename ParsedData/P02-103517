G scheme, and (ii) 500 sentences from the Brown corpus given gold standard annotations by Carroll et al. (1999) according to their dependency relations (DR) scheme.3 Annotating the WSJ test set was bootstrapped by parsing the test sentences using the LFG grammar and also checking for consistency with the Penn Treebank annotation.
    Starting from the (sometimes fragmentary) parser analyses and the Treebank annotations, gold standard parses were created by manual corrections and extensions of the LFG parses.
    Manual corrections were necessary in about half of the cases.
    The average sentence length of the WSJ f-structure bank is 19.8 words; the average number of predicate-argument relations in the goldstandard f-structures is 31.2.
    Performance on the LFG-annotated WSJ test set was measured using both the LFG and DR metrics, thanks to an f-structure-to-DR annotation mapping.
    Performance on the DR-annotated Brown test set was only measured using the DR metric.
    The LFG evaluation metric is base
