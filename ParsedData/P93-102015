they agree on (4 &lt; &lt; 7).
    That agreement on non-boundaries is more probable suggests that the significance of Q owes most to the cases where columns have a majority of l's.
    This assumption is borne out when Q is partitioned into distinct components for each possible value of Ti (0 to 7), based on partioning the sum of squares in the numerator of Q into distinct samples (Cochran, 1950).
    We find that Qi is significant for each distinct Ti &gt; 4 across all narratives.
    For T3=4, .0002 &lt; p &lt; .30 x 10-8; probabilities become more significant for higher levels of T,, and the converse.
    At T1=3, p is sometimes above our significance level of .01, depending on the narrative.
  
  
    We have shown that an atheoretical notion of speaker intention is understood sufficiently uniformly by naive subjects to yield significant agreement across subjects on segment boundaries in a corpus of oral narratives.
    We obtained high levels of percent agreement on boundaries as well as on nonboundarie
