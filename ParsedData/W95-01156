 Lexicon Evaluation (BiBLE, described below).
    BiBLE assigned a score for each model, and these scores were used to compare the effectiveness of various filter cascades.
    As shown in Figure 1, the only independent variable in the framework is the cascade of filters used on the translation candidates generated by each sentence pair, while the only dependent variable is a numerical score.
    Since the filters only serve to remove certain translation candidates, any number of filters can be used in sequence.
    This arrangement allows for fair comparison of different filter combinations.
  
  
    Translation lexicon quality has traditionally been measured on two axes: precision and recall.
    Recall is the fraction of the source language's vocabulary that appears in the lexicon.
    Precision is the fraction of lexicon entries that are correct.
    While the true size of the source vocabulary is usually unknown, recall can be estimated using a representative text sample by computing the fraction of wor
