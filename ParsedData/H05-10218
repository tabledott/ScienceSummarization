p probability ?1(x, u) = P (b = +1|x, u) associated with each phrase-pair (x, u) in the phrase-pair inventory.
			This is the probability that the phrase-pair (x, u) appears out of order in the transformed phrase sequence.We now describe the MJ-1 WFST.
			In the presentation, we use upper-case letters to denote the En glish phrases (uk) and lower-case letters to denote the French phrases (xk and yk).
			The PPI for this example is given in Table 1.

			The input to the WFST (Fig 4) is a lattice of French phrase sequences derived from the Frenchsentence to be translated.
			The outputs are the cor responding English phrase sequences.
			Note that the reordering is performed on the English side.
			The WFST is constructed by adding a self-loop for each French phrase in the input lattice, and a 2-arc path for every pair
