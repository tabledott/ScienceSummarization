 the baseline system started looking for its holder and topic.
    For holder and topic identification, we applied the same baseline algorithm as described in Subsection 4.1 to Testset 2.
    Result: Note that Testset 1 was collected from sentences of opinion-related frames in FrameNet and therefore all sentences in the set contained either opinion-bearing verb or adjective.
    (i.e.
    All sentences are opinion-bearing) However, sentences in Testset 2 were randomly collected from online news media pages and therefore not all of them are opinion-bearing.
    We first evaluated the task of opinion-bearing sentence identification.
    Table 5 shows the system results.
    When we mark all sentences as opinion-bearing, it achieved 43% and 38% of accuracy for the annotation result of Human1 and Human2 respectively.
    Our system performance (64% and 55%) is comparable with the unique assignment.
    We measured the holder and topic identification system with precision, recall, and F-score.
    As we can see fr
