    Bourigault claims that the grammar can parse &amp;quot;around 95% of the maximal length noun phrases&amp;quot; in a test corpus into possible terminological phrases, which then require manual validation.
    However, because its goal is terminological phrases, it appears that this system ignores NP chunk-initial determiners and other initial prenominal modifiers, somewhat simplifying the parsing task.
    Voutilainen (1993), in his impressive NPtool system, uses an approach that is in some ways similar to the one used here, in that he adds to his part-of-speech tags a new kind of tag that shows chunk structure; the chunk tag &amp;quot;&#169;&gt;N&amp;quot;, for example, is used for determiners and premodifiers, both of which group with the following noun head.
    He uses a lexicon that lists
