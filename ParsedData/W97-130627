a that do not fall under the purview of rules 1 through 7 and their refinements.
    If this is correct, then the introduction of better world knowledge sources will help in the recall of the system rather than the precision.
    Ultimately, the utility of CogNIAC is a function of how it performs.
    The high precision rules of CogNIAC performed very well, greater than 90% precision with good recall for the first experiment.
    In the second experiment, components other than the rules of CogNIAC began to degrade the performance of the system unduly.
    But there is promise in the high precision core of CogNIAC across varied domains.
  
  
    CogNIAC is currently the common noun and pronoun resolution component of the University of Pennsylvania's coreference resolution software and general NLP software (Camp).
    This paper does not address the common noun coreference aspects of the system but there are some interesting parallels with pronominal coreference.
    Some changes planned include the following
