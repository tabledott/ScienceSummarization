ented an approach to collective information extraction that uses Relational Markov Networks to reason about the mutual influences between multiple extractions.
    A new type of clique template &#8212; the logical OR template &#8212; was introduced, allowing a variable number of relevant entities to be used by other clique templates.
    Soft correlations between repetitions and acronyms and their long form in the same document have been captured by global clique templates, allowing for local extraction decisions to propagate and mutually influence each other.
    Regarding future work, a richer set of features for the local templates would likely improve performance.
    Currently, LT-RMN's accuracy is still significantly less than CRF's, which limits the performance of the full system.
    Another limitation is the approximate inference used by both RMN methods.
    The number of factor graphs for which the sum-product algorithm did not converge was non-negligible, and our approach stopped after a fix numbe
