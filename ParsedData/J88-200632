st be the case that 13(Ci3b,TF,RTi3b).
    Assume the listener takes p to be Pconseq on the basis of world knowledge&#8212;that is, 13conseq(C13b,TF,RTi3b).
    Since the tense of (13b) is simple past, its RT and ET coincide.
    Thus (13b) specifies a new entity Eb, located within the consequent phase of the TF&#8212;that is, Ea&#8212;and hence after it.
    I assume that, following the computation of the anaphoric function, TF becomes associated with the event entity located at RTb.
    In this case, it is Eb, and TF thereby moves forward (cf.
    Figure 9).
    As noted, this is the gradual forward movement of simple narratives that Hinrichs, Now Clause 15c is the same as (13b), and TF is the same as it was at the point of interpreting (13b).
    Thus not surprisingly, 15c produces the same change in E/S Now structure and in the TF as (13b), resulting in the diagram shown in Figure 11.
    To illustrate the effect of discourse structure on TF, consider the following variation on Example 15, which had the s
