;Shift&#8221;, since they do not modify the parse tree.
    Nevertheless, the score serves as a reference for the effect of additional features in the combined parser.
    Using both transition-based features and graphbased features from the MSTParser (&#8220;Combined [TM]&#8221;), the combined parser achieved 92.0% perword accuracy, which is significantly higher than the pure graph-based and transition-based parsers.
    Additional graph-based features further improved the accuracy to 92.1%/45.5%, which is the best among all the parsers compared.1 We use the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) 5 for experimental data.
    Following Duan et al. (2007), we 1A recent paper, Koo et al.
    (2008) reported parent-prediction accuracy of 92.0% using a graph-based parser with a different (larger) set of features (Carreras, 2007).
    By applying separate word cluster information, Koo et al. (2008) improved the accuracy to 93.2%, which is the best known accuracy on the PTB data.
    We excluded these from Table 5 because our
