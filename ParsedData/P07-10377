    Coming right up to date, (Marcu et al., 2006) The bidirectional word alignment is used to obtain demonstrate that &#8216;syntactified&#8217; target language phrase translation pairs using heuristics presented in phrases can improve translation quality for Chinese&#8211; 289 2http://www.fjoch.com/GIZA++.html (Och &amp; Ney, 2003) and (Koehn et al., 2003), and the Moses decoder was used for phrase extraction and decoding.3 Let t and s be the target and source language sentences respectively.
    Any (target or source) sentence x will consist of two parts: a bag of elements (words/phrases etc.) and an order over that bag.
    In other words, x = (0x&#65533; Ox), where 0x stands for the bag of phrases that constitute x, and Ox for the order of the phrases as given in x (Ox can be implemented as a function from a bag of tokens 0x to a
