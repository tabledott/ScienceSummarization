zzo (1980).
    This uniform method of specifying grammar transformations is similar to, but clearer than, similar techniques used with covering grammars (Nijholt 1980; Leermakers 1989).
  
  
    The previous work in this area is extensive, including work in deductive parsing, work in statistical parsing, and work in the combination of formal language theory and algebra.
    This paper can be thought of as synthetic, combining the work in all three areas, although in the course of synthesis, several general formulas have been found, most notably the general formula for reverse values.
    A comprehensive examination of all three areas is beyond the scope of this paper, but we can touch on a few significant areas of each.
    First, there is the work in deductive parsing.
    This work in some sense dates back to Earley (1970), in which the use of items in parsers is introduced.
    More recent work (Pereira and Warren 1983; Pereira and Shieber 1987) demonstrates how to use deduction engines for parsing.
