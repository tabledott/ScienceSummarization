ain the results shown in Table 7.
    (The computation time for loading the WordNet was excluded since it need be done only once.)
    Even though the noun taxonomy of WordNet is a large thesaurus containing approximately 50,000 nodes, our method still manages to efficiently generalize case slots using it.
    The table also shows the average number of levels generalized for each slot, namely, the average number of links between a node in the starting cut and its ancestor node in the resulting cut.
    (For example, the number of levels generalized for (plant...) is one in Figure 9.)
    One can see that a significant amount of generalization is performed by our method&#8212;the resulting tree cut is about 5 levels higher than the starting cut, on the average.
    Case frame patterns obtained by our method can be used in various tasks in natural language processing.
    In this paper, we test its effectiveness in a structural (PPattachment) disambiguation experiment.
