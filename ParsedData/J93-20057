culus, type coercion can be seen as transforming a monomorphic language into one with polymorphic types (cf.
    Cardelli and Wegner 1985).
    Argument, event, and qualia types must conform to the well-formedness conditions defined by the type system defined by the lexical inheritance structure when undergoing operations of semantic composition.'
    One component of this approach, the qualia structure, specifies the different aspects of a word's meaning through the use of subtyping.
    These include the subtypes CONSTITUTIVE, FORMAL, TELIC, and AGENTIVE.
    To illustrate how these are used, the qualia structure for book is given below.2 This structured representation allows one to use the same lexical entry in different contexts, where the word refers to different qualia of the noun's denotation.
    For example, the sentences in (1)&#8212;(3) below refer to different aspects (or qualia) of the general meaning of book.3 Example 1 This book weighs four ounces.
    Example 2 John finished a book.
