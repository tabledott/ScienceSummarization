    The gain from interpolation with a triangulated model is roughly equivalent to having twice as much training data.
    Finally, notice that triangulation may benefit when the sentences in each bitext are drawn from the same source, in that there are no unseen &#8216;intermediate&#8217; phrases, and therefore (1) can be easily evaluated.
    We investigate this by examining the robustness of our method in the face of disjoint bitexts.
    The concepts contained in each bitext will be more varied, potentially leading to better coverage of the target language.
    In lieu of a study on different domain bitexts which we plan for the future, we bisected the Europarl corpus for fr &#8594; en, triangulating with Spanish.
    The triangulated models were presented with fr-es and es-en bitexts drawn from either the same half of the corpus or from different halves, resulting in scores of 28.37 and 28.13, respectively.5 These results indicate that triangulation is effective for disjoint bitexts, although ideally
