r surface is far less complex than one might expect based on the huge number of alternative translation candidates that are represented in the lattice and thus contribute to the error surface.
    In fact, this result is a consequence of using a log-linear model which constrains how costs (or scores, respectively) can evolve due to hypothesis expansion.
    If instead quadratic cost functions were used, the size of the envelopes could not be limited in the same way.
    The above theorem does not, however, provide any additional guidance that would help to choose more promising directions in the line optimization algorithm to find better local optima.
    To alleviate this problem, the following section lists some best practices that we found to be useful in the context of MERT.
  
  
    This section addresses some techniques that we found to be beneficial in order to improve the performance of MERT. function weights by defining weights restrictions.
    The weight restriction for a feature function hm is sp
