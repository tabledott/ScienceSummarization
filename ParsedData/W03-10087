ollins, 1999).
    We then look for the label of the CCG relation between this head word and the verb itself.
  
  
    In previous work using the PropBank corpus, Gildea and Palmer (2002) developed a system to predict semantic roles from sentences and their parse trees as determined by the statistical parser of Collins (1999).
    We will briefly review their probability model before adapting the system to incorporate features from the CCG derivations.
    For the Treebank-based system, we use the probability model of Gildea and Palmer (2002).
    Probabilities of a parse constituent belonging to a given semantic role are calculated from the following features: The phrase type feature indicates the syntactic type of the phrase expressing the semantic roles: examples include noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP) , and clause (S).
    The parse tree path feature is designed to capture the syntactic relation of a constituent to the predicate.
    It is defined as the path from the predicate through the parse tree
