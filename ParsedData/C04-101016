		2.
			Labeled attachment score (LAS): The pro-.
			portion of words that are assigned the correct head and dependency type (or no head if the word is a root) (Nivre et al, 2004).
			3.
			Dependency accuracy (DA): The proportion.
			of non-root words that are assigned the correct head (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003).
			4.
			Root accuracy (RA): The proportion of root.
			words that are analyzed as such (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003).
	
	
			sentences whose unlabeled dependency structure is completely correct (Yamada and Mat sumoto, 2003).
			All metrics except CM are calculated as meanscores per word, and punctuation tokens are con sistently excluded.Table 1 shows the attachment score, both unla beled and labeled, for the two different state models with the two different label sets.
			First of all, we see that Model 1 gives better accuracy than Model 2 with the smaller label set G, which confirms our expectations that the added part-of-speech featuresare helpful when the dependency labels are less informative.
