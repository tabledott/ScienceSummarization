via anaphora.
    That is, decomposition adds very little to the categorial information available from the right conjunct, except to make the syntactic types yield an S. The real work is done in the semantics.
    Because the derivation is not a tree anymore, and the decomposed constituents do not correspond to actual constituents in the surface string, this analysis is difficult to represent in a treebank.
    The 107 sentences that contain sentential gapping are therefore omitted in the current version of CCGbank, even though special coordination rules that mimic the decomposition analysis are conceivable.
    Besides the cases discussed herein, the Treebank contains further kinds of null elements, all of which the algorithm ignores.
    The null element *ICH* (&#8220;Insert Constituent Here&#8221;), which appears 1,240 times, is used for extraposition of modifiers.
    Like ellipsis, this is a case of a semantic dependency which we believe to be anaphoric, and therefore not reflected in the syntactic categ
