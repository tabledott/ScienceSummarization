th sample human ratings, such as using a SVM as was done in PEM.
    We quantified the utility of our highly parallel data by computing the correlation between BLEU and human ratings when different numbers of references were available.
    The results are shown in Figure 4.
    As the number of references increases, the correlation with human ratings also increases.
    The graph also shows the effect of adding the source sentence as a reference.
    If our goal is to assess semantic equivalence only, then it is better to include the source sentence.
    If we are trying to assess the overall quality of the paraphrase, it is better to exclude the source sentence, since otherwise the metric will tend to favor paraphrases that introduce fewer changes.
    In addition to collecting paraphrases through video annotations, we also experimented with the more traditional task of presenting a sentence to an annotator and explicitly asking for a paraphrase.
    We randomly selected a thousand sentences from our data an
