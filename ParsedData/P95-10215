d annotate nodes with lexemes and arcs with grammatical function. by distinguishing between the adjunction of modifiers and of clausal complements.
    This gives us the derivation structure shown on the right in Figure 1.
    While this might provide a satisfactory treatment of modification at the derivation level, there are now three types of operations (two adjunctions and substitution) for two types of dependencies (arguments and modifiers), and the directionality problem for embedded clauses remains unsolved. defining have attempted to resolve these problems with the use of a single operation (that we call subsertion) for handling all complementation and a second operation (called sisteradjunction) for modification.
    Before discussion these operations further we consider a second problem with TAG that has implications for the design of these new composition operations (in particular, subsertion).
    1.2 Problematic Constructions for TAG be used to provide suitable analyses for certain syntactic pheno
