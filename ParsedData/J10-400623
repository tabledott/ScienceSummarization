cted from the corpus to be arranged (and that it shares with traditional structured DSMs).
    We then show how a weighted tuple structure can be represented, in linear algebraic terms, as a labeled third-order tensor.
    Finally, we derive different semantic vector spaces from the tensor by the operation of labeled tensor matricization.
    Relations among entities can be represented by ternary tuples, or triples.
    Let O1 and O2 be two sets of objects, and R &#8838; O1 x O2 a set of relations between these objects.
    A triple (o1, r, o2) expresses the fact that o1 is linked to o2 through the relation r. DM (like previous structured DSMs) includes tuples of a particular type, namely, weighted distributional tuples that encode distributional facts in terms of typed co-occurrence relations among words.
    Let W1 and W2 be sets of strings representing content words, and L a set of strings representing syntagmatic co-occurrence links between words in a text.
    T C_ W1 x L x W2 is a set of corpus-derived
