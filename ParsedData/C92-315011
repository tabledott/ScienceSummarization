uctures of the terminological units, representing out of context, in a terminology, the concepts of a subject field, are to be placed on two different organisational levels.
  It is thus advisable to dissociate these two analysis, though using the results of one for the other.
  Since the terminological unit, as its name suggests, is always a semantic unit, which is at the basis of its status (cf ?1), it should be treated as such on the syntactic level as well.
  This makes it possible to envisage a text analysis in two phases, the first identifying terminological units, the second using these results to analyse the sentences syntactically, with the view to constructing a semantic representation.
  This is the principle which we intend to adopt o make LEXTER a text analysis tool to aid knowledge acquisit ion (cf [Bourigault 1992a]).
  5) An experimental approach to work out rules of analysis To analyse texts, LEXTER uses an analysis rule base which detects frontier markers.
  Some of these rules are simple :
