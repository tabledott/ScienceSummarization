o words (synonymy, antonymy, etc.) is mapped by OPINE to a neighborhood feature.
			Thismapping allows OPINE to use simultaneously use multi ple independent sources of constraints on the label of aparticular word.
			In the following, we formalize this map ping.Let T denote the type of a word relationship in R (syn onym, antonym, etc.) and let Ak,T represent the labelsassigned by Ak to neighbors of a word w which are con nected to w through a relationship of type T . We have Ak = ? T Ak,T and P (l(w) = L|Ak)(m) = P (l(w) = L| [ T Ak,T )(m) For each relationship type T , OPINE defines a neighborhood feature fT (w,L,Ak,T ) which computes P (l(w) = L|Ak,T ), the probability that w?s label is L given Ak,T (see below).
			P (l(w) = L| ? T Ak,T )(m) isestimated combining the information from various fea tures about w?s label using the sigmoid function ?(): 343 P (l(w) = L|Ak)(m) = ?( jX i=1 f i(w,L,Ak,i)(m) ? ci) where c0, ...cj are weights whose sum is 1 and which reflect OPINE ?s confidence in each type of featur
