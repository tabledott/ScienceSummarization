n be achieved between human annotators labeling the subjectivity of senses.
    When uncertain cases are removed, the r. value is even higher (0.90).
    Moreover, the automatic subjectivity scoring mechanism that we devised was able to successfully assign subjectivity labels to senses, significantly outperforming an &#8220;informed&#8221; baseline associated with the task.
    While much work remains to be done, this first attempt has proved the feasibility of correctly assigning subjectivity labels to the fine-grained level of word senses.
    The second question was also positively answered: the quality of a word sense disambiguation system can be improved with the addition of subjectivity information.
    Section 5 provided evidence that automatic subjectivity classification may improve word sense disambiguation performance, but mainly for words with both subjective and objective senses.
    As we saw, performance may even degrade for words that do not.
