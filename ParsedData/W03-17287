 the two taggers.
    The Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) has been successfully used in some tagging problems.
    MEMM models are capable of utilizing a large set of features that generative models cannot use.
    On the other hand, MEMM approaches scan the input incrementally as generative models do.
    The Maximum Entropy Markov Model used in POS-tagging is described in detail in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and the LMR tagger here uses the same probability model.
    The probability model is defined over , where is the set of possible contexts or &#8221;histories&#8221; and is the set of possible tags.
    The model&#8217;s joint probability of a history and a tag is defined as where is a normalization constant, are the model parameters and are known as features, where .
    Each feature has a corresponding parameter , that effectively serves as a &#8221;weight&#8221; of this feature.
    In the training process, given a sequence of characters and their LMR tags as training data, the purpose is to determine t
