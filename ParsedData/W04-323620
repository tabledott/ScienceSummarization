unsegmented test sentences as input to the program.
    Figure 5 shows the word segmentation Fmeasure, while Figure 6 shows the POS tagging accuracy achieved by this approach.
    With an allat-once, character-based approach, an average word segmentation F-measure of 95.2% and an average POS tagging accuracy of 91.9% was achieved.
    The average training timing was 3 hours, while testing took about 20 minutes.
    There is a slight improvement in word segmentation and POS tagging accuracy using this approach, compared to the one-at-a-time, character-based approach.
    When a paired t-test was carried out at the level of significance 0.01, the all-at-once approach was found to be significantly better than the one-at-a-time approach for POS tagging accuracy, although the difference was insignificant for word segmentation.
    However, the time required for training and testing is increased significantly for the all-atonce approach.
    When efficiency is a major consideration, or if high quality hand-segmente
