 be more complicated, typically containing an increased number of nonterminals and productions.
    Thus, we create a mapping function for length := 2 to n for start := I to n &#8212; length + I such that P L R add P to Chart[length][start]; from each first pass nonterminal to a set of second pass nonterminals, and threshold out those second pass nonterminals that map from low-scoring first pass nonterminals.
    We call this mapping function the descendants function.2 There are many possible examples of first and second pass combinations.
    For instance, the first pass could use regular nonterminals, such as NP and VP and the second pass could use nonterminals augmented with head-word information.
    The descendants function then appends the possible head words to the first pass nonterminals to get the second pass ones.
    Even though the correspondence between forward/backward and inside/outside probabilities is very close, there are important differences between speech-recognition HMMs and natural-lang
