  Semantic Taxonomy Induction From Heterogenous Evidence
  
    We propose a novel algorithm for inducing semantic taxonomies.
    Previous algorithms for taxonomy induction have typically focused on independent classifiers for discovering new single relationships based on hand-constructed or automatically discovered textual patterns.
    By contrast, our algorithm flexibly incorporates evidence from multiple classifiers over heterogenous relationships to optimize the entire structure of the taxonomy, using knowledge of a word&#8217;s coordinate terms to help in determining its hypernyms, and vice versa.
    We apply our algorithm on the problem of sense-disambiguated noun hyponym acquisition, where we combine the predictions of hypernym and coordinate term classifiers with the knowledge in a preexisting semantaxonomy (WordNet 2.1).
    We add to WordNet 2.1 at a relaerror reduction of a non-joint algorithm using the same component classifiers.
    Finally, we show that a taxonomy built using our algorithm s
