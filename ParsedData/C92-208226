t loosening shown in the Groliers experiment indicates.
  A more savvy grammar for the constituent analyzer should also in- crease the results.
  3.2 Automatic Updating The question arises as to how to automatically in- sert relations between terms into the hierarchy.
  This involves two main difficulties.
  First, if both lexical expressions are present in the noun hierarchy but one or both }lave more than one sense, the algorithm ust decide which senses to link together.
  We have prelim- inary ideas as to how to work around this problem.
  Say the hyponym in question has only one sense, but the hypernym has several.
  Then the task is simplified to determining which sense of the hypernym to link the hypouym to.
  We can then make use of a lexical disambiguation algorithm, e.g., (Hearst 1991), to de- termine which sense of the hypernym is being used iu the sample sentence.
  Furthermore, since weve assumed the hyponym has only one main sense we could do tile following: Look through a corpus for occurrences
