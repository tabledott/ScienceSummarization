y gives trees of phrase type categories.
    The sentence in Figure 4 is one example of how the change in annotation style of Treebank-2 can affect this level of representation; the earlier style assigned the word him an NP node directly under the VP of expect.
    The most common values of the path feature, along with interpretations, are shown in Table 2.
    For the purposes of choosing a frame element label for a constituent, the path feature is similar to the gov feature defined above.
    Because the path captures more information than the governing category, it may be more susceptible to parser errors and data sparseness.
    As an indication of this, our path feature takes on a total of 2,978 possible values in the training data when frame elements with no matching Example of target word renting in a small clause. parse constituent are not counted and 4,086 possible values when paths are found to the best-matching constituent in these cases.
    The governing-category feature, on the other hand, which
