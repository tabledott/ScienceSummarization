ure 2.
    In both texts, the same set of words correlate with debenture closely.
    WoRM plots of debentures and administration are shown in Figures 3 and 4 respectively.
    The horizontal axis has 307 points representing the seed words, the vertical axis has the value of the correlation scores between these 307 seed words and our example words.
    These figures show that WoRMs of the same words are similar to each other, but WoRMs are different between different words.
  
  
    When all unknown words are represented in WoRMs, a matching function is needed to find the best WoRM pairs as bilingual lexicon entries.
    There are many metrics we can use to measure the closeness of two WoRMs.
    When matching vectors are very similar such as those in the WSJ English/English corpus, a simple metric like the Euclidean Distance could be used to find those matching pairs: However, most word pairs in truly non-parallel bilingual corpus are less similar than those in Figure 3.
    The y value of a new word is hig
