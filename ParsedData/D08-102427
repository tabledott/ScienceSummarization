a data-driven framework by incorporating source-side syntactic analysis in the form of soft syntactic constraints.
    This work joins a growing body of work demonstrating the utility of syntactic information in statistical MT.
    In the area of source-side syntax, recent research has continued to improve tree-to-string translation models, soften the constraints of the input tree in various ways (Mi et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008), and extend phrase-based translation with sourceside soft syntactic constraints (Cherry, 2008).
    All this work shows strong promise, but Marton and Resnik&#8217;s soft syntactic constraint approach is particularly appealing because it can be used unobtrusively with any hierarchically-structured translation model.
    Here, we have shown that using MIRA to weight all the constraints at once removes the crucial drawback of the approach, the problem of feature selection.
    Finally, we have introduced novel structural distortion features to fill a notable gap in the hierarchical
