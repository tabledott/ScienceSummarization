 following, Bik refers to the kth element of Bi in ascending order.
    The inverted alignments BI0 are a different way to represent normal alignments aJ1.
    The set B0 contains the positions of all source words that are aligned with the empty word.
    Fertility-based alignment models use the following decomposition and assumptions:2 As might be seen from this equation, we have tacitly assumed that the set B0 of words aligned with the empty word is generated only after the nonempty positions have We obtain an (inverted) zero-order alignment model p(j  |i, J).
    &#8226; In Model 4, every word is dependent on the previous aligned word and on the word classes of the surrounding words.
    First, we describe the dependence of alignment positions.
    (The dependence on word classes is for now ignored and will be introduced later.)
    We have two (inverted) first-order alignment models: p=1(&#8710;j  |&#183; &#183; &#183;) and p&gt;1(&#8710;j  |&#183; &#183; &#183;).
