ely checked for inter-annotator agreement.
    ITA scores below 90% lead to a revision and clarification of the groupings by the linguist.
    It is only after the groupings have passed the ITA hurdle that each individual group is linked to a conceptual node in the ontology.
    In addition to higher accuracy, we find at least a threefold increase in annotator productivity.
    As part of OntoNotes we are annotating the most frequent noun and verb senses in a 300K subset of the PropBank, and will have this data available for release in early 2007.
    Our initial goal is to annotate the 700 most frequently occurring verbs in our data, which are typically also the most polysemous; so far 300 verbs have been grouped and 150 double annotated.
    Subcategorization frames and semantic classes of arguments play major roles in determining the groupings, as illustrated by the grouping for the 22 WN 2.1 senses for drive in Figure 2.
    In addition to improved annotator productivity and accuracy, we predict a corresp
