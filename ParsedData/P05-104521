    Chieu and Ng (2002) propose a solution to this problem: for each token, they define additional features taken from other occurrences of the same token in the document.
    This approach has the added advantage of allowing the training procedure to automatically learn good weightings for these &#8220;global&#8221; features relative to the local ones.
    However, this approach cannot easily be extended to incorporate other types of non-local structure.
    The most relevant prior works are Bunescu and Mooney (2004), who use a Relational Markov Network (RMN) (Taskar et al., 2002) to explicitly models long-distance dependencies, and Sutton and McCallum (2004), who introduce skip-chain CRFs, which maintain the underlying CRF sequence model (which (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) lack) while adding skip edges between distant nodes.
    Unfortunately, in the RMN model, the dependencies must be defined in the model structure before doing any inference, and so the authors use crude heuristic part-of-speech patte
