 the choice of models that populate the pyramid.
    We conducted three experiments to locate the point at which scores stabilize across our three datasets.
    Each experiment supports the same conclusion, thus reinforcing the validity of the result.
    Our first step in investigating score variability was to examine all pairs of summaries where the difference in scores for an order 9 pyramid was greater than 0.1; there were 68 such pairs out of 135 total.
    All such pairs exhibit the same pattern illustrated in Figure 3 for two summaries we call &#8217;b&#8217; and &#8217;q&#8217;.
    The x-axis on the plot shows how many summaries were used in the pyramid and the y-axis shows the min, max and average score scores for the summaries for a given order of pyramid, 6 Of the two, &#8217;b&#8217; has the higher score for the order 9 pyramid, and is perceivably more informative.
    Averaging over all order1 pyramids, the score of &#8217;b&#8217; is higher than &#8217;q&#8217; but some individual order-1 pyram
