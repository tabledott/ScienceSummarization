illustrates how the force semantic component of a verb can also be used to extend its meaning so that one can infer a causation of accompanied motion.
    Depending on the particular syntactic frame in which they appear, members of this intersective class (pull, push, shove, tug, kick, draw, yank) * can be used to exemplify any one (or more) of the the component Levin classes. for each Levin verb class is not always complete, so to check if a particular verb belongs to a class it is better to check that the verb exhibits all the alternations that define the class.
    Since intersective classes were built using membership lists rather than the set of defining alternations, they were similarly incomplete.
    This is an obvious shortcoming of the current implementation of intersective classes, and might affect the choice of 3 as a relevance cut-off in later implementations.
    (verb of exerting force, no separation or causation of accompanied motion implied) Although the Levin classes that make up an intersec
