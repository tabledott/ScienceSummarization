re us- ing wider context of up to 50 words away [5,6,7,12].
  Due to the large number of variables involved, we shall not at- tempt o compare these directly.
  Our results are encouraging, however, and and we plan to conduct amore formal compari- son of the "bag of words" approaches relative to our separate modeling of local collocation types.
  We will also consider ad- ditional collocation types covering awider range of syntactic relationships.
  In addition, we hope to incorporate class-based techniques, uch as the modeling of verb-argument selectional preferences [Resnik, 1992], as a mechanism for achieving im- proved performance on unfamiliar collocations.
  CONCLUSION This paper has examined some of the basic distributional prop- erties of lexical ambiguity in the English language.
  Our ex- periments have shown that for several definitions of sense and collocation, an ambiguous word has only one sense in a given collocation with a probability of 90-99%.
  We showed how this claim is influenced by part-
