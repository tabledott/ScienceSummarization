s).
    In such situations the standard quality control mechanisms are not directly applicable, and the detection of errors requires either costly manual verification at the end of the acquisition process, or more complex and creative solutions integrating HITs for quality check.
    Most of the approaches to content generation proposed so far rely on post hoc verification to filter out undesired low-quality data (Mrozinski et al., 2008; Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2009; Wang and Callison-Burch, 2010).
    The few solutions integrating validation HITs address the translation of single sentences, a task that is substantially different from ours (Negri and Mehdad, 2010; Bloodgood and Callison-Burch, 2010).
    Compared to sentence translation, the task of creating CLTE pairs is both harder to explain without recurring to notions that are difficult to understand to non-experts (e.g.
    &#8220;semantic equivalence&#8221;, &#8220;unidirectional entailment&#8221;), and harder to execute without mastering these notio
