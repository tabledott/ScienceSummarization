 its component words.
    For example, the sentence John de Fido should have a higher probability of aligning with the sentence Jean a mange Fido than with the sentence Fido a mange Jean.
    However, modeling word order under translation is notoriously difficult (Brown ei al., 1993), and it is unclear how much improvement in accuracy a good model of word order would provide.
    Hence, we model word order using a uniform distribution; we take where the sum ranges over beadings B consistent with the sentence bead.
    We use an analogous equation for 1:2 sentence beads. where B ranges over beadings consistent with [E; F] and 1(B) denotes the number of beads in B.
    Recall that n is the length of the English sentence and in is the length of the French sentence.
    2.3 The Complete Translation Model In this section, we extend the translation model to other types of sentence beads.
    For simplicity, we only consider sentence beads consisting of one English sentence, one French sentence, one English sentence
