 and 300 sentences, respectively.
    The first pair was primarily used to develop the algorithm and to determine the various parameters of the program.
    The performance of the algorithm was finally tested on the latter pair of articles.
    We chose these journals because of a general impression that the translations were of very high quality and were sufficiently &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; to be a substantial challenge for the algorithm.
    Furthermore, we expected technical translators to adhere to a narrow view of semantic accuracy in their work, and to rate the importance of this above stylistic considerations.
    Later we also give results for another application of our algorithm to a larger text of 1257 sentences that was put together from two days from the French&#8212;English Hansard corpus.
    Table 1 shows the first 50 entries of the WAT after pass 1 of the algorithm.
    It shows part of the first section of the WAT (lines 1-23) and the beginning of the second (lines 24-50).
