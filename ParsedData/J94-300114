output.
    When the first tape contains the input, the machine models the generative application of the rule; when the second tape contains the input, it models the inversion of the rule.
    Thus, compared with the rewriting rules from which they are derived, finite-state transducers have the obvious advantage of formal and computational simplicity.
    Whereas the exact procedure for inverting rules themselves is not obvious, it is clearly different from the procedure required for generating.
    The corresponding transducers, on the other hand, have the same straightforward interpretation in both directions.
    While finite-state transducers are attractive for their formal simplicity, they have a much more important advantage for our purposes.
    A pair of transducers connected through a common tape models the composition of the relations that those transducers represent.
    The pair can be regarded as performing a transduction between the outer tapes, and it turns out that a single finite-state transd
