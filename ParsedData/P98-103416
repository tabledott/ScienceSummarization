    For all experiments, we derived the training, pruning, and testing sets from the 25 sections of Wall Street Journal distributed with the Penn Treebank II.
    All experiments employ 5-fold cross validation.
    More specifically, in each of five runs, a different fold is used for testing the final, pruned rule set; three of the remaining folds comprise the training corpus (to create the initial rule set); and the final partition is the pruning corpus (to prune bad rules from the initial rule set).
    All results are averages across the five folds.
    Performance is measured in terms of precision and recall.
    Precision was described earlier &#8212; it is a standard measure of accuracy.
    Recall, on the other hand, is an attempt to measure coverage: Throughout the table, we see the effects of base NP complexity &#8212; the base NPs of the R&amp;M corpus are substantially more difficult for our approach to identify than the simpler NPs of the Empire corpus.
    For the R&amp;M corpus, we lag the bes
