    3 External vs. Internal Annotation The two major previous annotation strategies, parent annotation and head lexicalization, can be seen as instances of external and internal annotation, respectively.
    Parent annotation lets us indicate an important feature of the external environment of a node which influences the internal expansion of that node.
    On the other hand, lexicalization is a (radical) method of marking a distinctive aspect of the otherwise hidden internal contents of a node which influence the external distribution.
    Both kinds of annotation can be useful.
    To identify split states, we suffixes of the form mark internal content and mark external features.
    To illustrate the difference, consider unary productions.
    In the raw grammar, there are many unaries, and once any major category is constructed over a span, most others become constructible as well using unary chains (see Klein and Manning (2001) for discussion).
    Such chains are rare in real treebank tr
