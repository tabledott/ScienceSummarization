 hyponym of Vogel (bird).
    Meronymy ('has-a'), the part-whole relation, holds only for nouns and is subdivided into three relations in WordNet (componentrelation, member-relation, stuff-relation).
    GermaNet, however, currently assumes only one basic meronymy relation.
    An example for meronytny is Arm (arm) standing in the naeronymy relation to Korper (body).
    For verbs, WordNet makes the assumption that the relation of entailment holds in two different situations.
    (1) In cases of 'temporal inclusion' of two events as in schnarchen (snoring) entailing schlafen (sleeping).
    (ii) In cases without temporal inclusion as in what Fellbaum (1993, 19) calls 'backward presupposition', holding between grimyen (succeed) (succeed) and versuchen (try).
    However, these two cases are quite distinct from each other, justifying their separation into two different relations in GermaNet.
    The relation of entailment is kept for the case of backward presupposition.
