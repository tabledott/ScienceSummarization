rsion is used to reduce computational complexity.
    We use an incremental variation of the algorithm to reduce the number of passes through the corpus required.
    In the EM algorithm, an expectation phase, where counts on the corpus are taken using the current estimates of the parameters, is alternated with a maximization phase, where parameters are re-estimated based on the counts just taken.
    Improved parameters lead to improved counts which lead to even more accurate parameters.
    In the incremental version of the EM algorithm we use, instead of re-estimating parameters after each complete pass through the corpus, we re-estimate parameters after each sentence.
    By re-estimating parameters continually as we take counts on the corpus, we can align later sections of the corpus more reliably based on alignments of earlier sections.
    We can align a corpus with only a single pass, simultaneously producing alignments and updating the model as we proceed.
    More specifically, we initialize paramet
