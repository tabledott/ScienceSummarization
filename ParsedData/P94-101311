on pattern for each word, and may be used in conjunction with or independent of dictionaries and other lexical resources.
    The initial step is to take a histogram of a corpus with accents and diacritics retained, and compute a table of accent pattern distributions as follows: De-accented Form Accent Pattern % Number cesse cesse 53% 669 cesse 47% 593 cout mut 100% 330 couta cofita 100% 41 coute colite 53% 107 mite 47% 96 cote cote 69% 2645 cote 28% 1040 cote 3% 99 cote &lt;1% 15 cotiere cOtiere 100% 296 For words with multiple accent patterns, steps 2-5 are applied.
    For a particular case of accent ambiguity identified above, collect &#177;k words of context around all occurrences in the corpus, label the concordance line with the observed accent pattern, and then strip the accents from the data.
    This will yield a training set such as the following: The training corpora used in this experiment were the Spanish AP Newswire (1991-1993, 49 million words), the French Canadian Hansards (1986-1988, 19 mill
