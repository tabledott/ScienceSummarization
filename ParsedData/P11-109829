    Template-based IE systems typically assume knowledge of the domain and its templates.
    We began by showing that domain knowledge isn&#8217;t necessarily required; we learned the MUC-4 template structure with surprising accuracy, learning new semantic roles and several new template structures.
    We are the first to our knowledge to automatically induce MUC-4 templates.
    It is possible to take these learned slots and use a previous approach to IE (such as seed-based bootstrapping), but we presented an algorithm that instead uses our learned syntactic patterns.
    We achieved results with comparable precision, and an F1 score of .40 that approaches prior algorithms that rely on hand-crafted knowledge.
    The extraction results are encouraging, but the template induction itself is a central contribution of this work.
    Knowledge induction plays an important role in moving to new domains and assisting users who may not know what
