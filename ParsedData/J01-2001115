sitions to words consists of pointers to all of the words that we have already labeled as being in Wc, and we can compute the length of these pointers by adding counts to these words; the length of the pointers to these words needs to be computed anyway in determining the compressed length of the corpus.
    This completes the computations needed to compare two states of the morphology.
    In addition, we must compute the difference in the compressed length of the corpus in the two states, and this is given in (11).
    37 The equivalence between the number computed in (9) and the number needed here is not exactly fortuitous, but it is not an error either.
    The figure computed in (9) describes an aspect of the complexity of the morphology as a whole, whereas the computation described here in the text is what it is because we have made the assumption that each stem occurs in exactly one signature.
    That assumption is not, strictly speaking, correct in natural language; we could well imagine an analysis
