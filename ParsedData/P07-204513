veral steps.
    Decomposition of the decoding process into various steps means that different factors can be modeled separately.
    Modeling factors in isolation allows for flexibility in their application.
    It can also increase accuracy and reduce sparsity by minimizing the number dependencies for each step.
    For example, we can decompose translating from surface forms to surface forms and lemma, as shown in Figure 3.
    By allowing the graph to be user definable, we can experiment to find the optimum configuration for a given language pair and available data.
    The factors on the source sentence are considered fixed, therefore, there is no decoding step which create source factors from other source factors.
    However, Moses can have ambiguous input in the form of confusion networks.
    This input type has been used successfully for speech to text translation (Shen et al. 2006).
    Every factor on the target language can have its own language model.
    Since many factors, like lemmas and POS
