ng, the verb stem selects for the verbal ending via the head feature SPEC.
    In the case of the combination of two verbal endings, the first ending selects for the second one via the head feature MARK.
    In both cases, the right element subcategorizes for the left one via SUBCAT.VAL.SPR.
    Using this mechanism, it is possible to control the sequence of verbal endings: Verb stems select verbal endings via SPEC and take no SPR, derivational morphemes (like causative or potential) select tense endings or other derivational morphemes via MARK and subcategorize for verb stems and/or verb endings via SPR (sase takes only verb stems), and tense endings take verb stems or endings as SPR and take no MARK or SPEC (as they occur at the end of the sequence).
