rpus.
    They obtain a list of prefixes and suffixes from this corpus, which is apparently augmented by a manually derived list of other affixes.
    Unfortunately, the full segmentation criteria are not given.
    Then a trigram model is learned from the segmented training corpus, and this is used to choose among competing segmentations for words in running text.
    In addition, a huge unannotated corpus (155 million words) is used to iteratively learn additional stems.
    Lee et al. (2003) show that the unsupervised use of the large corpus for stem identification increases accuracy.
    Overall, their error rates are higher than ours (2.9% vs. 0.7%), presumably because they do not use a morphological analyzer.
    There has been a fair amount of work on entirely unsupervised segmentation.
    Among this literature, Rogati et al. (2003) investigate unsupervised learning of stemming (a variant of tokenization in which only the stem is retained) using Arabic as the example language.
    Unsurprisingly, the
