    In this section, we explore in detail the data-driven paraphrase generation approaches that have emerged and have become extremely popular in the last decade or so.
    These corpus-based methods have the potential of covering a much wider range of paraphrasing phenomena and the advantage of widespread availability of corpora.
    We organize this section by the type of corpora used to generate the paraphrases: a single monolingual corpus, monolingual comparable corpora, monolingual parallel corpora, and bilingual parallel corpora.
    This form of organization, in our opinion, is the most instructive because most of the algorithmic decisions made for paraphrase generation will depend heavily on the type of corpus used.
    For instance, it is reasonable to assume that a different set of considerations will be paramount when using a large single monolingual corpus than when using bilingual parallel corpora.
    However, before delving into the actual paraphrasing methods, we believe that
