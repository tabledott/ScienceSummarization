d by knowledge about the sentence structure in the languages involved.
    These transformations aim at the assimilation of word orders in related sentences.
    A hierarchy of equivalence classes has been defined on the basis of morphological and syntactic information beyond the surface forms.
    The study of the effect of using information from either degree of abstraction led to the construction of hierarchical lexicon models, which combine different items of information in a log-linear way.
    The benefit from these combined models is twofold: First, the lexical coverage is improved, because the translation of unseen word forms can be derived by considering information from lower levels in the hierarchy.
    Second, category ambiguity can be resolved, because syntactical context information is made locally accessible by means of annotation with morpho-syntactic tags.
    As a side effect of the preparative work for setting up the underlying hierarchy of morpho-syntactic information, those pieces of info
