 rules are used to derive the translation During decoding, the source sentence is segmented into a sequence of phrases as in a standard phrase-based model.
    Then the lexical rule (3) 2 is 2Currently, we restrict phrases x and y not to be null.
    Therefore neither deletion nor insertion is carried out during decoding.
    However, these operations are to be considered in our future version of model. used to translate source phrase y into target phrase x and generate a block A.
    Later, the straight rule (1) merges two consecutive blocks into a single larger block in the straight order; while the inverted rule (2) merges them in the inverted order.
    These two merging rules will be used continuously until the whole source sentence is covered.
    When the translation is finished, a tree indicating the hierarchical segmentation of the source sentence is also produced.
    In the following, we will define the model in a straight way, not in the dynamic programming recursion way used by (Wu, 1996; Zens et
