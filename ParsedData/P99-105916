e 0(n4t2).
    We note that this construction can be straightforwardly extended to convert stochastic HAGs as in (Alshawi, 1996) into stochastic CFGs.
    Probabilities that Ha assigns to state q's various transition and halt actions are copied onto the corresponding productions A[a] a of G, where A = fa(q).
    8 Split head automaton grammars in time 0 (n3 ) For many bilexical CFGs or HAGs of practical significance, just as for the bilexical version of link grammars (Lafferty et al., 1992), it is possible to parse length-n inputs even faster, in time 0(n3) (Eisner, 1997).
    In this section we describe and discuss this special case, and give a new 0(n3) algorithm that has a smaller grammar constant than previously reported.
    A head automaton Ha is called split if it has no states that can be entered on a &#247;- transition and exited on a ---&gt; transition.
    Such an automaton can accept (x, y) only by reading all of y&#8212;immediately after which it is said to be in a flip state&#8212;and then readi
