ormativeness, representativeness and diversity.
    First, we propose three scoring functions to quantify the informativeness of an example, which can be used to select the most uncertain examples.
    Second, the representativeness measure is further proposed to choose the examples representing the majority.
    Third, we propose two diversity considerations (global and local) to avoid repetition among the examples of a batch.
    Finally, two combination strategies with the above three criteria are proposed to reach the maximum effectiveness on active learning for NER.
    We build our NER model using Support Vector Machines (SVM).
    The experiment shows that our active learning methods achieve a promising result in this NER task.
    The results in both MUC6 and GENIA show that the amount of the labeled training data can be reduced by at least 80% without degrading the quality of the named entity recognizer.
    The contributions not only come from the above measures, but also the two sample selection st
