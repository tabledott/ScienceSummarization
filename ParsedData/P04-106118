 directed dependencies were correct (63.7% ignoring direction).
    To our knowledge, this is the first published result to break the adjacent-word heuristic (at 33.6% for this corpus).
    Verbs are the sentence heads, prepositions take following noun phrases as arguments, adverbs attach to verbs, and so on.
    The most common source of discrepancy between the test dependencies and the model&#8217;s guesses is a result of the model systematically choosing determiners as the heads of noun phrases, while the test trees have the rightmost noun as the head.
    The model&#8217;s choice is supported by a good deal of linguistic research (Abney, 1987), and is sufficiently systematic that we also report the scores where the NP headship rule is changed to percolate determiners when present.
    On this adjusted metric, the score jumps hugely to 55.7% directed (and 67.9% undirected).
    This model also works on German and Chinese at above-baseline levels (55.8% and 54.2% undirected, respectively), with no modificat
