ner into two pieces; and MergeRule(&#8217;&lt;JJ&gt;&#8217;, &#8217;&lt;JJ&gt;&#8217;) combines two adjacent chunks where the first chunk ends and the second chunk starts with adjectives.
    The chunking tutorial motivates chunk parsing, describes each rule type, and provides all the necessary code for the assignment.
    The provided code is responsible for loading the chunked, part-of-speech tagged text using an existing tokenizer, creating an unchunked version of the text, applying the chunk rules to the unchunked text, and scoring the result.
    Students focus on the NLP task only &#8211; providing a rule set with the best coverage.
    In the remainder of this section we reproduce some of the cascades created by the students.
    The first example illustrates a combination of several rule types: ChunkRule(&#8217;&lt;DT&gt;&lt;NN.*&gt;&lt;VB.&gt;&lt;NN.
    *&gt;&#8217;), ChunkRule(&#8217;&lt;DT&gt;&lt;VB.&gt;&lt;NN.
    *&gt;&#8217;), ChunkRule(&#8217;&lt;.
    *&gt;&#8217;), UnChunkRule(&#8217;&lt;IN|
