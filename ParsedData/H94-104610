- tion of these data did not reveal any trend as a function of sentence length; short sentences were no harder than long ones.
  And the lower frequency of monosemous words is consistent with the non- technical nature of the passage; there is no obvious reason why that should influence the results for polysemous words.
  Without com- parable data for other passages, there is no way to know whether these results for F7 are representative or not.
  3.2 A Larger  Sample Rather than tag other new passages to use as test material, we decided to use passages that were already tagged semantically.
  That is to say, any tagged passage in the semantic concordance an be made to serve as a test passage by simply eliminating it from the training material.
  For example, in order to use passage X as a test passage, we can delete it from the semantic oncordance; then, using this diminished training material, the most-frequent heuristic is evaluated for passage X.
  Next, X is restored, Y is deleted, and the procedure repea
