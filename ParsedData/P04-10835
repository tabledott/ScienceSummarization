    A production rule that appears in an inference rule stands for the proposition that the production is in the grammar.
    Such specifications are nondeterFigure 2: Above: A tree generated by a 2-MTG in English and (transliterated) Russian.
    Every internal node is annotated with the linear order of its children, in every component where there are two children.

    Rectangles are 2D constituents. ministic: they do not indicate the order in which a parser should attempt inferences.
    A deterministic parsing strategy can always be chosen later, to suit the application.
    We presume that readers are familiar with declarative descriptions of inference algorithms, as well as with semiring parsing (Goodman, 1999).
  
  
    Figure 3 shows Logic C. Parser C is any parser based on Logic C. As in Melamed (2003)&#8217;s Parser A, Parser C&#8217;s items consist of a -dimensional label vector and a -dimensional d-span
