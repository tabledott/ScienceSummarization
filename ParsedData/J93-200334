f each word and a list of French words to connect to it.
    We call this list, which may be empty, a tablet.
    The collection of tablets is a random variable, T, that we call the tableau of e; the tablet for the ith English word is a random variable, Ti; and the kth French word in the ith tablet is a random variable, Tjk.
    After choosing the tableau, we permute its words to produce f. This permutation is a random variable, H. The position in f of the kth word in the ith tablet is yet another a random variable, ilzk&#8226; The joint likelihood for a tableau, T, and a permutation, 7r, is In this equation, r1c-1 represents the series of values , 7-,; 7r,ik-1 represents the series of values 7ri1, ,7rik_i; and 0, is shorthand for Knowing T and 7r determines a French string and an alignment, but in general several different pairs r, may lead to the same pair f, a.
    We denote the set of such pairs by (f, a).
    Clearly, then Two tableaux for one alignment.
    The number of elements in (f, a) is 1-11=0 Oi!
