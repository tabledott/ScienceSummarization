ts made in the context of topic segmentation algorithms, and Klavans, Popper, and Passonneau (2003) for selecting definition phrases.
    This &#8220;blurriness&#8221; of boundaries, combined with the prevalence effects discussed in Section 3.2, also explains the fact that topic annotation efforts which were only concerned with roughly dividing a text into segments (Passonneau and Litman 1993; Carletta et al. 1997; Hearst 1997; Reynar 1998; Ries 2002) generally report lower agreement than the studies whose goal is to identify smaller discourse units.
    When disagreement is mostly concentrated in one class (&#8216;boundary&#8217; in this case), if the total number of units to annotate remains the same, then expected agreement on this class is lower when a greater proportion of the units to annotate belongs to this class.
    When in addition this class is much less numerous than the other classes, overall agreement tends to depend mostly on agreement on this class.
    For instance, suppose we are testing th
