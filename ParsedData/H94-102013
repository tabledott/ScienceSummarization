rves as an id num- ber for the constituent.
  A null element itself is followed by the id number of the constituent with which it is co-indexed.
  We use SBARQ to mark WH-questions, and SQ to mark aux- iliaxy inverted structures.
  We use the WH-prefixed labels, WHNP, WHADVP, WHPP, etc., only when there is WH- movement; they always leave a co-indexed trace.
  Crucially, the predicate argument structure can be recovered by simply replacing the null element with the lexical material that it is co-indexed with: (SBARQ (NHNP-1What) (sQ is (NP-SB3 Tim) (VP eating (~P .Z,-i))) Z) Predicate Argument Structure: eat(Tim, what) In passives, the surface subject is tagged -SBJ, a passive trace is inserted after the verb, indicated by (NP *), and co-indexed to the surface subject (i.e.
  logical object).
  The logical sub- ject by-phrase, if present, is a child of VP, and is tagged -LGS (LoGical Subject).
  For passives, the predicate argu- ment structure can be recovered by replacing the passive null element with the mat
