lignments produced by the two annotators led to the final Sure aligned set, while the reunion of the Probable alignments led to the final Probable aligned set.
    The Sure alignment set is guaranteed to be a subset of the Probable alignment set.
    The annotators did not produce any NULL alignments.
    Instead, we assigned NULL alignments as a default backup mechanism, which forced each word to belong to at least one alignment.
    The English-French aligned data were produced by Franz Och and Hermann Ney (Och and Ney, 2000).
    For Romanian-English, annotators were instructed to assign an alignment to all words, with specific instructions as to when to assign a NULL alignment.
    Annotators were not asked to assign a Sure or Probable label.
    Instead, we had an arbitration phase, where a third annotator judged the cases where the first two annotators disagreed.
    Since an inter-annotator agreement was reached for all word alignments, the final resulting alignments were considered to be Sure alignmen
