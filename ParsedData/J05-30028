o understand the role of sentence fusion within summarization, we overview the MultiGen architecture, providing details on the processes that precede sentence fusion and thus, the input that the fusion component requires.
    Fusion itself is discussed in the subsequent sections of the article.
    MultiGen follows a pipeline architecture, shown in Figure 2.
    The analysis component of the system, Simfinder (Hatzivassiloglou, Klavans, and Eskin 1999) clusters sentences of input documents into themes, groups of sentences that convey similar information (Section 2.1).
    Once themes are constructed, the system selects a subset of the groups to be included in the summary, depending on the desired compression An example of MultiGen summary as shown in the Columbia Newsblaster Interface.
    Summary phrases are followed by parenthetical numbers indicating their source articles.
    The last sentence is extracted because it was repeated verbatim in several input articles.
