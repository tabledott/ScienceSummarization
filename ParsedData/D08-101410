els are projected back into the target language, and the resulting annotated corpus is used to train a subjectivity classifier.
    Figure 3 illustrates this experiment.
    As before, we use the high-coverage classifier available in OpinionFinder, and the SemCor corpus.
    We use a manual translation of this corpus available in the target language.
    In this experiment, the subjectivity annotations are carried out on automatically generated source text, and thus expected to be less accurate.
    However, since the training data was originally written in the target language, it is free of translation errors, and thus training carried out on this data should be more robust.
    For comparison purposes, we also propose an experiment which plays the role of an upper bound on the methods described so far.
    This experiment involves the automatic translation of the test data from the target language into the source language.
    The source language text is then annotated for subjectivity using OpinionFinder,
