with highest confidence can be classified at 80% accuracy.
    This property explains why the agreement model helps in joint ranking even though its overall accuracy may seem low.
    Under the Good Grief criterion, the agreement model&#8217;s prediction will only be enforced when its grief outweighs that of the ranking models.
    Thus in cases where the prediction confidence (|a&#183;x|) is relatively low,6 the agreement model will essentially be ignored.
  
  
    We considered the problem of analyzing multiple related aspects of user reviews.
    The algorithm presented jointly learns ranking models for individual aspects by modeling the dependencies between assigned ranks.
    The strength of our algorithm lies in its ability to guide the prediction of individual rankers using rhetorical relations between aspects such as agreement and contrast.
    Our method yields significant empirical improvements over individual rankers as well as a state-of-the-art joint ranking model.
    Our current model employs
