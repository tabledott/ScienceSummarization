pets that were vaguely on topic, Labeled LDA&#8217;s outputs are generally of superior subjective quality.
    To quantify this intuition, three human annotators rated each pair of snippets.
    The outputs were randomly labeled as &#8220;System A&#8221; or &#8220;System B,&#8221; and the annotators were asked to judge which system generated a better tag-specific document subset.
    The judges were also allowed to select neither system if there was no clear winner.
    The results are summarized in Table 2.
    L-LDA was judged superior by a wide margin: of the 149 judgments, L-LDA&#8217;s output was selected as preferable in 72 cases, whereas SVM&#8217;s was selected in only 21.
    The difference between these scores was highly significant (p &lt; .001) by the sign test.
    To quantify the reliability of the judgments, 51 of the 149 document-tag pairs were labeled by all three annotators.
    In this group, the judgments were in substantial agreement,1 with Fleiss&#8217; Kappa at .63.
