yntactic and semantic rules operate in parallel, the syntactic rules have the possibility of referring to the semantics of the constituents they work on.
    This possibility is in fact used in certain cases.
    We shall see an example in section III C 1.
    Complex discourse constituent units can be divided into four structurally different types: - sequences, which construct a dcu out of arbitrarily many constituents (e.g.
    : lists, narratives).
    - expansions, consisting of a clause and a subordinated unit which &amp;quot;expands&amp;quot; on it.
    - structures formed by a binary operator, such as &amp;quot;A because B&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If A then B&amp;quot;.
    - adjacency structures, involving speaker change, such as question/answer pairs and exchanges of greetings.
    In the next subsections, III B and III C, we shall discuss sequences and expansions in more detail.
    One general point we should like to make here already: sequences as well as expansions correspond to extensional semantic
