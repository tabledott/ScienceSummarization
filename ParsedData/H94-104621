b of sense identification?
  It should be noted that none of these heuristics takes into account the local context.
  Even the co- occurrence heuristic is indifferent o word order; imposing word- order constraints would have made sparse data sparser still.
  Local context--say, ?
  2 or 3 words--should contain sufficient informa- tion to identify the intended sense of most polysemous words.
  Given a system capable of exploiting local context, statistical heuristics might still provide a default, as Yarowsky [9] suggests; something to fall back on when local identification fails.
  Under those conditions, these statistical heuristics could indeed provide a floor on which more intelligent systems could build.
