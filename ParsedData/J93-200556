    We illustrated the approach for the acquisition of lexical information for several classes of nominals, and how such techniques can fine-tune the lexical structures acquired from an initial seeding of a machine-readable dictionary.
    In addition to conventional lexical semantic relations, we then showed how information concerning lexical presuppositions and preference relations can also be acquired from corpora, when analyzed with the appropriate semantic tools.
    In conclusion, we feel that the application of computational resources to the analysis of text corpora has and will continue to have a profound effect on the direction of linguistic and computational linguistic research.
    Unlike previous attempts at corpus research, the current focus is supported and guided by theoretical tools, and not merely statistical techniques.
    We should furthermore welcome the ability to expand the data set used for the confirmation of linguistic hypotheses.
    At the same time, we must remember th
