o s segments, so that segment U, in one half of the bitext and segment V, in the other half are mutual translations, 1 &lt; i &lt; s. Under the boundary-based model of co-occurrence, there are several ways to compute co-occurrence counts cooc(u, v) between word types u and v. In the models of Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993), reviewed in Section 4.3, where e, and f, are the urtigram frequencies of u and v, respectively, in each aligned text segment i.
    For most translation models, this method produces suboptimal results, however, when e,(u) &gt; 1 and J(v) &gt; 1.
    I argue elsewhere (Melamed 1998a) that nods and hoche often co-occur, as do nods and head.
    The direct association between nods and hoche, and the direct association between nods and head give rise to an indirect association between hoche and head.
    Many researchers have proposed greedy algorithms for estimating nonprobabilistic word-to-word translation models, also known as translation lexicons (e.g., Catizone, Russ
