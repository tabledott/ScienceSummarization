    Then, the resulting English sentences were analyzed, using the ESG parser and the postprocessing routine (see Section 2.2), to identify the relevant syntactic tuples.
    The tuples were further classified into &amp;quot;general classes,&amp;quot; as described in Section 2.3.
    The use of these general classes, which was intended to facilitate the mapping of syntactic relations from one language to another, also facilitated our simulation method and caused it to produce realistic output.
    At the end of the procedure, we had, for each sample sentence, a data structure similar to Table 1 (without the counts).
    The statistical data were acquired from the following corpora: However, the effective size of the corpora was only about 25 million words, owing to two filtering criteria.
    First, we considered only sentences whose length did not exceed 25 words, since longer sentences required excessive parse time and contained many parsing errors.
    Second, even 35% of the shorter sentences failed t
