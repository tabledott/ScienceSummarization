notated corpora such as the Proposition Banks (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Xue and Palmer, 2003) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) have enabled the development of a rapidly growing list of statistical semantic analyzers (Giidea and Jurafsky, 2002; Giidea and Palmer, 2002; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004; Sun and Jurafsky, 2004; Palmer et al., submitted).
    The shared task of the CoNLL-2004 is devoted to semantic role labeling (Carreras and Marquez, 2004).
    Most of these systems generally take as input a syntactic parse tree and use the syntactic information as features to tag the syntactic constituents with semantic role labels.
    Although these systems have shown great promise, we demonstrate that the features used in previous work have not fully exploited the information that a parse tree provides.
    In this paper we prepose an additional set of features and show that these features lead to fairly significant improvements in the tasks we performed.
