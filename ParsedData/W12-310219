systems are based on phrase-based models trained on the same training data, this is indeed a valid concern.
    They suggest ignoring ties, and using as ranking score instead the following ratio: Lopez (2012, in this volume) argues against using aggregate statistics over a set of very diverse judgments.
    Instead, a ranking that has the least number of pairwise ranking violations is said to be preferred.
    If we define the number of pairwise wins as then we define a count function for pairwise order violations as ranking of three systems as: Given a bijective ranking function R(s) &#8212;* i with the codomain of consecutive integers starting at 1, the total number of pairwise ranking violations is defined as Finding the optimal ranking R that minimizes this score is not trivial, but given the number of systems involved in this evaluation campaign, it is quite manageable.
    We now introduce a variant to Lopez&#8217;s ranking method.
    We motivate it first.
    Consider the following scenario: Since thi
