    In particular, it suggests a division of labor whereby annotation of the coreference relation proper is separated from other tasks such as annotation of bound anaphora and of the relation between a subject and a predicative NP.
  
  
    Various practical tasks requiring language technology including, for example, information extraction and text summarization, can be performed more reliably if it is possible to automatically find parts of the text containing information about a given topic.
    For example, if a text summarizer has to select the most important information, in a given text, about the 1984 Wall Street crash, then the summarization task is greatly helped if a program can automatically spot all the clauses in the text that contain information about this crash.
    To evaluate a program of this kind, extensive language
