    There are over 5K num features in DepBank so the overall microaveraged scores for a system will be significantly affected by accuracy on num.
    We expected our system, which incorporates a tagger with good empirical (97.1%) accuracy on the test data, to recover this feature with 95% accuracy or better, as it will correlate with tags NNx1 and NNx2 (where &#8216;x&#8217; represents zero or more capitals in the CLAWS tagset).
    However, DepBank treats the majority of prenominal modifiers as adjectives rather than nouns and, therefore, associates them with an adegree rather than a num feature.
    The PoS tag selected depends primarily on the relative lexical probabilities of each tag for a given lexical item recorded in the tagger lexicon.
    But, regardless of this lexical decision, the correct GR is recovered, and neither adegree(positive) or num(sg) add anything semantically-relevant when the lexical item is a nominal premodifier.
    A strategy which only provided a num feature for
