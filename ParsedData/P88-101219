.
    Then assuming Qi A Q2 will cost $20, whereas assuming Pi A P2 A P3 Will cost only $18, since the two instances of P2 can be unified.
    Thus, the abduction scheme allows us to adopt the careful policy of favoring least specific abduction while also allowing us to exploit the redundancy of texts for more specific interpretations.
    In the above examples we have used equal weights on the conjuncts in the antecedents.
    I is more reasonable, 'The abduction scheme is due to Mark Stickel, and it, or a variant of it, is described at greater length in Stickel (1988). however, to assign the weights according to the &amp;quot;semantic contribution&amp;quot; each conjunct makes to the consequent.
    Consider, for example, the axiom (Vz)car(z).&#176; A no-top(x).4 D convertible(x) We have an intuitive sense that car contributes more to convertible than no-top does.'
    In principle, the weights in (4) should be a function of the probabilities that instances of the concept P, are instances of the concept Q i
