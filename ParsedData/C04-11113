a foundation for terascale acquisition of knowledge.
			We will show that, for very small or very large corpora or for situations where recall is valued over precision, the pattern-based approach is best.
	
	
			Previous approaches to extracting is-a relations fall under two categories: pattern-based and co occurrence-based approaches.
			2.1 Pattern-based approaches.
			Marti Hearst (1992) was the first to use a pat tern-based approach to extract hyponym relations from a raw corpus.
			She used an iterative process to semi-automatically learn patterns.
			However, a corpus of 20MB words yielded only 400 examples.
			Our pattern-based algorithm is very similar to the one used by Hearst.
			She uses seed examples to manually discover her patterns whearas we use a minimal edit distance algorithm to automatically discover the patterns.
			771Riloff and Shepherd (1997) used a semi automatic method for discovering similar words using a few seed examples by using pattern-based techniques and human supervision.
