  7 2.3 The POS Tagging Process The tagged version of the Penn Treebank corpus is produced in two stages, using a combination of automatic POS assignment and manual correction.
  7 In versions of the tagged corpus distributed before November 1992, singular proper nouns, plural proper nouns, and personal pronouns were tagged as "NP," "NPS," and "PP," respectively.
  The current tags "NNP," "NNPS," and "PRP" were introduced in order to avoid confusion with the syntactic tags "NP" (noun phrase) and "PP" (prepositional phrase) (see Table 3).
