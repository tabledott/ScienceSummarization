ned, and each word is assigned a category score.
    The category score is (essentially) the conditional probability that the word appears in a category context.
    The words are ranked by this score and the top five are dynamically added to the seed word list.
    This bootstrapping process dynamically grows the seed word list so that each iteration produces a larger category context.
    After several iterations, the final list of ranked words usually contains many words that belong to the category, especially near the top.
    The ranked list is presented to a user, who scans down the list and removes any words that do not belong to the category.
    For more details of this algorithm, see (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997).
    A flowchart for the case frame generation process appears in Figure 2.
    AutoSlog-TS produces a ranked list of extraction patterns and our semantic lexicon generator produces a ranked list of words for each category.
    Generating these lists is fully automatic, but a human must revie
