ed algorithms is significant.
    Conversely, the superior fallout of condition 1 and superior error rate of condition 2 are significant.
    For the T = 3 boundaries, the differences are not statistically significant for condition 2, but for condition 1, precision and error rate are both superior, and the difference as compared with EA is statistically significant.
    The largest and the most statistically significant difference is the higher precision of the condition 1 automated algorithm.
    Qualitatively, the algorithms produced by error analysis are more intuitive and easier to understand than those produced by machine learning.
    Furthermore, note that the machine learning algorithm used the changes to the coding features that resulted from the error analysis.
    This suggests that error analysis is a useful method for understanding how to best code the data, while machine learning provides a cost-effective (and automatic) way to produce an optimally performing algorithm given a good feature repre
