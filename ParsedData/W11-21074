    Commonly used metrics such as BLEU and earlier versions of Meteor make no distinction between content and function words.
    This can be problematic for ranking-based evaluations where two system outputs can differ by a single word, such as mistranslating either a main verb or a determiner.
    To improve Meteor&#8217;s discriminative power in such cases, we introduce a function word list for each WMT language and a new 6 parameter to adjust the relative weight given to content words (any word not on the list) versus function words (see Section 3).
    Function word lists are estimated according to relative frequency in large monolingual corpora.
    For each language, we pool freely available WMT 2011 data consisting of Europarl (Koehn, 2005), news (sentence-uniqued), and news commentary data.
    Any word with relative frequency of 10&#8722;3 or greater is added to the function word list.
