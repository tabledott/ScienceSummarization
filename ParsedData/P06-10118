    The first type of association will provide us with our (cleaner) lexicon, while the second will allow us to estimate probabilities of words not being translations of each other.
    Before describing our new method more formally, we address the notion of word cooccurrence.
    In the work of Moore (2004a) and Melamed (2000), two words cooccur if they are present in a pair of aligned sentences in the parallel training corpus.
    However, most of the words from aligned sentences are actually unrelated; therefore, this is a rather weak notion of cooccurrence.
    We follow Resnik et. al (2001) and adopt a stronger definition, based not on sentence alignment but on word alignment: two words cooccur if they are linked together in the word-aligned parallel training corpus.
    We thus make use of the significant amount of knowledge brought in by the word alignment procedure.
    We compute ,the LLR score for words and , using the formula presented by Moore (2004b), which we do not repeat here due to lack
