sing, information extraction, and information retrieval, different segmentations can be useful or even essential for the different tasks.
    In this sense, word segmentation is similar to speech recognition, in which a system must be robust enough to adapt to and recognize the multiple speaker-dependent &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; pronunciations of words.
    In some cases, it may also be necessary to allow multiple &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; segmentations of the same text, depending on the requirements of further processing steps.
    However, many algorithms use extensive domain-specific word lists and intricate name recognition routines as well as hard-coded morphological analysis modules to produce a predetermined segmentation output.
    Modifying or retargeting an existing segmentation algorithm to produce a different segmentation can be difficult, especially if it is not clear what and where the systematic differences in segmentation are.
    It is widely reported in word segmentation papers,2 that t
