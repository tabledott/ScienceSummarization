jority are quite simple and can be annotated reliably.
    Our annotation philosophy can be summarised as: During this process we identified numerous cases that require a more sophisticated annotation scheme.
    There are genuine flat cases, primarily names like John A. Smith, that we would like to distinguish from implicitly right-branching NPs in the next version of the corpus.
    Although our scheme is still developing, we believe that the current annotation is already useful for statistical modelling, and we demonstrate this empirically in Section 6.
    Our annotation guidelines) are based on those developed for annotating full sub-NP structure in the biomedical domain (Kulick et al., 2004).
    The annotation guidelines for this biomedical corpus (an addendum to the Penn Treebank guidelines) introduce the use of NML nodes to mark internal NP structure.
    In summary, our guidelines leave right-branching structures untouched, and insert labelled brackets around left-branching structures.
