 equal to the translations of any other system in the manual evaluation.
    When there are no ties p can be calculated using the simplified equation: where di is the difference between the rank for systemi and n is the number of systems.
    The possible values of p range between 1 (where all systems are ranked in the same order) and &#8722;1 (where the systems are ranked in the reverse order).
    Thus an automatic evaluation metric with a higher absolute value for p is making predictions that are more similar to the human judgments than an automatic evaluation metric with a lower absolute p. Because the sentence-level judgments collected in the manual evaluation are relative judgments rather than absolute judgments, it is not possible for us to measure correlation at the sentencelevel in the same way that previous work has done (Kulesza and Shieber, 2004; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007a; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007b).
    Rather than calculating a correlation coefficient at the sentence-level we instead ascertained how
