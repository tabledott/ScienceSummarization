 these have a minor role in understanding cars drinking.
    The met* method bears out another problem that, &amp;quot;even when a feature is relevant, it is often shared only metaphorically.&amp;quot; Finally, with the problem that novel metaphors cannot be based on &amp;quot;extant similarities,&amp;quot; &#8212; the relevant analogies found in the met* method are not &amp;quot;extant&amp;quot; but have to be actively discovered.
    In Section 2, two main differences were noted between the interaction and comparison views: first, that similarities are &amp;quot;created&amp;quot; in the interaction view, whereas only pre-existing similarities are found in the comparison view, and second, that a whole system of similarities are evoked in the interactions view, unlike the comparisons view, which focuses upon finding a single similarity.
    Regarding the first difference, I would argue that the difference is a mistaken one and that interaction theorists are simply using a sophisticated form of comparison.
