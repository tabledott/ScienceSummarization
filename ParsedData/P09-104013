o x and that we can parse the sentence using only transitions in Tp&#8222; because nodes can be pushed onto the stack in projective order using only the SHIFT transition.
    If the words are not in projective order, we can use a combination of SHIFT and SWAP transitions to ensure that nodes are still pushed onto the stack in projective order.
    More precisely, if the next node in the projective order is the kth node in the buffer, we perform k SHIFT transitions, to get this node onto the stack, followed by k&#8722;1 SWAP transitions, to move the preceding k &#8722; 1 nodes back to the buffer.1 In this way, the parser can effectively sort the input nodes into projective order on the stack, repeatedly extracting the minimal element of &lt;G from the buffer, and build a tree that is projective with respect to the sorted order.
    Since any input can be sorted using SHIFT and SWAP, and any projective tree can be built using SHIFT, LEFT-ARCl and RIGHT-ARCl, the system Su is complete for the set of all dependen
