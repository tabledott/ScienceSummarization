atures 0(t, m).
    These features capture the intuition that a given Wikipedia title t is more likely to be referred to by mention m appearing in document d if the Wikipedia page for t has high textual similarity to d, or if the context surrounding hyperlinks to t are similar to m&#8217;s context in d. For each Wikipedia title t, we construct a top200 token TF-IDF summary of the Wikipedia page t, which we denote as Text(t) and a top-200 token TF-IDF summary of the context within which t was hyperlinked to in Wikipedia, which we denote as Context(t).
    We keep the IDF vector for all tokens in Wikipedia, and given an input mention m in a document d, we extract the TF-IDF representation of d, which we denote Text(d), and a TF-IDF representation of a 100-token window around m, which we denote Context(m).
    This allows us to define four local features described in Table 1.
    We additionally compute weighted versions of the features described above.
    Error analysis has shown that in many cases the summari
