ot have a standard training&#8211;test split, so these were randomly divided into 60&#8211;40 training&#8211;test splits.
    Due to the large number of training and test instances for these words, we filtered out instances associated with any sense that occurred in less than 5% of the training or test instances.
    We also randomly selected five pairs of words from the SENSEVAL-2 data and mixed their instances together (while retaining the training and test distinction that already existed in the data).
    After mixing, the data was filtered such that any sense that made up less than 10% in the training or test data of the new mixed sample was removed; this is why the total number of instances for the mixed pairs is not the same as the sum of those for the individual words.
    These mix-words were created in order to provide data that included both fine grained and coarse grained distinctions.
    Table 1 shows all words that were used in our experiments along with their parts of speech.
    Thereafter we
