&amp;quot; if and only if it is a constituent whose children consist solely of POS tags.
    Starting from the left, CHUNK assigns each (word,POS tag) pair a &amp;quot;chunk&amp;quot; tag, either Start X, Join X, or Other.
    Figure 3 shows the result after the second pass.
    The chunk tags are then used for chunk detection, in which any consecutive sequence of words vim wn (m &lt; n) are grouped into a &amp;quot;fiat&amp;quot; chunk X if tom has been assigned Start X and wn,fi wn have all been assigned Join X.
    The result of chunk detection, shown in figure 4, is a forest of trees and serves as the input to the third pass.
    The third pass always alternates between the use of BUILD and CHECK, and completes any remaining constituent structure.
    BUILD decides whether a tree will start a new constituent or join the incomplete constituent immediately to its left.
    Accordingly, it annotates the tree with either Start X, where X is any constituent label, or with Join X, where X matches the label of t
