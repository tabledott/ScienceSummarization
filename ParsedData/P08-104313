    Figure 1 depicts the lattice for a 2-words sentence bclm hneim.
    We use double-circles to indicate the space-delimited token boundaries.
    Note that in our construction arcs can never cross token boundaries.
    Every token is independent of the others, and the sentence lattice is in fact a concatenation of smaller lattices, one for each token.
    Furthermore, some of the arcs represent lexemes not present in the input tokens (e.g. h/DT, fl/POS), however these are parts of valid analyses of the token (cf. super-segmental morphology section 2).
    Segments with the same surface form but different PoS tags are treated as different lexemes, and are represented as separate arcs (e.g. the two arcs labeled neim from node 6 to 7).
    A similar structure is used in speech recognition.
    There, a lattice is used to represent the possible sentences resulting from an interpretation of an acoustic model.
