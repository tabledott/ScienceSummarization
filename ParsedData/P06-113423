ccuracy for the two different systems, the most frequent sense baseline, and the subjectivity/objectivity split among the word senses (according to Judge 1).
    The words in the top half of the table are the ones that have both S and O senses, and those in the bottom are the ones that do not.
    If we were to use Judge 2&#8217;s tags instead of Judge 1&#8217;s, only one word would change: source would move from the top to the bottom of the table. without subjectivity information, for the set of ambiguous nouns in SENSEVAL-3 For the words that have both S and O senses, the addition of the subjectivity feature alone can bring a significant error rate reduction of 4.3% (p &lt; 0.05 paired t-test).
    Interestingly, no improvements are observed for the words with no subjective senses; on the contrary, the addition of the subjectivity feature results in a small degradation.
    Overall for the entire set of ambiguous words, the error reduction is measured at 2.2% (significant at p &lt; 0.1 paired t-test).
