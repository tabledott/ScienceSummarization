tions, including first-order and second-order parsers, and labeled and unlabeled parsers.5 3As in Brown et al. (1992), we limit the clustering algorithm so that it recovers at most 1,000 distinct bit-strings; thus full bit strings are not equivalent to word forms.
    The English experiments were performed on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), using a standard set of head-selection rules (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) to convert the phrase structure syntax of the Treebank to a dependency tree representation.6 We split the Treebank into a training set (Sections 2&#8211;21), a development set (Section 22), and several test sets (Sections 0,7 1, 23, and 24).
    The data partition and head rules were chosen to match previous work (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald and Pereira, 2006).
    The part of speech tags for the development and test data were automatically assigned by MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), where the tagger was trained on the entire training corpus; to generate part of
