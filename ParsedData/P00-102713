n the first iteration, no inflection/root pairs are available for estimating the above models.
    As prior knowledge is not available regarding a &#8212;x stem-change probabilities, an assumption is made that the cost of each is proportional to the previously described Levenshtein distance between a and /3, with the cost of a change increasing geometrically as the distance from the end of the root increases.
    The rate of this cost increase ultimately depends on the tendency of the language to allow word-internal spelling changes (as in Spanish or Arabic), or strongly favor changes at the point of affixation (as in English).
    The primary goal of iterative retraining is to refine the core morphological transformation model, which not only serves as one of the four similarity models, but is also a primary deliverable of the learning process.
    As subsequent iterations proceed, the stemchange probability models are retrained on the output of the prior iteration, weighting each training example with its a
