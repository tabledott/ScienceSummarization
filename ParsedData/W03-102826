    Another possibility would be to let several persons index each document, thus getting a larger set of acceptable terms to choose from.
    This would hopefully lead to a better precision, while recall probably would be affected negatively; the importance of recall would then need to be reconsidered.
    Future work should also go in the direction of generating (as opposed to extracting) keywords, by for example exploring potential knowledge provided by a thesaurus.
