ge subsumes that of the second edge.
    Informally, this involves forming a new partial phrase whenever the category of a constituent needed by one partial phrase matches the category of a completed phrase and the dag associated with the completed phrase can be unified in appropriately.
    Scanner step: If i 0 and tv; = a, then for all items (h, i &#8212; 1, X0 a.a13, DI add the item [h, i, X0 oia.fl, Di.
    Informally, this involves allowing lexical items to be inserted into partial phrases.
    Notice that the Predictor Step in particular assumes the availability of the cat feature for top-down prediction.
    Consequently, this algorithm applies only to PATR-II with a context-free base.
    A first attempt at extending the algorithm to make use of more than just a single atomic-valued cal feature (or less if no such feature is mandated) is to change the Predictor Step so that instead of checking the predicted rule for a lefthand side that matches its cat feature with the predicting subphrase, we require
