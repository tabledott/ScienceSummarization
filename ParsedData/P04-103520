, 1/d2}, and c E [0, 1] at intervals of 0.1. enhancements cannot be attributed entirely to the mere inclusion of more sentences regardless of whether they are subjective or not &#8212; one counterargument is that Full review yielded substantially worse results for the NB default polarity classifier&#8212; and at any rate, the graph-derived extracts are still substantially more concise than the full texts.
    Now, while incorporating a bias for assigning nearby sentences to the same category into NB and SVM subjectivity detectors seems to require some non-obvious feature engineering, we also wish to investigate whether our graph-based paradigm makes better use of contextual constraints that can be (more or less) easily encoded into the input of standard classifiers.
    For illustrative purposes, we consider paragraph-boundary information, looking only at SVM subjectivity detection for simplicity&#8217;s sake.
    It seems intuitively plausible that paragraph boundaries (an approximation to discourse boundari
