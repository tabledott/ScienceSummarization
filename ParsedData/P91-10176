to this view, previous approaches in MT typically resolved examples like (1) by stating various constraints in terms of the source language (Nirenburg, 1987).
    As explained before, such constraints cannot be acquired automatically and therefore are usually limited in their coverage.
    The experiment conducted to test the statistical model clearly shows that the statistics on lexical relations are very useful for disambiguation.
    Most notable is the result for the set of examples for Hebrew to English translation, which was picked randomly from foreign news sections in Israeli press.
    For this set, the statistical model was applicable for 70% of the ambiguous words, and its selection was then correct for 92% of the cases.
    These results for target word selection in machine translation suggest to use a similar mechanism even if we are interested only in word sense disambiguation within a single language!
    In order to select the right sense of a word, in a broad coverage application, it is usefu
