npacked tree is a combination of trees, each of which is selected from a disjunctive daughter.
    Hence, a set of all unpacked trees is represented as a product of trees from disjunctive daughters.
    A disjunctive node d E D represents alternatives of packed trees, and obviously a set of its unpacked trees is represented as a union of the daughter trees, that is, &#8486;(d) = To summarize, a set of unpacked trees is defined formally as follows.
    Given a feature forest &#934; = (C, D, r,&#947;, 6), a set &#8486;(n) of unpacked trees rooted at node n E C U D is defined recursively as follows.
    Feature forests are directed acyclic graphs and, as such, this definition does not include a loop.
    Hence, &#8486;(n) is properly defined.
    A set of all unpacked trees is then represented by &#8486;(r); henceforth, we denote &#8486;(r) as &#8486;(&#934;), or just &#8486; when it is not confusing in context.
    Figure 3 shows &#8486;(&#934;) of the feature forest in Figure 1.
    Following Definition 4, the
