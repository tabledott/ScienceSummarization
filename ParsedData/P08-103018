reak down the document boundaries for event extraction.
    We gather together event extraction results from a set of related documents, and then apply inference and constraints to enhance IE performance.
    In the short term, the approach provides a platform for many byproducts.
    For example, we can naturally get an event-driven summary for the collection of related documents; the sentences including high-confidence events can be used as additional training data to bootstrap the event tagger; from related events in different timeframes we can derive entailment rules; the refined consistent events can serve better for other NLP tasks such as template based question-answering.
    The aggregation approach described here can be easily extended to improve relation detection and coreference resolution (two argument mentions referring to the same role of related events are likely to corefer).
    Ultimately we would like to extend the system to perform essential, although probably lightweight, event prediction
