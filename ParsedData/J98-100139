they are assumed to be.
    Resnik contrasts his method of computing similarity to those which compute path length (e.g., Sussna 1993), arguing that the links in the WordNet taxonomy do not represent uniform distances (cf.
    Resnik 1995b).
    Resnik's method, applied using WordNet's fine-grained sense distinctions and measured against the performance of human judges, approaches human accuracy.
    Like the other studies cited here, his work considers only nouns.
    WordNet is not a perfect resource for word sense disambiguation.
    The most frequently cited problem is the fine-grainedness of WordNet's sense distinctions, which are often well beyond what may be needed in many language-processing applications (see Section 3.2).
    Voorhees' (1993) hood construct is an attempt to access sense distinctions that are less fine-grained than WordNet's synsets, and less coarse-grained than the 10 WordNet noun hierarchies; Resnik's (1995a) method allows for detecting sense distinctions at any level of the WordNet
