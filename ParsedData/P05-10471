is to use machine learning to automatically learn the domain-specific information required to port a system (Riloff, 1996).
    Yangarber et al. (2000) proposed an algorithm for learning extraction patterns for a small number of examples which greatly reduced the burden on the application developer and reduced the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.
    Weakly supervised algorithms, which bootstrap from a small number of examples, have the advantage of requiring only small amounts of annotated data, which is often difficult and time-consuming to produce.
    However, this also means that there are fewer examples of the patterns to be learned, making the learning task more challenging.
    Providing the learning algorithm with access to additional knowledge can compensate for the limited number of annotated examples.
    This paper presents a novel weakly supervised algorithm for IE pattern induction which makes use of the WordNet ontology (Fellbaum, 1998).
    Extraction patterns are potentially useful for many
