for dealing with this problem. first is to or restrict Leibniz's Law.
    The second is to deny that the Evening Star and the Morning Star are identical as entities in the Platonic universe; they only happen to he identical in the real world, and that is not sufficient for intersubstitutivity. third is to deny that expression (16) represents (14) because 'the Evening Star&amp;quot; in (14) does not refer to what it seems to refer to.
    The first possibility is the approach of researchers who treat belief as an operator rather than as a predicate, and then re&#8226; strict substitution inside the operator?
    We cannot avail ourselves of this. solution because of the flatness of our notation. predicate rise is surely referentially transparent, so if S identical, MS can he substituted for the , give riselP,&#8222;t/S).
    Then the exnot even require substitution to he belief about the Morning In any case, this approach does not seem wise in view of the central importance played in discourse interpretation b
