ctors.
    These include: 1) better approximation of the corpus BLEU score, 2) larger hypothesis space, and 3) larger evidence space.
    We now present experiments to tease apart these factors.
    Our first experiment restricts both the hypothesis and evidence spaces in lattice MBR to the 1000-best list (Table 3).
    We compare this to N-best MBR with: a) sentence-level BLEU, and b) sentence-level log BLEU.
    The results show that when restricted to the 1000best list, Lattice MBR performs slightly better than N-best MBR (with sentence BLEU) on aren/enzh while N-best MBR is better on zhen.
    We hypothesize that on aren/enzh, the linear corpus BLEU gain (Equation 10) is better correlated to the actual corpus BLEU than sentence-level BLEU while the opposite is true on zhen.
    N-best MBR gives similar results with either sentence BLEU or sentence log BLEU.
    This confirms that using a log BLEU score does not change the outcome of MBR decoding and further justifies our Taylor-series approximation of the
