 provide the number of times the following tree schema, which As expected, the PCFGs induced from the output of the Flatten transform and Parent transform significantly improve precision and recall over the original treebank PCFG (i.e., the PCFG induced from the output of the Id transform).
    The PCFG induced from the output of the Parent transform performed significantly better than any other PCFG investigated here.
    As discussed above, both the Parent and the Flatten transforms induce PCFGs that are sensitive to what would be non-CF dependencies in the original treebank trees, which perhaps accounts for their superior performance.
    Both the Flatten and Parent transforms induced PCFGs that have substantially more productions than the original treebank grammar, perhaps reflecting the fact that they encode more contextual information than the original treebank grammar, albeit in different ways.
    Their superior performance suggests that the reduction in bias obtained by the weakening of independence
