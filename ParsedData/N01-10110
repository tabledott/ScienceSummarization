  A Decision Tree Of Bigrams Is An Accurate Predictor Of Word Sense
  
    This paper presents a corpus-based approach to word sense disambiguation where a decision tree assigns a sense to an ambiguous word based on the bigrams that occur nearby.

    It is more accurate than the average results reported for 30 of 36 words, and is more accurate than the best results for 19 of 36 words.
