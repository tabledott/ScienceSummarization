from the subcategorization list) when either a trace or a modifier nonterminal that has the +gap feature, is generated.
    For example, rule (2) in Figure 7, SBAR(that)(+gap) &#8594; WHNP(that) S-C(bought)(+gap), has probability In rule (2), Right is chosen, so the +gap requirement is added to RC.
    Generation of S-C(bought)(+gap) fulfills both the S-C and +gap requirements in RC.
    In rule (4), Right is chosen again.
    Note that generation of TRACE satisfies both the NP-C and +gap subcategorization requirements.
  
  
    Sections 3.1 to 3.3 described the basic framework for the parsing models in this article.
    In this section we describe how some linguistic phenomena (nonrecursive NPs and coordination, for example) clearly violate the independence assumptions of the general models.
    We describe a number of these special cases, in each instance arguing that the phenomenon violates the independence assumptions, then describing how the model can be refined to deal with the problem.
    We define n
