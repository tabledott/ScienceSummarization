 gradual convergence curves.
    Figure 1 plots the convergence curves for a randomly generated graph with 250 vertices and 250 edges, for a convergence threshold of 0.0001.
    As the connectivity of the graph increases (i.e. larger number of edges), convergence is usually achieved after fewer iterations, and the convergence curves for directed and undirected graphs practically overlap.
    In the context of Web surfing, it is unusual for a page to include multiple or partial links to another page, and hence the original PageRank definition for graph-based ranking is assuming unweighted graphs.
    However, in our model the graphs are build from natural language texts, and may include multiple or partial links between the units (vertices) that are extracted from text.
    It may be therefore useful to indicate and incorporate into the model the &#8220;strength&#8221; of the connection between two vertices and as a weight added to the corresponding edge that connects the two vertices.
    Consequently, we int
