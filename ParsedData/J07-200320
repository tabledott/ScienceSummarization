thm for CFGs in Chomsky normal form can be thought of as a deductive proof system whose items can take one of two forms: The axioms would be 6 Treating grammar rules as axioms is not standard practice, but advocated by Goodman (1999).
    Here, it has the benefit of simplifying the presentation in Section 5.3.4. and the inference rules would be and the goal would be [S, 0, n], where S is the start symbol of the grammar and n is the length of the input string f. Given a synchronous CFG, we could convert its French-side grammar into Chomsky normal form, and then for each sentence, we could find the best parse using CKY.
    Then it would be a straightforward matter to revert the best parse from Chomsky normal form into the original form and map it into its corresponding English tree, whose yield is the output translation.
    However, because we have already restricted the number of nonterminal symbols in our rules to two, it is more convenient to use a modified CKY algorithm that operates on our grammar direct
