    Moreover, it is very likely that the Web translation quality is an underestimate: Some of the low-scoring outliers within the Web data could be eliminated by using state-of-the-art sentence alignment techniques and automatic detection and Translation adequacy ratings: Distribution over scores for human-translated (Human), Web-generated (WWW), and machine-translated (MT) data.
    The left plot provides results for judge 1, the right plot for judge 2. elimination of noisy pairs at the sentence level (cf.
    Nie and Cai [2001]).
    We observe that the distribution of scores for Web data peaks at the highest rating and that the data are in both cases modestly bimodally distributed.
    Machine-translated pairs, on the other hand, have gen
