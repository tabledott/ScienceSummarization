velop innovative approaches to relation extraction based on syntactic information, in which the examples preserve their original representations (i.e. parse trees) and are compared by the kernel function (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zhao and Grishman, 2005).
    Despite the positive results obtained exploiting syntactic information, we claim that there is still room for improvement relying exclusively on shallow linguistic information for two main reasons.
    First of all, previous comparative evaluations put more stress on the deep linguistic approaches and did not put as much effort on developing effective methods based on shallow linguistic information.
    A second reason concerns the fact that syntactic parsing is not always robust enough to deal with real-world sentences.
    This may prevent approaches based on syntactic features from producing any result.
    Another related issue concerns the fact that parsers are available only for few languages and may not produce reliable re
