), nonterminals and n. However, this is dominated by the computation of the Inside and Outside probabilities, which takes time 0(rn3), for a grammar with r rules.
    Since there are eight rules for every node in the training data, this is 0(Tn3).
    By modifying the algorithm slightly to record the actual split used at each node, we can recover the best parse.
    The entry maxc Li, n] contains the expected number of correct constituents, given the model.
  
  
    We are grateful to Bod for supplying the data that he used for his experiments (Bod, 1995b, Bod, 1995a, Bod, 1993c).
    The original ATIS data from the Penn Tree Bank, version 0.5, is very noisy; it is difficult to even automatically read this data, due to inconsistencies between files.
    Researchers are thus left with the difficult decision as to how to clean the data.
    For this paper, we conducted two sets of experiments: one using a minimally cleaned set of data,1 making our results comparable to previous results; the other using the ATI
