pectively.
			GTM10, 20, and 30 are GTM with exponents of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 respectively.
			95% confidence intervals are estimated using bootstrap resampling (Davison and Hinkley 1997).
			From the BLEU group, we found that shorter BLEU has better adequacy correlation while longer BLEU has better fluency correlation.
			GTM with smaller exponent has better adequacy correlation and GTM with larger exponent has better fluency correlation.
			NIST is very good in adequacy correlation but not as good as GTM30 in fluency correlation.
			Based on these observations, we are not able to conclude which metric is the best because it depends on the manual evaluation criteria.
			This results also indicate that high correlation between human and automatic scores in both adequacy and fluency cannot always been achieved at the same time.
			The best performing metrics in fluency according to Table 1 are BLEU12 and GTM30 (dark/green cells).
			However, many metrics are statistically equivalent (gray cells) to them when we
