that were used in the experiments of Knight and Marcu (2000) and therefore in our experiments: The human-written condensations in the data set extracted from the Ziff-Davis corpus show the same word order as the original sentences and do not exhibit any structural modification that are common in humanwritten summaries.
    For example, humans tend to make use of structural modifications such as nominalization and verb alternations such as active/passive or transitive/intransitive alternations in condensation.
    Such alternations can easily be expressed in our transfer-based approach, whereas they impose severe problems to approaches that operate only on phrase structure trees.
    In the given test set, however, the condensation task restricted to the operation of deletion.
    A creation of additional condensations for the original sentences other than the condensed versions extracted from the human-written abstracts would provide a more diverse test set, and furthermore make it possible to match each syst
