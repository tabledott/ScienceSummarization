hose leaves express the content being communicated and whose nodes specify how this content is grouped via rhetorical or discourse relations (e.g., contrast, sequence, elaboration).
    For domains with large numbers of facts and rhetorical relations, there can be more than one possible tree representing the intended content.
    These different trees will be realized as texts with different sentence orders or even paragraph orders and different levels of coherence.
    Finding the tree that yields the best possible text is effectively a search problem.
    One way to address it is by narrowing down the search space either exhaustively or heuristically.
    Marcu (1997) argues that global coherence can be achieved if constraints on local coherence are satisfied.
    The latter are operationalized as weights on the ordering and adjacency of facts and are derived from a corpus of naturally occurring texts.
    A constraint satisfaction algorithm is used to find the tree with maximal weights from the space of al
