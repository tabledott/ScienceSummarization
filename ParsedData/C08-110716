nferences that are per formed in practice using the rule base.To perform such experiments, we need a test set of seed templates, which correspond to a set of target predicates, and a corpus annotated with allargument mentions of each predicate.
			The evaluation assesses the correctness of all argument ex tractions, which are obtained by matching in the corpus either the seed templates or templates that entail them according to the rule-base (the latter corresponds to rule-application).
			Following (Szpektor et al, 2008), we found the ACE 2005 event training set 2useful for this pur pose.
			This standard IE dataset includes 33 types of event predicates such as Injure, Sue and Divorce.
			2 http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/ace/ 852All event mentions are annotated in the corpus, in cluding the instantiated arguments of the predicate.
			ACE guidelines specify for each event its possible arguments, each associated with a semantic role.
			For instance, some of the Injure event arguments are Agent, Victim and Time
