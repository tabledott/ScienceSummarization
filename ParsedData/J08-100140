class of four models of the form Coreference[+/&#8722;]Syntax&#8722;Salience[+/&#8722;].
    The effect of fully fledged coreference resolution was assessed by creating models where entity classes were constructed simply by clustering nouns on the basis of their identity (Coreference&#8722;Syntax[+/&#8722;]Salience[+/&#8722;]).
    Finally, the contribution of salience was measured by comparing the full model which accounts separately for patterns of salient and non-salient entities against models that do not attempt to discriminate between them (Coreference[+/&#8722;]Syntax[+/&#8722;]Salience&#8722;).
    We would like to note that in this experiment we apply a coreference resolution tool to the original text and then generate permutations for the pairwise ranking task.
    An alternative design is to apply coreference resolution to permuted texts.
    Because existing methods for coreference resolution take into consideration the order of noun phrases in a text, the accuracy of these tools on permuted sente
