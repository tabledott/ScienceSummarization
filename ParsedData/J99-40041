ions using the operations of a semiring.
    The system allows a single, simple representation to be used for describing parsers that compute recognition, derivation forests, Viterbi, n-best, inside values, and other values, simply by substituting the operations of different semirings.
    We also show how to use the same representation, interpreted differently, to compute outside values.
    The system can be used to describe a wide variety of parsers, including Earley's algorithm, tree adjoining grammar parsing, Graham Harrison Ruzzo parsing, and prefix value computation.
  
  
    For a given grammar and string, there are many interesting quantities we can compute.
    We can determine whether the string is generated by the grammar; we can enumerate all of the derivations of the string; if the grammar is probabilistic, we can compute the inside and outside probabilities of components of the string.
    Traditionally, a different parser description has been needed to compute each of these values.
