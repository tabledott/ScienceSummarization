x, distributions with fewer non-zero parameters.
    Starting from the model from Section 2, we propose the following Bayesian extension, where A &#8212; Dir(B) means the random variable A is distributed according to a Dirichlet with parameter B: The parameters &#945;X and &#945;C control the sparsity of the two distributions in our model.
    One is the distribution of the three possible branching choices.
    The other is the distribution of the phrase pairs. &#945;C is crucial, since the multinomial it is controlling has a high dimension.
    By adjusting &#945;C to a very small number, we hope to place more posterior mass on parsimonious solutions with fewer but more confident and general phrase pairs.
    Having defined the Bayesian model, it remains to decide the inference procedure.
    We chose Variational Bayes, for its procedural similarity to EM and ease of implementation.
    Another potential option would be Gibbs sampling (or some other sampling technique).
    However, in experiments in unsuper
