 who had the highest ranked system in the closed challenge, integrate syntactic and semantic analysis in a final reranking step, which maximizes the joint syntactic-semantic score in the top k solutions.
    In the same spirit, Chen et al. (2008) search in the top k solutions for the one that maximizes a global measure, in this case the joint probability of the complete problem.
    These joint learning strategies are summarized in the Joint Learning/Opt. column in the table.
    The system of Riedel and MezaRuiz (2008) deserves a special mention: even though Riedel and Meza-Ruiz did not implement a syntactic parser, they are the only group that performed the complete SRL subtask &#8211; i.e., predicate identification and classification, argument identification and classification &#8211; jointly, simultaneously for all the predicates in a sentence.
    They implemented a joint SRL model using Markov Logic Networks and they selected the overall best solution using inference based on the cutting-plane algorithm
