ill demonstrate in the next few pages.
    Intuitively, the principle is simple: model all that is known and assume nothing about that which is unknown.
    In other words, given a collection of facts, choose a model consistent with all the facts, but otherwise as uniform as possible.
    This is precisely the approach we took in selecting our model p at each step in the above example.
    The maximum entropy concept has a long history.
    Adopting the least complex hypothesis possible is embodied in Occam's razor (&amp;quot;Nunquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necesitate.&amp;quot;) and even appears earlier, in the Bible and the writings of Herotodus (Jaynes 1990).
    Laplace might justly be considered the father of maximum entropy, having enunciated the underlying theme 200 years ago in his &amp;quot;Principle of Insufficient Reason:&amp;quot; when one has no information to distinguish between the probability of two events, the best strategy is to consider them equally likely (Guiasu and Shenitzer 1985).
