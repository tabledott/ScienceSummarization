very well to the English subclasses created by the intersective class.
    The conative alternation in Portuguese is mainly contra (against), and the apart alternation is mainly separando (separating).
    For example, Eu puxei o ramo e o galho separando-os (I pulled the twig and the branch apart), and Ele empurrou contra a parede (He pushed against the wall).
    We also investigated the Portuguese translation of some intersective classes of motion verbs.
    We selected the slide/roll/run, meander/roll and roll/run intersective classes.
    Most verbs have more than one translation into Portuguese, so we chose the translation that best described the meaning or that had the same type of arguments as described in Levin's verb classes.
    The elements of the slide/roll/run class are rebater (bounce), flutuar (float), rolar (roll) and deslizar (slide).
    The resultative in Portuguese cannot be expressed in the same way as in English.
    It takes a gerund plus a reflexive, as in A porta deslizou abrindo-se (
