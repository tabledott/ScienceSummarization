    (As before, P(E) is 0.333.)
    For comparison, we repeat here the kappa coefficients of the experts (K*), taken from Table 4.
    It is encouraging to see that we can collect a large amount of rank labels from MTurk.
    That said, we still need to guard against data from bad workers, who are either not being faithful and clicking randomly, or who might simply not be competent enough.
    Case in point, if we examine interand intra-annotator agreement on the MTurk data (Table 11), we see th
