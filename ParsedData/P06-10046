    This similarity plot reveals a block structure where true boundaries delimit blocks of text with high inter-sentential similarity.
    Sentences found in different blocks, on the other hand, tend to exhibit low similarity.
    Formalizing the Objective Whereas previous unsupervised approaches to segmentation rested on intuitive notions of similarity density, we formalize the objective of text segmentation through cuts on graphs.
    We aim to jointly maximize the intra-segmental similarity and minimize the similarity between different segments.
    In other words, we want to find the segmentation with a maximally homogeneous set of segments that are also maximally different from each other.
    Let G = {V, E} be an undirected, weighted graph, where V is the set of nodes corresponding to sentences in the text and E is the set of weighted edges (See Figure 2).
    The edge weights, w(u, v), define a measure of similarity between pairs of nodes u and v, where higher scores indicate higher similarity.
