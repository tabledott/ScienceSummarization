ill, they mean that the planning problem can be reduced to that of planning a sequence.
    The next experiments were an attempt to evaluate this idea.
  
  
    The genetic algorithm we used takes the following form: Notice that although the algorithm manipulates sequences, the evaluation is one that operates on trees.
    Mutation is a unary operation which, given one sequence, generates a new one.
    Crossover is binary in that it generates new solution(s) based on two existing ones.
    The choice of mutation and crossover operations depends on how the sequences are internally represented and should facilitate the exchange of useful subparts of solutions.
    Two different representations have been tried so far.
    The relevant features are summarised in Figure 3.
    The ordinal representation [Michalewicz 92] assumes that there is an initial canonical sequence of facts (in the figure, this is assumed to be 1,2,3,4).
    A given sequence is represented by a sequence of numbers, where the ith element in
