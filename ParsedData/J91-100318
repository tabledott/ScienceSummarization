    In the latter instance the roommate understands the utterance as metaphorical (ibid., p. 51).
    In a similar way, Ortony (1980) suggests that metaphor should be thought of as contextually anomalous.
    This means that a literal interpretation of the expression, be it a word, phrase, sentence, or an even larger unit of text, fails to fit the context (p. 73, his italics), so whether or not a sentence is a metaphor depends upon the context in which it is used: if something is a metaphor then it will be contextually anomalous if interpreted literally.... Insofar as the violation of selection restrictions can be interpreted in terms of semantic incompatibilities at the lexical level, such violations may sometimes be the basis of the contextual anomaly (ibid., p. 74).
    2.1.4 The Conventional Metaphor View.
    Lakoff and Johnson (1980) have popularized the idea of conventional metaphors, also known as conceptual metaphors.
    They distinguish three main kinds: orientational, ontological, and structural.
