s ofnatural language utterances and no others.
  This holy grail, of course, is just the goal of knowledge representation for natural language in general; we are unlikely to be able to rely on a full solution soon.
  However, by looking at approximations of this goal, suitably adapted to the particular problems of generation, we can hope to achieve some progress.
  In the case of approximations, it does not hold that the two methodologies reduce one to another; in this case, we feel that the second approach--designing a logical language that approximates in its canonical forms those needed for grammatical applications-qs more likely to yield good incremental results.
