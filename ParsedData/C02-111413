of in struments rather than a single instrument, etc. The only exceptions we have made are the terms wynd and planetology (marked in bold), whichare not in WordNet but are correct nonethe less.
			These conditions are at least as stringent as those of previous experiments, particularly those of Riloff and Shepherd (1997) who also give credit for words associated with but not belonging to a particular category.
			(It has been pointed out that many polysemous words may occur in several classes, making the task easier because for many words there are several classes which our algorithm would give credit for.)With these conditions, our algorithm re trieves only 36 incorrect terms out of a total of 200, giving an accuracy of 82%.
			5.3 Analysis.
			Our results are an order of magnitude better than those reported by Riloff and Shepherd (1997) and Roark and Charniak (1998), whoreport average accuracies of 17% and 35% re spectively.
			(Our results are also slightly better than those reported by Riloff and Jones (1
