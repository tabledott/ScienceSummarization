es in order to create new applications.
    For example, many other NLP tasks might require a sentence splitter and POS tagger, but would not necessarily require resources more specific to IE tasks such as a named entity transducer.
    The system is in use for a variety of IE and other tasks, sometimes in combination with other sets of application-specific modules.
    ANNIE consists of the following main processing resources: tokeniser, sentence splitter, POS tagger, gazetteer, finite state transducer (based on GATE's built-in regular expressions over annotations language (Cunningham et al., 2002)), orthomatcher and coreference resolver.
    The resources communicate via GATE's annotation API, which is a directed graph of arcs bearing arbitrary feature/value data, and nodes rooting this data into document content (in this case text).
    The tokeniser splits text into simple tokens, such as numbers, punctuation, symbols, and words of different types (e.g. with an initial capital, all upper case, etc.).
