    A possible fourth reason may have to do with questions about the utility of the data.
    For example, a Web-based parallel collection may be unpredictable in terms of its coverage, and the community is well aware of the dangers of using training data that are not representative of the test domain.
    A solution to this problem might be to extract topically relevant subsets of the collection for particular domains or appl
