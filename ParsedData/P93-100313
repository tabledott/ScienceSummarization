(mouse).
    Here again, even if the best correspondence were made the result would be wrong because of the relatively sophisticated considerations involved in the translation.
  
  
    As regards future possibilities, the algorithm lends itself to a range of improvements and applications, which are outlined next.
    Finding Word Correspondences: The algorithm finds corresponding noun phrases but provides no information about word-level correspondences within them.
    One possibility is simply to eliminate the tagger and noun phrase recognizer (treating all words as individual phrases of length unity and having a larger number of correspondences).
    Alternatively, the following strategy can be adopted, which involves fewer total correspondences.
    First, the algorithm is used to build noun phrase correspondences, then the phrase pairs that are produced are themselves treated as a bilingual noun phrase corpus.
    The algorithm is then employed again on this corpus, treating all words as individual phra
