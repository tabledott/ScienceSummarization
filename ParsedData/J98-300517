    This work studies how various discourse processing techniques (e.g., rhetorical structure relations) can be used to both identify important information and form the actual summary.
    While promising, this work does not involve an implementation as of yet, but provides a framework and strategies for future work.
    Marcu (1997) uses a rhetorical parser to build rhetorical structure trees for arbitrary texts and produces a summary by extracting sentences that span the major rhetorical nodes of the tree.
    In addition to domain-specific information extraction systems, there has also been a large body of work on identifying people and organizations in text through proper noun extraction.
    These are domain-independent techniques that can also be used to extract information for a summary.
    Techniques for proper noun extraction include the use of regular grammars to delimit and identify proper nouns (Mani et al. 1993; Paik et al.
