ptures the translation of source language words into the target language and the reordering of those words.
    The language model ranks the outputs of the translation model by how well they adhere to the syntactic constraints of the target language.1 The prime deficiency of the IBM model is the reordering component.
    Even in the most complex of 'Though usually a simple word n-gram model is used for the language model. the five IBM models, the reordering operation pays little attention to context and none at all to higherlevel syntactic structures.
    Many attempts have been made to remedy this by incorporating syntactic information into translation models.
    These have taken several different forms, but all share the basic assumption that phrases in one language tend to stay together (i.e. cohere) during translation and thus the word-reordering operation can move entire phrases, rather than moving each word independently.
