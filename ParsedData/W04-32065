corpus, (Glickman and Dagan, 2003) developed statistical methods that match verb paraphrases within a regular corpus.
    Their limited scale results, obtaining several hundred verb paraphrases from a 15 million word corpus, suggest that much larger corpora are required.
    Naturally, the largest available corpus is the Web.
    Since exhaustive processing of the Web is not feasible, (Duclaye et al., 2002) and (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) attempted bootstrapping approaches, which resemble the mutual bootstrapping method for Information Extraction of (Riloff and Jones, 1999).
    These methods start with a provided known set of anchors for a target meaning.
    For example, the known anchor set {Mozart, 1756} is given as input in order to find paraphrases for the template &#8216;X born in Y&#8217;.
    Web searching is then used to find occurrences of the input anchor set, resulting in new templates that are supposed to specify the same relation as the original one (&#8220;born in&#8221;).
    These new temp
