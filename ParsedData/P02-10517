simple translation patterns.
    Therefore, we will not address them in this paper.
    Instead we will focus on person names, locations, and organizations.
    But before we present further details, we will discuss how words can be transliterated (i.e., &#8220;sounded-out&#8221;), which is a crucial component of our named entity translation algorithm.
    Transliteration is the process of replacing words in the source language with their approximate phonetic or spelling equivalents in the target language.
    Transliteration between languages that use similar alphabets and sound systems is very simple.
    However, transliterating names from Arabic into English is a non-trivial task, mainly due to the differences in their sound and writing systems.
    Vowels in Arabic come in two varieties: long vowels and short vowels.
    Short vowels are rarely written in Arabic in newspaper text, which makes pronunciation and meaning highly ambiguous.
    Also, there is no oneto-one correspondence between Arabic sounds
