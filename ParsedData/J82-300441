    Then you can turn it around in your mind, so to speak; however, it seems at the moment you can see it another way; you never come to a full stop.
    (Minsky 1981, p. 19) In each of these representation schemes, we have introduced five primitive grammars: Catalan, Unit Step, 1, and 0, and terminals; and four composition rules: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    We have seen that it is often possible to employ these analytic tools in order to re-organize (compile) the grammar into a form more suitable for processing efficiently.
    We have identified certain situations where the ambiguity is combinatoric, and have sketched a few modifications to the grammar that enable processing to proceed in a more efficient manner.
    In particular, we have observed it to be important for the grammar to avoid referencing quantities that are not easily determined, such as the dividing point between a noun phrase and a prepositional phrase as in (55) Put the block in the box on the table in
