curacy on the entire training data (R250) at each iteration of learning.
    We see that the AGGRESSIVE approach learns to cover more of the training data and at a faster rate than DIRECT.
    Note that the performance of the DIRECT approach drops at the first iteration.
    We hypothesize this is due to imbalances in the binary feedback dataset (too many negative examples) in the first iteration.
  
  
    Learning to map sentences to a meaning representation has been studied extensively in the NLP community.
    Early works (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Tang and Mooney, 2000) employed inductive logic programming approaches to learn a semantic parser.
    More recent works apply statistical learning methods to the problem.
    In (Ge and Mooney, 2005; Nguyen et al., 2006), the input to the learner consists of complete syntactic derivations for the input sentences annotated with logical expressions.
    Other works (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Kate and Mooney, 2006; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collin
