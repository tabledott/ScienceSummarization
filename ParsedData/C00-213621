s, starting with the seed pat- te, nls in section 3.d.
  This view on the discovery procedure is closely related to the MUC %ext- till;ering" task, in which the systems are jlulged at the ]evel of doc,wm, e,nt.s rather thmt event slots.
  It; is interesting to (:omt)m:e Exl)IsCOs results with how other MUC-6 part]tit)ants performed on the MUC-b   test cortms , shown anonymously.
  ExDIscO attains values within the range of the MUC participald;S, all of which were either heavily-supervised or m~mually coded systems.
  II; is important to bear in mind that Ex I ) I sco had no benefit of training material, or any in- tbrmation beyond the seed pattern set.
  Figure 2 shows the 1)ertbrmance, of text fil- tering on the Acquisition task, again, given the seed in section 3.4.
  ExDisco  was trained on |;lie same WSJ eorlms, and tested against a set of 200 documents.
  We retrieved this set using keyword-based IR, search, and judged their rel- evance by halId.
  rThesc judgements constituted the truth which was used o
