, and not all metrics were verified to produce the same scores as submitted at NIST in time for publication.
    Any such caveats are reported with the description of the metrics above.
    The results reported here are limited to a comparison of metric scores on the full WMT10 test set with human assessments on the humanassessed subset.
    An analysis comparing the human assessments with the automatic metrics run only on the human-assessed subset will follow at a later date.
    The WMT10 system output used to generate the reported metric scores was found to have improperly escaped characters for a small number of segments.
    While we plan to regenerate the metric scores with this issue resolved, we do not expect this to significantly alter the results, given the small number of segments affected.
    The tables in Appendix B list the metric scores for the language pairs processed by each metric.
    These first four tables present scores for translations out of English into Czech, French, German and Span
