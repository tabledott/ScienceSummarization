ion comparisons between our model and alternative ordering strategies are important if we want to pursue this approach further.
    Several improvements can take place with respect to the model.
    An obvious question is whether a trigram model performs better than the model presented here.
    The greedy algorithm implements a search procedure with a beam of width one.
    In the future we plan to experiment with larger widths (e.g., two or three) and also take into account features that express semantic similarities across documents either by relying on WordNet or on automatic clustering methods.
