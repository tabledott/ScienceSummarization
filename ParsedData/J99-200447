y trees are of two kinds: (a) Initial Trees and (b) Auxiliary Trees.
    In an FB-LTAG grammar for natural language, initial trees are phrase structure trees of simple sentences containing no recursion, while recursive structures are represented by auxiliary trees.
    Examples of initial trees (as) and auxiliary trees (i3s) are shown in Figure 6.
    Nodes on the frontier of initial trees are marked as substitution sites by a &amp;quot;i&amp;quot;, while exactly one node on the frontier of an auxiliary tree, whose label matches the label of the root of the tree, is marked as a foot node by a &amp;quot;*&amp;quot;.
    The other nodes on the frontier of an auxiliary tree are marked as substitution sites.
    Each node of an elementary tree is associated with two feature structures (FS), Elementary trees for the sentence: the company is being acquired. the top and the bottom.
    The bottom FS contains information relating to the subtree rooted at the node, and the top FS contains information relating to the s
