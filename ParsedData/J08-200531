ality constraints are all linear in terms of the variables.
  The only difference in an integer linear program is that the variables can only take integers as their values.
  In our inference problem, the variables are in fact binary.
  A general binary integer linear programming problem can be stated as follows.
  Given a cost vector p ?
  d, a collection of variables u = (u1, .
  ,ud) and cost ma- trices C1 ?
  d , where c1 and c2 are the numbers of inequality and equality constraints and d is the number of binary variables, the ILP solution u?
  is the vector that maximizes the cost function, u?
  u subject to C1u ?
  b1, and C2u = b2 where b1 ?
  c2 , and for all u ?
  {0, 1}d. To solve the problem of Equation (2) in this setting, we first reformulate the original cost function ?M i=1 score(S i = ci) as a linear function over several binary vari- ables, and then represent the filter function F using linear inequalities and equalities.
  We set up a bijection from the semantic labeling to the variable set
