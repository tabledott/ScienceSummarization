 the probabilities of all trees that produce the string as terminal leaves (see Equation 1).
    In the beam search approach outlined above, we can estimate the string's probability in the same manner, by summing the probabilities of the parses that the algorithm finds.
    Since this is not an exhaustive search, the parses that are returned will be a subset of the total set of trees that would be used in the exact PCFG estimate; hence the estimate thus arrived at will be bounded above by the probability that would be generated from an exhaustive search.
    The hope is that a large amount of the probability mass will be accounted for by the parses in the beam.
    The method cannot overestimate the probability of the string.
    Recall the discussion of the grammar models above, and our definition of the set of partial derivations Dw, with respect to a prefix string wil) (see Equations 2 and 7).
    By definition, Note that the numerator at word wj is the denominator at word w1+1, so that the product of all
