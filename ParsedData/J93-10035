    The assumption that simple functions of the random variables being sampled are distributed normally or approximately normally underlies many common statistical tests.
    This particularly includes Pearson's x2 test and z-score tests.
    This assumption is absolutely valid in many cases.
    Due to the simplification of the methods involved, it is entirely justifiable even in marginal cases.
    When comparing the rates of occurrence of rare events, the assumptions on which these tests are based break down because texts are composed largely of such rare events.
    For example, simple word counts made on a moderate-sized corpus show that words that have a frequency of less than one in 50,000 words make up about 20-30% of typica
