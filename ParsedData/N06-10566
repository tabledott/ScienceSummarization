f formalizing syntax-based translation models (Melamed, 2004; Chiang, 2005).
    According to this theory, a semantic parser defines a translation, a set of pairs of strings in which each pair is an NL sentence coupled with its MR. To finitely specify a potentially infinite translation, we use a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) for generating the pairs in a translation.
    Analogous to an ordinary CFG, each SCFG rule consists of a single non-terminal on the left-hand side (LHS).
    The right-hand side (RHS) of an SCFG rule is a pair of strings, (&#945;, Q), where the non-terminals in 0 are a permutation of the non-terminals in &#945;.
    Below are some SCFG rules that can be used for generating the parse trees in Figure 3: Each SCFG rule X &#8594; (&#945;, Q) is a combination of a production of the NL semantic grammar, X &#8594; &#945;, and a production of the MRL grammar, X &#8594; Q.
    Each rule corresponds to a transformation rule in Kate et al. (2005).
    Following their terminology, we call
