n is dictated by templettes.
    Event templettes are frame-like structures with slots representing the event basic information, such as main event participants, event outcome, time and location.
    For each type of event, a separate templette is defined.
    The slots fills consist of excerpts from text with pointers back into the original source material.
    Templettes are designed to support event-based browsing and search.
    Figure 1 illustrates a templette defined for &#8220;market changes&#8221; as well as the source of the slot fillers.

    To date, some of the most successful IE techniques are built around a set of domain relevant linguistic patterns based on select verbs (e.g. fall, gain or lose for the &#8220;market change&#8221; topic).
    These patterns are matched against documents for identifying and extracting domain-relevant information.
    Such patterns are either handcrafted or acquired automatically.
