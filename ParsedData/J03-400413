se only those adjectives that have 10 synsets or less in WordNet and have 20 or more occurrences in the BNC.
    The set of ncs in P are selected from all the possibilities in the hyponym hierarchy according to the minimum description length (MDL) principle (Rissanen 1978) as used by Li and Abe (1995, 1998).
    MDL finds the best TCM by considering the cost (in bits) of describing both the model and the argument head data encoded in the model.
    The cost (or description length) for a TCM is calculated according to equation (10).
    The number of parameters of the model is given by k, which is the number of ncs in P minus one.
    N is the sample of the argument head data.
    The cost of describing each noun argument head (n) is calculated by the log of the probability estimate for that noun: description length = model description length + data description length Adjective classes that include fundamental.
    The probability estimate for each n is obtained using the estimates for all the nss that n has.
