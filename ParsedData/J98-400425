 tree representations in the WSJ corpus into something close to the alternative tree representations described above, although the diversity of local trees in the WSJ corpus makes this task more difficult.
    For example, what is the Chomsky adjunction representation of a VP with no apparent verbal head?
    In addition, the Chomsky adjunction representation requires argument PPs to be attached as sisters of the lexical head, while adjunct PPs are attached as sisters of a nonlexical projection.
    Argument PPs are not systematically distinguished from adjunct PPs in the Penn II tree representations, and reliably determining whether a particular PP is an argument or an adjunct is extremely difficult, even for trained linguists.
    Nevertheless, the tree transformations investigated below should give at least an initial idea as to the influence of different kinds of tree representation on the induced PCFG language models.
    The tree transformations investigated in this section are listed below.
