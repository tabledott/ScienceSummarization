 a super- or sub-string of the phrase 73% of the time.
    There are a number of strategies that might be adopted to alleviate this problem: &#8226; We could change the phrase extraction heuristic&#8217;s treatment of unaligned words, or we could attempt to ensure that we have fewer unaligned items in our word alignments.
    &#8226; The paraphrase criterion could be changed from being e2 =&#65533; e1 to specifying that e2 is not sub- or super-string of e1.
    In this paper we adopt a different strategy.
    The essence of our strategy is to constrain paraphrases to be the same syntactic type as the phrases that they are paraphrasing.
    Syntactic constraints can apply in two places: during phrase extraction and when substituting paraphrases into sentences.
    These are described in sections 3.1 and 3.2.
    When we apply syntactic constraints to the phrase extraction heuristic, we change how bilingual phrase pairs are enumerated and how the component probabilities of the paraphrase probability are calcula
