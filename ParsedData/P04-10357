 and n edges (vi, t), each with weight ind2(xi).
    Finally, add (n ) edges (vi, vk), each with weight assoc(xi, xk).
    Then, cuts in G are defined as follows: Definition 1 A cut (S, T) of G is a partition of its nodes into sets S = {s} U S0 and T = {t} U T0, where s &#8712;&#65533; S0, t &#8712;&#65533; T0.
    Its cost cost(S, T) is the sum of the weights of all edges crossing from S to T. A minimum cut of G is one of minimum cost.
    Observe that every cut corresponds to a partition of the items and has cost equal to the partition cost.
    Thus, our optimization problem reduces to finding minimum cuts.
    Practical advantages As we have noted, formulating our subjectivity-detection problem in terms of graphs allows us to model item-specific and pairwise information independently.
    Note that this is a very flexible paradigm.
    For instance, it is perfectly legitimate to use knowledge-rich algorithms employing deep linguistic knowledge about sentiment indicators to derive the individual scores.
