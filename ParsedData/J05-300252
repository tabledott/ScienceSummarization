interesting mistakes that we encountered during system development.
    Mistakes in Content Selection.
    Most of the mistakes in content selection can be attributed to problems with alignment.
    In most cases (17), erroneous alignments missed relevant word mappings as a result of the lack of a corresponding entry in our paraphrasing resources.
    At the same time, mapping of unrelated words (as shown in Table 5) was quite rare (two cases).
    This performance level is quite predictable given the accuracy of an automatically constructed dictionary and limited coverage of WordNet.
    Even in the presence of accurate lexical information, the algorithm occasionally produced suboptimal alignments (four cases) because of the simplicity of our weighting scheme, which supports limited forms of mapping typology and also uses manually assigned weights.
    Another source of errors (two cases) was the algorithm&#8217;s inability to handle many-to-many alignments.
    Namely, two trees conveying the same meaning m
