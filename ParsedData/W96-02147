 he did not parse sentences containing unknown words, effectively throwing out the most difficult sentences.
    Furthermore, Sima'an limited the number of substitution sites for his trees, effectively using a subset of the DOP model.
    Unfortunately, Bod's reduction to a STSG is extremely expensive, even when throwing away 95% of the grammar.
    Fortunately, it is possible to find an equivalent PCFG that contains exactly eight PCFG rules for each node in the training data; thus it is 0(n).
    Because this reduction is so much smaller, we do not discard any of the grammar when using it.
    The PCFG is equivalent in two senses: first it generates the same strings with the same probabilities; second, using an isomorphism defined below, it generates the same trees with the same probabilities, although one must sum over several PCFG trees for each STSG tree.
    To show this reduction and equivalence, we must first define some terminology.
    We assign every node in every tree a unique number, which we will
