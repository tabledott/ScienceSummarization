onvenient for constructing a confusion network in the next step of the algorithm.
    Given the M&#8722;1 monotone one-to-one alignments, the transformation to a confusion network as described by (Bangalore et al., 2001) is straightforward.
    It is explained by the example in Figure 1.
    Here, the original 4 hypotheses are shown, followed by the alignment of the reordered secondary hypotheses 2-4 with the primary hypothesis 1.
    The alignment is shown with the  |symbol, and the words of the primary hypothesis are to the right of this symbol.
    The symbol $ denotes a null alignment or an e-arc in the corresponding part of the confusion network, which is shown at the bottom of the figure.
    Note that the word &#8220;have&#8221; in translation 2 is aligned to the word &#8220;like&#8221; in translation 1.
    This alignment is acceptable considering the two translations alone.
    However, given the presence of the word &#8220;have&#8221; in translation 4, this is not the best alignment.
    Yet the pro
