n, validating that it indeed was a word group exhibiting semantic coherence.
    Source collocations that seemed incorrect (i.e., mistakenly identified as collocations by XTRACT) were removed from further consideration.
    The evaluators then classified the translations of the remaining collocations as either correct or incorrect.
    In this way, we decoupled the evaluation of Champollion from the errors made by XTRACT.
    It is clear that our classification scheme is not perfect because some cases are difficult to judge.
    The judges were not especially familiar with the institutionalized differences between Canadian French and continental French (which is the form of French they speak).
    For example, without knowledge of Canadian French, it is difficult to judge if the translation of affirmative action is action positive since this term is not used in other forms of French.
    One of the biggest problems for the evaluators was scoring translations of collocations with prepositions and articles.
