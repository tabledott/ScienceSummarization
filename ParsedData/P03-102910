 and the second term to the inverse document frequency in TF/IDF scoring. is used to control the weight on the IDF portion of this scoring function.
    The in Equation (1) is used to parameterize the weight on the IDF portion of the ranking function.
    As we pointed out in Section 2, we need to pay special attention to overlapping patterns; the more relevant context a pattern contains, the higher it should be ranked.
    The weight serves to focus on how specific a pattern is to a given scenario.
    Therefore, for high value, (triggered (explosion-OBJ)( C-DATE ADV)) is ranked higher than (triggered ( C-DATE ADV)) in the terrorism scenario, for example.
    Figure 2 shows the improvement of the extraction performance by tuning on the entity extraction task which will be discussed in the next section.
    For unsupervised tuning of, we used a pseudoextraction task, instead of using held-out data for supervised learning.
    We used an unsupervised version of the text classification task to optimize, assumin
