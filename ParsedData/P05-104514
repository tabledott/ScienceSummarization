pute counts of different types of violations.
    Label consistency structure derives from the fact that within a particular document, different occurrences of a particular token sequence are unlikely to be labeled as different entity types.
    Although any one occurrence may be ambiguous, it is unlikely that all instances are unclear when taken together.
    The CoNLL training data empirically supports the strength of the label consistency constraint.
    Table 3 shows the counts of entity labels for each pair of identical token sequences within a document, where both are labeled as an entity.
    Note that inconsistent labelings are very rare.6 In addition, we also want to model subsequence constraints: having seen Geoff Woods earlier in a document as a person is a good indicator that a subsequent occurrence of Woods should also be labeled as a person.
    However, if we examine all cases of the labelings of other occurrences of subsequences of a labeled entity, we find that the consistency constraint does
