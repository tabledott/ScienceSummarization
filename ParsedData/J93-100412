    It ought to be possible to achieve fairly reasonable results with much less computation.
    The IBM algorithm is much more efficient since they were able to extract nearly 3 million pairs of sentences from Hansard materials in 10 days of running time on an IBM Model 3090 mainframe computer with access to 16 megabytes of virtual memory (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991).
    The evaluation of results has been absent or rudimentary.
    Kay gives positive examples of the alignment process, but no counts of error rates.
    Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) report that they achieve a 0.6% error rate when the algorithm suggests aligning one sentence with one sentence.
    However, they do not characterize its performance overall or on the more difficult cases.
    Since the research community has not had access to a practical sentence alignment program, w
