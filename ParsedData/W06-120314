of MWEs to determine whether a given MWE indeed has noncompositional uses at all.
    In this experiment we made use of a test set of German Preposition-Noun-Verb &#8220;collocation candidate&#8221; database whose extraction is described by Krenn (2000) and which has been made available electronically.5 From this database only word combinations with frequency of occurrence more than 30 in our test corpus were considered.
    Our task was to classify these 81 potential MWEs according whether or not thay have an idiomatic meaning.
    To accomplish this task we took the following approach.
    We computed on the basis of the distribution of the components of the MWE an estimate for the compositional meaning vector for the MWE.
    We then compared this to the actual vector for the MWE as a whole, with the expectation MWEs which indeed have non-compositinoal uses will be distinguished by a relatively low vector similarity between the estimated compositional meaning vector and the actual meaning vector.
