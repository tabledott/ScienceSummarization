 minor reason may be the use of automatic parse-trees to extract PAF and SCF, even if preliminary experiments on automatic semantic shallow parsing of PropBank have shown no important differences versus semantic parsing which adopts Gold Standard parse-trees.
  
  
    In this paper, we have experimented with SVMs using the two novel convolution kernels PAF and SCF which are designed for the semantic structures derived from PropBank and FrameNet corpora.
    Moreover, we have combined them with the polynomial kernel of standard features.
    The results have shown that: First, SVMs using the above kernels are appealing for semantically parsing both corpora.
    Second, PAF and SCF can be used to improve automatic classification of PropBank arguments as they provide clues about the predicate argument structure of the target verb.
    For example, SCF improves (a) the classification state-of-theart (i.e. the polynomial kernel) of about 3 percent points and (b) the best literature result of about 5 percent point
