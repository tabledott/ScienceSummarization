			is not enough to determine their relationship.
			Obviously, context-sensitive tree spans should have the potential for better performance.
			One problem with the context-sensitive tree span explored in Zhang et al(2006) is that it only considers the availability of entities?
			siblings and fails to consider following two factors: 1) Whether is the information contained in SPT enough to determine the relationship between two entities?
			It depends.
			In the embedded cases, SPT is enough.
			For example, ?John?s wife?
			is enough to determine the relationship between ?John?
			and ?John?s wife?
			in the sentence ?John?s wife got a good job?
			as shown in Figure 1(a) . However, SPT is not enough in the coordinated cases, e.g. to determine the relationship between ?John?
			and ?Mary?
			in the sentence ?John and Mary got married?
			as shown in Figure 1(e).
			1 CSPT means SPT extending with the 1st left sibling of.
			the node of entity 1 and the 1st right sibling of the node of entity 2.
