nstituents of the parse for evaluation are: 310 1.
  The prospect of cutting backspend ing 2. prospect of cutting back spending 3. of cutting back spending 4. cutting back spending 5. cutting back While both constituents 2 and 5 differ from the standard, only 2 qualif ies as a "crossing" violation, as 5 is merely a substring of a constituent of the standard parse.
