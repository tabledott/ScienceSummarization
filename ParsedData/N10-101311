 When contextual information is available, AvgSim and MaxSim can be modified to produce more precise similarity computations: where d&#65533;,w,k = d(v(c), 7rk(w)) is the likelihood of context c belonging to cluster 7rk(w), and &#65533;r(w) def= 7rargmax1&lt;k&lt;K dc,w,k(w), the maximum likelihood cluster for w in context c. Thus, AvgSimC corresponds to soft cluster assignment, weighting each similarity term in AvgSim by the likelihood of the word contexts appearing in their respective clusters.
    MaxSimC corresponds to hard assignment, using only the most probable cluster assignment.
    Note that AvgSim and MaxSim can be thought of as special cases of AvgSimC and MaxSimC with uniform weight to each cluster; hence AvgSimC and MaxSimC can be used to compare words in context to isolated words as well.
