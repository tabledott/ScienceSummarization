2002a; Hockenmaier 2003a), a CCG version of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).
    Penn Treebank conversions have also been carried out for other linguistic formalisms, including TAG (Chen and Vijay-Shanker 2000; Xia, Palmer, and Joshi 2000), LFG (Burke et al. 2004), and HPSG (Miyao, Ninomiya, and Tsujii 2004).
    CCGbank was created by converting the phrase-structure trees in the Penn Treebank into CCG normal-form derivations.
    Some preprocessing of the phrase-structure trees was required, in order to allow the correct CCG analyses for some constructions, such as coordination.
    Hockenmaier (2003a) gives a detailed description of the procedure used to create CCGbank.
    Figure 3 shows an example normal-form derivation for an (abbreviated) CCGbank sentence.
    The derivation has been inverted, so that it is represented as a binary tree.
    Sentence categories (S) in CCGbank carry features, such as [dcl] for declarative, [wq] for wh-questions, and [for] for small clauses he
