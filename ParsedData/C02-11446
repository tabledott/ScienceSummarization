			Bisecting K-means (Steinbach, Karypis, Kumar 2000), a variation of K-means, begins with a set containing one large cluster consisting of every element and iteratively picks the largest cluster in the set, splits it into two clusters and replaces it by the split clusters.
			Splitting a cluster consists of applying the basic K-means algorithm ? times with K=2 and keeping the split that has the highest average element centroid similarity.
			Hybrid clustering algorithms combine hierarchical and partitional algorithms in an attempt to have the high quality of hierarchical algorithms with the efficiency of partitional algorithms.
			Buckshot (Cutting, Karger, Pedersen, Tukey 1992) addresses the problem of randomly selecting initial centroids in K-means by combining it with average-link clustering.
			Buckshot first applies average-link to a random sample of n elements to generate K clusters.
			It then uses the centroids of the clusters as the initial K centroids of K-means clustering.
