nd with some concluding remarks and a discussion of future research directions in Section 6.
  
  
    There are many different algorithms for the generation of referring expressions, each with its own objectives: Some aim at producing the shortest possible description (e.g., Dale&#8217;s [1992] full brevity algorithm), others focus on psychological realism (e.g., Dale and Reiter&#8217;s [1995] incremental algorithm) or realistic output (e.g., Horacek 1997).
    The degree of detail in which the various algorithms are described differs considerably.
    Some algorithms are fully formalized and come with explicit characterizations of their complexity (e.g., Dale and Reiter 1995; van Deemter 2000); others are more conceptual and concentrate on exploring new directions (e.g., Stone and Webber 1998).
    Despite such differences, most algorithms deal with the same problem definition.
    They take as input a single object v (the target object) for which a referring expression is to be generated and a set of objec
