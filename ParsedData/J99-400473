tain conditions.
    Unlike our version of Earley's algorithm, Tendeau's version requires time O(n1) where L is the length of the longest right-hand side, as opposed to 0(n3) for the classic version, and for our description.
    While one could split right-hand sides of rules to make them binary branching, speeding Tendeau's version up, this would then change values in the derivation semirings.
    Tendeau (1997b, 1997a) introduces a parse forest semiring, similar to our derivation forest semiring, in that it encodes a parse forest succinctly.
    To implement this semiring, Tendeau's version of rule value functions take as their input not only a nonterminal, but also the span that it covers; this is somewhat less elegant than our version.
    Tendeau (1997a) gives a generic description for dynamic programming algorithms.
    His description is very similar to our item-based descriptions, except that it does not include side conditions.
    Thus, algorithms such as Earley's algorithm cannot be described in Te
