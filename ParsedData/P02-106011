be classified according to their semantics.
    This sub-feature applies to both single word and multiple words.
    This set of triggers is collected semi-automatically from the NEs and their local context of the training data. determined by finding a match in the gazetteer of the corresponding NE type where n (in Table 4) represents the word number in the matched word string.
    In stead of collecting gazetteer lists from training data, we collect a list of 20 public holidays in several countries, a list of 5,000 locations from websites such as GeoHive3, a list of 10,000 organization names from websites such as Yahoo4 and a list of 10,000 famous people from websites such as Scope Systems5.
    Gazetters have been widely used in NER systems to improve performance.
    For external evidence, only one external macro context feature 4 f , as shown in Table 5, is captured in our model.
    4 f is about whether and how the encountered NE candidate is occurred in the list of NEs already recognized from the docume
