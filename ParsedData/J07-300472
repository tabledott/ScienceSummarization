(Collins 1997)).
    However, in a lexicalized formalism such as CCG, there is the additional problem of missing lexical entries for known words.
    Because lexical categories play such an essential role in CCG, even a small fraction of missing lexical entries can have a significant effect on coverage, since the parser will not be able to obtain the correct analysis for any sentence that contains such a token.
    Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002) show that this lexical coverage problem does in practice have a significant impact on overall parsing accuracy.
    However, because many of the known words with missing entries do not appear very often in the training data, Hockenmaier (2003a) demonstrates that this problem can be partially alleviated if the frequency threshold below which rare words are treated as unseen is set to a much higher value than for standard Treebank parsers.
    An alternative approach, advocated by Clark and Curran (2004), is to use a supertagger which predicts lexical CCG categories in
