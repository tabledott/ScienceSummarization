tly, results achieved by individual measures may very well be due to chance (cf. sections 4.1 and 4.2), and evaluation with respect to frequency strata is not possible (cf. section 4.3).
    (2) For the same reason, it is impossible to determine recall values, which are important for many practical applications.
    (3) The introduction of new measures or changes to the calculation methods require additional manual evaluation, as new -best lists are generated.
    To improve the reliability of the evaluation results, a number of properties need to be controlled.
    We distinguish between two classes:
  
  
    The base data for our experiments are extracted from two corpora which differ with respect to size and text type.
    The base sets also differ with respect to syntactic homogeneity and grammatical correctness.
    Both candidate sets have been manually inspected for TPs.
    The first set comprises bigrams of adjacent, lemmatized AdjN pairs extracted from a small ( word) corpus of freely available Ger
