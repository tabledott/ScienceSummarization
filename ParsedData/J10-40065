    DSMs succeed in tasks like synonym detection (Landauer and Dumais 1997) or concept categorization (Almuhareb and Poesio 2004) because such tasks require a measure of attributional similarity that favors concepts that share many properties, such as synonyms and co-hyponyms.
    However, many other tasks require detecting different kinds of semantic similarity.
    Turney (2006b) defines relational similarity as the property shared by pairs of words (e.g, dog&#8211;animal and car&#8211;vehicle) linked by similar semantic relations (e.g., hypernymy), despite the fact that the words in one pair might not be attributionally similar to those in the other pair (e.g., dog is not attributionally similar to car, nor is animal to vehicle).
    Turney generalizes DSMs to tackle relational similarity and represents pairs of words in the space of the patterns that connect them in the corpus.
    Pairs of words that are connected by similar patterns probably hold similar relations, that is, they are relationally sim
