heir small size (remaining personal exemplars were mostly singletons) and lack of evidence on many single-mention web pages.
    Thus the task of accurately partitioning the two most common uses and clustering the residual examples for visual exploration may be a natural and practical use for these classification and visualization technologies.
  
  
    In this paper we have presented a set of algorithms for finding the real referents for ambiguous personal names in text using unsupervised clustering and feature extraction methods.
    In particular, we have shown how to learn and use automatically extracted biographic information to improve clustering results, and have demonstrated this improvement by evaluating on pseudonames.
    We have presented initial results on learning these patterns to extract biographic information for multiple languages, and intend to use these techniques for large-scale multilingual polysemous name clustering.
    The results presented here support the automatic clustering of po
