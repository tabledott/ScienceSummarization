 not a problem, 11 Indeed, we might want such incompleteness for certain cases of psycholinguis- tically motivated psrsing models such as the simulated Lit model described above.
  nFor reference, the grammar issimilar in spirit to the third sample grammar in [Shieber, 1986].
  asIt holds in general that closed-class lexical items---case-m~rking prepositions, function verbs, etc.~-are uniformly considered initial items for purposes of genera- tion because of their vestigial semantics.
  This is as desired, and follows from the operation of semantic filtering, rather than from any ad hoc techniques.
