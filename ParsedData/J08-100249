e is the harmonic mean of LP and LR.
    Sentence accuracy is the exact match accuracy of complete predicate&#8211;argument relations in a sentence.
    These measures correspond to those used in other studies measuring the accuracy of predicate&#8211;argument dependencies in CCG parsing (Clark, Hockenmaier, and Steedman 2002; Hockenmaier 2003; Clark and Curran 2004b) and LFG parsing (Burke et al. 2004), although exact figures cannot be compared directly because the definitions of dependencies are different.
    All predicate&#8211;argument dependencies in a sentence are the target of evaluation except quotation marks and periods.
    The accuracy is measured by parsing test sentences with gold-standard part-of-speech tags from the Penn Treebank unless otherwise noted.
    The Gaussian prior was used for smoothing (Chen and Rosenfeld 1999a), and its hyper-parameter was tuned for each model to maximize F-score for the development set.
    The algorithm for parameter estimation was the limited-memory BFGS metho
