fact of mapping from the PARTS tagset o ours is eliminated, and we obtain error rates of 2-6%.
  2.3.2 Manual Correction Stage.
  The result of the first, automated stage of POS tagging is given to annotators to correct.
  The annotators use a mouse-based package written 8 In contrast to the Brown Corpus, we do not allow compound tags of the sort illustrated above for Im.
  Rather, contractions and the Anglo-Saxon genitive of nouns are automatically split into their component morphemes, and each morpheme is tagged separately.
  Thus, childrens is tagged "children/NNS s/POS," and wont is tagged "wo-/MD nt/RB."
  9 The two largest sources of mapping error are that the PARTS tagset distinguishes neither infinitives from non-third person singular present tense forms of verbs, nor prepositions from particles in cases like run up a hill and run up a bill.
