e preventing many potential users from reaping many of the benefits of bilingual corpora, because the proposed solutions are often unavailable, unreliable, and/ or computationally prohibitive.
    Most of the previous work on sentence alignment has yet to be published.
    Kay's draft (Kay and Roscheisen; this issue), for example, was written more than two years ago and is still unpublished.
    Similarly the IBM work is also several years old, but not the le 0.610 the la 0.178 the l' 0.083 the les 0.023 the ce 0.013 the il 0.012 the de 0.009 the a 0.007 the que 0.007 very well documented in the published literature; consequently, there has been a lot of unnecessary subsequent work at ISSCO and elsewhere.2 The method we describe has the same sentence-length basis as does that of Brown, Lai, and Mercer, while the two differ considerably from the lexical approaches tried by Kay and Roscheisen and by Catizone, Russell, and Warwick.
    The feasibility of other methods has varied greatly.
    Kay's approach is ap
