gure 4(c) and figure 4(d) show the sealing operations, where STOP derivation steps are generated.
    The left and right marks on node labels represent left and right STOPs that have been generated.4 The basic inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979) can be used for re-estimation.
    For each sentence s E S, it gives us cs(x : i, j), the expected fraction of parses of s with a node labeled x extending from position i to position j.
    The model can be re-estimated from these counts.
    For example, to re-estimate an entry of PSTOP(STOP|h, left, non-adj) according to a current model O, we calculate two quantities.5 The first is the (expected) number of trees headed by h] whose rightmost edge i is strictly left of h. The second is the number of trees headed by Fh] with rightmost edge i strictly left of h. The ratio is the MLE of that local probability factor: This can be intuitively thought of as the relative number of times a tree headed by h had already taken at least one argument to the left, had an opportu
