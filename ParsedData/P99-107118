e quite different from typical language generators, we had to address the design of the input language specification and its interaction with existing features in a new way, instead of using the existing SURGE syntactic realization in a &amp;quot;black box&amp;quot; manner.
    As an example, consider the case of temporal modifiers.
    The DSYNT for an input phrase will simply note that it contains a prepositional phrase.
    FUF/SURGE, our language generator, requires that the input contain a semantic role, circumstantial which in turn contains a temporal feature.
    The labelling of the circumstantial as time allows SURGE to make the following decisions given a sentence such as: &amp;quot;After they made an emergency landing, the pilots were reported missing.&amp;quot; The semantic input also provides a solid basis to authorize sophisticated revisions to a base input.
    If the sentence planner decides to adjoin a source to the clause, SURGE can decide to move the time circumstantial to the end of the cl
