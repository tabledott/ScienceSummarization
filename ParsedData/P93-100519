 denoted by H2 .2 When a rule is applied to a non-terminal, it indicates which child will generate the lexical primary head and which child will generate the secondary lexical head.
    The proposed generative model associates for each constituent in the parse tree the probability: In HBG, we predict the syntactic and semantic labels of a constituent, its rewrite rule, and its two lexical heads using the labels of the parent constituent, the parent's lexical heads, the parent's rule Rp that lead to the constituent and the constituent's index Ipc as a child of Rp.
    As we discuss in a later section, we have also used with success more information about the derivation tree than the immediate parent in conditioning the probability of expanding a constituent.
    We have approximated the above probability by the following five factors: While a different order for these predictions is possible, we only experimented with this one.
    We only have built a decision tree to the rule probability component (3) of the
