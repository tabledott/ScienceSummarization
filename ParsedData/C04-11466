ctions p and q is defined (Cover and Thomas, 1991) as the ?inefficiency of assuming that the distribution is q when the true distribution is p?: D(p||q) = ? c p log p q .However, D(p||q) = ? if there are any con texts c for which p(c) &gt; 0 and q(c) = 0.
			Thus,this measure cannot be used directly on maxi mum likelihood estimate (MLE) probabilities.One possible solution is to use the JS diver gence measure, which measures the cost of usingthe average distribution in place of each individual distribution.
			Another is the ?-skew diver gence measure, which uses the p distribution tosmooth the q distribution.
			The value of the pa rameter ? controls the extent to which the KL divergence is approximated.
			We use ? = 0.99 since this provides a close approximation to the KL divergence and has been shown to provide good results in previous research (Lee, 2001).
			The confusion probability (Sugawara et al, 1985) is an estimate of the probability that one word can be substituted for another.
