ant for building applications for sublanguages?
    Can they be used?
    Is it better to use a language model based on a large general-language corpus or a relatively tiny corpus of the right kind of text?
    Nobody knows.
    There is currently no theory, no mathematical models, and almost no discussion.
    A related issue is that of porting an application from the sublanguage for which it was developed to another.
    It should be possible to use corpora for the two sublanguages to estimate how large a task this will be, but again, our understanding is in its infancy.
    Much work in recent years has gone into developing language models.
    Clearly, the statistics for different types of text will be different (Biber 1993).
    This imposes a limitation on the applicability of any language model: We can be confident only that it predicts the behavior of language samples of the same text type as the trainingdata text type (and we can be entirely confident only if training and test samples are random samp
