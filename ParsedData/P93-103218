rary, but was chosen following the intuition that one wanted to test the program's performance on verbs of at least moderate frequency.
    &amp;quot;The verb redesign does not appear in the OALD, so its subcategorization entry was determined by me, based on the entry in the OALD for design. egorization frame (that is in the resulting sub categorization dictionary).
    Table 3 then summarizes the results from the previous table.
    Lower bounds for the precision and recall of my induced sub categorization dictionary are approximately 90% and 43% respectively (looking at types).
    The aim in choosing error bounds for the filtering procedure was to get a highly accurate dictionary at the expense of recall, and the lower bound precision figure of 90% suggests that this goal was achieved.
    The lower bound for recall appears less satisfactory.
    There is room for further work here, but this does represent a pessimistic lower bound (recall the 82% token recall figure above).
    Many of the more obscure su
