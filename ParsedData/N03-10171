the use of phrase translation.
    Och et al. [1999]&#8217;s alignment template model can be reframed as a phrase translation system; Yamada and Knight [2001] use phrase translation in a syntaxbased translation system; Marcu and Wong [2002] introduced a joint-probability model for phrase translation; and the CMU and IBM word-based statistical machine translation systems' are augmented with phrase translation capability.
    Phrase translation clearly helps, as we will also show with the experiments in this paper.
    But what is the best method to extract phrase translation pairs?
    In order to investigate this question, we created a uniform evaluation framework that enables the comparison of different ways to build a phrase translation table.
    Our experiments show that high levels of performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.
    In fact, for most of the steps necessary to build a phrase-based system, tools and resources are freely available for researchers in the field.
