    Some generic data is supplied for common verbs, but this can be augmented by user supplied, possibly domain specific files.
    The resulting set of ranked parses can be displayed, or passed on for further processing, in a variety of formats which retain varying degrees of information from the full derivations.
    We originally proposed transforming derivation trees into a set of named grammatical relations (GRs), illustrated as a subsumption hierarchy in Figure 2, as a way of facilitating cross-system evaluation.
    The revised GR scheme captures those aspects of predicate-argument structure that the system is able to recover and is the most stable and grammar independent representation available.
    Revisions include a treatment of coordination in which the coordinator is the head in subsuming relations to enable appropriate semantic inferences, and addition of a text adjunct (punctuation) relation to the scheme.
