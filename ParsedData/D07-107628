traction while considering more ancestral nodes may not help.
			This may be due to that, although our experimentation on the training data indicates that more than 80% (on average) of subtrees has a root node path longer than 3 (since most of the subtrees are deep from the root node and more than 90% of the parsed trees in the training data are deeper than 6 levels), including a root node path longer than 3 may be vulnerable to the full parsing errors and have negative impact.
			Table 1 also evaluates the impact of entity-related information in our tree kernel by attaching entity type information (e.g. ?PER?
			in the entity node 1 of Figure 1(b)) into both entity nodes.
			It shows that such information can significantly improve the performance by ~6.0 in F-measure.
			In all the following experiments, we will apply our tree kernel with m=3 and entity-related information by default.
			Table 2 compares the dynamic context-sensitive tree span with SPT using our tree kernel.
			It shows that the dynamic tree
