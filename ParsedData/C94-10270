  PART-OF-SPEECH TAGGING WITH NEURAL NETWORKS Hehnut Schmid Institute for Computational Linguistics, Azenbergstr.12, 70174 Stuttgart, Germany, schmid@ims.uni-stuttgart.de Topic area: large text corpora, part-of-speech tag- ging, neural networks 1 ABSTRACT Text corpora which are tagged with part-of-speech in- formation are useful in many areas of linguistic re- search.
  In this paper, a new part-of-speech tagging method hased on neural networks (Net-Tagger) is pre- sented and its performance is compared to that of a llMM-tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) and a trigram- based tagger (Kempe, 1993).
  It is shown that the Net-Tagger performs as well as the trigram-based tag- ger and better than the iIMM-tagger.
