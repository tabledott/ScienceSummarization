  7.1 Trie-based Morphology Models The high precision on the MProj-covered subset also make these partial pairings effective training data for robust supervised algo- rithms that can generalize the string transformation behavior to the remaining uncovered vocabulary.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  This property is illustrated in Figure 9, showing a sample (inflection $ root) trie branch for French verbal inflections, with suffix histories  =?oie?,  =?noie?,  =?roie?, etc.
  At each history node, the hierarchically smoothed probabilities of several y $ w (inflection $ root) changes are given.
  Note that the relative probabilities of the competing analyses ie $ ir and ie $ yer differ substantially for diffent suffix histories, and that there are subexceptions that tend to cluster by affix history.
  This allows for the successful analysis of 8 of the 9 italicized test words that had not been seen in the bilingual projection data or where the MProj model yielded no root candidate above thr
