    Unfortunately, because katakana is a syllabary, we would be unable to express an obvious and useful generalization, namely that English K usually corresponds to Japanese k, independent of context.
    Moreover, the correspondence of Japanese katakana writing to Japanese sound sequences is not perfectly one-to-one (see Section 3.4), so an independent sound inventory is well-motivated in any case.
    Our Japanese sound inventory includes 39 symbols: 5 vowel sounds, 33 consonant sounds (including doubled consonants like kk), and one special symbol (pause).
    An English sound sequence like (P R OW PAUSE S AA K ER) might map onto a Japanese sound sequence like (p u r o pause s a kk a a).
    Note that long Japanese vowel sounds Knight and Graehl Machine Transliteration are written with two symbols (a a) instead of just one (aa).
    This scheme is attractive because Japanese sequences are almost always longer than English sequences.
    Our WFST is learned automatically from 8,000 pairs of English/Japa
