    Context vectors are widely used in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing.
    Most often they represent first order co&#8211;occurrences, which are simply words that occur near each other in a corpus of text.
    For example, police and car are likely first order co&#8211;occurrences since they commonly occur together.
    A first order context vector for a given word would simply indicate all the first order co&#8211;occurrences of that word as found in a corpus.
    However, our Gloss Vector measure is based on second order co&#8211;occurrences (Sch&#168;utze, 1998).
    For example, if car and mechanic are first order co&#8211; occurrences, then mechanic and police would be second order co&#8211;occurrences since they are both first order co&#8211;occurrences of car.
