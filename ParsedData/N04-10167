models for a given task, and indicate which model shows optimal performance on the development set (marked by a &#8216;#&#8217; in all subsequent tables).
    We then compare the test set performance of this optimal model to the performance of the models reported in the literature.
    It is important to note that the figures taken from the literature were typically obtained on the whole gold standard data set, and hence may differ from the performance on our test set.
    We work on the assumption that such differences are negligible.
    We use &#967;2 tests to determine whether the performance of the best web model on the test set is significantly different from that of the best BNC model.
    We also determine whether both models differ significantly from the baseline and from the best model in the literature.
    A set of diacritics is used to indicate significance throughout this paper, see Table 2.
