tence, identify and label the predicate?s seman tic arguments.
			This process entails identifying groups ofwords in a sentence that represent these semantic argu ments and assigning specific labels to them.
			In recent work, a number of researchers have cast thisproblem as a tagging problem and have applied vari ous supervised machine learning techniques to it (Gildea and Jurafsky (2000, 2002); Blaheta and Charniak (2000); Gildea and Palmer (2002); Surdeanu et al (2003); Gildea and Hockenmaier (2003); Chen and Rambow (2003); Fleischman and Hovy (2003); Hacioglu and Ward (2003); Thompson et al (2003); Pradhan et al (2003)).
			In this ?This research was partially supported by the ARDA AQUAINT program via contract OCG4423B and by the NSF via grant IS-9978025 paper, we report on a series of experiments exploring this approach.
			For the initial experiments, we adopted the approachdescribed by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) (G&amp;J) and evaluated a series of modifications to improve its performance.
