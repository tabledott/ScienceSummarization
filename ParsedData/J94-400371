 larger than that used for acquiring statistics on syntactic constructs or sequences of parts of speech.
    Second, lexical co-occurrence patterns, as well as the definition of senses, may vary a great deal across different domains of discourse.
    Consequently, it is usually not sufficient to acquire the statistics from one widely available &amp;quot;balanced&amp;quot; corpus, as is common for syntactic applications.
    A sense disambiguation model should be trained on the same type of texts for which it will be applied, thus increasing the cost of manual tagging.
    The need to disambiguate a training corpus before acquiring a statistical model for disambiguation is often termed as the circularity problem.
    In the following paragraphs we discuss different methods that were proposed to overcome the circularity problem, without exhaustive manual tagging of the training corpus.
    In our opinion, this is the most critical issue in developing feasible sense disambiguation methods.
