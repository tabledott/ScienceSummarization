    We extracted NCs with up to 6 constituents, but for this paper we consider only NCs with 2 constituents.
    The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is a biomedical lexical resource produced and maintained by the National Library of Medicine (Humphreys et al., 1998).
    We use the MetaThesaurus component to map lexical items into unique concept IDs (CUIs).3 The UMLS also has a mapping from these CUIs into the MeSH lexical hierarchy (Lowe and Barnett, 1994); we mapped the CUIs into MeSH terms.
    There are about 19,000 unique main terms in MeSH, as well as additional modifiers.
    There are 15 main subhierarchies (trees) in MeSH, each corresponding to a major branch of medical ontology.
    For example, tree A corresponds to Anatomy, tree B to Organisms, and so on.
    The longer the name of the MeSH term, the longer the path from the root and the more precise the description.
    For example migraine is C10.228.140.546.800.525, that is, C (a disease), C10 (Nervous System Diseases), C10.228
