ystem makes to prevent a system simply hedging its bets by providing many re sponses.
			The credit is also divided by the number of responses from annotators.
			This gives higher scores to items with less variation.
			We want to emphasise test items with better agreement.
			Using the example for happy;a id 9999 above, ifthe system?s responses for this item was glad; cheer ful the credit for a9999 in the numerator of P and R would be 3+1 2 7 = .286 For Mode P and Mode R we use the system?sfirst guess and compare this to the mode of the anno tators responses on items where there was a response more frequent than the others.
			oot measures This allows a system to make up to 10 guesses.
			The credit for each correct guess is not divided by the number of guesses.
			This allows for the fact that there is a lot of variation for the task and we only have 5 annotators.
			With 10 guesses there is a better chance that the systems find the responses of these 5 annotators.
			There is no ordering of the guesses an
