   He took it that the allowable set of words simply constituted a regular set of morheme sequences.
    This is probably the more controversial part of his proposal, but it is also the less technically elaborate, and therefore the one that has attracted less attention.
    As a result, the term &amp;quot;two-level morphology&amp;quot; has come to be commonly accepted as applying to any system of word recognition that involves two-level, finite-state, phonology or graphology.
    The approach to nonconcatenative morphology to be outlined in this paper will provide a more unified treatment of morphophonemics and morphotactics than has been usual 3 I shall attempt to show how a two-level account might be given of nonconcatenative morphological phenomena, particularly those exhibited in the Semitic languages.
    The approach I intend to take is inspired, not only by finite-state morphology, broadly construed, but equally by autosegmental phonology as proposed by Goldsmith (1979) and the autosegmental morphology
