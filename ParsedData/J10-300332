herefore, the algorithm tends to perform better for paths with verbal roots.
    Another issue is that this algorithm, despite the use of more informative distributional features, can generate several incorrect or implausible paraphrase patterns (inference rules).
    Recent work has shown how to filter out incorrect inferences when using them in a downstream application (Pantel et al. 2007).
    Finally, there is no reason for the distributional features to be in the same language as the one in which the paraphrases are desired.
    Wu and Zhou (2003) describe a bilingual approach to extract English relation-based paraphrastic patterns of the form (w1, R, w2), where w1 and w2 are English words connected by a dependency link with the semantic relation R. Figure 3 shows a simple example based on their approach.
    First, instances of one type of pattern are extracted from a parsed monolingual corpus.
    In the figure, for example, a single instance of the pattern (verb, IN, pobj) has been extracted.
