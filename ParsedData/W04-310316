all 0.68 0.78 0.70 0.64 As is evident from the confusion matrices, the amount of data that we redundantly annotated is small and thus the kappa numbers are at best to be taken as trends.
    However, it does seem that the speculative vs. definite distinction can be made with some reliability.
    In contrast, the high speculation vs. low speculation distinction cannot.
    The gene regulation annotations marked by Light (sets a &amp; b using only Light&#8217;s annotations) can be used to answer questions about the position of speculative fragments in abstracts.
    Consider the histogram-like table below.
    The first row refers to speculative sentences and the second to definite.
    The columns refer to the last sentence of an abstract, the penultimate, elsewhere, and a row sum.
    The number in brackets is the raw count.
    Remember that the number of abstracts in sets a &amp; b together is 100.
    It is clear that almost all of the speculations come towards the end of the abstract.
    In fact the fin
