 and 0.42.
    We observe greater consistency at similar levels of granularity, and less so across the two classes.
    Note that annotator A operated at a level of granularity consistent with the original reference segmentation.
    Hence, the 0.24 Pk measure score serves as the benchmark with which we can compare the results attained by segmentation algorithms on the Physics lecture data.
    As an additional point of reference we note that the uniform and random baseline segmentations attain 0.469 and 0.493 Pk measure, respectively, on the Physics lecture set.

    Benefits of global analysis We first determine the impact of long-range pairwise similarity dependencies on segmentation performance.
