nces, most approaches use two types of features: context words and collocations.
    Context word features record the presence of a word within a fixed window around the target word (bag of words); collocational features capture the syntactic environment of the target word and are usually represented by a small number of words and/or partof-speech tags to the left or right of the target word.
    The results obtained by a variety of classification methods are given in Table 6.
    All methods use either the full set or a subset of 18 confusion sets originally gathered by Golding (1995).
    Most methods are trained and tested on the Brown corpus, using 80% for training and 20% for testing.3 We devised a simple, unsupervised method for performing spelling correction using web counts.
    The method takes into account collocational features, i.e., words that are adjacent to the target word.
    For each word in the confusion set, we used the web to estimate how frequently it co-occurs with a word or a pair of w
