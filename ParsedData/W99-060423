resent results on both the text transcription and the speech recognizer output using the alignment template approach and the single-word based approach.
    The text input was obtained by manually transcribing the spontaneously spoken sentences.
    There was no constraint on the length of the sentences, and some of the sentences in the test corpus contain more than 50 words.
    Therefore, for text input, each sentence is split into shorter units using the punctuation marks.
    The segments thus obtained were translated separately, and the final translation was obtained by concatenation.
    In the case of speech input, the speech recognizer along with a prosodic module produced so-called prosodic markers which are equivalent to punctuation marks in written language.
    The experiments for speech input were performed on the single-best sentence of the recognizer.
    The recognizer had a word error rate of 31.0%.
    Considering only the real words without the punctuation marks, the word error rate was sma
