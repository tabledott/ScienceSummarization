ke a &#8220;one sense per domain&#8221; assumption (similar Figure 4 illustrates what happens when a semantic lexicon is generated for a single category.
    The seed words for the category (in this case, category C) are represented by the solid black area in category C&#8217;s territory.
    The hypothesized words in the growing lexicon are represented by a shaded area.
    The goal of the bootstrapping algorithm is to expand the area of hypothesized words so that it exactly matches the category&#8217;s true territory.
    If the shaded area expands beyond the category&#8217;s true territory, then incorrect words have been added to the lexicon.
    In Figure 4, category C has claimed a significant number of words that belong to categories B and E. When generating a lexicon for one category at a time, these confusion errors are impossible to detect because the learner has no knowledge of the other categories.
    Figure 5 shows the same search space when lexicons are generated for six categories simultaneousl
