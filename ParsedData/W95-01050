  Disambiguating Noun Groupings With Respect To Wordnet Senses
  
    Word groupings useful for language processing tasks are increasingly available, as thesauri appear on-line, and as distributional word clustering techniques improve.
    However, for many tasks, one is in relationships among word words.
    This paper presents a method for automatic sense disambiguation of nouns appearing within sets of related nouns &#8212; the kind of data one finds in on-line thesauri, or as the output of distributional clustering algorithms.
    Disambiguation is performed with respect to WordNet senses, which are fairly fine-grained; however, the method also permits the assignment of higher-level WordNet categories rather than sense labels.
    The method is illustrated primarily by example, though results of a more rigorous evaluation are also presented.
