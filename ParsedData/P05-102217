e the functional head of VP is an auxiliary verb.
    We experimented with various kinds of feature selection, and found that a simple count threshold performs as well as any of the methods we tried.
    Specifically, we ignored all features that did not vary on the parses of at least t sentences, where t is the count threshold.
    In the experiments described below t = 5, though we also experimented with t = 2.
    The rest of this section outlines the feature schemata used in the experiments below.
    These feature schemata used here were developed using the n-best parses provided to us by Michael Collins approximately a year before the n-best parser described here was developed.
    We used the division into preliminary training and preliminary development data sets described in Collins (2000) while experimenting with feature schemata; i.e., the first 36,000 sentences of sections 2&#8211;20 were used as preliminary training data, and the remaining sentences of sections 20 and 21 were used as preliminary
