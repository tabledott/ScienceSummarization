cquired from f-structure an notated treebank resources.LFG distinguishes between governable (arguments) and nongovernable (adjuncts) grammati cal functions (GFs).
			If the automatic f-structureannotation algorithm outlined in Section 3 generates high quality f-structures, reliable seman tic forms can be extracted (reverse-engineered): for each f-structure generated, for each level of embedding we determine the local PRED valueand collect the governable, i.e. subcategoris able grammatical functions present at that level of embedding.
			For the proper f-structure in Figure 3 we obtain sign([subj,obj]) and say([subj,comp]).
			We extract frames from the full WSJ section of the Penn-II Treebank with48K trees.
			Unlike many other approaches, our ex traction process does not predefine frames, fully reflects LDDs in the source data-structures (cf.Figure 3), discriminates between active and passive frames, computes GF, GF:CFG category pair as well as CFG category-based subcategorisation frames and associates condi
