    A common assumption in the computational literature is that hearers can use surface position within a sentence or clause to distinguish discourse from sentential uses.
    In fact, most systems that recognize or generate cue phrases assume a canonical (usually first) position for discourse cue phrases within the clause (Reichman 1985; Zuckerman and Pearl 1986).
    Schiffrin (1987) also assumes that discourse uses of cue phrases are utterance initial.
    However, discourse uses of cue phrases can in fact appear noninitially in a clause, as illustrated by the item say in Example 8 (RJB86).
