ound that an initial gain of &#951;0 = 0.1 and batch size between 15 and 30 was optimal for this application.
  
  
    As discussed in Section 5 we performed experiments on both sentences of length &lt; 15 and length &lt; 40.
    All feature development was done on the length 15 corpus, due to the substantially faster train and test times.
    This has the unfortunate effect that our features are optimized for shorter sentences and less training data, but we found development on the longer sentences to be infeasible.
    Our features are divided into two types: lexicon features, which are over words and tags, and grammar features which are over the local subtrees and corresponding span/split (both have access to the entire sentence).
    We ran two kinds of experiments: a discriminatively trained model, which used only the rules and no other grammar features, and a featurebased model which did make use of grammar features.
    Both models had access to the lexicon features.
    We viewed this as equivalent t
