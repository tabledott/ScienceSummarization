n 6.4.2), and 66 instances of non-sentential gapping, or argument-cluster coordination (see Section 6.4.1).
    The remaining translation failures include trees that consist of sequences of NPs that are not separated by commas, some fragments, and a small number of constructions involving long-range dependencies, such as wh-extraction, parasitic gaps, or argument cluster coordinations where the translation did not yield a valid CCG derivation because a complement had been erroneously identified as an adjunct.
    24 Backward crossed composition is also used by Steedman (1996, 2000) and Baldridge (2002) to account for constraints on preposition stranding in English.
    Because this rule in its unrestricted form leads to overgeneralization, Baldridge restricts crossing rules via the x modality.
    The current version of CCGbank does not implement modalities, but because the grammar that is implicit in CCGbank only consists of particular seen rule instantiations, it may not be affected by such overgeneration p
