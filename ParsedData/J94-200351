LOCUS position of the verb give is not acceptable.
  Therefore an entity in the EMPATHY LOCUS position is ranked in a higher position on the Cf than the subject.
  3.2.1 Empathy and the Centering Algorithm.
  Using the Centering Algorithm, we model EMPATHY as a language-specific discourse factor by adding the EMPATHY-marked discourse ntity to the Cf ranking.
  Then preferences for CONTINUE over RETAIN when EMPATHY is involved can be demonstrated, as in example 24 below: 17 Example 24 a. Hanako wa kuruma ga kowarete komatteimasita.
  Hanako  TOP/SUBJ car SUBJ broken at a loss-was Her car broken, Hanako was at a loss.
  Cb: HANAKO Cf: [HANAKO, CAR] b. Taroo ga 0 sinsetu-ni te o kasite-kuremasita.
  Taroo SUBJ OBJ2/EMP kindly hand OBJ lend-gave.
  Taroo kindly did (Hanako) a favor in helping her.
  Cb: [HANAKO] Cf: [HANAKO, TAROO] EMPATHY SUBJ 17 The verb form kuremasita in 24b is the polite form of kureta, the past tense form of the verb kureru.
