elp in coping with the data sparseness problem, because they make corresponding sentences more similar.
    This section proposes a procedure for combining all these methods in order to improve the translation quality despite sparseness of data.
    Figure 3 sketches the proposed procedure.
    Training with scarce resources.
    &#8220;Restructuring,&#8221; &#8220;learn phrases,&#8221; and &#8220;annotation&#8221; all require morpho-syntactic analysis of the transformed sentences.
    Two different bilingual corpora C1 and C2, one monolingual target language corpus, and a conventional bilingual dictionary D can contribute in various ways to the overall result.
    It is important to note here that C1 and C2 can, but need not, be distinct, and that the monolingual corpus can be identical to the target language part of C2.
    Furthermore these corpora can be taken from different domains, and C1 can be (very) small.
    Only C2 has to represent the domain and the vocabulary for which the translation system is
