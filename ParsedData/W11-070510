 of tweets labeled as &#8220;junk&#8221; suggested that many of these tweets were those that were not translated well using Google translate.
    We eliminate the tweets with junk label for experiments.
    This leaves us with an unbalanced sample of 8,753 tweets.
    We use stratified sampling to get a balanced data-set of 5127 tweets (1709 tweets each from classes positive, negative and neutral).
  
  
    In this paper we introduce two new resources for pre-processing twitter data: 1) an emoticon dictionary and 2) an acronym dictionary.
    We prepare the emoticon dictionary by labeling 170 emoticons listed on Wikipedia1 with their emotional state.
    For example, &#8220;:)&#8221; is labeled as positive whereas &#8220;:=(&#8221; is labeled as negative.
    We assign each emoticon a label from the following set of labels: Extremely-positive, Extremely-negative, Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
    We compile an acronym dictionary from an online resource.2 The dictionary has translations for 5,184 acronyms.
