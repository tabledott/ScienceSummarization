 be improved by correcting a few common confusions.
    Game and move coding have been completed on the entire 128 dialogue Map Task Corpus; transaction coding is still experimental.
    Game and move coding are currently being used to study intonation both in oneword English utterances (Kowtko 1995) and in longer utterances across languages (Grice et al. 1995), the differences between audio-only, face-to-face, text-based, and video-mediated communication (Doherty-Sneddon et al., forthcoming; Newlands, Anderson, and Mullin 1996), and the characteristics of dialogue where one of the participants is a nonfluent Broca-type aphasic (Merrison, Anderson, and Doherty-Sneddon 1994).
    In addition, the move coded corpus has been used to train a program to spot the dialogue move category based on typical word patterns, in aid of speech recognition (Bird et al. 1995).
    The move categories themselves have been incorporated into a computational model of move goals within a spoken dialogue system in order to help the
