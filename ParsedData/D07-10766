et al2006), have been proposed in lit erature.
			For the feature-based methods, Kambhatla (2004) employed Maximum Entropy models to combine diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features in rela tion extraction, and achieved the F-measure of 52.8 on the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus.
			Zhou et al(2005) further systematically ex plored diverse features through a linear kernel and Support Vector Machines, and achieved the F measures of 68.0 and 55.5 on the 5 relation types and the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 cor pus respectively.
			One problem with the feature-based methods is that they need extensive feature engineering.
			Another problem is that, although they can ex plore some structured information in the parse tree (e.g. Kambhatla (2004) used the non-terminal path connecting the given two entities in a parse tree while Zhou et al (2005) introduced additional chunking features to enhance the performance), it is found dif ficult to well preserve structured information in
