ains all the information from the input sequence x (the raw sentence), the global feature vector 4&gt;(x, y) is replaced with 4&gt;(y), which is extracted from the candidate segmented sentences directly.
    Despite the above differences, since the theorems of convergence and their proof (Collins, 2002) are only dependent on the feature vectors, and not on the source of the feature definitions, the perceptron algorithm is applicable to the training of our CWS model.
    The averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) was proposed as a way of reducing overfitting on the training data.
    It was motivated by the votedperceptron algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1999) and has been shown to give improved accuracy over the non-averaged perceptron on a number of tasks.
    Let N be the number of training sentences, T the number of training iterations, and &#945;n,t the parameter vector immediately after the nth sentence in the tth iteration.
    The averaged parameter vector &#947; E Rd is defined as: To compute t
