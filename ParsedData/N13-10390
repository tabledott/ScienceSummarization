  Improved Part-of-Speech Tagging for Online Conversational Text with Word Clusters
  
    author: Online conversational text, typified by microblogs, and text is a challenge for natural language processing.
    Unlike the highly edited genres that conventional NLP tools have been developed for, conversational text contains many nonstandard lexical items and syntactic patterns.
    These are the result of unintentional errors, dialectal variation, conversational ellipsis, topic diversity, and creative use of language and orthography (Eisenstein, 2013).
    An example is shown in Fig.
    1.
    As a result of this widespread variation, standard modeling assumptions that depend on lexical, syntactic, and orthographic regularity are inappropriate.
    There Abstract We consider the problem of part-of-speech tagging for informal, online conversational text.
    We systematically evaluate the use of large-scale unsupervised word clustering and new lexical features to improve tagging accuracy.
