language training set, and evaluate a classifier trained on that data.
    Annotation Study.
    We start by performing an agreement study meant to determine the extent to which subjectivity is preserved by the cross-lingual projections.
    In the study, three annotators &#8211; one native English speaker (En) and two native Romanian speakers (Ro1 and Ro2) &#8211; first trained on 3 randomly selected documents (331 sentences).
    They then independently annotated the subjectivity of the sentences of two randomly selected documents from the parallel corpus, accounting for 173 aligned sentence pairs.
    The annotators had access exclusively to the version of the sentences in their language, to avoid any bias that could be introduced by seeing the translation in the other language.
    Note that the Romanian annotations (after all differences between the Romanian annotators were adjudicated) of all 331 + 173 sentences make up the gold standard corpus used in the experiments reported in Sections 3.2 and 4.1.
