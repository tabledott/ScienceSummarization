  Use Of Support Vector Learning For Chunk Identification
  
  
    In this paper, we explore the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for CoNLL-2000 shared task, chunk identification.
    SVMs are so-called large margin classifiers and are well-known as their good generalization performance.
    We investigate how SVMs with a very large number of features perform with the classification task of chunk labelling.
  
  
    Support Vector Machines (SVMs), first introduced by Vapnik (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Vapnik, 1995), are relatively new learning approaches for solving two-class pattern recognition problems.
    SVMs are well-known for their good generalization performance, and have been applied to many pattern recognition problems.
    In the field of natural language processing, SVMs are applied to text categorization, and are reported to have achieved high accuracy without falling into over-fitting even with a large number of words taken as the features (Joachims, 1998; Taira and Haruno, 1999) First of
