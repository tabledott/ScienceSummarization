 feature is seen in the correct parse but not in the competing parse; A&#8212;k is the set in which the kth feature is seen in the incorrect but not the correct parse.
    Based on these definitions, we next define Wk and W&#8212;k as follows: and BestLoss(k, &#175;a) = Z &#8212; (rWk+ Wk ~2 (16) where Z 1/4 Ei Enij1/42 SId - e Mi,j&#240;6&#222; 1/4 ExpLoss&#240;a&#222; is a constant (for fixed a) which appears in the BestLoss for all features and therefore does not affect their ranking.
    As Schapire and Singer (1999) point out, the updates in equation (15) can be problematic, as they are undefined (infinite) when either W&#254;k or Wk is zero.
    Following Schapire and Singer (1999), we introduce smoothing through a parameter E and the following new definition of BestWt: BestWt&#240;k, a&#222; 1/4 1 log W&#254;k &#254; EZ &#240;17&#222; 2 Wk &#254; EZ The smoothing parameter E is chosen through optimization on a development set.
