er). n The number of aligned nonmarkup text chunks of unequal length. r The correlation of lengths of the aligned nonmarkup chunks. p The significance level of the correlation r. The difference percentage (dp) quantifies the extent to which there are mismatches in the alignment: sequence tokens on one side that have no corresponding token on the other side.
    In the example above, one document contains an H1 header that is missing from the second document.
    Large numbers of such mismatches can indicate that the two documents do not present the same material to a great enough extent to be considered translations.
    This can happen, for example, when two documents are translations up to a point (e.g., an introduction), but one document goes on to include a great deal more content than another.
    Even more frequently, the difference percentage is high when two documents are prima facie bad candidates for a translation pair.
    The number of aligned nonmarkup text chunks (n) helps characterize the quali
