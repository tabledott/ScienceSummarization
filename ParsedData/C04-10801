otations of data.
			As we look to the future, we expect that relatively unsupervised methods will grow in applicability, reducing the need for expensive human annotation of data.
			With respect to part-of-speech tagging, we believe that the way forward from the relatively small number of languages for which we can currently identify parts of speech in context with reasonable accuracy will make use of unsupervised methods that require only an untagged corpus and a lexicon of words and their possible parts of speech.
			We believe this based on the fact that such lexicons exist for many more languages (in the form of conventional dictionaries) than extensive human-tagged training corpora exist for.
			Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging, as defined above, has been attempted using a variety of learning algorithms (Brill 1995, Church, 1988, Cutting et. al. 1992, Elworthy, 1994 Kupiec 1992, Merialdo 1991).
			While this makes unsupervised part-of-speech tagging a relatively well-studied problem, published result
