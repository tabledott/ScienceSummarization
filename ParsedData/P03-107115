 computing a segmentation probability at each potential boundary.
    This information can be effectively used in the featurebased segmenter to account for lexical cohesion, as described in the next section.
  
  
    In the previous section, we have concentrated exclusively on the consideration of content (through lexical cohesion) to determine the structure of texts, neglecting any influence of form.
    In this section, we explore formal devices that are indicative of topic shifts, and explain how we use these cues to build a segmenter targeting conversational speech.
    Topic segmentation is reduced here to a classification problem, where each utterance break Bi is either considered a topic boundary or not.
    We use statistical modeling techniques to build a classifier that uses local features (e.g. cue phrases, pauses) to determine if an utterance break corresponds to a topic boundary.
    We chose C4.5 and C4.5rules (Quinlan, 1993), two programs to induce classification rules in the form of decision
