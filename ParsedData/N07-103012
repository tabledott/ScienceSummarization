full coreference resolution system.
    It is worth noting that previous work tends to be vague in both these respects: details on mention filtering or providing performance figures for markable identification are rarely given.
    Following common practice, results are given in terms of recall and precision according to the standard model-theoretic metric (Vilain et al., 1995).
    This method operates by comparing the equivalence classes defined by the resolutions produced by the system with the gold standard classes: these are the two &#8220;models&#8221;.
    Roughly, the scores are obtained by determining the minimal perturbations brought to one model in order to map it onto the other model.
    Recall is computed by trying to map the predicted chains onto the true chains, while precision is computed the other way around.
    We test significant differences with paired t-tests (p &lt; .05).
    The anaphoricity classifier has an average accuracy of 80.2% on the three ACE datasets (using a threshold of .5
