ial to our method of inferring case frames of verbs from examples.
    Simple rules can predict which word designates the semantic clause of a noun phrase very reliably.
    We can use these simple rules plus lexical lookup to identify the basic semantic class of a noun phrase.
    Semantic knowledge called selection restrictions or case frames governs what phrases make sense with a particular verb or noun (what arguments go with a particular verb or noun).
    Traditionally such semantic knowledge is handcrafted, though some software aids exist to enable greater productivity (Ayuso, Shaked, and Weischedel 1987; Bates 1989; Grishman, Hirschman, and Nhan 1986; Weischedel et al. 1989).
    Instead of handcrafting this semantic knowledge, our goal is to learn that knowledge from examples, using a three-step process: noun, verb, and proper noun in the sample with the semantic class corresponding to it in the domain model.
    For instance, dawn would be annotated &lt;time&gt;, explode would be &lt;explosion event
