en higher than the permissive GIZA++ union.
    One factor contributing to this is the phrasal model&#8217;s use of cepts: it completely interconnects any phrase pair, while GIZA++ union and GDF may not.
    Its global view of phrases also helps in this regard: evidence for a phrase can be built up over multiple sentences.
    Finally, we note that in terms of alignment quality, the non-compositional constraint is an unqualified success for the phrasal ITG.
    It produces a 25 point improvement in precision, at the cost of 2 points of recall.
    This produces the highest balanced Fmeasure observed on our test set, but the utility of its alignments will depend largely on one&#8217;s desired precision-recall trade-off.
    In this section, we compare a number of different methods for phrase table generation in a French to English translation task.
    We are interested in answering three questions: With this in mind, we test five phrase tables.
    Two are conditionalized phrasal models, each EM trained until
