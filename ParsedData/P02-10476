are different in some respects (Libya cannot buy arms legally while Rwanda can), and because these situations are compared with respect to these differences.
    By a similar line of reasoning, we would label the relation between 2.a and 2.b as EVIDENCE.
    The discussion above illustrates two points.
    First, it is clear that although current discourse theories are built on fundamentally different principles, they all share some common intuitions.
    Sure, some theories talk about &#8220;negative polarity&#8221; while others about &#8220;contrast&#8221;.
    Some theories refer to &#8220;causes&#8221;, some to &#8220;potential causes&#8221;, and some to &#8220;explanations&#8221;.
    But ultimately, all these theories acknowledge that there are such things as CONTRAST, CAUSE, and EXPLANATION relations.
    Second, given the complexity of the definitions these theories propose, it is clear why it is difficult to build programs that recognize such relations in unrestricted texts.
