ple in section 3.3 illustrates this.
			Our results are for a lexical sample because we did not have the resources to produce manually tagged domain-specific corpora for an all words task.
			Although sense distribution data derived fromSemCor can be more accurate than such informa tion derived automatically (McCarthy et al, 2004), in a given domain there will be words for whichthe SemCor frequency distributions are inappropriate or unavailable.
			The work presented here demonstrates that the automatic method for finding pre dominant senses outperforms SemCor on a sampleof words, particularly on ones that are salient to a do main.
			As well as domain-salient words, there will be words which are not particularly salient but still havedifferent distributions than in SemCor.
			We therefore propose that automatic methods for determin ing the first sense should be used when either there is no manually tagged data, or the manually taggeddata seems to be inappropriate for the word and do main under consideration.
