Tibetan.
    Many of these are even in standardized formats (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007).
    Past studies have shown that for both part-of-speech tagging and grammar induction, learning with multiple comparable languages leads to improvements (Cohen and Smith, 2009; Snyder et al., 2009; BergKirkpatrick and Klein, 2010).
    In this section we examine whether this is also true for parser transfer.
    Table 2 shows the matrix of source-target language UAS for all nine languages we consider (the original eight target languages plus English).
    We can see that there is a wide range from 33.3% to 74.7%.
    There is also a wide range of values depending on the source training data and/or target testing data, e.g., Portuguese as a source tends to parse target languages much better than Danish, and is also more amenable as a target testing language.
    Some of these variations are expected, e.g., the Romance languages (Spanish, Italian and Portuguese) tend to transfer well to one another.
