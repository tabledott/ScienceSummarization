o the word order of the target language (TL), and then the reordered SL sentence S' is translated as a TL sentence T by monotonous translation.
    Our first contribution is a new translation model as represented by formula 2: where an n-best list of S', instead of only one S', is generated.
    The reason of such change will be given in section 2.
    Note also that the translation process S'&#8594;T is not monotonous, since the distance-based model is needed for local reordering.
    Our second contribution is our definition of the best translation: where Fi are the features in the standard phrasebased model and Pr(S &#8594; S') is our new feature, viz. the probability of reordering S as S'.
    The details of this model are elaborated in sections 3 to 6.
    The settings and results of experiments on this new model are given in section 7.
  
  
    There have been various attempts to syntaxbased SMT, such as (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and (Quirk et al., 2005).
    We do not adopt these models since a lot of
