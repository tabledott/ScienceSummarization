ction preferences; (5) study various properties of discovered patterns in a detailed manner; and (6) adapt the algorithm to morphologically rich languages. words&#8217; precision of 90.47%.
    This metric was reported to be 82% in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002).
    It should be noted that our algorithm can be viewed as one for automatic discovery of word senses, because it allows a word to participate in more than a single category.
    When merged properly, the different categories containing a word can be viewed as the set of its senses.
    We are planning an evaluation according to this measure after improving the merge stage.
