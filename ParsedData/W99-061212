f or smooth to the more general class distribution, which is typically more uniform.
    Unfortunately, this representation is difficult to distinguish from a conditional distribution based on a very large sample (and hence estimated with confidence) that just happens to have a similar fairly uniform true distribution.
    One would like a representation that does not obscure this distinction, and represents the uncertainty of the distribution separately.
    We resolve this problem while retaining a single probability distribution over classes by adding a separate &amp;quot;questionable&amp;quot; (or unassigned) cell that reflects the uncertainty of the distribution.
    Probability mass continues to be distributed among the remaining class cells proportional to the observed distribution in the 'data, but with a total sum (&lt; 1) that reflects the confidence in the distribution and is equal to 1&#8212; P(qiiestionable).
    This approach has the advantage of explicitly representing the uncertainty in a give
