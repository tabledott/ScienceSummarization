own answer type.
    In order to provide a baseline for our experiments, we ran a version of our Q/A system, known as FERRET (Harabagiu et al., 2005a), that does not make use of textual entailment information when identifying answers to questions.
    Results from this baseline are presented in Table 7.
    The performance of the TE system described in Section 3 was first evaluated in the 2006 PASCAL RTE Challenge.
    In this task, systems were tasked with determining whether the meaning of a sentence (referred to as a hypothesis) could be reasonably inferred from the meaning of another sentence (known as a text).
    Four types of sentence pairs were evaluated in the 2006 RTE Challenge, including: pairs derived from the output of In previous work (Hickl et al., 2006), we have found that the type and amount of training data available to our TE system significantly (p &lt; 0.05) impacted its performance on the 2006 RTE Test Set.
    When our system was trained on the training corpora described in Section 3.3,
