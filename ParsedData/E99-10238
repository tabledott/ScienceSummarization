all Street Journal corpus (WSJ).
    The second part was test data and consisted of 47377 words taken from section 20 of the same corpus.
    The words were part-of-speech (POS) tagged with the Brill tagger and each word was classified as being inside or outside a baseNP with the IOB1 representation scheme.
    The chunking classification was made by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) based on the parsing information in the WSJ corpus.
    The performance of the baseNP recognizer can be measured in different ways: by computing the percentage of correct classification tags (accuracy), the percentage of recognized baseNPs that are correct (precision) and the percentage of baseNPs in the corpus that are found (recall).
    We will follow (Argamon et al., 1998) and use a combination of the precision and recall rates: Fo.--1 = (2*precision*recall)/(precision+recall).
    In our first experiment series we have tried to discover the best word/part-of-speech tag context for each representation format.
