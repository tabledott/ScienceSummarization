hurch and Hanks 1990) and also forms part of Resnik&#8217;s association score, which will be introduced in Section 6.
    Thus the generalization procedure can be thought of as one that finds &#8220;homogeneous&#8221; areas of the hierarchy, that is, areas consisting of classes that are associated to a similar degree with the verb (Clark and Weir 1999).
    Finally, we note that the proposed estimation method does not guarantee that the estimates form a probability distribution over the concepts in the hierarchy, and so a normalization factor is required: We use psc to denote an estimate obtained using our method (since the technique finds sets of semantically similar senses, or &#8220;similarity classes&#8221;) and [c, v, r] to denote the class chosen for concept c in position r of verb v; p&#710; denotes a relative frequency estimate, and C denotes the set of concepts in the hierarchy.
    Before providing the details of the generalization procedure, we give the relativefrequency estimates of the relevant p
