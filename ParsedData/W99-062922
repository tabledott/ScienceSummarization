pect that especially an improvement of the adverbial function assignment will lead to better OR assignment.
    Finally, since cascading proved effective for GR. assignment we intend to study the effect of cascading different types of XP chunkers on chunking performance.
    We might e.g. first find ADJP chunks, then use that chunker's output as additional input for the NP chunker, then use the combined output as input to the VP chunker and so on.
    Other chunker orderings are possible, too.
    Likewise, it might be better to find different grammatical relations subsequently, instead of simultaneously.
