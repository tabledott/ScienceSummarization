 it from models with commutative composition operations.
    The second experiment&#8217;s results deliver the expected qualitative difference between models, with our categorical model outperforming the others and showing an increase in alignment with human judgements in correlation with the increase in sentence complexity.
    We use this second evaluation principally to show that there is a strong case for the development of more complex experiments measuring not only the disambiguating qualities of compositional models, but also their syntactic sensitivity, which is not directly measured in the existing experiments.
    These results show that the high level categorical distributional model, uniting empirical data with logical form, can be implemented just like any other concrete model.
    Furthermore it shows better results in experiments involving higher syntactic complexity.
    This is just the tip of the iceberg: the mathematics underlying the implementation ensures that it uniformly scales to large
