    'This might be explained in part by (Stark 1988) who shows that readers disagree measurably about where to place paragraph boundaries when presented with texts with those boundaries removed, ogy that occurred in all of them reappears in this one location (in the spirit of a Grosz &amp; Sidner (1986) &amp;quot;pop&amp;quot; operation).
    Thus it displays low similarity both to itself and to its neighbors.
    This is an example of a breakdown caused by the assumptions about the subtopic structure.

    The final paragraph is a summary of the entire text; the algorithm recognizes the change in terminology from the preceding paragraphs and marks a boundary; only two of the readers chose to differentiate the summary; for this reason the
