., identifying themany-to-1 mapping and evaluating on different subsets of the data, would answer many of these objections.
			Haghighi and Klein (2006) propose constrain ing the mapping from hidden states to POS tags so that at most one hidden state maps to any POS tag.
			This mapping is found by greedily assigning hidden states to POS tags until either the hidden states or POS tags are exhausted (note that if the number ofhidden states and POS tags differ, some will be unas signed).
			We call the accuracy of the POS sequence obtained using this map its 1-to-1 accuracy.
			Finally, several authors have proposed using information-theoretic measures of the divergence between the hidden state and POS tag sequences.
			Goldwater and Griffiths (2007) propose using the Variation of Information (VI) metric described byMeila?
			(2003).
			We regard the assignments of hidden states and POS tags to the words of the cor pus as two different ways of clustering those words,and evaluate the conditional entropy of each
