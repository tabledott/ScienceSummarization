per computation.
			Cumulative lookup time was dominated by a very small fraction of the computations (Fig.
			1).
			As expected, further analysis showed that these expensive computations all involved one or more very frequent subpatterns.
			In the worst cases a single collocation took severalseconds to compute.
			However, there is a silver lining.
			Patterns follow a Zipf distribution, so the number of pattern types that cause the problem is actu ally quite small.
			The vast majority of patterns arerare.
			Therefore, our solution focuses on computa tions where one or more of the component patternsis frequent.
