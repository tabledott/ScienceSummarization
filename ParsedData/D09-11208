 the Stanford parser, and then for each evaluation mention, we find the largest-span NP which has the previously determined mention head as its head.5 Often, this results in a different, typically larger, mention span than annotated in the data.
    Now that each mention is situated in a parse tree, we utilize the length of the shortest tree path between mentions as our notion of distance.
    In by agreement constraints (see Section 3.1.2).
    The pronoun them is closest to the site mention, but has an incompatible number feature with it.
    The closest (in tree distance, see Section 3.1.1) compatible mention is The Israelis, which is correct particular, this fixes examples such as those in Figure 1 where the true antecedent has many embedded mentions between itself and the pronoun.
    This change by itself yields 51.7 pairwise F1 (see BASE-TREE in Table 2), which is small overall, but reduces pairwise pronoun antecedent selection error from 51.3% to 42.5%.
    We now refine our compatibility filtering to
