are usually referred to as the lexical and surface strings.
    The lexical-surface string sets of the individual generalizations in Koskenniemi's system are clearly regular, since they are defined outright as finite-state transducers.
    But it is not immediately obvious that the string relation defined by a whole two-level grammar is regular.
    Koskenniemi gave an operational specification, not an algebraic one, of how the separate transducers are to interact.
    A pair of strings is generated by a two-level grammar if the pair is accepted separately by each of the transducers, and furthermore, the label on the transition taken by one fst at a particular string position is identical to the label of the transition that every other fst takes at that string position.
    In essence, he prescribed a transition function (5 for a whole-grammar transducer that allows transitions between states in cross-product state sets just in case they are permitted by literal-matching transitions in the individual machines
