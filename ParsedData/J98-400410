juncts have exactly two levels of phrasal projection.
    The lower level contains the lexical head, and all adjuncts are attached as sisters to a maximal projection at the higher level.
    To a first approximation, this is the representation used for NPs with PP modifiers or complements in the WSJ corpus used in this study.1 If the standard linguistic intuition that the number of PP modifiers permitted in natural language is unbounded is correct, then only the Chomsky adjunction representation trees can be generated by a CFG, as the other two representations depicted in Figure 1 require a different production for each possible number of PP modifiers.
    For example, the rule schema VP &#8212;4 V NP PP*, which generates the flat attachment structure, abbreviates an infinite number of CF productions.
    In addition, if a treebank using the two-level representation contains at least one node with a single PP modifier, then the PCFG induced from it will generate Chomsky adjunction representations of multiple
