ed with labelled dependencies.
    We use the Briscoe and Carroll (2006) version of DepBank, a 560 sentence subset used to evaluate the RASP parser.
    Some translation is required to compare our brackets to DepBank dependencies.
    We map the brackets to dependencies by finding the head of the NP, using the Collins (1999) head finding rules, and then creating a dependency between each other child&#8217;s head and this head.
    This does not work perfectly, and mismatches occur because of which dependencies DepBank marks explicitly, and how it chooses heads.
    The errors are investigated manually to determine their cause.
    The results are shown in Table 2, with the number of agreements before manual checking shown in parentheses.
    Once again the dependency numbers are higher than those at the NP level.
    Similarly, when we only look at cases where we have inserted some annotations, we are looking at more difficult cases and the score is not as high.
    The results of this analysis are quite posi
