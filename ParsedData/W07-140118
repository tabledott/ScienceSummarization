ldovan carry on a sophisticated analysis of named entities, in particular Person names, distinguishing first names from last names.
    Some form of relation extraction, either through manually built patterns (Chambers et al.) or through the use of an information extraction system (Hickl and Bensley) have been introduced this year, even if still on a small scale (i.e. few relations).
    On the other hand, RTE-3 confirmed that both machine learning using lexical-syntactic features and transformation-based approaches on dependency representations are well consolidated techniques to address textual entailment.
    The extension of transformation-based approaches toward probabilistic settings is an interesting direction investigated by some systems (e.g.
    Harmeling).
    On the side of &#8220;light&#8221; approaches to textual entailment, Malakasiotis and Androutpoulos provide a useful baseline for the task (0.61%) using only POS tagging and then applying string-based measures to estimate the similarity betwe
