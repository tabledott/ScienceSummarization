rs are type, colour, and la- bel.
  The user-knows function simply returns true if the attributc~value pair is accurate and false other- wise; this essentially assumes that the user can visu- ally perceive the value of any attribute in *preferred- attributes*, which may not tie true in general.
  The referring expression generation model seems rea- sonably successful in IDAS.
  In parLieular, the algo- rithm lure proven to be useful because: 1.
  The algorithm runs in linear time in the number of distractors, which is probably im- possible for any algorithm that includes an ex- plicit brevity requirement (e.g., the algorithms of [Da189,Rei90a]).
  Of equal importance, its run- time is independent of the number of potential attributes that could be used in the referring ex- preszion.
  This ks a consequence of the fact that the algorithm does not attempt to find the at- tribute with the highest discriminatory power, but rather simply takes attributes from the *preferred- attributes* list until it has built a s
