hed a retention of more than 25% of the Ziff-Davis data, which greatly benefited the lexical probabilities incorporated into our Markovized SCFGs.
    Our work provides three main contributions: pact of different Markov orders for sentence compression, similarly to a study done for PCFGs (Klein and Manning, 2003).
    (3) We provide a framework for exploiting document-abstract sentence pairs that are not purely compressive, and augment the available training resources for syntax-directed sentence compression systems.
  
  
    One successful syntax-driven approach (Knight and Marcu, 2000, henceforth K&amp;M) relies on synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) (Lewis and Stearns, 1968; Aho and Ullman, 1969).
    SCFGs can be informally defined as context-free grammars (CFGs) whose productions have two right-hand side strings instead of one, namely source and target right-hand side.
    In the case of sentence compression, we restrict the target side to be a sub-sequence of the source side (possibly identical),
