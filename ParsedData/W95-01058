rresponds to a WordNet synset.)
    The traditional method of evaluating similarity in a semantic network by measuring the path length between two nodes (Lee et al., 1993; Rada et at, 1989) also captures this, albeit indirectly, when the semantic network is just an IS-A hierarchy: if the minimal path of IS-A links between two nodes is long, that means it is necessary to go high in the taxonomy, to more abstract concepts, in order to find their least upper bound.
    However, there are problems with the simple path-length definition of semantic similarity, and experiments using WordNet show that other measures of semantic similarity, such as the one employed here, provide a better match to human similarity judgments than simple path length does (Resnik, 1995).
    Given two words w1 and w2, their semantic similarity is calculated as where subsumers(wi, w2) is the set of WordNet synsets that subsume (i.e., are ancestors of) both w1 and w2, in any sense of either word.
