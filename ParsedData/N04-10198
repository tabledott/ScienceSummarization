the same semantic content.
    An SCU has a unique index, a weight, and a natural language label.
    The label, which is subject to revision throughout the annotation process, has three functions.
    First, it frees the annotation process from dependence on a semantic representation language.
    Second, it requires the annotator to be conscious of a specific meaning shared by all contributors.
    Third, because the contributors to an SCU are taken out of context, the label serves as a reminder of the full in-context meaning, as in the case of SCU2 above where the temporal PPs are about a specific event, the time of the indictment.
    Our impression from consideration of three SCU inventories is that the pattern illustrated here between SCU1 and SCU2 is typical; when two SCUs are semantically related, the one with the lower weight is semantically dependent on the other.
    We have catalogued a variety of such relationships, and note here that we believe it could prove useful to address semantic interdepe
