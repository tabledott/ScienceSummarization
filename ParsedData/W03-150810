llabic nuclei!
    This is because Mandarin does not permit complex consonant clusters in a way that is quite prevalent in English.
    This linguistic knowledge, however, need not be imparted by hand in the IBM model.
    One can, indeed, derive such a list from the trained models by simply reading off the list of symbols which have zero fertility with high probability.
    This list, in our case, is -i, e, u, o, r, tu, ou, c, iu, ie.
    The second translation system, for converting pinyin sequences to character sequences, has a one-toone mapping between symbols and therefore has no words with zero fertility.
    We evaluate the efficacy of our transliteration at two levels.
    For comparison with the very comparable set-up of Meng et al (2001), we measure the accuracy of the pin-yin output produced by our system after Step 3. in Section 2.3.
    The results are shown in Table 1, where pin-yin error rate is the edit distance between the &#8220;correct&#8221; pin-yin representation of the correct transliter
