 w' is the categorial functor.
    For example, in our sentence &#8220;London denied plans on Monday&#8221;, the relation connecting the verb denied with plans is (S[dcl]\NP)/NP.2.&#8592;, with the left arrow indicating the lexical category included in the relation is that of the verb, while the relation connecting denied with on is ((S\NP)\(S\NP))/NP.2.&#8594;, with the right arrow indicating the the lexical category included in the relation is that of the modifier.
    If the CCG derivation does not define a predicateargument relation between the two words, we use the parse tree path feature described above, defined over the CCG derivation tree.
    In our training data, 77% of PropBank arguments corresponded directly to a relation in the CCG predicate-argument representation, and the path feature was used for the remaining 23%.
    Most of these mismatches arise because the CCG parser and PropBank differ in their definition of head words.
    For instance, the CCG parser always assumes that the head of a P
