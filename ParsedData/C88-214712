er, as described in Section 2.1, adjunctions will be allowed only if the appropriate f ature structures can be unified.
  Thus, we expect o implement the adjoining constraints of TAGs simply by making declarative statements made in the feature structures associated with the nodes to ensure that only the appropriate trees get adjoined at a node.
  The adjoining constraints are implemented in FTAG as follows.
  No- tice, from Figure 4, t~ and troot, and b, and b.toa must be compatible for adjunction to occur.
  We hope to specify some feature-values in these t, b statements o specify the local constraints so that 1. if some auxiliary tree should not adjoined at a node (because of its SA constraint) hen some unification involved (tu with troop, or b/oo~ with b,~) in our attempt to adjoin this auxiliary tree will fail, and 2. if a node has OA constraint, we should ensure that an appropriate auxiliary tree does get adjoined at that node.
  This is ensured if t, is incompatible with b,.
