    Arguably this consists of about three phonological words.
    On the other hand, in a translation system one probably wants to treat this string as a single dictionary word since it has a conventional and somewhat unpredictable translation into English.
    Thus, if one wants to segment words&#8212;for any purpose&#8212;from Chinese sentences, one faces a more difficult task than one does in English since one cannot use spacing as a guide.

    Now, for this application one might be tempted to simply bypass the segmentation problem and pronounce the text character-by-character.
    However, there are se
