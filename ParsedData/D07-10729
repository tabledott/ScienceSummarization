ommon inventory of possiblenext states.
			We can achieve this by tying these mix ture models together using the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) (Teh et al, 2006).
			The stick-breaking representation of an HDP is defined as follows: first,the top-level stick-breaking weights ? are drawn ac cording to the stick-breaking prior as before.
			Then, a new set of stick-breaking weights ??
			are generated according based on ?: ??
			DP(??,?), (2) where the distribution of DP can be characterized in terms of the following finite partition property: for all partitions of the positive integers into sets A1, . . .
			, Am, (??(A1), . . .
			,??(Am)) (3) ? Dirichlet ( ???(A1), . . .
			, ???(Am) ) , where ?(A) = ? k?A ?k. 1 The resulting ??
			is an-.
			other distribution over the positive integers whosesimilarity to ? is controlled by a concentration pa rameter ??.
