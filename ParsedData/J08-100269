ation trees of LTAG and CCG.
    Chiang (2003) proved that feature forests could be considered as the derivation forests of linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRSs) (Vijay-Shanker, Weir, and Joshi 1987; Weir 1988).
    LCFRSs define a wide variety of grammars, including LTAG and CCG, while preserving polynomial-time complexity of parsing.
    This demonstrates that feature forest models are applicable to probabilistic models far beyond PCFGs.
    Feature forests are also isomorphic to support graphs (or explanation graphs) used in the graphical EM algorithm (Kameya and Sato 2000).
    In their framework, a program in a logic programming language, PRISM (Sato and Kameya 1997), is converted into support graphs, and parameters of probabilistic models are automatically learned by an EM algorithm.
    Support graphs have been proved to represent various statistical structural models, including HMMs, PCFGs, Bayesian networks, and many other graphical structures (Sato and Kameya 2001; Sato 2005).
