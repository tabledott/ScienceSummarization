y for each of the two languages whether prepositions or postpositions are more common, where &amp;quot;preposition&amp;quot; here is meant not in the usual part-of-speech sense, but rather in a broad sense of the tendency of function words to attach left or right.
    This simple strategem is effective because the majority of unmatched singletons are function words that lack counterparts in the other language.
    This observation holds assuming that the translation lexicon's coverage is reasonably good.
    For both English and Chinese, we specify a prepositional bias, which means that singletons are attached to the right whenever possible.
    A Singleton-Rebalancing Algorithm.
    We give here an algorithm for further improving the bracketing accuracy in cases of singletons.
    Consider the following bracketing produced by the algorithm of the previous section: The prepositional bias has already correctly restricted the singleton The/e to attach to the right, but of course The does not belong outside the
