or statistical translation, then, is not a philosophical one, but an empirical one: Can one construct approximations to the distributions Pr(e) and Pr(f le) that are good enough to achieve an acceptable quality of translation?
    Equation (2) summarizes the three computational challenges presented by the practice of statistical translation: estimating the language model probability, Pr(e); estimating the translation model probability, Pr(f le); and devising an effective and efficient suboptimal search for the English string that maximizes their product.
    We call these the language modeling problem, the translation modeling problem, and the search problem.
    The language modeling problem for machine translation is essentially the same as that for speech recognition and has been dealt with elsewhere in that context (see, for example, the recent paper by Maltese and Mancini [1992] and references therein).
    We hope to deal with the search problem in a later paper.
    In this paper, we focus on the trans
