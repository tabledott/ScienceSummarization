 Phrase Structure grammars (GPSG), Lexical Functional grunmmm (LFG), Phrm~ Linking grammars (PLG), and Tree Adjoining grammars (TAG) are some key examples of grammatical systems that have been and still continue to be investignted along theme lines.
  Some of the bask notions of TAGs were introduced in [Joahi, Levy, and Takahashi,1975] and [Jo~hi,198,3 I.
  Some pretiminav/ investigations of the linguistic relevance and some computational properties were also carried out in [Jo~hi, l~S3 I.
  More recently, a detailed iuvestigution of the linguistic relevance of TAGs were carried out by [Kro~h and Joshi, 19851.
  In this paper, we will des?ribe some new results for TAGs, especially in the following areas: (I) parsing complexity of TAGs, (2) some closure results for TAGs, and (3) the relationship to Head grammar*.
  These topics will be covered in Sections 3, 4, and $ respectively.
  In section 2, we will give an introduction to TAGs.
  In section 6, we will state some properties not discussed here.
