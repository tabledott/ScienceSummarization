implicit in a treebank has to cover all constructions that occur in the corpus.
    Expressive formalisms such as CCG provide explicit analyses that contain detailed linguistic information.
    For example, CCG derivations assign a lexical head to every constituent and define explicit functor&#8211;argument relations between constituents.
    In a phrase-structure grammar, analyses can be much coarser, and may omit more fine-grained structures if they are assumed to be implicit in the given analysis.
    Furthermore, constructions that are difficult to analyze do not need to be given a detailed analysis.
    In both cases, the missing information has to be added before a Treebank tree can be translated into CCG.
    If the missing structure is implicit in the Treebank analysis, this step is relatively straightforward, but constructions such as parentheticals, multiword expressions, and fragments require careful reanalysis in order to avoid lexical coverage problems and overgeneration.
