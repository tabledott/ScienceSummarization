  Does Baum-Welch Re-Estimation Help Taggers?
  
    In part of speech tagging by Hidden Markov Model, a statistical model is used to assign grammatical categories to words in a text.
    Early work in the field relied on a corpus which had been tagged by a human annotator to train the model.
    recently, Cutting al. suggest that training can be achieved with a minimal lexicon and a limited amount priori about probabilities, by using an Baum-Welch re-estimation to automatically refine the model.
    In this paper, I report two experiments designed to determine how much manual training information is needed.
    The first experiment suggests that initial biasing of either lexical or transition probabilities is essential to achieve a good accuracy.
    The second experiment reveals that there are three distinct patterns of Baum-Welch reestimation.
    In two of the patterns, the re-estimation ultimately reduces the accuracy of the tagging rather than improving it.
    The pattern which is applicable can be pr
