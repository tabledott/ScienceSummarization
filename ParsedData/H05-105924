second-order model is sufficient because further increase of n has little impact on per formance.
			Thus the training typically takes four or 16 times as much time as it would take for training a single unidirectional tagger, which looks somewhatexpensive.
			However, because each type of classi fier can be trained independently, the training can be performed completely in parallel and run with the same amount of memory as that for training a single classifier.
			This advantage contrasts with the case for CRFs which requires substantial amount ofmemory and computational cost if one tries to incor porate higher-order features about tag sequences.
			Tagging speed is another important factor inbuilding a practical tagger for large-scale text min 473 ing.
			Our inference algorithm with the easiest-first strategy needs no Viterbi decoding unlike MEMMs and CRFs, and makes it possible to perform very fast tagging with high precision.
