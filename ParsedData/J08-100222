    Figure 5 shows the process of computing the inside &#945;-product at a conjunctive node from the inside &#945;-products of its daughter nodes.
    Because the inside of a conjunctive node is a set of the combinations of all of its descendants, the &#945;-product is computed by multiplying the &#945;-products of the daughter trees.
    The following equation is derived.
    The inside of a disjunctive node is the collection of the inside trees of its daughter nodes.
    Hence, the inside &#945;-product at disjunctive node d &#8712; D is computed as follows (Figure 6).
    The inside &#945;-product &#981;c at a conjunctive node c is computed by the following equation if &#981;d is given for all daughter disjunctive nodes d &#8712; &#948;(c).
    The outside of a disjunctive node is equivalent to the outside of its daughter nodes.
    Hence, the outside &#945;-product of a disjunctive node is propagated to its daughter conjunctive nodes (Figure 7).
    The computation of the outside &#945;-pro
