interpolated bitext map was pulled close to the TPC, even though it may have been much farther off in the middle of the sentence.
    Thus, the results in Table 3 should be considered only relative to each other and to other results obtained under the same experimental conditions.
    It would be impressive indeed if any bitext mapping algorithm's actual RMS error were less than 1 character on bitexts involving languages with different word order, such as English/Korean.
    The matching predicates for French/English and Spanish/English relied on an LCSR threshold to find cognates.
    The Korean text contained some Roman character strings, so the matching predicate for Korean/English generated candidate points of correspondence whenever one of these strings coordinated in the search rectangle with an identical string in the English half of the bitext.
    A seed translation lexicon was also used to strengthen the Korean/English signal.
    In addition, English, French, Spanish and Korean stop lists were used
