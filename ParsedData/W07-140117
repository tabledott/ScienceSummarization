e pairs (for which the entailment holds) before all the negative ones, yielding an average precision value of 1.
    Twenty-six teams participated in the third challenge, three more than in previous year.
    Table 2 presents the list of the results of each submitted runs and the components used by the systems.
    Overall, we noticed a move toward deep approaches, with a general consolidation of approaches based on the syntactic structure of Text and Hypothesis.
    There is an evident increase of systems using some form of logical inferences (at least seven systems).
    However, these approaches, with few notably exceptions, do not seem to be consolidated enough, as several systems show results not still at the state of art (e.g.
    Natural Logic introduced by Chambers et al.).
    For many systems an open issue is the availability and integration of different and complex semantic resourcesA more extensive and fine grained use of specific semantic phenomena is also emerging.
    As an example, Tatu and Mo
