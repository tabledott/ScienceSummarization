t not in the structures themselves.
    As we have shown (see [91) that there is a unique minimal satisfying DG structure for any nondisjunctive FDL formula, we can represent the parts of a formula which do not contain any disjunction by DGs.
    DGs are a more compact way of representing the same information that is contained in a FDL formula, provided the formula contains no disjunction.
    Let us define an unconditional conjunct to be a conjunct of a formula which contains no occurrences of disjunction.
    After path expansion any formula can be put into the form: where uconj contains no occurrences of disjunction, and each disji, for 1 &lt; i &lt; m, is a disjunction of two or more alternatives.
    The uconj part of the formula is formed by using the commutative law to bring all unconditional conjuncts of the formula together at the front.
    Of course, there may be no unconditional conjuncts in a formula, in which case uconj would be the formula NIL.
    Each disjunct may be any type of formula, so d
