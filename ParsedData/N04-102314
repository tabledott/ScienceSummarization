sion is able to provide relatively good results in general.
    In previous work on the PRank algorithm, ranks are defined on the entire training and test data.
    Thus we can define boundaries between consecutive ranks on the entire data.
    But in MT reranking, ranks are defined over every single source sentence.
    For example, in our data set, the rank of a translation is only the rank among all the translations for the same sentence.
    The training data includes about 1000 sentences, each of which normally has 1000 candidate translations with the exception of short sentences that have a smaller number of candidate translations.
    As a result, we cannot use the PRank algorithm in the reranking task, since there are no global ranks or boundaries for all the samples.
    However, the approach of using pairwise samples does work.
    By pairing up two samples, we compute the relative distance between these two samples in the scoring metric.
    In the training phase, we are only interested in whether
