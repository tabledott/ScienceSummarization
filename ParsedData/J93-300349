of us classified as discourse and the other as sentential.
    Of the 953 tokens in this corpus, we agreed in our judgments of 878 cue phrases (92.1%) as discourse or sentential.
    Another 59 (6.2%) tokens we both judged ambiguous.
    We disagreed on only 16 items (1.7%); for 11 of these, the disagreement was between classifiable and ambiguous.
    When we examined the areas of ambiguity and disagreement in our judgments, we found that a high proportion of these involved judgments of coordinate conjunction tokens, and, or, and but, which, as we previously noted, represent nearly half of the tokens in this study.
    Table 6 shows that, comparing conjunction with nonconjunction, we agreed on the classification of 495 (97.2%) nonconjunction tokens but only 383 (86.3%) conjunctions.
    We both found 48 (10.8%) conjunctions ambiguous, but only 11 (2.2%) nonconjunctions; 48 of the 59 tokens we agreed were ambiguous in the corpus were, in fact, coordinate conjunctions.
    Of the 16 tokens on which we simply di
