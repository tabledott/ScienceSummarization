-Freq 20 model (on a 502 MHz Sun Blade computer).
    We then tested the best models for each vocabulary size on the testing set.4 Standard measures of performance are shown in table 1.5 The top panel of table 1 lists the results for the nonlexicalized model (SSN-Tags) and the available results for three other models which only use part-of-speech tags as inputs, another neural network parser (Costa et al., 2001), an earlier statistical left-corner parser (Manning and Carpenter, 1997), and a PCFG (Charniak, 1997).
    The SSN-Tags model achieves performance which is much better than the only other broad coverage neural network parser (Costa et al., 2001).
    The SSN-Tags model also does better than any other published results on parsing with just part-of-speech tags, as exemplified by the results for (Manning and Carpenter, 1997) and (Charniak, 1997).
    The bottom panel of table 1 lists the results for the two lexicalized models (SSN-Freq 200 and SSN-Freq 20) and five recent statistical parsers (Ratnaparkhi
