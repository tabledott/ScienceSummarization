for Pearson's X2 test, although the form shown is not quite the customary one.
    Figure 2 shows the reasonably good agreement between this expression and the exact binomial log-likelihood ratio derived earlier where p = 0.1 and n1 = n2 = 1000 for various values of ki and k2.
    Figure 3, on the other hand, shows the divergence between Pearson's statistic and the log-likelihood ratio when p = 0.01, n1 = 100, and n2 = 10000.
    Note the large change of scale on the vertical axis.
    The pronounced disparity occurs when ki is larger than the value expected based on the observed value of k2.
    The case where n1 &lt; n2 and Ln &gt;1 2 -n 2 is exactly the case of most interest in many text analyses.
    Tile convergence of the log of the likelihood ratio to the asymptotic distribution is demonstrated dramatically in Figure 4.
    In this figure, the straighter line was computed using a symbolic algebra package and represents the idealized one degree of freedom cumulative X2 distribution.
