    A knowledge base of about 400,000 facts has been built by learning facts from 8,000 Web users, over a one year period (Singh, 2002).
    If Open Mind Word Expert experiences a similar learning rate, we expect to shortly obtain a corpus that exceeds the size of all previously tagged data.
    During the first fifty days of activity, we collected about 26,000 tagged examples without significant efforts for publicizing the site.
    We expect this rate to gradually increase as the site becomes more widely known and receives more traffic.
  
  
    The availability of large amounts of semantically tagged data is crucial for creating successful WSD systems.
    Yet, as of today, only few sense tagged corpora are publicly available.
    One of the first large scale hand tagging efforts is reported in (Miller et al., 1993), where a subset of the Brown corpus was tagged with WordNet senses.
    The corpus includes a total of 234,136 tagged word occurrences, out of which 186,575 are polysemous.
