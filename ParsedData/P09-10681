chank and Abelson, 1977) (structured representations of events, their causal relationships, and their participants) and frames to drive interpretation of syntax and word use.
    Knowledge structures such as these provided the interpreter rich information about many aspects of meaning.
    The problem with these rich knowledge structures is that the need for hand construction, specificity, and domain dependence prevents robust and flexible language understanding.
    Instead, modern work on understanding has focused on shallower representations like semantic roles, which express at least one aspect of the semantics of events and have proved amenable to supervised learning from corpora like PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and Framenet (Baker et al., 1998).
    Unfortunately, creating these supervised corpora is an expensive and difficult multi-year effort, requiring complex decisions about the exact set of roles to be learned.
    Even unsupervised attempts to learn semantic roles have required a pre-defined se
