ng other, even more important information, such as the gender/number of noun phrases.
  
  
    Coreference resolution is generally conducted as a pairwise classification task, using various constraints and preferences to determine whether two expressions corefer.
    Coreference is typically only allowed between nouns matching in gender and number, and not violating any intrasentential syntactic principles.
    Constraints can be applied as a preprocessing step to scoring candidates based on distance, grammatical role, etc., with scores developed either manually (Lappin and Leass, 1994), or through a machine-learning algorithm (Kehler et al., 2004).
    Constraints and preferences have also been applied together as decision nodes on a decision tree (Aone and Bennett, 1995).
    When previous resolution systems handle cases like (1) and (2), where no disagreement or syntactic violation occurs, coreference is therefore determined by the weighting of features or learned decisions of the resolution classifier.
