e variant.
    For each of the four algorithms, we give proofs of correctness and complexity.
    In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation of all algorithms in combination with SVM classifiers for predicting the next parsing action, using data from thirteen languages.
    We show that all four algorithms give competitive accuracy, although the non-projective list-based algorithm generally outperforms the projective algorithms for languages with a non-negligible proportion of non-projective constructions.
    However, the projective algorithms often produce comparable results when combined with the technique known as pseudo-projective parsing.
    The linear time complexity of the stack-based algorithms gives them an advantage with respect to efficiency both in learning and in parsing, but the projective list-based algorithm turns out to be equally efficient in practice.
    Moreover, when the projective algorithms are used to implement pseudo-projective parsing, they sometimes become less efficient
