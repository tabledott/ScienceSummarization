ency problem have been described (and indeed are currently enjoying a surge of interest) in statistics, machine learning, and statistical pattern recognition, particularly image processing.
    The models of interest are known as random fields.
    Random fields can be seen as a generalization of Markov chains and stochastic branching processes.
    Markov chains are stochastic processes corresponding to regular grammars and random branching processes are stochastic processes corresponding to context-free grammars.
    The evolution of a Markov chain describes a line, in which each stochastic choice depends only on the state at the immediately preceding time-point.
    The evolution of a random branching process describes a tree in which a finite-state process may spawn multiple child processes at the next time-step, but the number of processes and their states depend only on the state of the unique parent process at the preceding time-step.
    In particular, stochastic choices are independent of other choic
