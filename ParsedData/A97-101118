cess rate is similar or maybe even slightly better than in ENGCG.
    More importantly, the ambiguity rate is only about a quarter of that in the ENGCG output.
    The overall result should be considered good in the sense that the output contains information about the syntactic functions (see Figure 4) not only part-of-speech tags.
    The major improvement over ENGCG is the level of explicit dependency representation, which makes it possible to excerpt modifiers of certain elements, such as arguments of verbs.
    This section evaluates the success of the level of dependencies.
    One of the crude measures to evaluate dependencies is to count how many times the correct head is found.
    The results are listed in Fig( received. correct links, ) ure 7.
    Precision is and rereceived links call ( ). received correct links, The difference between &#8216; desired lnks precision and recalli is due to the fact that the parser does not force a head on every word.
