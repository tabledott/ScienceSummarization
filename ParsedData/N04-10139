rease robustness, the standard grammar is augmented with a FRAGMENT grammar.
    This allows sentences to be parsed as well-formed chunks specified by the grammar, in particular as Ss, NPs, PPs, and VPs, with unparsable tokens possibly interspersed.
    These chunks have both c-structures and f-structures corresponding to them.
    The grammar has a fewest-chunk method for determining the correct parse.
    The grammar incorporates a version of Optimality Theory that allows certain (sub)rules in the grammar to be prefered or disprefered based on OT marks triggered by the (sub)rule (Frank et al., 1998).
    The Complete version of the grammar uses all of the (sub)rules in a multi-pass system that depends on the ranking of the OT marks in the rules.
    For example, topicalization is disprefered, but the topicalization rule will be triggered if no other parse can be built.
    A one-line rewrite of the Complete grammar creates a Core version of the grammar that moves the majority of the OT marks into the NOGOOD
