ing bilingual parallel corpora for paraphrasing has the inherent advantage that sentences in the other language are exactly semantically equivalent to sentences in the intended paraphrasing language.
    Therefore, the most common way to generate paraphrases with such a corpus exploits both its parallel and bilingual natures: Align phrases across the two languages and consider all co-aligned phrases in the intended language to be paraphrases.
    The bilingual phrasal alignments can simply be generated by using the automatic techniques developed for the same task in the SMT literature.
    Therefore, arguably the most important factor affecting the performance of these techniques is usually the quality of the automatic bilingual phrasal (or word) alignment techniques.
    One of the most popular methods leveraging bilingual parallel corpora is that proposed by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005).
    This technique operates exactly as described above by attempting to infer semantic equivalence between phrases i
