ntagged monolingual corpus, after the mapping has been performed.
    Our results show that the precision of the selection algorithm is high despite the additional noise which is introduced by mapping single words independently of their context.
    As mentioned in Section 6.3, an optimal method may combine the two methods.
    In some sense, the use of a bilingual lexicon resembles the use of a thesaurus in Yarowsky's approach.
    Both rely on a manually established mapping of senses to other concepts (classes of words or words in another language) and collect information about the target concepts from an untagged corpus.
    In both cases, ambiguous words in the corpus introduce some level of noise: counting an occurrence of a word as an occurrence of all the classes to which it belongs, or counting an occurrence of a target word as an occurrence of all the source words to which it may correspond (a smaller amount of noise is introduced in the latter case, as a mapping to target words is much more finely g
