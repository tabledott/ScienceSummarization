 alignment of the two trees.
    We again work in a dependency framework, where syntactic nodes are simply lexical items.
    This allows us to use existing work on word alignment.
    Hwa et al. (2005) tested the DCA under idealized conditions by obtaining hand-corrected dependency parse trees of a few hundred sentences of Spanish-English and Chinese-English bitext.
    They also used human-produced word alignments.
    Since their word alignments could be many-tomany, they gave a heuristic Direct Projection Algorithm (DPA) for resolving them into component dependency relations.
    It should be noted that this process introduced empty words into the projected target language tree and left words that are unaligned to English detached from the tree; as a result, they measured performance in dependency Fscore rather than accuracy.
    With manual English parses and word alignments, this DPA achieved 36.8% F-score in Spanish and 38.1% in Chinese.
    With Collins-model English parses and GIZA++ word alignments,
