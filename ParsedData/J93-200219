ives, such as saunter and arrive, are about equally likely to be followed by a cue for an NP argument.
    If the error probability 77-__s were known, then we could use the standard hypothesis testing method for binomial frequency data.
    For example, suppose 7r&#8222;= .05&#8212;on average, one in twenty occurrences of a -S verb is followed by a cue for S. If some verb V occurs 200 times in the corpus, and 20 of those occurrences are followed by cues for S, that ought to suggest that V is unlikely to have probability .05 of being followed by a cue for S, and hence V is unlikely to be -S. Specifically, the chance of flipping 20 or more heads out of 200 tosses of a coin with a five percent chance of coming up heads each time is less than three in 1000.
    On the other hand, it is not all that unusual to flip 2 or more heads out of 20 on such a coin&#8212;it happens about one time in four.
    If a verb occurs 20 times in the corpus and 2 of those occurrences are followed by cues for S, it is quite possible
