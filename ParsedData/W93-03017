    The variable, m, is used to denote the length of the French sentence and the variable, I, is used to denote the length of the English sentence.
    There are quite a number of constraints that could be used to estimate Pr(f, ale).
    Model 1 depends primarily on the translation probabilities, t(f(e), and does not make use of constraints involving the positions within an alignment.
