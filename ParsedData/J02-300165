    As with the clustering experiments reported above, the WordNet hierarchy was used only for noun phrases.
    The WordNet hierarchy does not include pronouns; to increase coverage, the personal pronouns I, me, you, he, she, him, her, we, and us were added as hyponyms of person.
    Pronouns that refer to inanimate, or both animate and inanimate, objects were not included.
    In addition, the CELEX English lexical database (Baayen, Piepenbrock, and Gulikers 1995) was used to convert plural nouns to their singular forms.
    As shown in Table 11, accuracy for the WordNet technique is roughly the same as that in the automatic clustering results in Table 10: 84.3% on NPs, as opposed to 85.0% with automatic clustering.
    This indicates that the error introduced by the unsupervised clustering is roughly equivalent to the error caused by our arbitrary choice of the first WordNet sense for each word and the first hypernym for each WordNet sense.
    Coverage for the WordNet technique is lower,
