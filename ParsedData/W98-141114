and the chances of stumbling on them are small.
    Different initial trees will contain different good fragments, and it seems desirable to be able to combine the good parts of different solutions.
    This motivates using some sort of crossover operation that can combine elements of two solutions into a new one [Goldberg 89].
    But it is not immediately clear how crossover could work on two RS trees.
    In particular, two chosen trees will rarely have non-trivial subtrees with equal fringes.
    Their way of breaking up the material may be so different that it is hard to imagine how one could combine elements of both.
    This jewel i is 72.0 cm long.
    The previous jewel.
    ; has little diamonds scattered around its edges and has an encrusted bezel.
    Iti is encrusted with jewels: iti features diamonds encrusted on a natural shell.
  
  
    As a way of making a crossover operation conceivable, our first step has been to reduce the planning problem. to that of planning the sequential order of the
