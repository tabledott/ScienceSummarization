n (Goel and Byrne, 2000) and bitext word alignment for statistical MT (Kumar and Byrne, 2002), to the problem of building automatic MT systems tuned for specific metrics.
    This is a framework that can be used with statistical models of speech and language to develop decision processes optimized for specific loss functions.
    We will show that MBR decoding can be applied to machine translation in two scenarios.
    Given an automatic MT metric, we design a loss function based on the metric and use MBR decoding to tune MT performance under the metric.
    We also show how MBR decoding can be used to incorporate syntactic structure into a statistical MT system by building specialized loss functions.
    These loss functions can use information from word strings, word-to-word alignments and parse-trees of the source sentence and its translation.
    In particular we describe the design of a Bilingual Tree Loss Function that can explicitly use syntactic structure for measuring translation quality.
