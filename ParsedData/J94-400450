uld be to use featural restrictions during syntactic processing.
  22 The solution to lexical divergence is trivial for transfer machine translation systems, ince transfer entries map source-language words directly to their target-language equivalents.
  In general, exical selection is not seen as a problem in these systems.
  616 Bonnie J. Dorr Machine Translation Divergences There is also a structural divergence in this example, since the prepositional phrase into the room must be translated into a noun phrase entrada al cuarto.
  This divergence compounds the lexical divergence problem, since it is necessary to choose the target- language word a in the absence of a source-language counterpart.
  Lexical divergence also shows up in three previously presented examples, (12), (29), and (26), owing to the presence of thematic, categorial, and conflational diver- gences, respectively: in (12) the word like is chosen for the word gustar (literally, to please); in (29) the word haben (literally, to have) is chose
