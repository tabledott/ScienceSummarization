he focus of the local context.
    We link the words in the extracted sentence with words in its local context, if they are repetitions, morphologically related, or linked in WordNet through one of the lexical relations.
    The system then computes an importance score for each word in the extracted sentence, based on the number of links it has with other words and the types of links.
    The formula for computing the context importance score for a word w is as follows: Here, i represents the different types of lexical relations the system considered, including repetition, inflectional relation, derivational relation, and the lexical relations from WordNet.
    We assigned a weight to each type of lexical relation, represented by Li in the formula.
    Relations such as repetition or inflectional relation are considered more important and are assigned higher weights, while relations such as hypernym are considered less important and assigned lower weights.
    NU (w) in the formula represents the number of a
