s paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we present the transliteration problems.
    In section 3, a joint source-channel model is formulated.
    In section 4, several experiments are carried out to study different aspects of proposed algorithm.
    In section 5, we relate our algorithms to other reported work.
    Finally, we conclude the study with some discussions.
  
  
    Transliteration is a process that takes a character string in source language as input and generates a character string in the target language as output.
    The process can be seen conceptually as two levels of decoding: segmentation of the source string into transliteration units; and relating the source language transliteration units with units in the target language, by resolving different combinations of alignments and unit mappings.
    A unit could be a Chinese character or a monograph, a digraph or a trigraph and so on for English.
    The problems of English-Chinese transliteration have been studied extensively in the
