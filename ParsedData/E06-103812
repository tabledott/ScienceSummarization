I(yj)) for a pair of adjacent words in the compression.
    These features were tuned on a development data set.
  
  
    The first set of features are over adjacent words yj&#8722;1 and yj in the compression.
    These include the part-of-speech (POS) bigrams for the pair, the POS of each word individually, and the POS context (bigram and trigram) of the most recent word being added to the compression, yj.
    These features are meant to indicate likely words to include in the compression as well as some level of grammaticality, e.g., the adjacent POS features &#8220;JJ&amp;VB&#8221; would get a low weight since we rarely see an adjective followed by a verb.
    We also add a feature indicating if yj&#8722;1 and yj were actually adjacent in the original sentence or not and we conjoin this feature with the above POS features.
    Note that we have not included any lexical features.
    We found during experiments on the development data that lexical information was too sparse and led to overfitting, so we ra
