t;learn&amp;quot; how to identify a sense of a polysemous word with as few as 100 example contexts.
    On the other hand, anyone who has manually built such sets knows that even collecting 100 examples of each sense is a long and tedious process.
    The next section presents one way in which the lexical knowledge in WordNet can be used to extract training examples automatically.
  
  
    Corpus-based word sense identifiers are data hungry&#8212;it takes them mere seconds to digest all of the information contained in training materials that take months to prepare manually.
    So, although statistical classifiers are undeniably effective, they are not feasible until we can obtain reliable unsupervised training data.
    In the Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992a) study, training and testing materials were automatically acquired using an aligned French-English bilingual corpus by searching for English words that have two different French translations.
    For example, English tokens of sentence were translated
