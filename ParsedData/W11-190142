response entities R, with each entity comprising one or more mentions, each metric generates its variation of a precision and recall measure.
    The MUC measure if the oldest and most widely used.
    It focuses on the links (or, pairs of mentions) in the data.18 The number of common links between entities in K and R divided by the number of links in K represents the recall, whereas, precision is the number of common links between entities in K and R divided by the number of links in R. This metric prefers systems that have more mentions per entity &#8211; a system that creates a single entity of all the mentions will get a 100% recall without significant degradation in its precision.
    And, it ignores recall for singleton entities, or entities with only one mention.
    The B-CUBED metric tries to addresses MUCS&#8217;s shortcomings, by focusing on the mentions and computes recall and precision scores for each mention.
    If K is the key entity containing mention M, and R is the response entity containin
