h segments were never included in the development or test set, since, as discussed in Section 2, their labels are probably noisy; however, including them in the training set allows the classifier to examine more instances even though some of them are labeled incorrectly.
    As Table 2 shows, using more, if noisy, data yields better agreement-classification results on the development set, and so we use that policy in all subsequent experiments.11 10Our implementation puts a link between just one arbitrary pair of speech segments among all those uttered by a given pair of apparently agreeing speakers.
    The &#8220;infiniteweight&#8221; same-speaker links propagate the agreement information to all other such pairs.
    11Unfortunately, this policy leads to inferior test-set agreeAn important observation is that precision may be more important than accuracy in deciding which agreement links to add: false positives with respect to agreement can cause speech segments to be incorrectly assigned the same label, wh
