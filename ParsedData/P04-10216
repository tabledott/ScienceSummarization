    For instance, French has different phonic rules from those of English.
    The phoneme-based approach requires derivation of proper phonemic representation for names of different origins.
    One may need to prepare multiple language-dependent grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion systems accordingly, and that is not easy to achieve (The Onomastica Consortium, 1995).
    For example, /Lafontant/ is transliterated into &#25289;&#20016;&#21776;(La-FengTang) while /Constant/ becomes &#24247;&#26031;&#22374;&#29305;(KangSi-Tan-Te) , where syllable /-tant/ in the two names are transliterated differently depending on the names&#8217; language of origin.
    2) Suppose that language dependent graphemeto-phoneme systems are attainable, obtaining Chinese orthography will need two further steps: a) conversion from generic phonemic representation to Chinese Pinyin; b) conversion from Pinyin to Chinese characters.
    Each step introduces a level of imprecision.
