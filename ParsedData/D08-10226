e NP and VP), and whose frontier nodes are labeled by sourcelanguage words (like &#8220;y&#711;u&#8221;) or variables from a set X = {x1, x2,...}; rhs(r) is the target-side string expressed in target-language words (like &#8220;with&#8221;) and variables; and 0(r) is a mapping from X to nonterminals.
    Each variable xi E X occurs exactly once in lhs(r) and exactly once in rhs(r).
    For example, for rule r1 in Figure 1, These rules are being used in the reverse direction of the string-to-tree transducers in Galley et al. (2004).
    We now briefly explain the algorithm of Galley et al. (2004) that can extract these translation rules from a word-aligned bitext with source-side parses.
    Consider the example in Figure 3.
    The basic idea is to decompose the source (Chinese) parse into a series of tree fragments, each of which will form a rule with its corresponding English translation.
    However, not every fragmentation can be used for rule extraction, since it may or may not respect the alignment and
