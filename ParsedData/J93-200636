    Furthermore, the partially specified semantic representation for the sentence as a whole also shows the semantic relation to SCHOOLS, which is expressed here by the for phrase.

    Probabilistic modeling plays a key role in this process.
    While context-sensitive techniques for inferring lexical features can contribute a great deal, they can still leave substantial ambiguity.
