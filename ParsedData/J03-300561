ional probability estimates f (v, n)/f (v) and f (v', n)/f (v') and again selected as the seen bigram the one with the highest estimate (in both cases, ties were resolved by choosing at random).10 The same two models were used to perform pseudodisambiguation for the (v, n, n') triples, where we have to choose between (v, n) and (v, n').
    Here, the probability estimates f (v, n) and f (v, n') were used for the joint probability model, and f (v, n)/f (n) and f (v, n')/f (n') for the conditional probability model.
    The results for Rooth et al.&#8217;s (1999) data set are given in Table 13.
    The conditional probability model achieves a performance of 71.2% correct for subjects and 85.2% correct for objects.
    The performance on the whole data set is 77.7%, which is below the performance of 80.0% reported by Rooth et al. (1999).
    However, the difference is not found to be significant using a chi-square test comparing the number of correct and incorrect classifications (x2(1) = 2.02, p = .16).
