d in another large improvement, and predicate nominals also helped.
    Our full model scores about 9% higher than Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), and about 6% higher than McCallum &amp; Wellner (2005).
    To our knowledge, this is the best coreference accuracy reported on MUC-6 to date.7 The B3 scores of MLN-HAN on the MUC-6 dataset are 77.4 (precision), 67.6 (recall) and 72.2 (F1).
    (The other systems did not report B3.)
    Interestingly, the rule-based MLN (RULE) sufficed to outperform Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007), and by using better heads and the apposition and predicate-nominal rules (RULE-HAN), it outperformed McCallum &amp; Wellner (2005), the supervised system.
    The MLNs with learning (MLN-30 and MLN-HAN), on the other hand, substantially outperformed the corresponding rule-based ones.
    Table 2 compares our system to Haghighi &amp; Klein (2007) on the ACE-2004 training set in MUC scores.
    Again, our system outperformed theirs by a large margin.
