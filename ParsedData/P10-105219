ewhere in the literature.
    Unless otherwise mentioned, the experiments use the same protocol: 10 fold cross validation, where eight folds are used for training, one for development, and one for testing.
    Results are reported in terms of phoneme error rates or tag error rates on the test set.
    Comparing run-times can be a tricky matter, especially when different software packages are involved.
    As discussed above, the observed runtimes depend on many small implementation details.
    As the three algorithms share as much code as possible, we believe the comparison reported hereafter to be fair and reliable.
    All experiments were performed on a server with 64G of memory and two Xeon processors with 4 cores at 2.27 Ghz.
    For comparison, all measures of run-times include the cumulated activity of all cores and give very pessimistic estimates of the wall time, which can be up to 7 times smaller.
    For OWL-QN, we use 5 past values of the gradient to approximate the inverse of the Hessian matrix:
