on 'waves.'
    Semantic dependencies exist between not just pairs of lexical items but also pairs of senses of lexical items.
    For example, the metaphorical reading of (15) is because 'waves' is understood as being the sense meaning &amp;quot;movement of water,&amp;quot; not for example the sense meaning &amp;quot;movement of the hand.&amp;quot; Semantic relations result from evaluating lexical semantic constraints in sentences.
    Every semantic relation has a source (a lexical item whose semantic constraints are applied) and a target (a lexical item which receives those constraints).
    Other terms used to refer to the source and target in a semantic relation include: vehicle and tenor (Richards 1936), subsidiary subject and principal subject (Black 1962), figurative term and literal term (Perrine 1971), referent and subject (Tversky 1977), secondary subject and primary subject (Black 1979), source and destination (Winston 1980), old domain and new domain (Hobbs 1983a), and base and target (Gentner 19
