al meaning.
    Following Sch&#168;utze (1998) and Landauer &amp; Dumais (1997) our general assumption is that the meaning of an expression can be modelled in terms of the words that it co-occurs with: its co-occurrence signature.
    To determine whether a phrase has a non-compositional meaning we compute whether the co-occurrence signature of the phrase is systematically related to the cooccurrence signatures of its parts.
    Our hypothesis is that a systematic relationship is indicative of compositional interpretation and lack of a systematic relationship is symptomatic of noncompositionality.
    In other words, we expect compositional MWEs to appear in contexts more similar to those in which their component words appear than do non-compositional MWEs.
    In this paper we describe two experiments that test this hypothesis.
    In the first experiment we seek to confirm that the local context of a known idiom can reliably distinguish idiomatic uses from non-idiomatic uses.
    In the second experiment we
