ach representations of generalizations across linguistic objects and across languages; and (iii) the richness of the matrix and the incorporation of files which connect it with the LKB allow for extremely quick start-up as the matrix is applied to new languages.
    Since February 2002, this preliminary version of the matrix has been in use at two Norwegian universities, one working towards a broad-coverage reference implementation of Norwegian (NTNU), the other&#8212;for the time being&#8212;focused on specific aspects of clause structure and lexical description (Oslo University).
    In the first experiment with the matrix, at NTNU, basic Norwegian sentences were parsing and producing reasonable semantics within two hours of downloading the matrix files.
    Linguistic coverage should scale up quickly, since the foundation supplied by the matrix is designed not only to provide a quick start, but also to support long-term development of broad-coverage grammars.
    Both initiatives have confirmed the utility
