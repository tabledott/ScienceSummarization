s assumed that the words it contains are being used in the same senses as were assigned manually.
    Disambiguation makes use of several knowledge sources: frequency information, syntactic tags, morphological information, semantic context (clusters), collocations and word associations, role-related expectations, and selectional restrictions.
    The knowledge sources are combined by adding their results.
    Each knowledge source assigns a (possibly negative) numeric value to each of the possible senses.
    The numerical value depends upon the type of knowledge source.
    Some knowledge sources have only two possible values, for example the frequency information has one value for frequent senses and another for infrequent ones.
    The numerical values assigned for each were determined manually.
    The selectional restrictions knowledge source assigns scores in the range -10 to +10, with higher scores being assigned to senses that are more specific (according to the concept hierarchy).
