s (e.g., WordNet), and ontologies (Buitelaar, Cimiano, and Magnini 2005; Lenci 2010).
    Innovative applications of corpus-based semantics are also being explored in linguistics, for instance in the study of semantic change (Sagi, Kaufmann, and Clark 2009), lexical variation (Peirsman and Speelman 2009), and for the analysis of multiword expressions (Alishahi and Stevenson 2008).
    The wealth and variety of semantic issues that DSMs are able to tackle confirms the importance of looking at distributional data to explore meaning, as well as the maturity of this research field.
    However, if we looked from a distance at the whole field of DSMs we would see that, besides the general assumption shared by all models that information about the context of a word is an important key in grasping its meaning, the elements of difference overcome the commonalities.
    For instance, DSMs geared towards attributional similarity represent words in the contexts of other (content) words, thereby looking very different fr
