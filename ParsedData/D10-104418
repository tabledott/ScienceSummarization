ered to retain the top 30 translations for each source phrase using the TM part of the current log-linear model.
    Table 2 shows results for both settings and all methods described in sections 2 and 3.
    The 1st block contains the simple baselines from section 2.1.
    The natural baseline (baseline) outperforms the pure IN system only for EMEA/EP fren.
    Log-linear combination (loglin) improves on this in all cases, and also beats the pure IN system.
    The 2nd block contains the IR system, which was tuned by selecting text in multiples of the size of the EMEA training corpus, according to dev set performance.
    This significantly underperforms log-linear combination.
    The 3rd block contains the mixture baselines.
    The linear LM (lin lm), TM (lin tm) and MAP TM (map tm) used with non-adapted counterparts perform in all cases slightly worse than the log-linear combination, which adapts both LM and TM components.
    However, when the linear LM is combined with a linear TM (lm+lin tm) or MAP TM
