 then later also matched against by transformational rule patterns, were derived by running the raw texts in a prepass through Brill's transformational part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1993c).
    In transformational learning, the space of candidate rules to be searched is defined by a set of rule templates that each specify a small number of particular feature sets as the relevant factors that a rule's left-hand-side pattern should examine, for example, the part-of-speech tag of the word two to the left combined with the actual word one to the left.
    In the preliminary scan of the corpus for each learning pass, it is these templates that are applied to each location whose current tag is not correct, generating a candidate rule that would apply at least at that one location, matching those factors and correcting the chunk tag assignment.
    When this approach is applied to part-of-speech tagging, the possible sources of evidence for templates involve the identities of words within a neighborhood of some appr
