stuctures.
    The result of unifying two descriptions is a new description, which is satisfied by the intersection of the sets of structures that satisfy the two given descriptions.
    The new description contains all the information that is contained in either of the given descriptions, subtracting any disjuncts which are no longer compatible.
  
  
    In order to illustrate the effect of each step of the algorithm, let us consider an example of unifying the description of a known constituent with the description of a portion of a grammar.
    This exemplifies the predominant type of structure building operation needed in a parsing program for Functional Unification Grammar.
    The example given here is deliberately simple, in order to illustrate how the algorithm works with a minimum amount of detail.
    It is not intended as an example of a linguistically motivated grammar. descriptions have been unified, and their indefinite components have been conjoined together.
    In step 2 of the algorithm each
