that tend to occur in possibly aligned sentences.
    The idea is to propose a pair of words for alignment if they have similar distributions in their respective texts.
    The distributions of a pair of words are similar if most of the sentences in which the first word occurs are alignable with sentences in which the second occurs, and vice versa.
    The most apparently reliable of these word alignments are then used to induce a set of sentence alignments that will be a subset of the eventual result.
    A new estimate is now made of what sentences are alignable based on the fact that we are now committed to aligning certain pairs, Because sentence pairs are never removed from the set of alignments, the process converges to the point when no new ones can be found; then it stops.
    In the next section, we describe the algorithm, In Section 3 we describe additions to the basic technique required to provide for morphology, that is, relatively superficial variations in the forms of words.
    In Section 4 we
