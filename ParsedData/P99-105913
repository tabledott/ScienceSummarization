n(H) and D = A single head automaton is an acceptor for a language of string pairs (zi, zr) E V x V. Informally, if b is the leftmost symbol of Zr and q' E a(q, b, -4), then Ha can move from state q to state q', matching symbol b and removing it from the left end of Zr.
    Symmetrically, if b is the rightmost symbol of zi and q' E Sa(q,b,&lt;---) then from q Ha can move to q', matching symbol b and removing it from the right end of z1.5 More formally, we associate with the head automaton Ha a &amp;quot;derives&amp;quot; relation ha, defined as a binary relation on Qa X 1 /4 X V. .
    For every q E Q, x,y E V, b E VT, de D, and q' E &amp;(q, b, d), we specify that The reflexive and transitive closure of ha is written Ha*.
    The language generated by Ha is the set We may now define the language generated by the entire grammar H. To generate, we expand the start word $ E VT into x$y for some (x, y) E L (Hs), and then recursively expand the words in strings x and y.
    More formally, given H, we simultaneous
