f-speech-tagged corpora.
    This means that parsing errors are likely to result because of tagging mistakes.
    Second, even if one assumes perfect tagging, the heuristic nature of our extraction procedures may introduce additional noise or miss bigrams for which detailed structural information would be needed.
    For instance, our method for extracting adjective-noun pairs ignores cases in which the adjective modifies noun sequences of length greater than two.
    The heuristic in (1) considers only two-word noun sequences.
    Abney&#8217;s (1996) chunker recognizes basic syntactic units without resolving attachment ambiguities or recovering missing information (such as traces resulting from the movement of constituents).
    Although parsing is robust and fast (since unlike in traditional parsers, no global optimization takes place), the identified verb-argument relations are undoubtedly somewhat noisy, given the errors inherent in the part-of-speech tagging and chunk recognition procedure.
