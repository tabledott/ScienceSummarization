    Various heuristics are used to combine source-to-target and target-to-source alignments, after which a further heuristic is used to read off phrase pairs which are &#8216;consistent&#8217; with the alignment.
    Although efficient, the sheer number of somewhat arbitrary heuristics makes this approach overly complicated.
    A number of authors have proposed alternative techniques for directly inducing phrase-based translation models from sentence aligned data.
    Marcu and Wong (2002) proposed a phrase-based alignment model which suffered from a massive parameter space and intractable inference using expectation maximisation.
    Taking a different tack, DeNero et al. (2008) presented an interesting new model with inference courtesy of a Gibbs sampler, which was better able to explore the full space of phrase translations.
    However, the efficacy of this model is unclear due to the small-scale experiments and the short sampling runs.
