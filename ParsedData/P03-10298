ting dependency trees contain some NE class names as leaf nodes.
    This is crucial to identifying common patterns, and to applying these patterns to new text.
    The procedure retrieves a set of documents that describe the events of the scenario of interest, the relevant document set.
    A set of narrative sentences describing the scenario is selected to create a query for the retrieval.
    Any IR system of sufficient accuracy can be used at this stage.
    For this experiment, we retrieved the documents using CRL&#8217;s stochasticmodel-based IR system (Murata et al., 1999).
    Given the dependency trees of parsed sentences in the relevant document set, all the possible subtrees can be candidates for extraction patterns.
    The ranking of pattern candidates is inspired by TF/IDF scoring in IR literature; a pattern is more relevant when it appears more in the relevant document set and less across the entire collection of source documents.
