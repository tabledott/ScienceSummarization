 problematic.
    There need not be a one-to-one mapping from source language relations to target language ones.
    In many cases the mapping depends on the words of the syntactic tuple, as seen in the following example of translating from German to English.
    In this example the source language subject (Tisch) becomes the direct object (table) in the target, whereas the direct object (mir) in the source language becomes the subject (I) in the target.
    Therefore, the German syntactic tuples (The Hebrew equivalent is similar to the German structure).
    In practice this is less of a problem.
    In most cases, the source language relation has a direct equivalent in the target language.
    In many other cases, transformation rules can be encoded, either in the lexicon (if they are word dependent) or as syntactic transformations.
    These rules are usually available in machine translation systems that use the transfer method, as this knowledge is required to generate target language structures.
