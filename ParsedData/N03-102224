 high cost.
    Some advantages are: the capability of pinpointing exact answers that otherwise will be missed, answer justification, and a quantifiable measure of how close a system is to providing an answer.
    However, the implementation of a QA logic prover is expensive as it requires logic representation of text, world knowledge axioms and a large number of linguistic axioms, that all take time to develop.
