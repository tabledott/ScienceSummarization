ount of sharing of individual sibling pairs among different rules, the so-called cross-pollination effect.
    This method of determining probabilities effectively amounts to a bigram language model7 embedded in a hierarchical structure, where a separate set of bigram statistics is collected on category pairs for each unique LHS category name.
    The method is to be distinguished from the more common method of applying probabilities to entire rule productions, rather than to sibling pairs among a shared rule set.
    An advantage to organizing probabilities at the sibling-pair level is that it conveniently provides an explicit probability estimate for a single next word, given a particular word sequence.
    This probability can be used to represent the language model score for the next word, which, when used in conjunction with the acoustic score, provides the overall score for the word.
    We make a further simplifying assumption that each sentence has only a single parse associated with it.
    This is p
