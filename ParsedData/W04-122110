l F1 measure of 69.8 on the evaluation set (88.9 on the training set), converging after 230 training iterations and approximately 18 hours of computation.
    The complete model, however, only reached an overall F1 of 69.5 on the evaluation set (86.7 on the training set), converging after 152 iterations in approximately 9 hours.
    The deleterious effect of the semantic lexicons is surprising and puzzling.7 However, even though semantic lexicons slightly decrease overall performance, it is worthwhile to note that adding lexicons actually improves both recall and precision for the RNA and CELL-LINE entities.
    These happen to be the two lowest frequency class labels in the data, together comprising less than 10% of the mentions in either the training or evaluation set.
    Error analysis shows that several of the orthographic model&#8217;s false negatives for these entities are of the form &#8220;messenger accumulation&#8221; (RNA) or &#8220;nonadherent culture&#8221; (CELL-LINE).
