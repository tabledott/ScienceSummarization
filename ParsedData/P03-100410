thresholds).
    The algorithm PKE is an approximation of the PKB, and changes the final accuracy according to the selection of thresholds &#963;pos and &#963;neg.
    The calculation of w' is formulated as the following mining problem: Given a set of support examples and subset weight cd(r), extract all subsets s and their weights w(s) if w(s) holds w(s) &gt; &#963;pos or w(s) :5 &#963;neg .
    In this paper, we apply a Sub-Structure Mining algorithm to the feature combination mining problem.
    Generally speaking, sub-structures mining algorithms efficiently extract frequent sub-structures (e.g., subsets, sub-sequences, sub-trees, or subgraphs) from a large database (set of transactions).
    In this context, frequent means that there are no less than &#958; transactions which contain a sub-structure.
    The parameter &#958; is usually referred to as the Minimum Support.
    Since we must enumerate all subsets of F, we can apply subset mining algorithm, in some times called as Basket Mining algorithm, to
