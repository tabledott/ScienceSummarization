    To explore how much difference in performance those lexical rule templates make, we repeated the above test runs omitting templates that refer to specific words.
    The results for these runs, in Tables 7 and 8, suggest that the lexical rules improve performance on the baseNP chunk task by about 1% (roughly 5% of the overall error reduction) and on the partitioning chunk task by about 5% (roughly 10% of the error reduction).
    Thus lexical rules appear to be making a limited contribution in determining baseNP chunks, but a more significant one for the partitioning chunks.
    A rough hand categorization of a sample of the errors from a baseNP run indicates that many fall into classes that are understandably difficult for any process using only local word and partof-speech patterns to resolve.
    The most frequent single confusion involved words tagged VBG and VBN, whose baseline prediction given their part-of-speech tag was 0, but which also occur frequently inside baseNPs.
    The system did d
