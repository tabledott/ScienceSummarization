coder should, after translating the word &#8220;Ihn&#8221; as &#8220;increase&#8221;, jump to the last word &#8220;R 13T(investment)&#8221;.
    This is obviously out of the capability of the baseline model, and our approach can accomplish the desired reordering as expected.
    By and large, the experiment results show that no matter what kind of reordering knowledge is used, the preprocessing of syntax-based reordering does greatly improve translation performance, and that the reordering of 3-ary nodes is crucial.
    The second set of experiments test the effect of some constraints.
    The basic setting is the same as that of test 6 in the first experiment set, and reordering is applied to both binary and 3-ary nodes.
    The results are shown in table 5.
    In test (a), the constraint is that the module does not consider any reordering of a node if the yield of this node contains not more than four words.
    The underlying rationale is that reordering within distortion limit should be left to the dista
