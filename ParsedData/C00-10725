tion.
  On the contrary, topic signatures only rely on cor- pus statistics, arc docmnent-based a and used in text smnmarization.
  In the next section, we describe the automated text smmnarization system SUMMARIST that we used in the experiments to provide the context of discussion.
  We then define topic signatures and de- tail the procedures for automatically constructing topic signatures.
  In Section 5, we give an overview of the corpus used in the evaluation.
  In Section 6 we present he experimental results and the possibility of enriching topic signatures using an existing ontol- ogy.
  Finally, we end this paper with a conclusion.
  3 SUMMARIST SUMMARIST (How and Lin, 1999) is a system designed to generate summaries of multilingual in- put texts.
  At this time, SUMMARIST can process English, Arabic, Bahasa Indonesia, Japanese, Ko- rean, and Spanish texts.
  It combines robust natural language processing methods (morl)hologieal trans- formation and part-of-speech tagging), symbolic world knowledge, an
