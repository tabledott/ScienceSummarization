tures described in Section 7 as to their usefulness for this task.
    The second is to investigate the importance of recognizing neutral instances&#8212; recognizing when a sentiment clue is not being used to express a sentiment&#8212;for classifying contextual polarity.
    To evaluate features, we investigate their performance, both together and separately, across several different learning algorithms.
    Varying the learning algorithm allows us to verify that the features are robust and that their performance is not the artifact of a particular algorithm.
    We experiment with four different types of machine learning: boosting, memory-based learning, rule learning, and support vector learning.
    For boosting, we use BoosTexter (Schapire and Singer 2000) AdaBoost.MH.
    For rule learning, we use Ripper (Cohen 1996).
    For memory-based learning, we use TiMBL (Daelemans et al. 2003b) IB1 (k-nearest neighbor).
    For support vector learning, we use SVM-light and SVM-multiclass (Joachims 1999).
