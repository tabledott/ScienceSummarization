an further increase parsing speed.This is the first work we are aware of to succes fully integrate a supertagger with a full parser which uses a lexicalised grammar automatically extractedfrom the Penn Treebank.
			We also report signifi cantly higher parsing speeds on newspaper text than any previously reported for a full wide-coverage parser.
			Our results confirm that wide-coverage CCG parsing is feasible for many large-scale NLP tasks.
	
	
			Parsing using CCG can be viewed as a two-stage process: first assign lexical categories to the wordsin the sentence, and then combine the categories to gether using CCG?s combinatory rules.1 The first stage can be accomplished by simply assigning to each word all categories from the word?s entry in the lexicon (Hockenmaier, 2003).
