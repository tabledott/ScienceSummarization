    It is provided for readers who are skeptical about our use of transcribed word boundaries.
    The move coders reached K = .92 using word boundaries as units (N = 4,079 [the number of units], k = 4 [the number of coders]); pairwise percent agreement on locations where any coder had marked a move boundary was 89% (N = 796).
    Most of the disagreement fell into one of two categories.
    First, some coders marked a READY move but the others included the same material in the move that followed.
    One coder in particular was more likely to mark READY moves, indicating either greater vigilance or a less restrictive definition.
    Second, some coders marked a reply, while others split the reply into a reply plus some sort of move conveying further information not strictly elicited by the opening question (i.e., an EXPLAIN, CLARIFY, or INSTRUCT).
    This confusion was general, suggesting that it might be useful to think more carefully about the difference between answering a question and providi
