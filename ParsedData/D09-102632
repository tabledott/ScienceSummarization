a higher probability in programming than in design.
    But because the document as a whole is more about design than programming(incorporating words not shown here), inferring the document&#8217;s topic-mixture &#952; enables L-LDA to correctly re-assign most words. that L-LDA correctly infers that most of the words in this passage have more to do with design than programming.
  
  
    This paper has introduced Labeled LDA, a novel model of multi-labeled corpora that directly addresses the credit assignment problem.
    The new model improves upon LDA for labeled corpora by gracefully incorporating user supervision in the form of a one-to-one mapping between topics and labels.
    We demonstrate the model&#8217;s effectiveness on tasks related to credit attribution within documents, including document visualizations and tagspecific snippet extraction.
    An approximation to Labeled LDA is also shown to be competitive with a strong baseline (multiple one vs-rest SVMs) for multi-label classification.
