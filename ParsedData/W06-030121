pic using FrameNet data.
    Our method first identifies an opinion-bearing word, labels semantic roles related to the word in the sentence, and then finds a holder and a topic of the opinion word among labeled semantic roles.
    There has been little previous study in identifying opinion holders and topics partly because it requires a great amount of annotated data.
    To overcome this barrier, we utilized FrameNet data by mapping target words to opinion-bearing words and mapping semantic roles to holders and topics.
    However, FrameNet has a limited number of words in its annotated corpus.
    For a broader coverage, we used a clustering technique to predict a most probable frame for an unseen word.
    Our experimental results showed that our system performs significantly better than the baseline.
    The baseline system results imply that opinion holder and topic identification is a hard task.
    We believe that there are many complicated semantic relations between opinion-bearing words and their hol
