edge which cannot be automatically acquired.
    In the remainder of the section, we show that this is not the case.
    Our manual analysis of generated sentences revealed that most of the grammatical mistakes are caused by the linearization component, or more specifically, by suboptimal scoring of the language model.
    Language modeling is an active area of research, and we believe that advances in this direction will be able to dramatically boost the linearization capacity of our algorithm.
    4.4.1 Error Analysis.
    In this section, we discuss the results of our manual analysis of mistakes in content selection and surface realization.
    Note that in some cases multiple errors are entwined in one sentence, which makes it hard to distinguish between a sequence of independent mistakes and a cause-and-effect chain.
    Therefore, the presented counts should be viewed as approximations, rather than precise numbers.
    We start with the analysis of the test set and continue with the description of some
