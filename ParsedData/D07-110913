proportional to p(zu = i |z?u) ? ?
			p(?
			|??u)1[wu ? ?], (2) which is the probability of selecting z from ?d times the probability of a path generating wu from a path in the ith WORDNET-WALK.
			The first term, the topic probability of the uth word, is based on the assignments to the K topics for words other than u in this document, p(zu = i|z?u) = n(d)?u,i + ?i ? j n (d) ?u,j + ?K j=1 ?j , (3) where n(d)?u,j is the number of words other than u in topic j for the document d that u appears in.
			The second term in Equation 2 is a sum over the probabilities of every path that could have generatedthe word wu.
			In practice, this sum can be com puted using a dynamic program for all nodes that have unique parent (i.e. those that can?t be reached by more than one path).
			Although the probability ofa path is specific to the topic, as the transition prob abilities for a synset are different across topics, we will omit the topic index in the equation, p(?u = ?|??u, ) = ?l?1 i=1 ? ?u ?i,?i+1 .
