ute this to two factors.
    First, as noted above, although far from perfect, NE taggers generally perform reasonably well.
    Second, only 20 to 25% of the coreference element resolutions required for these data sets involve a proper name (see Section 4).
    Conclusion #1: Improving the performance of NE taggers is not likely to have a large impact on the performance of state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems.
    We expect CE detection to be an important subproblem for an end-to-end coreference system.
    Results for a system that assumes perfect CEs are shown in box 5 of Table 3.
    For these runs, RECONCILEACL09 uses only the annotated CEs for both training and testing.
    Using perfect CEs solves a large part of the coreference resolution task: the annotated CEs divulge anaphoricity information, perfect NP boundaries, and perfect information regarding the coreference relation defined for the data set.
    We see that focusing attention on all and only the annotated CEs leads to (often subst
