he task structure was necessarily a prebuilt tree.
    If the task structure is taken to be a special case of intentional structure, it becomes clear that the tree structure is simply a more constrained structure than one might require for other discourses; the nature of the task related to the task-oriented discourse is such that the dominance hierarchy of the intentional structure of the dialogue has both dominance and satisfaction-precedence relationships,5 while other discourses may not exhibit significant precedence constraints among the DSPs.
    Furthermore, there has never been any reason to assume that the task structures in task-oriented dialogues are prebuilt, any more than the intentional structure of any other kind of discourses.
    It is rather that one objective of discourse theory (not a topic considered here, however) is to explain how the OCP builds up a model of the task structure by using information supplied in the discourse.
    However, it is important to note that conflating the afore
