he attachment decision (1 for noun attachment, 0 for verb).
    For example the verb phrase: ((joined (the board)) (as a nonexecutive director)) would give the quintuple: 0 joined board as director The elements of this quintuple will from here on be referred to as the random variables A, V, Ni, P, and N2.
    In the above verb phrase A = 0, V = joined, Ni = board, P = as, and N2 = director.
    The data consisted of training and test files of 20801 and 3097 quintuples respectively.
    In addition, a development set of 4039 quintuples was also supplied.
    This set was used during development of the attachment algorithm, ensuring that there was no implicit training of the method on the test set itself.
    A PP-attachment algorithm must take each quadruple (V = v, Ni = nl, P = p, N2 = n2) in test data and decide whether the attachment variable A =.-- 0 or 1.
    The accuracy of the algorithm is then the percentage of attachments it gets 'correct' on test data, using the A values taken from the treebank as th
