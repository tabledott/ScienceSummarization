 uninformative or misleading set of features.
    Therefore, our focus is on developing and discovering feature sets that make distinctions among word senses.
    Our learning algorithms must not only produce accurate models, but they should also shed new light on the relationships among features and allow us to continue refining and understanding our feature sets.
    We believe that decision trees meet these criteria.
    A wide range of implementations are available, and they are known to be robust and accurate across a range of domains.
    Most important, their structure is easy to interpret and may provide insights into the relationships that exist among features and more general rules of disambiguation.
  
  
    Bigrams have been used as features for word sense disambiguation, particularly in the form of collocations where the ambiguous word is one component of the bigram (e.g., (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), (Ng and Lee, 1996), (Yarowsky, 1995)).
    While some of the bigrams we identify are collocations t
