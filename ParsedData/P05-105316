    In this paper, we only measure the performance of relation extraction on &#8220;true&#8221; mentions with &#8220;true&#8221; chaining of coreference (i.e. as annotated by the corpus annotators) in the ACE corpus.
    Table 2 measures the performance of our relation extraction system over the 43 ACE relation subtypes on the testing set.
    It shows that our system achieves best performance of 63.1%/49.5%/ 55.5 in precision/recall/F-measure when combining diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features.
    Table 2 also measures the contributions of different features by gradually increasing the feature set.
    It shows that: country name list and the personal relative trigger word list further increases the F-measure by 1.5 largely due to the differentiation of the relation subtype &#8220;ROLE.Citizen-Of&#8221; from &#8220;ROLE.
    Residence&#8221; by distinguishing country GPEs from other GPEs.
    The effect of personal relative trigger words is very limited due to the limited number of testing insta
