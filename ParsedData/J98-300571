ning a given entity as a news corpus on which to perform the extraction of descriptions.
  
  
    Our prototype system demonstrates the feasibility of generating briefings of a series of domain-specific news articles on the same event, highlighting changes over time as well as similarities and differences among sources and including some historical information about the participants.
    The ability to automatically provide summaries of heterogeneous material will critically help in the effective use of the Internet in order to avoid overload with information.
    We show how planning operators can be used to synthesize summary content from a set of templates, each representing a single article.
    These planning operators are empirically based, coming from analysis of existing summaries, and allow for the generation of concise briefings.
    Our framework allows for experimentation with summaries of different lengths and for the combination of multiple, independent summary operators to produce more complex
