ard criterion for training such a log-linear model is to maximize the probability of the parallel training corpus consisting of S sentence pairs f(fs, es) : s = 1, ... , S}.
    However, this does not guarantee optimal performance on the metric of translation quality by which our system will ultimately be evaluated.
    For this reason, we optimize the parameters directly against the BLEU metric on held-out data.
    This is a more difficult optimization problem, as the search space is no longer convex.
    However, certain properties of the BLEU metric can be exploited to speed up search, as described in detail by Och (2003).
    We use this method of optimizing feature weights throughout this paper.
    Our baseline MT system is the alignment template system described in detail by Och, Tillmann, and Ney (1999) and Och and Ney (2004).
    In the following, we give a short description of this baseline model.
    The probability model of the alignment template system for translating a sentence can be thought o
