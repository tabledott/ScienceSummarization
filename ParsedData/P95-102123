    This is done by either using appropriate feature constraints at nodes or by means of subsertion-insertion constraints (see Section 2).
    We end this section by briefly commenting on the other DTG operation of sister-adjunction.
    In TAG, modification is performed with adjunction of modifier trees that have a highly constrained form.
    In particular, the foot nodes of these trees are always daughters of the root and either the leftmost or rightmost frontier nodes.
    The effect of adjoining a 21n these cases the foot node is an argument node of the lexical anchor.
    'This was also observed by Rambow (1994a), where an integrity constraint (first defined for an ID/LP version of TAG (Becker etal., 1991)) is defined for a MCTAG-DL version called V-TAG.
    However, this was found to be insufficient for treating both long-distance scrambling and long-distance topicalization in German.
    V-TAG retains adjoining (to handle topicalization) for this reason. tree of this form corresponds (almost) exactly
