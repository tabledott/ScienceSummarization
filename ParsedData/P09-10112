ons, etc.
    In this less restricted data setting, we must resolve multiple ambiguities: (1) the segmentation of the text into utterances; (2) the identification of relevant facts, i.e., the choice of records and aspects of those records; and (3) the alignment of utterances to facts (facts are the meaning representations of the utterances).
    Furthermore, in some of our examples, much of the world state is not referenced at all in the text, and, conversely, the text references things which are not represented in our world state.
    This increased amount of ambiguity and noise presents serious challenges for learning.
    To cope with these challenges, we propose a probabilistic generative model that treats text segmentation, fact identification, and alignment in a single unified framework.
    The parameters of this hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model can be estimated efficiently using EM.
    We tested our model on the task of aligning text to records in three different domains.
    The first domain is
