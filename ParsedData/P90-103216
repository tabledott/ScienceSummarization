ntence is equivalent to unifying a semantic structure (Logical Form) with the grammar.
    The grammar we use is divided into three zones, the &amp;quot;sentential,&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;lericai&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the syntactic zone.&amp;quot; Each zone contains constraints pertaining to a given domain and the input logical form is unified in turn with the three zones.
    As it is, full backtracking across the three zones is allowed.
    &#8226; The sentential zone contains the phrasal templates against which the logical form is unified first.
    A sentential entry is a whole sentence that should be used in a given context.
    This context is specified by subparts of the logical form given as input.
    When there is a match at this point, unification succeeds and generation is reduced to simple template filling.
    &#8226; The lexical zone contains the information used to lexicalize the input.
    It contains collocational information along with the semantic context in which to use it.
