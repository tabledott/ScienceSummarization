modification (by &amp;quot;josei-wo&amp;quot;) during the parsing process, which precludes the chunk &amp;quot;kono-honwo&amp;quot; from modifying &amp;quot;sagasiteiru&amp;quot; since there is a strict constraint about double-accusative modification that will be learned from training examples.
    We decided to take into consideration all such modification information by using functional words or inflection forms of modifiers.
    Using such information about modifiers in the training phase has no difficulty since they are clearly available in a tree-bank.
    On the other hand, they are not known in the parsing phase of the test data.
    This problem can be easily solved if we adopt a bottom-up parsing algorithm and attach the modification information dynamically to the newly constructed phrases (the chunks that become the head of the phrases).
    As we describe later we apply a beam search for parsing, and it is possible to keep several intermediate solutions while suppressing the combinatorial explosion
