ction 5 we present some results in which the possible expansions of a constituent are fixed in advanced by extracting a tree-bank grammar [3] from the training corpus.
    The method that gives the best results, however, uses a Markov grammar &#8212; a method for assigning probabilities to any possible expansion using statistics gathered from the training corpus [6,10,15].
    The method we use follows that of [10].
    In this scheme a traditional probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) rule can be thought of as consisting of a left-hand side with a label 1(c) drawn from the non-terminal symbols of our grammar, and a right-hand side that is a sequence of one or more such symbols.
    (We assume that all terminal symbols are generated by rules of the form &amp;quot;preterm word&amp;quot; and we treat these as a special case.)
    For us the non-terminal symbols are those of the tree-bank, augmented by the symbols aux and auxg, which have been assigned deterministically to certain auxiliary verbs such as &am
