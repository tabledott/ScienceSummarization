    Our experiments showed that the computation is dominated by the generation of Earley states during the prediction steps.
    It is therefore worthwhile to minimize the total number of predicted states generated by the parser.
    Since predicted states only affect the derivation if they lead to subsequent scanning, we can use the next input symbol to constrain the relevant predictions.
    To this end, we compute the extended left-corner relation Rif, indicating which terminals can appear as left corners of which nonterminals.
    Ru- is a Boolean 21 These figures are not very meaningful for their absolute values.
    All measurements were obtained on a Sun SPARCstation 2 with a CommonLisp/CLOS implementation of generic sparse matrices that was not particularly optimized for this task. matrix with rows indexed by nonterminals and columns indexed by terminals.
    It can be computed as the product where Pu has a nonzero entry at (X, a) iff there is a production for nonterminal X that starts with
