ents of the input to the rule.
    For instance, the leaf labeled x2 means that when this rule is applied, x2 is replaced by the target subtree rooted at V B (since V B is the second element of the input).
    Observe that the second rule induced in Figure 4 is simply a CFG rule expressed in the opposite direction, thus this rule format can (and should) be viewed as a strict generalization of CFG rules.
    Every derivation step can be mapped to a rule in this way.
    Hence given a source string S, a target tree T, and an alignment A, we can define the set PA(S, T) as the set of rules in any derivation D E 6A(S, T).
    We can regard this as the set of rules that we are entitled to infer from the triple (S, T, A).
    Now we have a precise problem statement: learn the set PA(S, T).
    It is not immediately clear how such a set can be learned from the triple (S, T, A).
    Fortunately, we can infer these rules directly from a structure called an alignment graph.
    In fact, we have already seen numerous exa
