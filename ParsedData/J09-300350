hich we compare to the higher word baseline.
    Table 12 lists the sets of features tested in these experiments.
    The feature sets generally correspond to how the neutral&#8211;polar features are presented in Table 7, although some of the groups are broken down into more fine-grained sets that we believe capture meaningful distinctions.
    Table 13 gives the results for these experiments.
    Increases and decreases for a given metric as compared to the word+priorpol baseline (word baseline for Ripper) are indicated by + or &#8211;, respectively.
    Where changes are significant at the p &lt; 0.1 level, ++ or &#8211; &#8211; are used, and where changes are significant at the p &lt; 0.05 level, +++ or &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; are used.
    An &#8220;nc&#8221; indicates no change (a change of less than &#177; 0.05) compared to the baseline.
    What does Table 13 reveal about the performance of various feature sets for neutral&#8211; polar classification?
    Most noticeable is that no individual feature s
