 Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) are used to implement the system.
    Using what is known as the ONE VS ALL classification strategy, n binary classifiers are trained, where n is number of semantic classes including a NULL class.
    The baseline feature set is a combination of features introduced by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and ones proposed in Pradhan et al., (2004), Surdeanu et al., (2003) and the syntactic-frame feature proposed in (Xue and Palmer, 2004).
    Table 1 lists the features used.
    As described in (Pradhan et al., 2004), we postprocess the n-best hypotheses using a trigram language model of the argument sequence.
    We analyze the performance on three tasks: Table 2 shows the performance of the system using the hand corrected, TreeBank parses (HAND) and using parses produced by a Charniak parser (AUTOMATIC).
    Precision (P), Recall (R) and F1 scores are given for the identification and combined tasks, and Classification Accuracy (A) for the classification task.
