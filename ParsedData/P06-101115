    We perform experiments in the context of Romanian to English machine translation.
    We use two initial parallel corpora.
    One is the training data for the Romanian-English word alignment task from the Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Corpora3 which has approximately 1M English words.
    The other contains additional data from the Romanian translations of the European Union&#8217;s acquis communautaire which we mined from the Web, and has about 10M English words.
    We downloaded comparable data from three online news sites: the BBC, and the Romanian newspapers &#8220;Evenimentul Zilei&#8221; and &#8220;Ziua&#8221;.
    The BBC corpus is precisely the kind of corpus that our method is designed to exploit.
    It is truly nonparallel; as our example from Figure 1 shows, even closely related documents have few or no parallel sentence pairs.
    Therefore, we expect that our extraction method should perform best on this corpus.
    The other two sources are fairly similar, both in genre and
