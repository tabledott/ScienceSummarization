om Table 6, our system achieved much higher precision than the baseline system for both Topic and Holder identification tasks.
    However, we admit that there is still a lot of room for improvement.
    The system achieved higher precision for topic identification, whereas it achieved higher recall for holder identification.
    In overall, our system attained higher F-score in holder identification task, including the baseline system.
    Based on Fscore, we believe that identifying topics of opinion is much more difficult than identifying holders.
    It was interesting to see the same phenomenon that the baseline system mainly assuming that subject and object of a sentence are likely to be opinion holder and topic, achieved lower scores for both holder and topic identification tasks in Testset 2 as in Testset 1.
    This implies that more sophisticated analysis of the relationship between opinion words (e.g. verbs and adjectives) and their topics and holders is crucial.
    We observed several difficultie
