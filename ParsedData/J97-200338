 the minimum outputs for any given string.
    Notice that several transitions might reach the same state with a priori different residual weights.
    Since one is only interested in the best path, namely the path corresponding to the minimum weight, one can keep the minimum of these weights for a given state element of a subset (line 11 of the algorithm of Figure 10).
    In the next section, we give a set of transducers TI for which the determinization algorithm terminates.
    The following theorem shows the correctness of the algorithm when it terminates.
    Transducer it2 obtained by power series determinization of Theorem 10 Assume that the determinization algorithm terminates, then the resulting transducer 72 is equivalent to r1.
    We denote by Oi(q,w, q') the minimum of the outputs of all paths from q to q'.
    By construction we have: We define the residual output associated to q in the subset 62(i2, w) as the weight c(q, w) associated to the pair containing q in 82 (i2, w).
    It is not hard t
