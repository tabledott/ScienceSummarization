or the Gloss Vector measure.
    We take the gloss of a given concept, and concatenate to it the glosses of all the concepts to which it is directly related according to WordNet.
    The Gloss Vector for that concept is then created from this big concatenated gloss.
  
  
    Below we briefly describe five alternative measures of semantic relatedness, and then go on to include them as points of comparison in our experimental evaluation of the Gloss Vector measure.
    All of these measures depend in some way upon WordNet.
    Four of them limit their measurements to nouns located in the WordNet is-a hierarchy.
    Each of these measures takes two WordNet concepts (i.e., word senses or synsets) c1 and c2 as input and return a numeric score that quantifies their degree of relatedness.
    (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998) finds the path length between c1 and c2 in the is-a hierarchy of WordNet.
    The path length is then scaled by the depth of the hierarchy (D) in which they reside to obtain the relatedness of the
