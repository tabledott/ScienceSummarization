ng sentences that may overlap very little at the string level.
			We measure the relative utility of the two derived monolingual corpora in the context of word alignment techniques developed originally for bilingual text.
			We show that although the edit distance corpus is well-suited as training data for the alignment algorithms currently used in SMT, it is an incomplete source of information about paraphrase relations, which exhibit many of the characteristics of comparable bilingual corpora or free translations.
			Many of the more complex alternations that characterize monolingual paraphrase, such as large-scale lexical alternations and constituent reorderings, are not readily learning sentence level paraphrases, including major constituent reorganizations, we do not address this approach here.
			2 Barzilay &amp; McKeown (2001) consider the possibility of using SMT machinery, but reject the idea because of the noisy, comparable nature of their dataset.
