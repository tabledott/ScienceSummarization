study on similarity metrics which focuses on text similarity rather than topic boundary detection.
    Second, the error metric favours texts with short topic segments.
    Segmentation errors within a segment which is smaller than k are not always detected correctly.
    Thus, an algorithm is assessed using texts with different ranges of segment length.
    Although the metric is not perfect, it is significantly more accurate than the popular precision/recall metric which ignores near misses.
    Furthermore, the method is sufficiently accurate for this comparative study.
    Five degenerate algorithms define the baseline for the experiments.
    Be partitions a document into e = 10 segments of equal length.
    Br, does not propose any boundaries.
    B,&#8222; assumes all potential boundaries are topic boundaries.
    Bb randomly selects b = 10 boundaries.
    B? randomly selects any number of boundaries as real boundaries.
    Details about Bb and B? are described in (Choi, 2000a).
