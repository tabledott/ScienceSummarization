 of a tile, with brackets omitted, yielding the total count for the tile (recall that the negative count is the difference between the total and positive counts).
    After the above procedure, each situated candidate is assigned a score.
    In order to select a bracketing for the input sentence, we assume that target instances are non-overlapping (this is usually the case for the types of patterns with which we experimented).
    We use a simple constraint propagation algorithm that finds the best choice of non-overlapping candidates in an input sentence: ber of patterns and average length in the training data.
  
  
    We have tested our algorithm in recognizing three syntactic patterns: noun phrase sequences (NP), verb-object (VO), and subject-verb (SV) relations.
    The NP patterns were delimited by 'P and ' ] ' symbols at the borders of the phrase.
    For VO patterns, we have put the starting delimiter before the main verb and the ending delimiter after the object head, thus covering the whole noun p
