hallenges that questioned our previous assumptions and suggested probabilistic models instead.

    We could no longer assume a limited vocabulary.
    Rather in the domain of terrorist incidents of the Third Message Understanding conference (MUC-3) (Sundheim 1991), roughly 20,000 vocabulary items appear in a corpus 430,000 words long.
    Additional text from that domain would undoubtedly contain new words.
    Probabilistic models offer a mathematically grounded, empirically based means of predicting the most likely interpretation.
    To see whether our four hypotheses (in italics above) effectively addressed the four concerns above, we chose to test the hypotheses on two well-known problems: ambiguity (both at the structural level and at the part-of-speech level) and inferring syntactic and semantic information about unknown words.
    Guided by the past success of probabilistic models in speech processing, we have integrated probabilistic models into our language processing systems.
