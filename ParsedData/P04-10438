the target syntactic structure.
    (PAF) We consider the predicate argument structures annotated in PropBank or FrameNet as our semantic space.
    The smallest sub-structure which includes one predicate with only one of its arguments defines our structural feature.
    For example, Figure 2 illustrates the parse-tree of the sentence &amp;quot;Paul delivers a talk in formal style&amp;quot;.
    The circled substructures in (a), (b) and (c) are our semantic objects associated with the three arguments of the verb to deliver, i.e.
    &lt;deliver, Arg0&gt;, &lt;deliver, Arg1 &gt; and &lt;deliver, ArgM&gt;.
    Note that each predicate/argument pair is associated with only one structure, i.e.
    Fp,a contain only one of the circled sub-trees.
    Other important properties are the followings: (1) The overall semantic feature space F contains sub-structures composed of syntactic information embodied by parse-tree dependencies and semantic information under the form of predicate/argument annotation.
