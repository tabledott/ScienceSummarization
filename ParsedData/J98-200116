tablishing relative clauses.)
    Many authors, including Hawkins himself, have attempted to go beyond the purely descriptive list just discussed.
    One group of authors have identified uniqueness as the defining property of definite descriptions.
    This idea goes back to Russell (1905), and is motivated by larger situation definite descriptions such as the pope and by some cases of unexplanatory modifier use such as the first person to sail to America.
    The hypothesis was developed in recent years to address the problem of uniqueness within small situations (Kadmon 1987; Neale 1990; Cooper 1993).7 Another line of research is based on the observation that many of the uses of definite descriptions listed by Hawkins have one property in common: the speaker (or writer) is making some assumptions about what the hearer (or reader) already knows.
    Speaking very loosely, we might say that the speaker assumes that the hearer is able to &amp;quot;identify&amp;quot; the referent of the definite description.
