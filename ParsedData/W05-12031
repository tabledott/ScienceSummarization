 has been also used for relevance feedback and text classification (Rocchio, 1971), word sense disambiguation (Lesk, 1986), and more recently for extractive summarization (Salton et al., 1997b), and methods for automatic evaluation of machine translation (Papineni et al., 2002) or text summarization (Lin and Hovy, 2003).
    The typical approach to finding the similarity between two text segments is to use a simple lexical matching method, and produce a similarity score based on the number of lexical units that occur in both input segments.
    Improvements to this simple method have considered stemming, stop-word removal, part-of-speech tagging, longest subsequence matching, as well as various weighting and normalization factors (Salton et al., 1997a).
    While successful to a certain degree, these lexical matching similarity methods fail to identify the semantic similarity of texts.
    For instance, there is an obvious similarity between the text segments I own a dog and I have an animal, but most of the
