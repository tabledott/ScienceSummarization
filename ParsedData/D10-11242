ography and topic interact, as &#8220;pure&#8221; topical lexical distributions are corrupted by geographical factors; for example, a sports-related topic will be rendered differently in New York and California.
    Each author is imbued with a latent &#8220;region&#8221; indicator, which both selects the regional variant of each topic, and generates the author&#8217;s observed geographical location.
    The regional corruption of topics is modeled through a cascade of logistic normal priors&#8212;a general modeling approach which we call cascading topic models.
    The resulting system has multiple capabilities, including: (i) analyzing lexical variation by both topic and geography; (ii) segmenting geographical space into coherent linguistic communities; (iii) predicting author location based on text alone.
    This research is only possible due to the rapid growth of social media.
    Our dataset is derived from the microblogging website Twitter,1 which permits users to post short messages to the public.
