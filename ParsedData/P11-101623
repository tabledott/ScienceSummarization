 and all extended targets with that using only the exact target.
    We also eliminate the extended targets generated by each of the three target extension methods and reevaluate the performances.
    As shown in Table 2, without extended targets, the accuracy is 65.6%, which is still higher than those using only target-independent features.
    After adding all extended targets, the accuracy is improved significantly to 68.2% (p &lt; 0.005), which suggests that target extension does help find indirectly expressed sentiments about the target.
    In addition, all of the three methods contribute to the overall improvement, with the head noun method contributing most.
    However, the other two methods do not contribute significantly.
    Similarly, we conduct several experiments on positive and negative tweets to compare the polarity classifiers with different features, where we use 268 negative and 268 randomly selected positive tweets.
    The results are listed below.
    From Table 3, we can see that the c
