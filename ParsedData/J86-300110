e components will abstract away from the details of the discourse participants.
    Whether one constructs a computer system that can participate in a discourse (i.e., one that is a language user) or defines a psychological theory of language use, the task will require the appropriate projection of this abstract model onto properties of a language user, and specification of additional details (e.g., specifying memory for linguistic structure, means for encoding attentional state, and appropriate representations of intentional structure).
    We do, however, address ourselves directly to certain processing issues that are essential to the computational validity of the [abstract] model and to its utilization for a language-processing system or psychological theory.
    Finally, it is important to note that although discourse meaning is a significant, unsolved problem, we will not address it in this paper.
    An adequate theory of discourse meaning needs to rest at least partially on an adequate theory of disco
