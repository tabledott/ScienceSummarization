    In all, we used 18 roles, a somewhat richer set than is often used, but still much more restricted than the frame-specific roles.
    Even with this enriched set, not all framespecific roles fit neatly into one category.
    An experiment was performed replacing each role tag in the training and test data with the corresponding thematic role and training the system as described above on the new dataset.
    Results were roughly comparable for the two types of semantic roles: overall performance was 82.1% for thematic roles, compared to 80.4% for framespecific roles.
    This reflects the fact that most frames had a one-to-one mapping from frame-specific to abstract roles, so the tasks were largely equivalent.
    We expect abstract roles to be most useful when one is generalizing to predicates and frames not found in the training data, the topic of the following sections.
    One interesting consequence of using abstract roles is that they allow us to compare more easily the system&#8217;s performa
