de still has a cost that exponentially grows with the number of &#8217;s daughters because we must sum up the probabilities of combinations of latent annotation symbols for a node with daughters.
    We thus took a kind of transformation/detransformation approach, in which a tree is binarized before parameter estimation and restored to its original form after parsing.
    The details of the binarization are explained in Section 4.
    Using syntactically annotated corpora as training data, we can estimate the parameters of a PCFGLA model using an EM algorithm.
    The algorithm is a special variant of the inside-outside algorithm of Pereira and Schabes (1992).
    Several recent work also use similar estimation algorithm as ours, i.e, inside-outside re-estimation on parse trees (Chiang and Bikel, 2002; Shen, 2004).
    The rest of this section precisely defines PCFGLA models and briefly explains the estimation algorithm.
    The derivation of the estimation algorithm is largely omitted; see Pereira and Schabe
