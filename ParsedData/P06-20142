    Recently, discriminative learning technology for structured output spaces has enabled several discriminative word alignment solutions (Liu et al., 2005; Moore, 2005; Taskar et al., 2005).
    Discriminative learning allows easy incorporation of any feature one might have access to during the alignment search.
    Because the features are handled so easily, discriminative methods use features that are not tied directly to the search: the search and the model become decoupled.
    In this work, we view synchronous parsing only as a vehicle to expose syntactic features to a discriminative model.
    This allows us to include the constraints that would usually be imposed by a tree-to-string alignment method as a feature in our model, creating a powerful soft constraint.
    We add our syntactic features to an already strong flat-string discriminative solution, and we show that they provide new information resulting in improved alignments.
