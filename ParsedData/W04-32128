 this same task is performed on the output of the argument identification task presented in Table 1.
    The same experiments are repeated using automatic parses produced by the Collins parser.
    The results are presented in Table 2.
    Row 1 presents results of all arguments when functional tags of the ArgMs are predicted, while Row 2 presents results of all arguments when functional tags are ignored.
    Finally Row 3 presents results when only the core arguments (numbered arguments) are calculated.
    Standard accuracy, CS (f) = Cold Standard fscore, CP = Collins Parser Feature performance Table 3 shows the performance of the new features.
    The baseline system uses the original features proposed in (Giidea and Palmer, 2002) and each row shows the improvement over the baseline when that feature is added to the baseline features.
    The results are on known (when constituents that are semantic arguments are given) and unknown (when constituents that are arguments have to be identified first before be
