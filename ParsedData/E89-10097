    The three remaining inference rules implement a non-local notion of inheritance: quoted descriptors specify values to be - 68 interpreted in the context in which the original query was made (the global context), rather than the current context.
    To see how the operation of these rules differs from the earlier unquoted cases, consider the following theory: The intention here is that the CAT node expresses the generalisation that by default plural is the same as singular, v and Al inherit this, but A2, while inheriting its plural form from Al, has an exceptional singular form, overriding inheritance from CAT (via Al).
    Now from this theory we can derive all the following theorems concerning plural: and the following theorem concerning singular: A2: &lt;sing&gt; = en.
    But we cannot derive a theorem for V:&lt;sing&gt;, for example.
    This is because v:&lt;sing&gt; inherits from cAT:&lt;sing&gt;, which inherits (locally) from cAT:&lt;plur&gt;, which is not defined.
    What we wanted was for cAT:&l
