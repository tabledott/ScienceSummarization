s at the word as well as phrasal levels, it can be used to build systems that can learn from these annotations and generate not only fully lexicalized phrasal paraphrases but also syntactically motivated paraphrastic patterns.
    To demonstrate the viability of the corpus for this purpose, a grammar induction algorithm (Cohn and Lapata 2007) is applied&#8212;originally developed for sentence compression&#8212;to the parsed version of their paraphrase corpus and the authors show that they can learn paraphrastic patterns such as those shown in Figure 9.
    In general, building paraphrase corpora, whether it is done at the sentence level or at the sub-sentential level, is extremely useful for the fostering of further research and development in the area of paraphrase generation.
