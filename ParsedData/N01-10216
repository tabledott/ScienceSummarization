om 1.0 gives the total probability of all the analyses the parser has disconfirmed.
    If the human parser is eager, then the &#8220;work&#8221; done during sentence processing is exactly this disconfirmation.
  
  
    The computation of prefix probabilities takes advantage of the design of the Earley parser (Earley, 1970) which by itself is not probabilistic.
    In this section I provide a brief overview of Stolcke&#8217;s algorithm but the original paper should be consulted for full details (Stolcke, 1995).
    Earley parsers work top-down, and propagate predictions confirmed by the input string back up through a set of states representing hypotheses the parser is entertaining about the structure of the sentence.
    The global state of the parser at any one time is completely defined by this collection of states, a chart, which defines a tree set.
    A state is a record that specifies An Earley parser has three main functions, predict, scan and complete, each of which can enter new states into the char
