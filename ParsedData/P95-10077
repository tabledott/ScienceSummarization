ght provide the oracle, and this idea is the basis of the three algorithms which use the adjacency model.
    The simplest of these is reported in Pustejovsky et al (1993).
    Given a three word compound, a search is conducted elsewhere in the corpus for each of the two possible subcomponents.
    Whichever is found is then chosen as the more closely bracketed pair.
    For example, when backup compiler disk is encountered, the analysis will be: The proposal of Liberman and Sproat (1992) is more sophisticated and allows for the frequency of the words in the compound.
    Their proposal involves comparing the mutual information between the two pairs of adjacent words and bracketing together whichever pair exhibits the highest.
    Again, there is no evaluation of the method other than a demonstration that four examples work correctly.
    The third proposal based on the adjacency model appears in Resnik (1993) and is rather more complex again.
    The SELECTIONAL ASSOCIATION between a predicate and a word is
