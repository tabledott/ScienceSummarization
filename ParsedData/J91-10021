have a correspondence to the structure of the text.
    Determining the structure of text is an essential step in determining the deep meaning of the text.
    In this paper, a thesaurus is used as the major knowledge base for computing lexical chains.
    Correspondences between lexical chains and structural elements are shown to exist.
    Since the lexical chains are computable, and exist in non&#8211;domain-specific text, they provide a valuable indicator of text structure.
    The lexical chains also provide a semantic context for interpreting words, concepts, and sentences.
  
  
    A text or discourse is not just a set of sentences, each on some random topic.
    Rather, the sentences and phrases of any sensible text will each tend to be about the same things &#8212; that is, the text will have a quality of unity.
    This is the property of cohesion &#8212; the sentences &amp;quot;stick together&amp;quot; to function as a whole.
    Cohesion is achieved through back-reference, conjunction, and semant
