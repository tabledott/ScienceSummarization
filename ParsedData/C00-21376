at one usually does not have Sd, but only st and s2, where Sl is the estimate for XlS standard deviation and similarly for s2.
  Ilow does one get the former fiom the latter?
  It turns out that (Box et al., 1978, Ch.
  3) o -2 o-12 + a~ d = --  2p12a10-2 where cri is the true standard eviation (instead of the estimate si) and pl2 is the correlation coefficient between xl and :c2.
  Analogously, it turns out that 2 z S d 82 -t- 82 - -  2 r128182 (2) where r12 is an estimate for P12.
  So not only does cr d (and Sd) depend on the properties of xl and x2 in isolation, it also depends on how Xl and .~2 interact, as measured by P12 (and rr)).
  When Xl and x2 are independent, p12 = 0, and then (Td = ~-+ c7~ and analogously, Sd = ~ + s~.
  When P~2 is positive, ;1; 1 and x2 are positively correlated: a rise in xl or x2 tends to be accompanied by a rise in the other result.
  When P12 is negative, :cl and x2 are negatively correlated: a rise in :cl or x9 tends to be accompmfied by a decline in the other result.
