as that described in the previous section.
    Our goal is to automate, to the extent possible, the initial construction of these structures.
    Extensive research has been done on the kind of information needed by natural language programs and on the representation of that information (Wang, Vandendorpe, and Evens 1985; Ahlswede and Evens 1988).
    Following Boguraev et al. (1989) and Wilks et al. of 1989), we believe that much of what is needed for NLP lexicons can be found either explicitly or implicitly in a dictionary, and empirical evidence suggests that this information gives rise to a sufficiently rich lexical representation for use in extracting information from texts.
    Techniques for identifying explicit information in machine-readable dictionaries have been developed by many researchers (Boguraev et al. 1989; Slator 1988; Slator and Wilks 1987; Guthrie et al.
    1990) and are well understood.
    Many properties of a word sense or the semantic relationships between word senses are available i
