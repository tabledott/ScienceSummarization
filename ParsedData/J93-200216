ility of verbs to appear in particular syntactic frames on the basis of noisy data like that of Table 4.
    Given the data in Table 4, that method yields the judgments in Table 5.
  
  
    As noted above, the correspondence between syntactic structure and the cues that Lerner uses is not perfect.
    Mismatches between cue and structure are problematic because naturally occurring language provides no negative evidence.
    If a V verb is followed by a cue for some syntactic frame S, that provides evidence that V does occur in frame S. but there is no analogous source of evidence that V does not occur in frame S. The occurrence of mismatches between cue and structure can be thought of as a random process where each occurrence of a verb V has some non-zero probability of being followed by a cue for a frame S, even if V cannot in fact occur in S. If this model is accurate, the more times V occurs, the more likely it is to occur at least once with a cue for S. The intransitive verb arrive, for example, will eve
