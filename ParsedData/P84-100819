 al. propose, which nevertheless preserves the traditional view of markedness.
    The desired result can be obtained by using negative con
  
  
    let + 3rd - - conversant:
  
  
    Note that the proper part of lst+2nd excludes 3rd person.
    It is compatible with both 1st and 2nd person but the negative constraint rules out the latter one.
    In tile case of lst+3rd, the negative constraint is compatible with 1st person but incompatible with 2nd and 3rd.
    In the last case, the specification [speaker: -] rules out 1st person and the negative constraint -[conversant: -1 eliminates 3rd person.
    When negative constraints are counted in, 1st person is the most and 3rd person the least marked member of the three.
    In that respect, the proposed analysis is in line with traditional views on markedness.
    Another relevant observation is that the negative constraints on which the result crucially depends are themselves not too unnatural.
    In effect, they say of 1st person that it is &amp;quot;neith
