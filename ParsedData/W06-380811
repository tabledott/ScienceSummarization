 angle between the vectors (PSPZ,1&#8722;PSPZ) and (PSPj, 1&#8722; PSPj).
    Positive sentences are identified using a binary classifier trained on a separate &#8220;snippet data set&#8221; located at the same URL as above.
    The snippet data set contains 10662 short quotations taken from movie reviews appearing on the rottentomatoes.com Web site.
    Each snippet is labeled positive or negative based on the rating of the originating review.
    Pang and Lee (2005) trained a Naive Bayes classifier.
    They showed that PSP is a (noisy) measure for comparing reviews&#8212;reviews with low ratings tend to receive low PSP scores, and those with higher ratings tend to get high PSP scores.
    Thus, two reviews with a high PSP-based similarity are expected to have similar ratings.
    For our experiments we derived PSP measurements in a similar manner, but using a linear SVM classifier.
    We observed the same relationship between PSP and ratings (Figure 2).
    The metric labeling method has parameters (the e
