es that are consistent with the alignment is constituted by all bilingual phrase pairs in which all words within the source language phrase are aligned only with the words of the target language phrase and the words of the target language phrase are aligned only with the words of the source language phrase.
    Note that we require that at least one word in the source language phrase be aligned with at least one word of the target language phrase.

    Figure 3 gives the algorithm phrase-extract that computes the phrases.
    The algorithm takes into account possibly unaligned words at the boundarie
