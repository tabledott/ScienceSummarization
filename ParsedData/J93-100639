t seen as related to one another.
    This might not be seen as a disadvantage in all circumstances.
    For example, nouns and verbs in one text might be expected to map onto nouns with the same number and verbs with the same tense much of the time.
    But this is not always the case and, more importantly, some languages make morphological distinctions that are absent in the other.
    German, for example, makes a number of case distinctions, especially in adjectives, that are not reflected in the morphology of English.
    For these reasons, it seems desirable to allow words to contract associations with other words both in the form in which they actually occur, and in a more normalized form that will throw them together with morphologically related other words in the text.
    The strategy we adopted was to make entries in the WSI, not only for maximal strings of alphabetic characters occurring in the texts, but also for other strings that could usefully be regarded as normalized forms of these.
