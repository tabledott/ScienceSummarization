algorithms have been proposed for deriving attributional similarity from WordNet (Resnik 1995; Jiang and Conrath 1997; Budanitsky and Hirst 2001; Banerjee and Pedersen 2003).
    We use Rohde&#8217;s SVDLIBC implementation of the SVD, which is based on SVDPACKC (Berry 1992).6 In LRA, SVD is used to reduce noise and compensate for sparseness.
    We will go through each step of LRA, using an example to illustrate the steps.
    Assume that the input to LRA is the 374 multiple-choice SAT word analogy questions of Turney and Littman (2005).
    Since there are six word pairs per question (the stem and five choices), the input consists of 2,244 word pairs.
    Let&#8217;s suppose that we wish to calculate the relational similarity between the pair quart:volume and the pair mile:distance, taken from the SAT question in Table 6.
    The LRA algorithm consists of the following 12 steps: alternates as follows.
    For each alternate pair, send a query to the WMTS, to find the frequency of phrases that begin with one
