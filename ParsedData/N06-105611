anings.
    For example, in CLANG, parentheses and braces are delimiters that are semantically vacuous.
    Such tokens are not supposed to be aligned with any words, and inclusion of these tokens in the training data is likely to confuse the word alignment model.
    Second, MR tokens may exhibit polysemy.
    For instance, the CLANG predicate pt has three meanings based on the types of arguments it is given: it specifies the xy-coordinates (e.g.
    (pt 0 0)), the current position of the ball (i.e.
    (pt ball)), or the current position of a player (e.g.
    (pt our 4)).
    Judging from the pt token alone, the word alignment model would not be able to identify its exact meaning.
    A simple, principled way to avoid these difficulties is to represent an MR using a sequence of productions used to generate it.
    Specifically, the sequence corresponds to the top-down, left-most derivation of an MR.
    Figure 4 shows a partial word alignment between the sample sentence and the linearized parse of its MR.
