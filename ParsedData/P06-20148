tree must exist for which the alignment maintains phrasal cohesion.
    Figure 2 shows a word alignment and the corresponding tree found by an ITG parser.
    Wu (1997) provides anecdotal evidence that only incorrect alignments are eliminated by ITG constraints.
    In our French-English data set, an ITG rules out only 0.3% of necessary links beyond those already eliminated by the one-to-one constraint (Cherry and Lin, 2006).
    An ITG will search all alignments that conform to a possible binary constituency tree.
    We wish to confine that search to a specific n-array dependency tree.
    Fortunately, Wu (1997) provides a method to have an ITG respect a known partial structure.
    One can seed the ITG parse chart so that spans that do not agree with the provided structure are assigned a value of &#8212;oc before parsing begins.
    The result is that no constituent is ever constructed with any of these invalid spans.
    In the case of phrasal cohesion, the invalid spans correspond to spans of the English
