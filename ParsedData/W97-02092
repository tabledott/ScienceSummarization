has a comparatively high error rate (Miller, personal communication, reports an upper bound for human annotators of around 90% for ambiguous cases, using a non-blind evaluation method that may make even this estimate overly optimistic); and (c) no fully automatic method provides high enough quality output to support the &amp;quot;annotate automatically, correct manually&amp;quot; methodology used to provide high volume annotation by data providers like the Penn 'Treebank project (Marcus et al., 1993).
  
  
    The treatment of selectional preference used here is that proposed by Resnik (1993a; 1996), combining statistical and knowledge-based methods.
    The basis of the approach is a probabilistic model capturing the co-occurrence behavior of predicates and conceptual classes in the taxonomy.
    The intuition is illustrated in Figure 1.
    The prior distribution PrR(c) captures the probability of a class occurring as the argument in predicate-argument relation R, regardless of the identity of the predicat
