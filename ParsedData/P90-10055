of sentence (1) as shown in Figure 3 if we interpret the governor rote of a word as a pointer to the syntactic governor of the word.
    Thus, the syntactic structure produced by a CDG is usually a dependency structure (flays 1964) rather than a phtyrse structure.
  
  
    CDG parsing is done by assigning values to n x k roles, whose values are selected from a finite set L x {1,2, ... , nil}_ Therefore, CDG parsing can be viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem over a finite domain.
    Many interesting artificial intelligence problems, including graph coloring and scene labeling, are classified in this group of problems, and much effort has been spent on the development of efficient techniques to solve these problems.
    Constraint propagation (Waltz 1975, Montanan i 1976), sometimes called filtering, is one such technique.
    One advantage of the filtering algorithm is that it allows new constraints to be added easily so that a better solution can be obtained when many candidates remain.
    Usually,
