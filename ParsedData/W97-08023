any large-scale monolingual resources are publically available which can aid the building of a semantic net.
    The particular resource situation for German makes it necessary to rely to a large extent on manual labour for the creation process of a wordnet, based on monolingual general and specialist dictionaries and literature, as well as comparisons with the English WordNet.
    However, we take a strongly corpus-based approach by determining the base vocabulary modeled in GermaNet by lemmatized frequency lists from text corporal.
    This list is further tuned by using other available sources such as the CELEX German database.
    Clustering methods, which in principle can apply to large corpora without requiring any further information in order to give similar words as output, proved to be interesting but not helpful for the construction of the core net.
    Selectional restrictions of verbs for nouns will, however, be automatically extracted by clustering methods.
    We use the Princeton WordNet techno
