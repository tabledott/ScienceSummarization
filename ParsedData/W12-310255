 0.65 down to a DeltaAvg of 0.15 (with Spearman values varying from 0.64 down to 0.19).
    In addition to the performance of the official submission, we report here results obtained by various oracle methods.
    The oracle methods make use of various metrics that are associated in a oracle manner to the test input: the gold-label Effort metric for &#8220;Oracle Effort&#8221;, the HTER metric computed against the post-edited translations as reference for &#8220;Oracle HTER&#8221;, and the BLEU metric computed against the same post-edited translations as reference for &#8220;Oracle (H)BLEU&#8221;.11 The &#8220;Oracle Effort&#8221; DeltaAvg score of 0.95 gives an upperbound in terms of DeltaAvg for the test set used in this evaluation.
    It basically indicates that, for this set, 11We use the (H)BLEU notation to underscore the use of Post-Edited translations as reference, as opposed to using references that are not the product of a Post-Editing process, as for the traditional BLEU metric. the difference in P
