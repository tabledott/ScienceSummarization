if we add the IDF into the weighting factor, we get the following measure Si: where wic = TFic x IDF, wie = TFie x IDFi In addition, the Dice and Jaccard coefficients are also suitable similarity measures for document comparison (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992).
    We also implement the Dice coefficient into similarity measure S2: where wic = TFie x IDFi Si is often used in comparing a short query with a document text, whereas S2 is used in comparing two document texts.
    Reasoning that our objective falls somewhere in between&#8212;we are comparing segments of a document, we also multiply the above two measures into a third similarity measure S3.
  
  
    In using bilingual seed words such asN,Et /virus as &amp;quot;bridges&amp;quot; for terminology translation, the quality of the bilingual seed lexicon naturally affects the system output.
    In the case of European language pairs such as French-English, we can envision using words sharing common cognates as these &amp;quot;bridges&amp;quot;.
