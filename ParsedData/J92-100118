that context is active.
    This distinction is a product of experience; it is conceivable that a formerly dynamic sense may become static, as when military terms creep into everyday language.
    The partitioning of the lexicon into static and dynamic components reduces the number of senses the system must consider in situations where the context does not trigger some dynamic sense.
    Although the idea of using dynamic lexicons is not new (see Schank and Abelson [19771, for example), our approach is much more flexible than previous ones because TRUMP's lexicon does not link all senses to a domain.
    As a result, the lexical retrieval mechanism never forces the system to use a sense just because the domain has preselected it.
    3.1.1 The Core Lexicon.
    The core lexicon, by design, includes only coarse distinctions between word senses.
    This means that, for a task such as generating databases from text, task-specific processing or inference must augment the core lexical knowledge, but problems of c
