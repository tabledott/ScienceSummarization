ror rate for the NP cues is substantially lower than 1 out of 100, then it cannot be estimated accurately with sample size N = 100.
    On the other hand, if the sample size N is increased substantially there may not be enough verbs that occur N times or more in the corpus.
    So a larger corpus might improve the recall rate for NP.
  
  
    This paper explores the possibility of using simple grammatical regularities to learn lexical syntax.
    The data presented in Tables 6, 7, and 8 provide evidence that it is possible to learn significant aspects of English lexical syntax in this way.
    Specifically, these data suggest that neither a large parser nor a large lexicon is needed to recover enough syntactic structure for learning lexical syntax.
    Rather, it seems that significant lexical syntactic information can be recovered using a few approximate cues along with statistical inference based on a simple model of the cues' error distributions.
    The lexical entry of a verb can specify other syntactic
