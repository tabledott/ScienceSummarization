 be aesthetic or explanatory differences between the two formal systems, empirical coverage by itself cannot be used to choose between them.
    Inspired in part by our early report of the material presented in this paper (Kaplan and Kay 1981), Koskenniemi (1983) proposed an alternative system for recognizing and producing morphological and phonological word-form variants.
    Under his proposal, individual generalizations are expressed directly in the state-transition diagrams of finite-state transducers, and their mutual interactions emerge from the fact that every input-output string pair must be accepted simultaneously by all these transducers.
    Thus, he replaced the serial feeding arrangement of the independent generalizations in a rewriting grammar with a parallel method of combination.
    In eliminating the intermediate strings that pass from one rewriting rule to another, he also reduced to just two the number of linguistically meaningful levels of representation.
    In two-level parlance, these
