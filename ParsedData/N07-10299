m to one; i.e., there are three free parameters.
    These weights can balance the total confidence between the number of systems generating the hypothesis (votes), and the sum, maximum and average of the system confidences.
    The second feature in the GLM is the sentence posterior estimated from the -best list.
    A sentence posterior may simply be estimated from an -best list by scaling the system scores for all hypotheses to sum to one.
    When combining several systems based on different translation paradigms and feature sets, the system scores may not be comparable.
    The total scores may be scaled to obtain more consistent sentence posteriors.
    The scaled posterior estimated from an -best list may be written as where is the scaling factor for system and is the log-score system assigns to hypothesis .
    The scaling factors may be tuned to optimize the evaluation metric in the same fashion as the logit model weights in Section 3.1.
    Equation 4 may be used to assign total posteriors for each
