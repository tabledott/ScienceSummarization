a clearer and more direct fashion without a compromise in performance.
    We present a detailed case study of this learning method applied to part-of-speech tagging.
  
  
    It has recently become clear that automatically extracting linguistic information from a sample text corpus can be an extremely powerful method of overcoming the linguistic knowledge acquisition bottleneck inhibiting the creation of robust and accurate natural language processing systems.
    A number of part-of-speech taggers are readily available and widely used, all trained and retrainable on text corpora (Church 1988; Cutting et al. 1992; Brill 1992; Weischedel et al.
    1993).
    Endemic structural ambiguity, which can lead to such difficulties as trying to cope with the many thousands of possible parses that a grammar can assign to a sentence, can be greatly reduced by adding empirically derived probabilities to grammar rules (Fujisaki et al. 1989; Sharman, Jelinek, and Mercer 1990; Black et al.
    1993) and by computing stati
