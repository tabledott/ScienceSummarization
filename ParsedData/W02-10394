another.
    If two spans do overlap, we call this a crossing.
    Figure 1 shows an example of an English parse along with the alignment between the English and French words (shown with dotted lines).
    The English word &#8220;not&#8221; is aligned to the two French words &#8220;ne&#8221; and &#8220;pas&#8221; and thus has a span of [1,3].
    The main English verb &#8220;change&#8221; is aligned to the French &#8220;modifie&#8221; and has a span of [2,2].
    The two spans overlap and thus there is a crossing.
    This definition is asymmetric (i.e. what is a crossing when moving from English to French is not guaranteed to be a crossing when moving from French to English).
    However, we only pursue translation direction since that is the one for which we have parsed data.
  
  
    To calculate spans, we need aligned pairs of English and French sentences along with parses for the English sentences.
    Our aligned data comes from a corpus described in (Och and Ney, 2000) which contains 500 sentence pair
