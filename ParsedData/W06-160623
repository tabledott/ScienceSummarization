006).
    If we analyze these three models in terms of expressive power, the Galley et al. (2006) model is more expressive than the SPMT models, which in turn, are more expressive than Chiang&#8217;s model.
    The xRS formalism utilized by Galley et al. (2006) allows for the use of translation rules that have multi-level target tree annotations and discontinuous source language phrases.
    The SPMT models are less general: they use translation rules that have multi-level target tree annotations but require that the source language phrases are continuous.
    The Syncronous Grammar formalism utilized by Chiang is stricter than SPMT since it allows only for single-level target tree annotations.
    The parameters of the SPMT models presented in this paper are easier to estimate than those of Galley et al&#8217;s (2006) and can easily exploit and expand on previous research in phrase-based machine translation.
    Also, the SPMT models yield significantly fewer rules that the model of Galley et al. In contrast
