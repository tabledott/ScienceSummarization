count for the guide features over the MaltParser output.
    The specific features used by MSTMalt are given in table 1.
    All features are conjoined with the part-of-speech tags of the words involved in the dependency to allow the guided parser to learn weights relative to different surface syntactic environments.
    Though MSTParser is capable of defining features over pairs of arcs, we restrict the guide features over single arcs as this resulted in higher accuracies during preliminary experiments.
    The transition-based model, MaltParser, learns a scoring function s(c, t) E R over configurations and transitions.
    The set of training instances for this learning problem is the set of pairs (c, t) such that t is the correct transition out of c in the transition sequence that derives the correct dependency graph Gx for some sentence x in the training set T. Each training instance (c, t) is represented by a feature vector f(c, t) E Rk, where features are defined in terms of arbitrary properties of the
