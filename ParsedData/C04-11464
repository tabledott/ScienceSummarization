 measures that have been proposed for use in NLP.
			In Section 3, we analyse the variation in neighbour sets returned by these measures.
			In Section 4, we take one fundamental statisticalproperty (word frequency) and analyse correla tion between this and the nearest neighbour setsgenerated.
			In Section 5, we relate relative fre quency to a concept of distributional generalityand the semantic relation of hyponymy.
			In Sec tion 6, we consider the effects that this has on a potential application of distributional similarity techniques, which is judging compositionality of collocations.
	
	
			In this section, we introduce some basic con cepts and then discuss the ten distributional similarity measures used in this study.
			The co-occurrence types of a target word are the contexts, c, in which it occurs and these have associated frequencies which may be used to form probability estimates.
			In our work, theco-occurrence types are always grammatical de pendency relations.
			For example, in Sections 3 to
