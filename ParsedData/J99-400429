other.
    By hypothesis, for a given input, there are grammar derivations E1 Ek (for 0 &lt; k &lt; oo) and corresponding item derivation trees D1 .
    .
    .
    Dk of the goal item.
    Since corresponding items are iso-valued, for all i, V(E) = V(DO.
    (If the semiring is commutative, then since the items are commutatively iso-valued, it is still the case that for all i, V(E1) = V (D,).)
    Now, since the value of the string according to the grammar is just @, V(E) = ED, V(D), and the value of the goal item is el, V (D,), the value of the string according to the grammar equals the value of the goal item.
    0 There is one additional condition for an item-based description to be usable in practice, which is that there be only a finite number of derivable items for a given input sentence; there may, however, be an infinite number of derivations of any item.
    All of the semirings we use should be familiar, except for the derivation semirings, which we now describe.
    These semirings, unlike the oth
