 of 16 tags was used to tag 8 name classes (the seven MUC classes plus the additional null class).
    Two tags were required per class to account for adjacent elements of the same type.
    For example, the string Betty Mary and Bobby Lou would be tagged as PERSON-START PERSON-START NULL-START PERSON-START PERSON-CONTINUE.
    Our model uses a total of 19 classes of features.
    The first seven of these correspond closely to features used in a typical HMM name tagger.
    The remaining twelve encode cluster membership.
    Clusters of various granularity are specified by prefixes of the bit strings.
    Short prefixes specify short paths from the root node and therefore large clusters.
    Long prefixes specify long paths and small clusters.
    We used 4 different prefix lengths: 8 bit, 12 bit, 16 bit, and 20 bit.
    Thus, the clusters decrease in size by about a factor of 16 at each level.
    The complete set of features is given in Table 2.
