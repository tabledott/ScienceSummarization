e investigate how far we can get by focusing our attention only on discourse markers and lexicogrammatical constructs that can be detected by a shallow analysis of natural language texts.
    The intuition behind our choice relies on the following facts: the discourse segments that they relate.
    In other words, we assume that the texts that we process are well-formed from a discourse perspective, much as researchers in sentence parsing assume that they are well-formed from a syntactic perspective.
    As a consequence, we assume that one can bootstrap the full syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic analysis of the clauses that make up a text and still end up with a reliable discourse structure for that text.
    Given the above discussion, the immediate objection that one can raise is that discourse markers are doubly ambiguous: in some cases, their use is only sentential, i.e., they make a semantic contribution to the interpretation of a clause; and even in the cases where markers have a discourse usage, they
