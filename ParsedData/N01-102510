ri(Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995) and Allwein(Allwein et al., 2000) introduce a unifying framework for solving the multiclass problem we want to keep consistency with Inside/Start (B/I/O) representation. by reducing them into binary models.
    However, we employ the simple pairwise classifiers because of the following reasons: (1) In general, SVMs require training cost (where is the size of training data).
    Thus, if the size of training data for individual binary classifiers is small, we can significantly reduce the training cost.
    Although pairwise classifiers tend to build a larger number of binary classifiers, the training cost required for pairwise method is much more tractable compared to the one vs. all others.
    (2) Some experiments (Kre&#223;el, 1999) report that a combination of pairwise classifiers performs better than the one vs. all others.
    For the feature sets for actual training and classification of SVMs, we use all the information available in the surrounding context, such as the wo
