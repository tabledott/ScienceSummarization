forms pruning, which in principle limits the possible translations that can be produced given a certain input sentence.
    To solve this problem, we define for maximum entropy training each sentence as reference translation that has the minimal number of word errors with respect to any of the reference translations.
  
  
    We present results on the VERBMOBIL task, which is a speech translation task in the domain of appointment scheduling, travel planning, and hotel reservation (Wahlster, 1993).
    Table 1 shows the corpus statistics of this task.
    We use a training corpus, which is used to train the alignment template model and the language models, a development corpus, which is used to estimate the model scaling factors, and a test corpus.
    So far, in machine translation research does not exist one generally accepted criterion for the evaluation of the experimental results.
    Therefore, we use a large variety of different criteria and show that the obtained results improve on most or all of thes
