(syntax-directed) transduction grammars with rank r, versus ITGs on a pair of subconstituent sequences of length r each.
  
  
    In a stochastic ITG (SITG), a probability is associated with each rewrite rule.
    Following the standard convention, we use a and b to denote probabilities for syntactic and lexical rules, respectively.
    For example, the probability of the rule NN [A N] is aNN&#8212;[A = 0.4.
    The probability of a lexical rule A ox/y is bA(x,y) = 0.001.
    Let W1, W2 be the vocabulary sizes of the two languages, and Al = {A1, ,AN} be the set of nonterminals with indices 1,. .
    .
    , N. (For conciseness, we sometimes abuse the notation by writing an index when we mean the corresponding nonterminal symbol, as long as this introduces no confusion.)
    Then for every 1 &lt; i &lt; N, the production probabilities are subject to the constraint that We now introduce an algorithm for parsing with stochastic ITGs that computes an optimal parse given a sentence-pair using dynamic programming.
