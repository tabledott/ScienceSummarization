tructure that it. is compatible with, such as: If this happens, then the tuple (A C) is no longer consistent.
    A side effect of A becoming A' = render: tem] number: sg case: nom is that C' simultaniously reduces to {(B C)).
    Since there is now only one viable alternative left, B and C can at this point be unified.
    The original result from (Unify {A Ill C) now reduces to the same as (Unify B C).
    C&amp;quot; = {(B C)} = [number: Lease: aco As the example shows, once C is unified with (A B), A and B acquire a &amp;quot;positive constraint.&amp;quot; All later unifications involving them must keep at least one of the two pairs (A C), (B C) unifieable.
    If at some later point one of the two tuples becomes inconsistent, the members of the sole remaining tuple finally can and should be unified.
    When that has happened, the positive constraint on A and B can also be discarded.
    A more elaborate example of this sort is given in the Appendix.
    Essentially the same procedure also works for more
