, nominal subjects, such as relationships, and like relationships.
			We sum up the mutual information scores for each term that occurs in these rela tionships with a committee of a class.
			The highest scoring term is the name of the class.
			The syntactical co-occurrence approach has worst-case time complexity O(n2k), where n is the number of words in the corpus and k is the feature space (Pantel and Ravichandran 2004).
			Just to parse a 1 TB corpus, this approach requires ap proximately 10.2 years (see Table 2).
	
	
			We propose an algorithm for learning highly scalable lexico-POS patterns.
			Given two sentences with their surface form and part of speech tags, the algorithm finds the optimal lexico-POS alignment.
			For example, consider the following 2 sentences: 1) Platinum is a precious metal.
			2) Molybdenum is a metal.
			Applying a POS tagger (Brill 1995) gives the following output: Surface Platinum is a precious metal . POS NNP VBZ DT JJ NN . Surface Molybdenum is a metal . POS NNP VBZ DT NN .
