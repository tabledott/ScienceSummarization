			Our method for Base NP translation comprises of two steps: translation candidate collection and translation selection.
			In translation candidate collection, we look for translation candidates of a given Base NP.
			In translation selection, we find out possible translation(s) from the translation candidates.
			In this paper, we confine ourselves to translation of noun-noun pairs from English to Chinese; our method, however, can be extended to translations of other types of Base NPs between other language pairs.
			3.1 Translation Candidate Collection.
			We use heuristics for translation candidate collection.
			Figure 1 illustrates the process of collecting Chinese translation candidates for an English Base NP ?information age?
			with the heuristics.
