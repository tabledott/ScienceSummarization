nd WER.
    The problem of how to avoid a preference of overly long candidate sentences by CDER remains unsolved, as can be found in Table 4: Each of the proposed penalties infers a significant decrease of correlation between the (extended) CDER and human evaluation.
    Future research will aim at finding a suitable length penalty.
    Especially if CDER is applied in system development, such a penalty will be needed, as preliminary optimization experiments have shown.
    WER: the correlation with human judgment is increased by about 2% absolute on both language pairs.
    The Levenshtein-based substitution costs are better suited for WER than the scheme based on common prefix length.
    For CDER, there is hardly any difference between the two methods.
    Experiments on five more corpora did not give any significant evidence which of the two substitution costs correlates better with human evaluation.
    But as the prefix-based substitution costs improved correlation more consistently across all corpora,
