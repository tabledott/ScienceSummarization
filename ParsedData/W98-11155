, only completed edges, i.e., constituents, are entered into the agenda; incomplete edges are always processed as soon as they are constructed.
    At each iteration the constituent with the highest figure of merit is removed from the agenda, added to the chart, and used to extend current partially completed constituents.
    Thus we characterize their work as constituent-based best-first chart parsing.
    C&amp;C take as an &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; FOM the quantity to,,).
    Here NJ, is a constituent of type i (e.g., NP, VP, etc.) that spans the constituents from j up to but not including k, and tom are the n parts-of-speech (tags) of the sentence.
    Note that C&amp;C simplify parsing by assuming that the input is a sequence of tags, not words.
    We make the same assumption in this paper.
    Thus taking p(N;rk I to,,) as an FOM says that one should work on the constituent that is most likely to be correct .given the tags of the sentence.
    As p(N;,k to,n) can only be computed precisely after a full
