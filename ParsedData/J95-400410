ions in turn and score the resulting annotated corpus.'
    In this example, applying transformation T2 results in the largest reduction of errors, so 12 is learned as the first transformation.
    T2 is then applied to the entire corpus, and learning continues.
    At this stage of learning, transformation 13 results in the largest reduction of error, so it is learned as the second transformation.
    After applying the initial-state annotator, followed by T2 and then T3, no further reduction in errors can be obtained from applying any of the transformations, so learning stops.
    To annotate fresh text, this text is first annotated by the initial-state annotator, followed by the application of transformation T2 and then by the application of T3.
    To define a specific application of transformation-based learning, one must specify the following: In cases where the application of a particular transformation in one environment could affect its application in another environment, two additional parameters mu
