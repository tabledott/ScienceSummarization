			The synchronous TAG formalism is inherently nondirec- tional.
			Derivation is not defined in terms of constructing 6The subscript x on certain nodes is the value of a feature on the nodes corresponding to the variable bound by the quantifier.
			The technique of using metavariables to encode object variables is familiar from the logic and unification-based grammar literatures, Variable renaming with respect o these variables proceeds as usual.
