entence length.
    We assume that the number of ambiguities in a sentence will increase linearly with sentence length; if a five word sentence has on average one ambiguity, then a ten word sentence will have two, etc.
    A linear increase in ambiguity will lead to an exponential decrease in probability of the most probable parse.
    Since the probability of the most probable parse decreases exponentially in sentence length, the number of random samples needed to find this most probable parse increases exponentially in sentence length.
    Thus, when using the Monte Carlo algorithm, one is left with the uncomfortable choice of exponentially decreasing the probability of finding the most probable parse, or exponentially increasing the runtime.
    We admit that this is a somewhat informal argument.
    Still, the Monte Carlo algorithm has never been tested on sentences longer than those in the ATIS corpus; there is good reason to believe the algorithm will not work as well on longer sentences.
