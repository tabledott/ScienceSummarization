 samples of sentences have been chosen and the distribution of the F0=1 rates in these samples is assumed to be the distribution of the performance of the system.
    We assume that performance A is significantly different from performance B if A is not within the center 90% of the distribution of B.
    The performances of the sixteen systems on the two test data sets can be found in Table 5.
    For English, the combined classifier of Florian et al. (2003) achieved the highest overall F0=1 rate.
    However, the difference between their performance and that of the Maximum Entropy approach of Chieu and Ng (2003) is not significant.
    An important feature of the best system that other participants did not use, was the inclusion of the output of two externally trained named entity recognizers in the combination process.
    Florian et al. (2003) have also obtained the highest F0=1 rate for the German data.
    Here there is no significant difference between them and the systems of Klein et al. (2003) and Zha
