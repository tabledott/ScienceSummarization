ers&#8212;is crucial for referent selection.
    By incorporating functional considerations in terms of the information structure of utterances into the centering model we actually enrich the types of knowledge that go into centered anaphora resolution decisions, i.e., we extend the &amp;quot;dimensionality&amp;quot; of the centering model, too.
    But unlike the numerical scoring approaches, our combination remains at the symbolic computation level, preserves the modularity of criteria, and, in particular, is linguistically justified.
    Although functional centering is not a complete theory of preferential anaphora resolution, one should clearly stress the different goals behind heuristics-based systems, such as the ones just discussed, and the model of centering.
    Heuristic approaches combine introspectively acquired descriptive evidence and attempt to optimize reference resolution performance by proper evidence &amp;quot;engineering&amp;quot;.
    This is often done in an admittedly ad hoc way, requi
