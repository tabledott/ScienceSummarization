nd their weights, score(yd, ysi&#65533;1, ysi , s) = w &#183; f(yd, ysi&#65533;1, ysi , s) (1) and f is a high dimensional feature representation of the clique and w a corresponding weight vector.
    Note that s is included in each score since it is given as input and can always be conditioned on.
    In general, inference in undirected graphical models is intractable.
    However, for the common case of sequences (a.k.a. linear-chain models) the Viterbi algorithm can be used (Rabiner, 1989; Lafferty et al., 2001).
    Fortunately there is a simple technique that reduces inference in the above model to sequence classification with a constrained version of Viterbi.
    The inference problem is to find the highest scoring labeling y for an input s, i.e., arg max score(y, s) Y If the document label yd is fixed, then inference in the model from Figure 1 reduces to the sequential case.
    This is because the search space is only over the sentence labels ysi , whose graphical structure forms a chain.
    Thus the
