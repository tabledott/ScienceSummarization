y areas, such as question expansion in question answering (QA) (Duboue and Chu-Carroll, 2006), text polishing in natural language generation (NLG) (Iordanskaja et al., 1991), text simplification in computer-aided reading (Carroll et al., 1999), and sentence similarity computation in the automatic evaluation of machine translation (MT) (Kauchak and Barzilay, 2006) and summarization (Zhou et al., 2006).
    This paper presents a method for statistical paraphrase generation (SPG).
    As far as we know, this is the first statistical model specially designed for paraphrase generation.
    It&#8217;s distinguishing feature is that it achieves various applications with a uniform model.
    In addition, it exploits multiple resources, including paraphrase phrases, patterns, and collocations, to resolve the data shortage problem and generate more varied paraphrases.
    We consider three paraphrase applications in our experiments, including sentence compression, sentence simplification, and sentence similarity comput
