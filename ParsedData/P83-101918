    The rules depend crucially on being able to recognize an editing signal, for that marks the right edge of an expunction site.
    For the present discussion, I will assume little about the phonetic nature of the signal except that it is phonetically recognizable, and that, whatever their phonetic nature, all editing signals are, for the self-correction system, equivalent.
    Specifying the nature of the editing signal is, obviously, an area where further research is needed.
    The only action that the editing rules can perform is expunction, by which I mean removing an element from the view of the parser.
    The rules never replace one element with another or insert an element in the parser data structures.
    However, both replacements and insertions can be accomplished within the self-correction system by expunction of partially identical strings.
    For example, in The self-correction rules will expunge the I am which precedes the editing signal, thereby in effect replacing am wi
