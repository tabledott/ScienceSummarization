ged 74% accuracy&#8212;as did TLC using only topical context.
    When local context is combined with topical, TLC is superior to the topical classifiers compared in the Leacock, Towel!, and Voorhees (1993) study.
    Just how useful is a sense classifier whose accuracy is 85% or less?
    Probably not very useful if it is part of a fully automated NLP application, but its performance might be adequate in an interactive application (e.g., machine-assisted translation, on-line thesaurus functions in word processing, interactive information retrieval).
    In fact, when recall does not have to be 100% (as when a human is in the loop) the precision of the classifier can be improved considerably.
    The classifier described above always selects the sense that has the highest probability.
    We have observed that when Classifier performance on three senses of the adjective hard.
    Percentage accounted for by most frequent sense = 80%. the difference between the probability of this sense and that of the second
