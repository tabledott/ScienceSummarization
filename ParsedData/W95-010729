s&amp;quot; where &amp;quot;about&amp;quot; is used as a quantifier rather than preposition.
    A similar list of the first ten rules for the chunk task can be seen in Table 6.
    To gloss a few of these, in the first rule here, determiners (with part-of-speech tag DT), which usually begin N chunks and thus are assigned the baseline tag BN, have their chunk tags changed to N if they follow a word whose tag is also BN.
    In Rule 2, sites currently tagged N but which fall at the beginning of a sentence have their tags switched to BN.
    (The dummy tag Z and word ZZZ indicate that the locations one to the left are beyond the sentence boundaries.)
    Rule 3 changes N to BN after a comma (which is tagged P), and in Rule 4, locations tagged BN are switched to BV if the following location is tagged V and has the part-of-speech tag VB.
    The fact that this system includes lexical rule templates that refer to actual words sets it apart from approaches that rely only on part-of-speech tags to predict chunk stru
