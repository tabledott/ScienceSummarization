tion length (for tree cuts) we assigned an equal code length to each tree cut, which translates to placing no bias on any cut.
    We could have employed a different coding scheme assigning shorter code lengths to cuts nearer the root.
    We chose not to do so partly because, for sufficiently large sample sizes, the parameter description length starts dominating the model description length anyway.
    Another important property of the definition of description length is that it affects not only the effective prior probabilities on the models, but also the procedure for computing the model minimizing the measure.
    Indeed, our definition of model description length was chosen to be compatible with the dynamic programming technique, namely, its calculation is performable locally for each subtree.
    For a different choice of coding scheme, it is possible that a simple and efficient MDL algorithm like Find-MDL may not exist.
    We believe that our choice of model description length is derived from a natura
