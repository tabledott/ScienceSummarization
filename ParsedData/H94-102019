l constructions.
  For example, extraposed sentences which leave behind a semantically null "it" are parsed as follows, using the *EXP* tag: (S (NP-SBJ (NP It) (S *EXP*-i)) (VP is (liP a pleasure)) (S-I (NP-SBJ *) (VP to (VP teach (NP her))))) Pred icate  Argument S t ructure : pleasure(teach(*someone*,  h r ) ) Note that "It" is recognized as the surface subject, and that the extraposed clause is attached at S level and adjoined to "it" with what we call *EXPa-attach.
  The *EXP* is auto- matically co-indexed by our annotator workstation software to the postposed clause.
  The extraposed clause is interpreted as the subject of a pleasure here; the word it is to be ignored during predicate argument interpretation; this is flagged by the use of a special tag.
  CONJUNCTION AND GAPP ING In general, we use a Chomsky adjunetion structure to show coordination, and we coordinate structures as low as possible.
  We leave word level conjunction implicit; two single word NPs or VPs will have only the higher level of s
