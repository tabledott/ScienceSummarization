iptions from entering coreference relations altogether and leaving their analysis to the other tasks.
    It has been proposed that annotation can profitably be broken down into two more manageable steps: annotation of markables (step 1) is to be carried out before (step 2) partitioning the set of markables into equivalence classes of coreferring elements (e.g., Hirschman and Chinchor 1997).
    It turns out, however, that a strict distinction between the two steps is difficult to maintain, because, in principle, almost anything is markable.
    In the MUC-7 TD, this is sensibly acknowledged by letting annotators mark up certain elements only if they corefer with an existing markable: these include conjuncts and prenominal modifiers.
    In the following example, the first occurrence of aluminum is only considered to be markable because it corefers with the occurrence of this noun as a bare NP in the second clause.
    In other words: coreference (step 2) helps to determine what the markables are (step 1).
