    This extension will require using a more selective alignment technique (similar to that of (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1999)).
    We will also investigate a more powerful representation of contextual features.
    Fortunately, statistical parsers produce reliable results on news texts, and therefore can be used to improve context representation.
    This will allow us to extract macro-syntactic paraphrases in addition to local paraphrases which are currently produced by the algorithm.
