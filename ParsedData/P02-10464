(x) =&#65533; +}.
    When F does not abstain, &#175;F` and F&#175;` are identical.
    Finally, in expressions like Pr[F = +|Y = +] (with square brackets and &#8220;Pr&#8221;), the functions F(x) and Y (x) are used as random variables.
    By contrast, in the expression P(F|Y ) (with parentheses and &#8220;P&#8221;), F is the set of instances for which F(x) = +, and Y is the set of instances for which Y (x) = +.
  
  
    Blum and Mitchell assume that each instance x consists of two &#8220;views&#8221; x1, x2.
    We can take this as the assumption of functions X1 and X2 such that X1(x) = x1 and X2(x) = x2.
    They propose that views are conditionally independent given the label.
    Definition 1 A pair of views x1, x2 satisfy view independence just in case: There is a related independence assumption that will prove useful.
    Let us define W1 to consist of rules that are functions of X1 only, and define W2 to consist of rules that are functions of X2 only.
    If instead of generating W1 and W2 from X1 an
