 while retaining the capacity to annotate and search for more complex events.
    In this case, one component entity point mutations cor2An influential precursor to this integration is the system described in (Miller et al., 1996).
    Our work is in much the same spirit, although the representation of the predicate-argument structure via Propbank and the linkage to the entities is quite different, as well as of course the domain of annotation.
    3There are cases where the entities are so minimal that they are contained within a NP, not including the determiner, such as CpG site in the NP a CpG site. entities.
    We are not as concerned about these cases since we expect that such entity information properly contained within a base NP can be associated with the full base NP. responds to a (base) NP node, and at codon 12 is corresponds to the PP node that is the NP&#8217;s sister.
    At the same time, the relation annotation contains the information relating these two constituents.
    Similarly, while the
