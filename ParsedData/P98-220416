(strat.) give the numbers of errors directly produced by the algorithms' strategy, the rows marked with wrong (ambig.) the number of analyses with ambiguities generated by the BFP-algorithm (my approach does not generate ambiguities).
    The rows marked with wrong (intra) give the number of errors caused by (missing) specifications for intrasentential anaphora.
    Since my algorithm integrates the specifications for intra-sentential anaphora, I count these errors as strategic errors.
    The rows marked with wrong (chain) give the numbers of errors contained in error chains.
    The rows marked with wrong (other) give the numbers of the remaining errors (consisting of pronouns with split antecedents, errors because of segment boundaries, and missing specifications for event anaphora).
    Interpretation.
    The results of my experiments showed not only that my algorithm performed better than the centering approaches but also revealed insight in the interaction between inter- and intrasentential preferences
