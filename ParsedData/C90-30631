onstraints i one of the most popular methods in applying semantic information to the resolution of ambiguities in natural anguages.
  The constraints typically specify which combina- tions of semantic lasses are acceptable in subject- verb-object relationships and other syntactic struc- tures.
  This information is used to filter ont some analyses of ambiguous constructs or to set prefer- ences between alternatives.
  Though the use of selectional constraints i very popular, there is very little success (if any) in im- plementing this method for broad domains.
  The major problem is the huge amount of information that must be acquired in order to achieve a rea- sonable representation of a large domain.
  In order to overcome this problem, our project suggests an alternative to the traditional model, based on auto- matic acquisition of constraints flom a large corpus.
  The rest of the paper describes how this method is used to resolve anaphora references.
  Similarly, the constraints are used also to resolve
