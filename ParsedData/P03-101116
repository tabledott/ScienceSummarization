s gave an average of 21 tokens for the Korean sentences.
    The average English sentence length was 16.
    The maximum number of children of a node in the Korean trees was 23 (this corresponds to a comma-separated list of items).
    77% of the Korean trees had no more than four children at any node, 92% had no more than five children, and 96% no more than six children.
    The vocabulary size (number of unique types) was 4700 words in English, and 3279 in Korean &#8212; before splitting multi-morphemic words, the Korean vocabulary size was 10059.
    For reasons of computation speed, trees with more than 5 children were excluded from the experiments described below.
  
  
    We evaluate our translation models both in terms agreement with human-annotated word-level alignments between the sentence pairs.
    For scoring the viterbi alignments of each system against goldstandard annotated alignments, we use the alignment error rate (AER) of Och and Ney (2000), which measures agreement at the level of pairs o
