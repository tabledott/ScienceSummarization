cal tagsets.
    A first proposal in this direction was advanced by Melamed and Resnik (2000), who developed a coefficient for hierarchical tagsets that could be used in SENSEVAL for measuring agreement with tagsets such as HECTOR.
    Melamed and Resnik proposed to &#8220;normalize&#8221; the computation of observed and expected agreement by taking each label which is not a leaf in the tag hierarchy and distributing it down to the leaves in a uniform way, and then only computing agreement on the leaves.
    For example, with a tagset like the one in Table 9, the cases in which the coders used the label &#8216;Group 1&#8217; would be uniformly &#8220;distributed down&#8221; and added in equal measure to the number of cases in which the coders assigned each of the four WordNet labels.
    The method proposed in the paper has, however, problematic properties when used to measure intercoder agreement.
    For example, suppose tag A dominates two sub-tags A1 and A2, and that two coders mark a particular item as A
