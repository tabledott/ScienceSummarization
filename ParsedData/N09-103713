l., 2008), this is the first work to our knowledge to simultaneously model the multiple levels of annotation available.
    Because this is a new corpus, still under development, it is not surprising that we found places where the data was inconsistently annotated, namely with crossing brackets between named entity and tree annotations.
    In the places where we found inconsistent annotation it was rarely the case that the different levels of annotation were inherently inconsistent, but rather inconsistency results from somewhat arbitrary choices made by the annotators.
    For example, when the last word in a sentence ends with a period, such as Corp., one period functions both to mark the abbreviation and the end of the sentence.
    The convention of the Penn Treebank is to separate the final period and treat it as the end of sentence marker, but when the final word is also part of an entity, that final period was frequently included in the named entity annotation, resulting in the sentence terminating pe
