    We also investigated the effect of feature selection on syntactic-relation features that are words (i.e., POS, voice, and relative position are excluded).
    Some examples are shown in Table 1.
    Each POS noun, verb, or adjective is illustrated by one example.
    For each example, (a) shows and its POS; (b) shows the sentence where occurs; and (c) shows the feature vector corresponding to syntactic relations.
  
  
    We evaluated four supervised learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), AdaBoost with decision stumps (AdB), Naive Bayes (NB), and decision trees (DT).
    All the experimental results reported in this paper are obtained using the implementation of these algorithms in WEKA (Witten and Frank, 2000).
    All learning parameters use the default values in WEKA unless otherwise stated.
    The SVM (Vapnik, 1995) performs optimization to find a hyperplane with the largest margin that separates training examples into two classes.
    A test example is classified depending on the s
