t improves over the F1 baseline of K=0,with the best cutoff point at K=20.
			BInc?s re call increases moderately compared to other unarylearning approaches, but it is still substantially bet ter than not using rules (a relative recall increase of 50% already at K=10).
			We found that many of the correct mentions missed by BInc but identified by other methods are due to occasional extractions of incorrect frequent rules, such as partial templates (see Section 5.2).
			This is reflected in the very low precision of the other methods.
			On the other hand, some correct rules were only learned by BInc, e.g. ?countersuit againstX?X sue?
			and ?X take wife ? X marry?.When only one argument is annotated for a specific event mention (28% of ACE predicate mentions, which account for 15% of all annotated arFigure 1: Average Precision, Recall and F1 at dif ferent top K rule cutoff points.
