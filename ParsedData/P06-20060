  Evaluating The Accuracy Of An Unlexicalized Statistical Parser On The PARC DepBank
  
    We evaluate the accuracy of an unlexicalized statistical parser, trained on 4K treebanked sentences from balanced data and tested on the PARC DepBank.
    We demonstrate that a parser which is competitive in accuracy (without sacrificing processing speed) can be quickly tuned without reliance on large in-domain manuallyconstructed treebanks.
    This makes it more practical to use statistical parsers in applications that need access to aspects of predicate-argument structure.
    The comparison of systems using DepBank is not straightforward, so we extend and validate DepBank and highlight a number of representation and scoring issues for relational evaluation schemes.
  
  
    Considerable progress has been made in accurate statistical parsing of realistic texts, yielding rooted, hierarchical and/or relational representations of full sentences.
    However, much of this progress has been made with systems based on l
