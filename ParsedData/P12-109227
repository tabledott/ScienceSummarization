imilarity tasks, which are importantfor tasks such as information retrieval and summarization.
			Our experiments show that our word em beddings are competitive in word similarity tasks.
			Most of the previous vector-space models use a single vector to represent a word even though many words have multiple meanings.
			The multi-prototypeapproach has been widely studied in models of cat egorization in psychology (Rosseel, 2002; Griffiths et al, 2009), while Schu?tze (1998) used clustering of contexts to perform word sense discrimination.
			Reisinger and Mooney (2010b) combined the twoapproaches and applied them to vector-space mod els, which was further improved in Reisinger and Mooney (2010a).
			Two other recent papers (Dhillon et al, 2011; Reddy et al, 2011) present models for constructing word representations that deal with context.
			It would be interesting to evaluate those models on our new dataset.
			Many datasets with human similarity ratings on pairs of words, such as WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et
