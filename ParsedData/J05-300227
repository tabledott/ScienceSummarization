    Another important property of our algorithm is that it produces a local alignment.
    Local alignment maps local regions with high similarity to each other rather than creating an overall optimal global alignment of the entire tree.
    This strategy is more meaningful when only partial meaning overlap is expected between input sentences, as in typical sentence fusion input.
    Only these high-similarity regions, which we call intersection subtrees, are included in the fusion sentence.
    Fusion lattice computation is concerned with combining intersection subtrees.
    During this process, the system will remove phrases from a selected sentence, add phrases from other sentences, and replace words with the paraphrases that annotate each node.
    Among the many possible combinations of subtrees, we are interested only in those combinations which yield semantically sound sentences and do not distort the information presented in the input sentences.
    We cannot explore every possible combination, s
