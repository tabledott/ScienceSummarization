es between Arabic (tagA) and English (tagE).
    We also obtain translation probabilities of an English part-of-speech tag given each Arabic prefix/suffix and its part-of-speech according to (2) computes the translation probability of an Arabic suffix and its part-of-speech into an English part-of-speech in the Arabic stem tag context, stemtagA.
    StemtagA is one of the major stem parts-of-speech with which the specified prefix or suffix co-occurs, i.e.
    ADV, ADJ, NOUN, NOUN_PROP, VERB_IMPERFECT, VERB_PERFECT.
    2 J in suffix; ranges from 1 to M, M = number of distinct suffixes co-occurring with stemtagA. tag;k in suffix;_tag;k is the part-of-speech of suffix;, where k ranges from 1 to L, L = number of probability into NULL tag is not the highest, merge the prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk into its stem in the stemtagA context.
    Merge/deletion analysis is applied to all prefixi_tagik/suffixj_tagjk occurring in the appropriate stem tag contexts in the training corpus (for translation model training) and a
