    There are two ways to start this stage, either by tokenizing the text or considering it in raw form.
    When tokenization is used, each token is inserted in the two morphological tries: one that keeps the letters of the tokens in the normal (prefix) order, another that keeps the letter in the reverse (suffix) order.
    For each letter on the path, the raw distributions are changed by adding the a priori probability of the token belonging to each class (language dependent information may be used here).
    For&#8226; example, in the case of Indo-European languages, if the token starts with an upper-case letter, we add 1 full count (all probability mass) to the &amp;quot;questionable&amp;quot; sum, as this entity is initially fully ambiguous.
    If the token starts with lower-case (and hence is an unlikely name) in this case we add the bulk of the probability mass 5 (e.g.d ?
    ; 0.9) to &amp;quot;non-entity&amp;quot; and the remainder (1-5) to &amp;quot;questionable&amp;quot; (otherwise unassi
