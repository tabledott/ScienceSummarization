feature overlap.
			5.3.1 Tag co-occurrenceMany tweets contain more than a single hashtag or a single smiley type.
			As mentioned, we ex clude such tweets from the training set to reduce ambiguity.
			However such tag co-appearances canbe used for sentiment overlap estimation.
			We cal culated the relative co-occurrence frequencies of some hashtags and smileys.
			Table 5 shows some of the observed co-appearance ratios.
			As expected some of the observed tags frequently co-appear with other similar tags.

			Interestingly, it appears that a relatively high ratio of co-appearance of tags is with opposite meanings (e.g., ?#ilove eating but #ihate feeling fat lol?
			or ?happy days of training going to end in a few days #sad #happy?).
