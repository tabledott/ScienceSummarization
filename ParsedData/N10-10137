d (2) using the distributional hypothesis to automatically infer a vector-space prototype of word meaning from large corpora (Agirre et al., 2009; Curran, 2004; Harris, 1954).
    The former approach tends to have greater precision, but depends on handcrafted dictionaries and cannot, in general, model sense frequency (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).
    The latter approach is fundamentally more scalable as it does not rely on specific resources and can model corpus-specific sense distributions.
    However, the distributional approach can suffer from poor precision, as thematically similar words (e.g., singer and actor) and antonyms often occur in similar contexts (Lin et al., 2003).
    Unsupervised word-sense discovery has been studied by number of researchers (Agirre and Edmond, 2006; Sch&#168;utze, 1998).
    Most work has also focused on corpus-based distributional approaches, varying the vector-space representation, e.g. by incorporating syntactic and co-occurrence information from the words surrounding th
