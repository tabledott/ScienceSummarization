    Problems with this approach arise, however, as soon as the domain of interest becomes too large or too rich to specify semantic features and selection restrictions accurately by hand.
    This paper concerns the use of selectional constraints for automatic sense disambiguation in such broad-coverage settings.
    The approach combines statistical and knowledge-based methods, but unlike many recent corpus-based approaches to sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1993; Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Miller et al., 1994), it takes as its starting point the assumption that senseannotated training text is not available.
    Motivating this assumption is not only the limited availability of such text at present, but skepticism that the situation will change any time soon.
    In marked contrast to annotated training material for partof-speech tagging, (a) there is no coarse-level set of sense distinctions widely agreed upon (whereas part-of-speech tag sets tend to differ in the details); (b) sense annotation
