verted using the procedure defined in Candito et al. (2010).
    RU and KO are native dependency treebanks.
    For the CoNLL data sets we use the part-of-speech tags provided with the data.
    For all other data sets, we train a part-of-speech tagger on the training data in order to tag the development and evaluation data.
    For the NER experiments we use the training, development and evaluation data sets from the CoNLL 2002/2003 shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) for all four languages (DE, EN, ES and NL).
    The data set for each language consists of newswire text annotated with four entity categories: Location (LOC), Miscellaneous (MISC), Organization (ORG) and Person (PER).
    We use the part-of-speech tags supplied with the data, except for ES where we instead use universal part-of-speech tags (Petrov et al., 2011).
    Unlabeled data for training the monolingual cluster models was extracted from one year of newswire articles from multiple sources from a news a
