sed models with the exception of f(t,w1)/t; the best Altavista model performs significantly better than the best BNC model.
    Table 6 shows that both the best Altavista model and the best BNC model outperform their respective baselines.
    A comparison with the literature shows that the best Altavista model outperforms Golding (1995), Jones and Martin (1997) and performs similar to Golding and Schabes (1996).
    The highest accuracy on the task is achieved by the class of multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow (Golding and Roth, 1999).
    Both the best BNC model and the best Altavista model perform significantly worse than this model.
    Note that Golding and Roth (1999) use algorithms that can handle large numbers of features and are robust to noise.
    Our method uses a very small feature set, it relies only on co-occurrence frequencies and does not have access to POS information (the latter has been shown to have an improvement on confusion sets whose words belong to different parts
