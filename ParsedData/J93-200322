through, the reader may wish to jump from here directly to Section 5, returning to this Section when and if he should desire to understand more deeply how the results reported later are achieved.
    The basic mathematical object with which we deal here is the joint probability distribution Pr(F = f, A = a, E = e), where the random variables F and E are a French string and an English string making up a translation, and the random variable A is an alignment between them.
    We also consider various marginal and conditional probability distributions that can be constructed from Pr(F = f, A = a, E = e), especially the distribution Pr(F = fl E = e).
    We generally follow the common convention of using uppercase letters to denote random variables and the corresponding lowercase letters to denote specific values that the random variables may take.
    We have already used 1 and in to represent the lengths of the strings e and f, and so we use L and M to denote the corresponding random variables.
