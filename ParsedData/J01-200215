iter type) combination methods, a fact which we have recently exploited in bootstrapping a word class tagger for a new corpus from existing taggers with completely different tagsets (Zavrel and Daelemans 2000).
    One of the best methods for tagger combination in (van Halteren, Zavrel, and Daelemans 1998) is the TagPair method.
    It looks at all situations where one tagger suggests tagi and the other tag2 and estimates the probability that in this situation the tag should actually be tag,.
    Although it is presented as a variant of voting in that paper, it is in fact also a stacked classifier, because it does not necessarily select one of the tags suggested by the component taggers.
    Taking the same example as in the voting section above, if tagger MXPOST suggests DT and tagger TnT suggests CS, we find that the probabilities for the appropriate tag are: CS subordinating conjunction 0.4623 CS22 second half of a two-token subordinating conjunction, e.g., so that 0.0171 DT determiner 0.4966 QL quantifier
