estion about one word of the context in which w appears.
    One does not know beforehand whether the informant will be the first noun to the right, the first verb to the right, or some other word. in the context of w. However, one can construct a question for each of a number of candidate informant sites, and then choose the most informative question.
    Given a potential informant such as the first 1101111 to the right, we can construct a question that has high mutual information with the translation of w by using the flip-flop algorithm devised by Nadas, Nahamoo, Picheny, and Powell [Nadas et al., 1991].
    To understand their algorithm, first imagine that w is a French word and that English words which are possible translations of w have been divided into two classes.
    Consider the problem of constructing a binary question about the potential informant that provides maximal information about these two English word classes.
    If the French vocabulary is of size V, then there are 2&amp;quot; possible
