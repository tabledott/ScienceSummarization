ifying syntactic signatures under these conditions.
  These re- sults are shown in the three major rows of Table 2.
  The best result, using both positive and negative v- idence to identify semantic classes, gives 6.3% of the verbs having perfect overlaps relating semantic lasses to syntactic signatures.
  See Table 2 for the full results.
