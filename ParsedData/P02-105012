trees usually fail to contain an appropriate grammatical relation for these items.
    Because they are frequent, the failure to properly account for them significantly hurts performance.
    Our error analysis led to the conclusion that the correspondence of syntactic relationships would be improved by a better handling of the one-tomany mappings and the unaligned cases.
    We investigated two ways of addressing this issue.
    First, we adopted a simple strategy informed by the tendency of languages to have a consistent direction for &amp;quot;headedness&amp;quot;.
    Chinese and English share the property that they are headinitial for most phrase types.
    Thus, if an English word aligns to multiple Chinese words cj, , cm, the leftmost word c1 is treated as the head and c2, ..., cm are analyzed as its dependents.
    If a Chinese empty node was introduced to align with an untranslated English word, it is deleted and its left-most child is promoted to replace it.
    Looking at language in this non-const
