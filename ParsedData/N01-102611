r for the word from 4.2.1.
    Doing so salvages very large quantities of otherwise accurate tag sequence data with very little introduced noise.
    Evaluation of the tagger projection and induction algorithms is conducted on two granularities of tagset.
    The first tagset is at the level of core part-of-speech tags such as Verb (V), Noun (N), Pronoun (P), Adjective (J), Adverb (R), Preposition (I), Determiner (D), etc., for which English and French share remarkable compatibility.'
    The second is at the level of granularity captured in the English Penn Treebank tagset, where for example singular and plural nouns (NN and NNS) are distinguished.
    As previously noted, the goal of this work is not to induce potential French tagset features such as grammatical gender, mood or subtle tense distinctions that do not appear in English, but to focus on the algorithm's effectiveness at accurately transferring tagging capabilities at the granularity that is present in English (or whichever projection source lang
