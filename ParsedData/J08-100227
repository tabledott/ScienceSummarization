  Figure 10 shows the lexical sign for loves.
    The geometry of signs follows Pollard and Sag: HEAD represents the part-of-speech of the head word, MOD denotes modifiee constraints, and SPR, SUBJ, and COMPS describe constraints of a specifier, a syntactic subject, and complements, respectively.
    CONT denotes the Lexical entry for the transitive verb loves.
    Simplified representation of the lexical entry in Figure 10. predicate&#8211;argument structure of a phrase/sentence.
    The notation of CONT in this article is borrowed from that of Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al. 2006): HOOK represents a structure accessed by other phrases, and RELS describes the remaining structure of the semantics.
    In what follows, we represent signs in a reduced form as shown in Figure 11, because of the large size of typical HPSG signs, which often include information not immediately relevant to the point being discussed.
    We will only show attributes that are relevant to an explanation, expecting that r
