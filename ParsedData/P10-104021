lary size, i.e. how many word representations were induced.
    Note that cleaning is applied only to the unlabeled data, not to the labeled data used in the supervised tasks.
    RCV1 is a superset of the CoNLL03 corpus.
    For this reason, NER results that use RCV1 word representations are a form of transductive learning.
  
  
    The Brown clusters took roughly 3 days to induce, when we induced 1000 clusters, the baseline in prior work (Koo et al., 2008; Ratinov &amp; Roth, 2009).
    We also induced 100, 320, and 3200 Brown clusters, for comparison.
    (Because Brown clustering scales quadratically in the number of clusters, inducing 10000 clusters would have been prohibitive.)
    Because Brown clusters are hierarchical, we can use cluster supersets as features.
    We used clusters at path depth 4, 6, 10, and 20 (Ratinov &amp; Roth, 2009).
    These are the prefixes used in Table 1.
    The Collobert and Weston (2008) (C&amp;W) embeddings were induced over the course of a few weeks, and trained for a
