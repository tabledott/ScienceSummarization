beled with pairs of symbols and we continue to write them with a colon separator.
    Thus, u:v labels a transition over a u on the first tape and a v on the second.
    A finite-state transducer T defines the regular relation R(T), the set of pairs (x, y) such that 6* (q , x, y) contains a final state.
    The pair &#8364;: e plays the same role as a label of transducer transitions that the singleton c plays in one-tape machines, and the e-removal algorithm for one-tape machines can be generalized to show that every regular relation is accepted by an E: &amp;free transducer.
    However, it will also be convenient for some arguments below to assume the existence of vacuous E:E transitions.
    We write xRy if the pair (x, y) belongs to the relation R. The image of a string x under a relation R, which we write x/R, is the set of strings y such that (x, y) is in R. Similarly, R/y is the set of strings that R carries onto y.
    We extend this notation to sets of strings in the obvious way: X/R = uxex x/R.
