ties seen mainly in social media: URLs and email addresses; emoticons; Twitter hashtags, of the form #tagname, which the author may supply to categorize a tweet; and Twitter at-mentions, of the form @user, which link to other Twitter users from within a tweet.
    Hashtags and at-mentions can also serve as words or phrases within a tweet; e.g.

    When used in this way, we tag hashtags with their appropriate part of speech, i.e., as if they did not start with #.
    Of the 418 hashtags in our data, 148 (35%) were given a tag other than #: 14% are proper nouns, 9% are common nouns, 5% are multi-word expresssions (tagged as G), 3% are verbs, and 4% are something else.
    We do not apply this procedure to atmentions, as they are nearly always proper nouns.
