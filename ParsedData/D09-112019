    Another common error is that the % symbol is made compatible with a wide variety of common nouns in the financial domain.
  
  
    We present formal experimental results here (see Table 2).
    We first evaluate our model on the ACE2004-CULOTTA-TEST dataset used in the state-of-the-art systems from Culotta et al. (2007) and Bengston and Roth (2008).
    Both of these systems were supervised systems discriminatively trained to maximize b3 and used features from many different structured resources including WordNet, as well as domain-specific features (Culotta et al., 2007).
    Our best b3 result of 79.0 is broadly in the range of these results.
    We should note that in our work we use neither the gold mention types (we do not model pre-nominals separately) nor do we use the gold NER tags which Bengston and Roth (2008) does.
    Across metrics, the synta
