ategories (for both strict and lenient).
			As seen in this experiment, the results for both the pattern-based and cooccurrence-based systems report very poor per formance for data sets up to 150 MB.
			However, there is an increase in performance for both systems on the 1.5 GB and larger datasets.
			The per formance of the system in the top 5 category is much better than that of WordNet (38%).
			There is promise for increasing our system accuracy by re ranking the outputs of the top-5 hypernyms.
	
	
			There is a long standing need for higher quality performance in NLP systems.
			It is possible that semantic resources richer than WordNet will en able them to break the current quality ceilings.
			Both statistical and symbolic NLP systems can make use of such semantic knowledge.
			With the increased size of the Web, more and more training data is becoming available, and as Banko and Brill (2001) showed, even rather simple learning algo rithms can perform well when given enough data.
			In this light, we s
