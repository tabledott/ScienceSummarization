is separated into two different challenges: a closed challenge, where systems have to be trained strictly with information contained in the given training corpus, and an open challenge, where systems can be developed making use of any kind of external tools and resources.
    The participants could submit results in either one or both challenges.
    This paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 defines the task, including the format of the data, the evaluation metrics, and the two challenges.
    Section 3 introduces the corpora used and our constituent-to-dependency conversion procedure.
    Section 4 summarizes the results of the submitted systems.
    Section 5 discusses the approaches implemented by participants.
    Section 6 analyzes the results using additional non-official evaluation measures.
    Section 7 concludes the paper.
  
  
    In this section we provide the definition of the shared task, starting with the format of the shared task data, followed by a description of the evaluation metri
