usly smaller than the true probability; in the latter case, the MLE is much larger than the true probability.
  adjust their estimates for new or infrequent words by interpolating between local and global estimates of the probability.
  The Bayesian classifier experiments were performed by Kenneth Church of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.
  In these experiments, two-sentence contexts are used in place of a fixed-sized window of ?50 tokens surrounding the tar- get word that Gale, et.
  find optimal, s resulting in a smaller amount of context used to estimate the proba- bilities.
  Content  Vectors The content vector approach to sense resolution is moti- vated by the vector-space model of information retrieval systems [8], where each concept in a corpus defines an axis of the vector space, and a text in the corpus is rep- resented as a point in this space.
  The concepts in a corpus are usually defined as the set of word stems that appear in the corpus (e.g., the strings computer(s), com- puting, computation(al), e
