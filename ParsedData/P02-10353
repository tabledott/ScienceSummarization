fine discriminative or conditional criteria with respect to the set of grammar parses consistent with the treebank annotations.
    Such data can be gathered by applying labels and brackets taken from the treebank annotation to the parser input.
    The rudimentary treebank annotations are thus used to provide partially labeled data for discriminative estimation of a probability model on linguistically fine-grained parses.
    Concerning empirical evaluation of disambiguation performance, we feel that an evaluation measuring matches of predicate-argument relations is more appropriate for assessing the quality of our LFGbased system than the standard measure of matching labeled bracketing on section 23 of the WSJ treebank.
    The first evaluation we present measures matches of predicate-argument relations in LFG fstructures (henceforth the LFG annotation scheme) to a gold standard of manually annotated f-structures for a representative subset of the WSJ treebank.
    The evaluation measure counts the number o
