e used a random sample of such words, rather than a sample of words from the literature.
    In addition to the sampling questions, one feels uncomfortable about comparing results across experiments, since there are many potentially important differences including different corpora, different words, different judges, differences in treatment of precision and recall, and differences in the use of tools such as parsers and part of speech taggers, etc.
    In short, there seem to be a number of serious questions regarding the commonly used technique of reporting percent correct on a few words chosen by hand.
    Apparently, the literature on evaluation of word-sense disambiguation algorithms fails to offer a clear role model that we might follow in order to quantify the performance of our disambiguation algorithms.
    Moreover, there doesn't seem to be a very clear sense of what is possible.
    Is interest a relatively easy word or is it a relatively hard word?
    Zemik says it is relatively easy; we say it i
