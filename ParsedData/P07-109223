anic languages out-scored the Romance languages.
    These findings suggest that &#8216;intermediate&#8217; languages which exhibit a high degree of similarity with the source or target language are desirable.
    We conjecture that this is a consequence of better automatic word alignments and a generally easier translation task, as well as a better preservation of information between aligned phrases.
    Using a single language for triangulation clearly improves performance, but can we realise further improvements by using additional languages?
    Figure 5 shows the performance profile for fr &#8212;* en when adding languages in a fixed order.
    The languages were ordered by family, with Romance before Germanic before Greek and Finnish.
    Each addition results in an increase in performance, even for the final languages, from which we expect little information.
    The purely triangulated (triang) and interpolated scores (interp) are converging, suggesting that the source-target bitext is redundant given
