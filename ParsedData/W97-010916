ion of similar below).
    The quadruple Q3 satisfies this criteria.
    Distances of all the combinations of senses of the noun company and business are calculated and the nearest match chosen to disambiguate the noun company in Q2: min(dist(company,business)dist(COmPANY-1, BUS1NESS-10.083 The algorithm then proceeds to the next quadruple, i.e.
    Q3.
    There are two quadruples which satisfy the similarity threshold for verbs: Q2 and Q4 (Q6 is not considered, because its verb is identical and therefore not similar).
    The verb buy in Q2 is already disambiguated and the distance to both Q2 and Q4 is the same, i.e.
    : dqv(Q3,Q2)=dqv(Q3,Q4)&#8212;(0.252+0.083+0)/3-0.0485 where the minimum semantic distance between the nearest senses of the verb acquire and buy is: min(di st(acquire,buy)iist(ACQUI RE-1 ,BUY-1)4.25 The verb acquire is disambiguated to the sense nearest to the sense of the verb buy and the algorithm proceeds to the noun business in Q3.
    The same two quadruples fall below the SDT for nou
