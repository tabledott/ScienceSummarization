  Recent work on parser evaluation using dependency graphs in the biomedical domain confirms that researchers regard dependency-based evaluation as a more useful surrogate for extrinsic task-based evaluation (Clegg and Shepherd, 2007; Pyysalo et al., 2007a).
    In their evaluation, Clegg and Shepherd (2007) aimed at analyzing the capabilities of syntactic parsers with respect to semantically important tasks crucial to biological information extraction systems.
    To do so, they used the SD scheme, which provides &#8220;a de facto standard for comparing a variety of constituent parsers and treebanks at the dependency level,&#8221; and they assessed its suitability for evaluation.
    They found that the SD scheme better illuminates the performance differences between higher ranked parsers (e.g., Charniak-Lease parser (Lease and Charniak, 2005)), and lower ranked parsers (e.g., the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003)).
    Their parser evaluation accommodates user needs: they used the collapsed version
