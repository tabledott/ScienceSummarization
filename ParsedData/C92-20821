  1 In t roduct ion Currently there is much interest in the automatic ac- quisition of lexiea[ syntax and semantics, with the goal of building up large lexicons for natural lain guage processing.
  Projects that center around ex- tracting lexical information from Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRDs) have shown much success but are inherently limited, since the set of entries within a dictionary is fixed.
  In order to find terms and ex- pressions that are not defined in MRDs we must turn to other textual resources.
  For this purpose, we view a text corpus not only as a source of information, but also as a source of information about the language it is written in.
  When interpreting unrestricted, omain-independent text, it is difficult to determine in advance what kind of infbrmation will be encountered and how it will be expressed.
  Instead of interpreting everything in the text in great detail, we can searcil for specific lexical relations that are e
