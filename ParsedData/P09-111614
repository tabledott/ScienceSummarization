valuation criteria as the CoNLL 2003 Shared Task.
    To make the clusters more relevant to this domain, we adopted the following strategy: The features in our baseline CRF classifier are a subset of the conventional features.
    They are defined with the following templates: Here, s denotes a position in the input sequence; ys is a label that indicates whether the token at position s is a named entity as well as its type; wu is the word at position u; sfx3 is a word&#8217;s threeletter suffix; &lt;SPL&#231;= 8 are indicators of different word types: wtp1 is true when a word is punctuation; wtp2 indicates whether a word is in lower case, upper case, or all-caps; wtp3 is true when a token is a number; wtp4 is true when a token is a hyphenated word with different capitalization before and after the hyphen.
    NER systems often have global features to capture discourse-level regularities (Chieu and Ng 2003).
    For example, documents often have a full mention of an entity at the beginning and then refer to th
