e handling of the left and right verbal brace).
    To formalize the approach, we introduce four verb group states S: Order in which the German source positions are covered for the German-to-English reordering example given in Figure 5.
    The states Move and Skip both allow a set of upcoming words to be processed sooner than would be the case in the monotonic traversal.
    The state Initial is entered whenever there are no uncovered positions to the left of the rightmost covered position.
    The sequence of states needed to carry out the word reordering example in Figure 5 is given in Figure 6.
    The 13 source sentence words are processed in the order shown.
    A formal specification of the state transitions is given in Section 3.5.
    Any number of consecutive German verb phrases in a sentence can be processed by the algorithm.
    The finite-state control presented here is obtained from a simple analysis of the Germanto-English word reordering problem and is not estimated from the training data.
