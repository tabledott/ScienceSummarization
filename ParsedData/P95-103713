 of the decisiontree algorithms used in this work, see (Magerman, 1994).
    An important point which has been omitted from this discussion of decision trees is the fact that only binary questions are used in these decision trees.
    A question which has k values is decomposed into a sequence of binary questions using a classification tree on those k values.
    For example, a question about a word is represented as 30 binary questions.
    These 30 questions are determined by growing a classification tree on the word vocabulary as described in (Brown et al., 1992).
    The 30 questions represent 30 different binary partitions of the word vocabulary, and these questions are defined such that it is possible to identify each word by asking all 30 questions.
    For more discussion of the use of binary decision-tree questions, see (Magerman, 1994).
  
  
    The SPATTER parsing algorithm is based on interpreting parsing as a statistical pattern recognition process.
