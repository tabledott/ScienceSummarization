    The same applies for the choice of 4 as the RELC threshold.
    (uniform(oc)) or the allowed tags according to our simple ambiguity-class guesser (uniform(suf)).
    All the p(tjw) estimates and HMM models are trained on the entire WSJ corpus.
    We use the same 24K word test-set as used in SE, TJ and GG, as well as the same diluted dictionaries.
    We report the results on the same reduced tagsets for comparison, but also include the results on the full 46 tags tagset.
    Table 2 summarizes the results of our experiments.
    Uniform initialization based on the simple suffixbased ambiguity class guesser yields big improvements over the uniform all-open-class initialization.
    However, our refined initial conditions always improve the results (by as much as 40% error reduction).
    As expected, the linear
