s using the standard definitions of dominance and precedence.
    The relation is stipulated to be transitive, so that all head nouns in a list co-occur with each other (e.g. in the phrase planes, trains, and automobiles all three nouns are counted as co-occuring with each other).
    Two head nouns co-occur in this algorithm if they meet the following four conditions: In contrast, R&amp;S counted the closest noun to the left and the closest noun to the right of a head noun as co-occuring with it.
    Consider the following sentence from the MUC-4 (1992) corpus: &amp;quot;A cargo aircraft may drop bombs and a truck may be equipped with artillery for war.&amp;quot; In their algorithm, both cargo and bombs would be counted as co-occuring with aircraft.
    In our algorithm, co-occurrence is only counted within a noun phrase, between head nouns that are separated by a comma or conjunction.
    If the sentence had read: &amp;quot;A cargo aircraft, fighter plane, or combat helicopter ...&amp;quot;, then aircraft,
