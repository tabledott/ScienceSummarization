 The previous section compared our learned knowledge to current work in event and role semantics.
    We now provide a more formal evaluation against untyped narrative chains.
    The two main contributions of schema are (1) adding typed arguments and (2) considering joint chains in one model.
    We evaluate each using the narrative cloze test as in (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008).
    The cloze task (Taylor, 1953) evaluates human understanding of lexical units by removing a random word from a sentence and asking the subject to guess what is missing.
    The narrative cloze is a variation on this idea that removes an event slot from a known narrative chain.Performance is measured by the position of the missing event slot in a system&#8217;s ranked guess list.
    This task is particularly attractive for narrative schemas (and chains) because it aligns with one of the original ideas behind Schankian scripts, namely that scripts help humans &#8216;fill in the blanks&#8217; when language is underspecified.
