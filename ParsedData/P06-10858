orization, and indeed the unsegmented corpus is not the optimal solution under this model, as we will show in Section 3.
    Second, the factorization into four separate steps makes it theoretically possible to modify each step independently in order to investigate the effects of the various modeling assumptions.
    However, the mathematical statement of the model and the approximations necessary for the search procedure make it unclear how to modify the model in any interesting way.
    In particular, the fourth step uses a uniform distribution, which creates a unigram constraint that cannot easily be changed.
    Since our research aims to investigate the effects of different modeling assumptions on lexical acquisition, we develop in the following sections a far more flexible model that also incorporates a preference for sparse solutions.
  
  
    Our goal is a model of language that prefers sparse solutions, allows independent modification of components, and is amenable to standard search procedures.
