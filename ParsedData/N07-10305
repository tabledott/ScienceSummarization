ILP formulations and evaluate their performance with respect to each other and the base classifier.
  
  
    The classification approach tackles coreference in two steps by: (i) estimating the probability, PC(COREF|hi, ji), of having a coreferential outcome given a pair of mentions hi, ji, and (ii) applying a selection algorithm that will single out a unique candidate out of the subset of candidates i for which the probability PC(COREF|hi, ji) reaches a particular value (typically .5).
    We use a maximum entropy model for the coreference classifier.
    Such models are well-suited for coreference, because they are able to handle many different, potentially overlapping learning features without making independence assumptions.
    Previous work on coreference using maximum entropy includes (Kehler, 1997; Morton, 1999; Morton, 2000).
    The model is defined in a standard fashion as follows: comes (COREF and &#172;COREF).
    Model parameters are estimated using maximum entropy (Berger et al., 1996).
