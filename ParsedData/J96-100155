).9 Control then returns to the start of Step 2.
    In our example, during the first run of Step 4, a set of word pairs would be produced, including, for example, (suivantes, doug), (deposer, lewis), (petitions, honneur), and (officielles, langues).
    Some of the word triplets formed during the second iteration of Step 4 on our example starting from the word pair (officielles, longues) are (officielles, langues, suivantes), (officielles, langues, doug), (officielles, langues, lewis), and (officielles, langues, honneur).
    Similarly, on the third run of Step 4 quadruplets are formed such as (officielles, langues, suivantes, lewis).
    Finally, on the eighth iteration of this step, three 9-tuples are formed, including, for example, (suivantes, doug, deposer, lewis, petitions, honneur, officielles, langues, mixte), and are passed on to Step 2; note that none of them will pass the Dice threshold at the next iteration of Step 2.
