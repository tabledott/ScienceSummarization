  Structural Disambiguation With Constraint Propagation
  
    present a new grammatical formalism called Con- Dependency Grammar in which every rule is given constraint on wordto-word modifications.
    CDG parsing is formalized as a constraint satisfaction problem over a finite domain so that efficient constraint-propagation algorithms can be employed to reduce structural ambiguity without generating individual parse trees.
    The weak generative capacity and the computational complexity of CDG parsing are also discussed_
  
  
    We are interested in an efficient treatment of structural ambiguity in natural language analysis.
    It is known that &amp;quot;every-way&amp;quot; ambiguous constructs, such as prepositional attachment in English, have a Catalan number of ambiguous parses (Church and Patil 1982), which grows at a faster than exponential rate (Knuth 1975).
    A parser should be provided with a disambiguation mechanism that does not involve generating such a combinatorial number of parse trees
