    Before comparing bitext alignment algorithms in terms of accuracy, it is important to compare their asymptotic running times.
    In order to run a quadratic-time alignment algorithm in a reasonable amount of time on a large bitext, the bitext must be presegmented into a set of smaller bitexts.
    When a bitext contains no easily recognizable &amp;quot;anchors,&amp;quot; such as paragraphs or sections, this first-pass alignment must be done manually.
    Given a reasonably good bitext map, GSA's expected running time is linear in the number of input segment boundaries.
    In all the bitexts on which GSA was trained and tested, the points of correspondence in SIMR's output were sufficiently dense and accurate that GSA backed off to a quadratic-time alignment algorithm only for very small aligned blocks.
    For example, when the seed translation lexicon was used in SIMR's matching predicate, the largest aligned block that needed to be realigned was 5 x 5 segments.
    Without the seed trans
