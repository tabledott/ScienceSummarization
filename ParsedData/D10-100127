and &#947; &gt; 0 is a parameter dictating the relative weight of the two models.12 This problem is similar to the second example in section 4; a very similar dual decomposition algorithm to that described in section 4.2 can be derived.
    We used the Penn Wall Street Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) for the experiments, with sections 2-21 for training, section 22 for development, and section 23 for testing.
    The parameter &#947; was chosen to optimize performance on the development set.
    We ran the dual decomposition algorithm with a limit of K = 50 iterations.
    The dual decomposition algorithm returns an exact solution if case 1 occurs as defined in section 6.2; we found that of 2416 sentences in section 23, case 1 occurred for 2407 (99.6%) sentences.
    Table 1 gives statistics showing the number of iterations required for convergence.
    Over 80% of the examples converge in 5 iterations or fewer; over 90% converge in 10 iterations or fewer.
    We compare the accuracy of the dual decomposition a
