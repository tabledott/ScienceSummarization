exical head word statistics, in particular, are valuable when data are available but are particularly sparse because of the large number of possible head words.
    To combine the strengths of the various distributions, we merged them in various ways to obtain an estimate of the full distribution P(r  |h, pt,gov, position, voice, t).
    The first combination method is linear interpolation, which simply averages the probabilities given by each of the distributions: where Ei &#955;i = 1.
    The geometric mean, when expressed in the log domain, is similar: where Z is a normalizing constant ensuring that Er P(r  |constituent) = 1.
    Results for systems based on linear interpolation are shown in the first row of Table 5.
    These results were obtained using equal values of &#955; for each distribution defined for the relevant conditioning event (but excluding distributions for which the conditioning event was not seen in the training data).
    As a more sophisticated method of choosing interpolation weights,
