  Noun Phrase Coreference As Clustering
  
    This paper introduces a new, unsupervised algorithm for noun phrase coreference resolution.
    It differs from existing methods in that it views coreference resolution as a clustering task.
    In an evaluation on the MUC-6 coreference resolution corpus, the algorithm achieves an F-measure of 53.6%, placing it firmly between the worst (40%) and best (65%) systems in the MUC-6 evaluation.
    More importantly, the clustering approach outperforms the only MUC-6 system to treat coreference resolution as a learning problem.
    The clustering algorithm appears to provide a flexible mechanism for coordinating the application of context-independent and context-dependent constraints and preferences for accurate partitioning of noun phrases into coreference equivalence classes.
  
  
    Many natural language processing (NLP) applications require accurate noun phrase coreference resolution: They require a means for determining which noun phrases in a text or dialogue r
