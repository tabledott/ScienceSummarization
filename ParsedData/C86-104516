			What has been proposed so far is therefore not a new grammar formalism and even less a linguistic framework.
			The proposal is simply to further explore the usefulness and formal properties of subclasses of CUG.
			This proposal can be supported by a number of reasons.
			Both types of formalisms have clear advantages.
			Categorial grammars have been hailed for their conceptual c arity and their potentials for l inking syntax and semantics.
			The fact that they have been around for a long time and that they are currently enjoying a renaissance in the works of Steedman, Bach, Dowty, and many others demonstrates their virtues.
			Unification grammars are spreading last and lend themselves to powerfifl but efficient computer implementations.
			Traditionally, categorial grammars have been lacking syntactic sophistication.
			In a functor category such as A/B, only domain and range of the function are specified but nothing is said about bow they are related; how, for instance, the features of the argument
