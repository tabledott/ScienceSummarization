   If the anaphor is a child or nested markable, then its possible antecedents must not be any markable with the same root markable as the current anaphor.
    However, the possible antecedents can be other root markables and their children that are before the anaphor in document order.
    For example, consider the two root markables, Mr. Tom's daughter and His daughter's eyes, appearing in that order in a test document.
    The possible antecedents of His cannot be His daughter or His daughter's eyes, but can be Mr. Tom or Mr. Tom's daughter.

    The coreference resolution algorithm considers every markable j starting from the second markable in the document to be a potential candidate as an anaphor.
    For each j, the algorithm considers every markable i before j as a potential antecedent.
    For each pair i and j, a feature vector is generated and given to the decision tree classifier.
    A coreferring antecedent is found if the classifier returns true.
    The algorithm starts from the immediate
