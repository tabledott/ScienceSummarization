    For evaluation, itive instances.
    The corporate acquisition test set we train on the manually labeled instances from the has a total of 995 instances, out of which 156 are test bags.
    We use a combination of one positive bag positive.
    The person-birthplace test set has a total and one negative bag for training, while the other of 601 instances, and only 45 of them are positive. two bags are used for testing.
    The results are averExtrapolating from the test set distribution, the pos- aged over all four possible combinations.
    Note that the supervision provided to SSK&#8211;SIL requires significantly more annotation effort, therefore, given a sufficient amount of training examples, we expect this system to perform at least as well as its M
