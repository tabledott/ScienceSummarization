ecision of each pattern by the formula P = Ca / Co where Ca = total number of patterns with the answer term present Co = total number of patterns present with answer term replaced by any word 6.
    Retain only the patterns matching a sufficient number of examples (we choose the number of examples &gt; 5).
    We obtain a table of regular expression patterns for a given question type, along with the precision of each pattern.
    This precision is the probability of each pattern containing the answer and follows directly from the principle of maximum likelihood estimation.
    For BIRTHDATE the following table is obtained: For a given question type a good range of patterns was obtained by giving the system as few as 10 examples.
    The rather long list of patterns obtained would have been very difficult for any human to come up with manually.
    The question term could appear in the documents obtained from the web in various ways.
    Thus &#8220;Mozart&#8221; could be written as &#8220;Wolfgang Amadeus Moz
