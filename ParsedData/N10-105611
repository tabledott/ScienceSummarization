sformations we found to be reasonable were not on his list.
    Instead, we measured our agreement with the list of transformations he assembled (SPLIST).
    The top 100 pairs from each system (edit model10 and SIMPL and the two baselines) plus 100 randomly selected pairs from SPLIST were mixed and all presented in random order to three native English speakers and three non-native English speakers (all non-authors).
    Each pair was presented in random orientation (i.e., either as A &#8594; a or as a &#8594; A), and the labels included &#8220;simpler&#8221;, &#8220;more complex&#8221;, &#8220;equal&#8221;, &#8220;unrelated&#8221;, and &#8220;?&#8221; (&#8220;hard to judge&#8221;).
    The first two labels correspond to simplifications for the orientations A &#8594; a and a &#8594; A, respectively.
    Collapsing the 5 labels into &#8220;simplification&#8221;, &#8220;not a simplification&#8221;, and &#8220;?&#8221; yields reasonable agreement among the 3 native speakers (n = 0.69; 75.3% of the time all three
