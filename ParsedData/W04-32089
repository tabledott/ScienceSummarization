re translations of each other tend to be translations themselves.
    Conversely, the context sentences of translated word pairs are similar.
    For noisy parallel corpora, sentence alignment is based on embedded content words.
    The word alignment principles used in previous work are as follows: Different sentence alignment algorithms based on the above principles can be found in Manning and Sch&#369;tze (1999), Somers (2001), Wu (2000), and Veronis (2002).
    These methods have also been applied recently in a sentence alignment shared task at NAACL 20031.
    We have also learned that as bilingual corpora become less parallel, it is better to rely on lexical information rather than sentence length and position information.
    For comparable corpora, the alignment principle made in previous work is as follows: with high similarity scores &#8211; &#8220;find-topic-extract-sentence&#8221; We take a step further and propose a new principle for our task:
