f affairs that might allow complicated schemes to improve the parser&#8217;s performance as measured by the metric.
    See Figure 1.
    The parser described in [3] was trained on the Switchboard training corpus as specified in section 2.1.
    The input to the training algorithm was the gold standard parses minus all EDITED nodes and their children.
    We tested on the Switchboard testing subcorpus (again as specified in Section 2.1).
    All parsing results reported herein are from all sentences of length less than or equal to 100 words and punctuation.
    When parsing the test corpus we carried out the following operations: We ran the parser in three experimental situations, each using a different edit detector in step 2.
    In the first of the experiments (labeled &#8220;Gold Edits&#8221;) the &#8220;edit detector&#8221; was simply the simplified gold standard itself.
    This was to see how well the parser would do it if had perfect information about the edit locations.
    In the second experiment (
