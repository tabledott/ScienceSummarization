f the various parallel corpora showing the number of parallel sentences, N , for each of the experiments, together with the ? thresholds (?
			= log(N)).
			Table 3 shows the sizes of the phrasetables that result from the various pruning thresholds described for the WMT06 data.
			It is clear that this is extremely aggressive pruning at the given levels.
			Table 4 shows the corresponding phrasetable sizes for the large corpus Chinese?English data.
			The pruning is not as aggressive as for the WMT06 data but still quite sizeable.
			Tables 5 and 6 show the main results for theWMT06 and the Chinese?English large corpus experiments.
			To make these results more graphic, Fig ure 1 shows the French ??
			English data from the WMT06 results in the form of three graphs.
