 Portuguese and 4 hours for Czech.
    Parsing is also very fast, with an average throughput of 200 sentences per second: Table 1 reports parse time for parsing each whole test set.
    Using Memory Based Learning increases considerably the parsing time, while as expected learning time is quite shorter.
    On the other hand MBL achieves an improvement up to 5% in accuracy, as shown in detail in Table 1.
    Shift/Reduce, one to decide which Reduce action and a third one to choose the dependency in case of Left/Right action For details on the CoNLL-X shared task and the measurements see (Buchholz, et al. 2006).
  
  
    I performed several experiments to tune the parser.
    I also tried alternative machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Winnow, Voted Perceptron.
    The use of SVM turned out quite impractical since the technique does not scale to the size of training data involved: training an SVM with such a large number of features was impossible for any of the larger corpora.
    For smaller ones, e
