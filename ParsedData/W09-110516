rrectly assigned a class for as many negation signals as there are.
    Additionally, we evaluate the percentage of correct scopes (PCS).
    A scope is correct if all the tokens in the sentence have been assigned the correct scope class for a specific negation signal.
    The evaluation in terms of precision and recall measures takes as unit a token, whereas the evaluation in terms of PCS takes as unit a scope.
    An informed baseline system has been created by tagging as negation signals the tokens with the words: absence, absent, fail, failure, impossible, instead of, lack, loss, miss, negative, neither, never, no, none, nor, not, rather than, unable, with the exception of, without.
    The list has been extracted from the training corpus.
    Baseline results and inter-annotator agreement scores are shown in Table 2.
    Table 3 shows the results of the system, which are significantly higher than the results of the baseline system.
    With a more comprehensive list of negation signals it would be possib
