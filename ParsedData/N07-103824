ank sets.
    In cases of disagreement, however, our model does not provide sufficient constraints as the vast majority of ranking sets remain viable.
    This explains the performance of GG ORACLE, the variant of our algorithm with perfect knowledge of agreement/disagreement facts.
    As shown in Table 1, GG ORACLE yields substantial improvement over our algorithm, but most of this gain comes from consensus instances (see Table 2).
    We also examine the impact of the agreement model accuracy on our algorithm.
    The agreement model, when considered on its own, achieves classification accuracy of 67% on the test set, compared to a majority baseline of 58%.
    However, those instances with high confidence |a &#183; x |exhibit substantially higher classification accuracy.
    Figure 3 shows the performance of the agreement model as a function of the confidence value.
    The 10% of the data with highest confidence values can be classified by the agreement model with 90% accuracy, and the third of the data
