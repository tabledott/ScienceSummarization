ument is a country name and the word of the second argument is president, which could be a good clue for an EMP-ORG relation.
    The polynomial kernel is down weighted by a normalization factor because we do not want the high order features to overwhelm the original ones.
    In our experiment, using polynomial kernels with degree higher than 2 does not produce better results.
    2) Full kernel This is the final kernel we used for this task, which is a combination of all the previous kernels.
    In our experiments, we set all the scalar factors to 1.
    Different values were tried, but keeping the original weight for each kernel yielded the best results for this task.
    All the individual kernels we designed are explicit.
    Each kernel can be seen as a matching of features and these features are enumerable on the given data.
    So it is clear that they are all valid kernels.
    Since the kernel function set is closed under linear combination and polynomial extension, the composite kernels are also v
