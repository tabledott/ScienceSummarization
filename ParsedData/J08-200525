ing both linguistic and structural knowledge, such as ?arguments do not overlap?
  or ?each verb takes at most one argument of each type.?
  This knowledge is useful to resolve any incon- sistencies of argument classification in order to generate final legitimate predictions.
  We design an inference procedure that is formalized as a constrained optimization problem, represented as an integer linear program (Roth and Yih 2004).
  It takes as input the argument classifiers?
  confidence scores for each type of argument, along with a list of constraints.
  The output is the optimal solution that maximizes the lin- ear sum of the confidence scores, subject to the constraints that encode the domain knowledge.
  The inference stage can be naturally extended to combine the output of several different SRL systems, as we will show in Section 5.
  In this section we first introduce the constraints and formalize the inference problem for the semantic role labeling task.
  We then demonstrate how we apply integer linear
