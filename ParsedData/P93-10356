diately to the right, or none immediately to the left, then the transformation fails to apply.
    Structurally, the transformation can be seen as follows.
    If we wish to delete a left paren to the right of constituent X', where X appears in a subtree of the form: Given the sentence:5 The dog barked . this would initially be bracketed by the naive parser as: ( ( The ( dog barked) ) . )
    If the transformation delete a left paren to the right of a determiner is applied, the structure would be transformed to the correct bracketing: ( ( ( The dog) barked) ) To add a right parenthesis to the right of YY, YY must once again be in a subtree of the form: YY Z 3To the right of the rightmost terminal dominated by X if X is a nonterminal.
    4The twelve transformations can be decomposed into two structural transformations, that shown here and its converse, along with six triggering environments.
    'Input sentences are also labelled with parts of speech.
    If it is, the following steps are carried out to add t
