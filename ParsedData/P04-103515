s is statistically indistinguishable from the 86.4% that is achieved by running the SVM polarity classifier on ExtractNB input.
    (More improvements to extraction performance are reported later in this section.)
    These findings indicate10 that the extracts preserve (and, in the NB polarity-classifier case, apparently clarify) the sentiment information in the originating documents, and thus are good summaries from the polarity-classification point of view.
    Further support comes from a &#8220;flipping&#8221; experiment: if we give as input to the default polarity classifier an extract consisting of the sentences labeled objective, accuracy drops dramatically to 71% for NB and 67% for SVMs.
    This confirms our hypothesis that sentences discarded by the subjectivity extraction process are indeed much less indicative of sentiment polarity.
    Moreover, the subjectivity extracts are much more compact than the original documents (an important feature for a summary to have): they contain on average only a
