s is shown in Figure 8: Partee, and Dowty were out to achieve.
    Here it falls out simply from the discourse notion of a TF and from the particular anaphoric function Pconseq&#8226; 16 Now consider Example 15 (repeated here) whose first clause is the same as Example 13a and hence would be processed in the same way.
    The tense of the next clause (15b) is past perfect.
    As I noted above, the only anaphoric function on RTisb and an event entity that makes sense for perfect tenses is 00&#8212;that is, Given that perfect tenses imply ET &lt; RT, the event Eb specified by (15b) will be interpreted as being prior to Ea.
    Moreover, since (15b) is past perfect, the consequent phase of Eb is assumed to still hold with respect to RT,5b.
    Hence the consequent phase of Eb overlaps Ea.
    Finally since TF is associated with the event entity at RTb, it remains at Ea.
    E/S structure at this point resembles Figure 10: Now If Clause 13b is interpreted as being part of the same discourse segment as (13a) it mu
