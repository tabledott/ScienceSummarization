llow semantic features such as number, gender, named entities, semantic class, Hobbs&#8217; distance, etc.
    A better idea of the progress in the field can be obtained by reading recent survey articles (Ng, 2010) and tutorials (Ponzetto and Poesio, 2009) dedicated to this subject.
    Corpora to support supervised learning of this task date back to the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC).
    These corpora were tagged with coreferring entities identified by noun phrases in the text.
    The de facto standard datasets for current coreference studies are the MUC (Hirschman and Chinchor, 1997; Chinchor, 2001; Chinchor and Sundheim, 2003) and the ACE1 (G. Doddington et al., 2000) corpora.
    The MUC corpora cover all noun phrases in text, but represent small training and test sets.
    The ACE corpora, on the other hand, have much more annotation, but are restricted to a small subset of entities.
    They are also less consistent, in terms of inter-annotator agreement (ITA) (Hirschman et al., 1998).
