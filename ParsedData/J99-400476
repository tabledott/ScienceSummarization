  Perhaps the most useful application of these results is in finding formulas for outside values.
    For parsers such as CKY parsers, finding outside formulas is not particularly burdensome, but for complicated parsers such as TAG parsers, GHR parsers, and others, it can require a fair amount of thought to find these equations through conventional reasoning.
    With these techniques, the formulas can be found in a simple mechanical way.
    The second advantage comes from clarifying the conditions under which a parser can be converted from computing values in the Boolean semiring (a recognizer) to computing values in any w-continuous semiring.
    We should note that because in the Boolean semiring, infinite summations can be computed trivially and because repeatedly adding a term does not change results, it is not uncommon for parsers that work in the Boolean semiring to require significant modification for other semirings.
    For parsers like CKY parsers, verifying that the parser will work in any semiri
