from early syntax-based statistical translation models in combining the idea of hierarchical structure with key insights from phrase-based MT: Crucially, by incorporating the use of elementary structures with possibly many words, we hope to inherit phrase-based MT&#8217;s capacity for memorizing translations from parallel data.
    Other insights borrowed from the current state of the art include minimum-error-rate training of log-linear models (Och and Ney 2002; Och 2003) and use of an m-gram language model.
    The conjunction of these various elements presents a considerable challenge for implementation, which we discuss in detail in this article.
    The result is the first system employing a grammar (to our knowledge) to perform better than phrase-based systems in large-scale evaluations.2
  
  
    Approaches to syntax-based statistical MT have varied in their reliance on syntactic theories, or annotations made according to syntactic theories.
    At one extreme are those, exemplified by that of Wu (199
