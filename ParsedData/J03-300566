 used as a means of parameter tuning by Rooth et al. [1999] and Prescher, Riezler, and Rooth [2000]).
    It is possible that this fact inflates the performance values for the EM-based approaches (but see note 8).
  
  
    This article explored a novel approach to overcoming data sparseness.
    If a bigram is unseen in a given corpus, conventional approaches re-create its frequency using techniques such as back-off, linear interpolation, class-based smoothing or distanceweighted averaging (see Dagan, Lee, and Pereira [1999] and Lee [1999] for overviews).
    The approach proposed here does not re-create the missing counts but instead retrieves them from a corpus that is much larger (but also much more noisy) than any existing corpus: it launches queries to a search engine in order to determine how often the bigram occurs on the Web.
    We systematically investigated the validity of this approach by using it to obtain frequencies for predicate-argument bigrams (adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verbobject bigr
