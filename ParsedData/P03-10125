 P(lk|Ck) can be approximated by P(lk|eik, fjk, FTk).
    Let C0k = {eik, fjk}&#8746;FTk.
    P(lk|C0k) can then be decomposed using the same derivation as above.
    In the second line of this derivation, we can drop eik and fjk from C0k, leaving only FTk, because they are implied by the events which the probabilities are conditionalized on.
    Now, we are left with the task of approximating P (FTk|lk) and P(FTk|eik,fjk).
    To do so, we will assume that for all ft &#8712; FTk, ft is conditionally independent given either lk or (eik, fjk).
    This allows us to approximate alignment probability P(A|E, F) as follows: represent the context of lk.
    Note that both the context Ck and the link lk imply the occurrence of eik and fjk.
    We can rewrite P (lk|Ck) as: In any context, only a few features will be active.
    The inner product is understood to be only over those features ft that are present in the current context.
    This approximation will cause P(A|E, F) to no longer be awell-behaved probability
