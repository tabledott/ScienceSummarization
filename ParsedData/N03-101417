rom one history representation to another, and thus determines the inductive bias of the system.
    We have designed top and so that the inductive bias reflects structural locality.
    Thus, top includes nodes which are structurally local to top .
    These nodes are the left-corner ancestor of top (which is below top on the stack), top &#8217;s left-corner child (its leftmost child, if any), and top &#8217;s most recent child (which is top , if any).
    For right-branching structures, the left-corner ancestor is the parent, conditioning on which has been found to be beneficial (Johnson, 1998), as has conditioning on the left-corner child (Roark and Johnson, 1999).
    Because these inputs include the history representations of both the left-corner ancestor and the most recent child, a derivation step always has access to the history representation from the previous derivation step , and thus (by induction) any information from the entire previous derivation history could in principle be stored in the hist
