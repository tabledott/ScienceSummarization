numerical ratings.
    We call such documents unlabeled data.
    Standard supervised machine learning algorithms cannot learn from unlabeled data.
    Assigning labels can be a slow and expensive process because manual inspection and domain expertise are needed.
    Often only a small portion of the documents can be labeled within resource constraints, so most documents remain unlabeled.
    Supervised learning algorithms trained on small labeled sets suffer in performance.
    Can one use the unlabeled reviews to improve rating-inference?
    Pang and Lee (2005) suggested that doing so should be useful.
    We demonstrate that the answer is &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Our approach is graph-based semi-supervised learning.
    Semi-supervised learning is an active research area in machine learning.
    It builds better classifiers or regressors using both labeled and unlabeled data, under appropriate assumptions (Zhu, 2005; Seeger, 2001).
