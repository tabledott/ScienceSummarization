jecthood.
  Going from syntactic position to semantic role, the numbered arguments are more predictable than the non-predicate-specific adjunct roles.
  The two exceptions are the roles of ??modal??
  (MOD) and ??negative??
  (NEG), which as previously discussed are not syntactic adjuncts at all but were simply marked as ArgMs as the best means of tracking their important semantic contributions.
  They are almost always realized as auxiliary verbs and the single adverb (part-of-speech tag RB) not, respectively.
  6.2 Associating Verb Classes with Specific Syntactic Constructions Turning to the behavior of individual verbs in the PropBank data, it is interesting to see how much correspondence there is between verb classes proposed in the literature Table 7 Most frequent syntactic positions for each semantic role.
