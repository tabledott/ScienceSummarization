d averaging of results while Ratnaparkhi only makes one test run.
    The accuracy for known tokens is significantly higher than for unknown tokens.
    For the German newspaper data, results are 8.7% better when the word was seen before and therefore is in the lexicon, than when it was not seen before (97.7% vs. 89.0%).
    Accuracy for known tokens is high even with very small amounts of training data.
    As few as 1000 tokens are sufficient to achieve 95%-96% accuracy for them.
    It is important for the tagger to have seen a word at least once during training.
    Stochastic taggers assign probabilities to tags.
    We exploit the probabilities to determine reliability of assignments.
    For a subset that is determined during processing by the tagger we achieve accuracy rates of over 99%.
    The accuracy of the complement set is much lower.
    This information can, e.g., be exploited in an annotation project to give an additional treatment to the unreliable assignments, or to pass selected ambiguitie
