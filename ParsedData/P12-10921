ure semantic and syntac tic information of words.
			These representations can be used to induce similarity measures by computingdistances between the vectors, leading to many useful applications, such as information retrieval (Manning et al, 2008), document classification (Sebas tiani, 2002) and question answering (Tellex et al, 2003).

			Despite their usefulness, most VSMs share acommon problem that each word is only repre sented with one vector, which clearly fails to capture homonymy and polysemy.
			Reisinger and Mooney (2010b) introduced a multi-prototype VSM whereword sense discrimination is first applied by clus tering contexts, and then prototypes are built using the contexts of the sense-labeled words.
			However, in order to cluster accurately, it is important to capture both the syntax and semantics of words.
			While many approaches use local contexts to disambiguate word meaning, global contexts can also prov
