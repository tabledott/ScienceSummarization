compared to Sp, but none of these differences is statistically significant.
    In fact, the only significant differences in attachment score here are the positive differences between MSTMalt and all other systems for Arabic and Danish, and the negative difference between MST-06 and all other systems for Turkish.
    The attachment scores for non-projective arcs are generally very low for these languages, except for the two MST parsers on Danish, but Su performs at least as well as Spp on Danish and Turkish.
    (The results for Arabic are not very meaningful, given that there are only eleven non-projective arcs in the entire test set, of which the (pseudo-)projective parsers found two and Su one, while MSTMalt and MST-06 found none at all.)
    Considering the exact match scores, finally, it is very interesting to see that Su almost consistently outperforms all other parsers, including the combo system MSTMalt, and sometimes by a fairly wide margin (Czech, Slovene).
    The difference is statistically signif
