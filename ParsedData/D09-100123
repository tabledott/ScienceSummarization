ncy tree.
    Even an efficient sampler like MC-SAT (Poon and Domingos, 2006), as used in Poon &amp; Domingos (2008), would have a hard time generating accurate estimates within a reasonable amount of time.
    On the other hand, as already noted in the previous section, the lambda-form distribution is generally sparse.
    Large lambda-forms are rare, as they correspond to complex expressions that are often decomposable into smaller ones.
    Moreover, while ambiguities are present at the lexical level, they quickly diminish when more words are present.
    Therefore, a lambda form can usually only belong to a small number of clusters, if not a unique one.
    We thus simplify the problem by approximating the sum with the mode, and search instead for the L and 0 that maximize log PB(Q, L).
    Since the optimal weights and log-likelihood can be derived in closed form given the semantic parses L, we simply search over semantic parses, evaluating them using log-likelihood.
