atures, Koo et al. (2008) found it helpful to restrict lexicalized features to only relatively frequent words.
    We did not observe a similar phenomenon with our CRF.
    We include all words as features and rely on the regularized CRF to select from them.
    Table 4 summarizes the evaluation results for our NER system and compares it with the two best results on the data set in the literature, as well the top-3 systems in CoNLL 2003.
    In this table, W and P refer to word and phrase clusters created with the web corpus.
    The superscripts are the numbers of clusters.
    LDC refers to the clusters created with the smaller LDC corpus and +pos indicates the use of part-of-speech tags as features.
    The performance of our baseline system is rather mediocre because it has far fewer feature functions than the more competitive systems.
    The Top CoNLL 2003 systems all employed gazetteers or other types of specialized resources (e.g., lists of words that tend to co-occur with certain named entity types)
