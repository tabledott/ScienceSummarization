   Section 6.3 illustrates another example in which the assumption is not valid, causing the algorithm to fail to select the correct translation.
    We must make this assumption since we use only a target language corpus, which is not related to any source language information.6 Therefore, when seeing an occurrence of the target language word w, we do not know which source language word is appropriate in the current context.
    Consequently, we count its occurrence as a translation of all the source language words for which w is a possible translation.
    This implies that sometimes we use inaccurate data, which introduce noise into the statistical model (see Section 6.3 for a discussion of an alternative, but expensive, solution, using a bilingual corpus).
    As we shall see, even though the assumption does not always hold, in most cases this noise does not interfere with the decision algorithm.
    5 The problem of constructing a bilingual lexicon that is as complete as possible is beyond the scope of t
