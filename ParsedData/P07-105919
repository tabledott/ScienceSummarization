hrases of the original query was used.
    For the noisier question-answer translation, expansion terms and phrases were extracted from a 10best list of query translations.
    Terms taken from query paraphrases were matched with the same field weight vector (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3) as above.
    Terms taken from question-answer translation were matched with the weight vector (0.0,1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.5, 0.3), preferring answer fields over question fields.
    After stopword removal, the average number of expansion terms produced was 7.8 for paraphrasing, and 3.1 for question-answer translation.
    The local expansion technique used in our experiments follows Xu and Croft (1996) in taking expansion terms from the top n answers that were retrieved by the baseline tfidf system, and by incorporating cooccurrence information with query terms.
    This is done by calculating term frequencies for expansion terms by summing up the tfidf weights of the answers in which they occur, thus giving h
