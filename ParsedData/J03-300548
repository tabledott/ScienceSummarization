 counts on the task of predicting plausibility judgments.
    The correlation coefficients are listed in Table 11.
    The re-created frequencies are correlated significantly with all three types of bigrams, both for seen and unseen bigrams.
    For the seen bigrams, we found that the correlation coefficients obtained using smoothed counts were significantly lower than the upper bound for all three types of bigrams (t(87) = 3.01, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 3.23, p &lt; .01; t(87) = 3.43, p &lt; .01).
    This result also held for the unseen bigrams: The correlations obtained using smoothing were significantly lower than the upper bound for all three types of bigrams (t(87) = 1.86, p &lt; .05; t(87) = 1.97, p &lt; .05; t(87) = 3.36, p &lt; .01).
    Recall that the correlation coefficients obtained using the Web counts were not found to be significantly different from the upper bound, which indicates that Web counts are better predictors of plausibility than smoothed counts.
    This fact was confirmed by further sig
