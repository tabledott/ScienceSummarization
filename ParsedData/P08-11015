 our system is fully data-driven.
    Different methods have been proposed to reduce error propagation between pipelined tasks, both in general (Sutton et al., 2004; Daum&#180;e III and Marcu, 2005; Finkel et al., 2006) and for specific problems such as language modeling and utterance classification (Saraclar and Roark, 2005) and labeling and chunking (Shimizu and Haas, 2006).
    Though our model is built specifically for Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging, the idea of using the perceptron model to solve multiple tasks simultaneously can be generalized to other tasks.
  
  
    We built a two-stage baseline system, using the perceptron segmentation model from our previous work (Zhang and Clark, 2007) and the perceptron POS tagging model from Collins (2002).
    We use baseline system to refer to the system which performs segmentation first, followed by POS tagging (using the single-best segmentation); baseline segmentor to refer to the segmentor from (Zhang and Clark, 2007) which performs segmentation
