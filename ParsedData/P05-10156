ositive than, or (3) as positive as the second.
    The texts in any particular review pair were taken from the same author to factor out the effects of cross-author divergence.
    As Table 1 shows, both subjects performed perfectly when the rating separation was at least 3 &#8220;notches&#8221; in the original scale (we define a notch as a half star in a four- or five-star scheme and 10 points in a 100-point scheme).
    Interestingly, although human performance drops as rating difference decreases, even at a one-notch separation, both subjects handily outperformed the random-choice baseline of 33%.
    However, there was large variation in accuracy between subjects.2 Because of this variation, we defined two different classification regimes.
    From the evidence above, a three-class task (categories 0, 1, and 2 &#8212; essentially &#8220;negative&#8221;, &#8220;middling&#8221;, and &#8220;positive&#8221;, respectively) seems like one that most people would do quite well at (but we should not assume 100% h
