onstant) for its distributions so the numbers it returns are not true probabilities.
    We noted there that if we replaced the &#8220;max-ent inspired&#8221; feature with standard deleted interpolation smoothing, we took a significant hit in performance.
    We have now found several ways to overcome this problem, including some very efficient ways to compute partition functions for this class of models.
    In the end, however, this was not necessary, as we found that we could obtain equally good performance by &#8220;hand-crafting&#8221; our interpolation smoothing rather than using the &#8220;obvious&#8221; method (which performs poorly).
    Secondly, as noted in [2], the parser encourages right branching with a &#8220;bonus&#8221; multiplicative factor of 1.2 for constituents that end at the right boundary of the sentence, and a penalty of 0.8 for those that do not.
    This is replaced by explicitly conditioning the events in the expansion of Equation 6 on whether or not the constituent is at the right
