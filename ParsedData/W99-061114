 4).
    (The &amp;quot;adjusted&amp;quot; results are described below.)
    For the dryrun data set, the clustering algorithm obtains 48.8% recall and 57.4% precision.
    The formal evaluation produces similar scores: 52.7% recall and 54.6% precision.
    Both runs use r = 4, which was obtained by testing different values on the dryrun corpus.
    Table 5 summarizes the results on the dryrun data set for r values from 1.0 to 10.0.3 As expected, increasing r also increases recall, but decreases precision.
    Subsequent tests with different values for r on the formal evaluation data set also obtained optimal performance with r= 4.
    This provides partial support for our hypothesis that r need not be recalculated for new corpora.
    The remaining rows in Table 4 show the performance of the three baseline algorithms.
    The first baseline marks every pair of noun phrases as coreferent, i.e. all noun phrases in the document form one class.
    This baseline is useful because it establishes an upper bound fo
