  A variable such as mean log frequency would assign identical difficulty to both of these passages, while our model would clearly distinguish them according to each word&#8217;s grade usage.
    To test this hypothesis, we formed passages of length L by sampling L consecutive tokens from near the center of each Reading A-Z test document.
    We compared the RMS error of the Smoothed Unigram prediction on these passages to that obtained from the UNK semantic variable.
    We computed different predictions for both methods by varying the passage length L from 3 tokens to 100 tokens.
    The results are shown in Figure 3.
    Accuracy for the two methods was comparable for passages longer than about 50 tokens, but Smoothed Unigram obtained statistically significant improvements at the 0.05 level for 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8-word passages.
    In those cases, the prediction is accurate enough that very short passages may be reliably classified into low, medium, and high levels of difficulty.
