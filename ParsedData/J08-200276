cteristics of specific words and phrases, such as by improving lexical statistics; for instance, our performance on ARGM-TMP roles is rather worse than that of some other groups.
    Finally, it is worth exploring alternative handling of multiconstituent arguments; our current model uses a simple rule in a post-processing step to decide which constituents given the same label are part of the same argument.
    This could be done more intelligently by the machine learning model.
    Because perfect syntactic parsers do not yet exist and the major bottleneck to the performance of current semantic role labeling systems is syntactic parser performance, the more important question is how to improve performance in the presence of parser errors.
    We explored a simple approach of choosing from among the top k parses from Charniak&#8217;s parser, which resulted in an improvement.
    Other methods have also been proposed, as we discussed in Section 2 (M`arquez et al. 2005; Pradhan, Ward et al.
