ny head tree &#951;h, but the dependencies D must nevertheless be coherent&#8212;for example they must be consistent with the spines in E, and they must be nested correctly.4 We will allow multiple modifier spines to s-adjoin or r-adjoin (a) into the same node in a head spine; see section 2.3 for more details.
    The model used for parsing with this approach is a global linear model.
    For a given sentence x, we define Y(x) to be the set of valid derivations for x, where each y E Y(x) is a pair (E, D) as described in the previous section.
    A function f maps (x, y) pairs to feature-vectors f(x, y) E Rd.
    The parameter vector w is also a vector in Rd.
    Given these definitions, the optimal derivation for an input sentence x is y* = arg maxyEY(X) w &#183; f(x, y).
    We now come to how the feature-vector f(x, y) is defined in our approach.
