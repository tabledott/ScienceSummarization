  An Empirical Study of Semi-supervised Structured Conditional Models for Dependency Parsing
  
    This paper describes an empirical study of high-performance dependency parsers based on a semi-supervised learning approach.
    We describe an extension of semisupervised structured conditional models (SS-SCMs) to the dependency parsing problem, whose framework is originally proposed in (Suzuki and Isozaki, 2008).
    Moreover, we introduce two extensions related to dependency parsing: The first extension is to combine SS-SCMs with another semi-supervised approach, described in (Koo et al., 2008).
    The second extension is to apply the approach to secondorder parsing models, such as those described in (Carreras, 2007), using a twostage semi-supervised learning approach.
    We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods on dependency parsing experiments using two widely used test collections: the Penn Treebank for English, and the Prague Dependency Treebank for Czech.
