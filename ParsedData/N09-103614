 quite complex, permitting us to study the effects of the various model and implementation choices described below on a complex hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian model.
    The collocation-syllable adaptor grammar generates a Sentence in terms of three levels of Collocations (enabling it to capture a wider range of interword dependencies), and generates Words as sequences of 1 to 4 Syllables.
    Syllables are subcategorized as to whether they are initial (I), final (F) or both (IF).
    Here Consonant and Vowel expand to all possible consonants and vowels respectively, and the parentheses in the expansion of Word indicate optionality.
    Because Onsets and Codas are adapted, the collocation-syllable adaptor grammar learns the possible consonant sequences that begin and end syllables.
    Moreover, because Onsets and Codas are subcategorized based on whether they are wordperipheral, the adaptor grammar learns which consonant clusters typically appear at word boundaries, even though the input contains no ex
