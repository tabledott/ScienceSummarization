    It may well appear that the systems we have been considering properly belong to finite-state phonology or graphology, and not to morphology, properly construed.
    Computational linguists have indeed often been guilty of some carelessness in their use of this terminology.
    But it is not hard to see how it could have arisen.
    The first step in any process that treats natural text is to recognize the words it contains, and this generally involves analyzing each of them in terms of a constituent set of formatives of some kind.
    Most important among the difficulties that this entails are those having to do with the different shapes that formatives assume in different environments.
    In other words, the principal difficulties of morphological analysis are in fact phonological or graphological.
    The inventor of two-level morphology, Kimmo Koskenniemi, is fact provided a finite-state account not just of morphophonemics (or morphographemics), but also of morphotactics.
