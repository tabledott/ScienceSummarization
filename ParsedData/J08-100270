ether, these results imply the high applicability of feature forest models to various real tasks.
    Because feature forests have a structure isomorphic to parse forests of PCFG, it might seem that they can represent only immediate dominance relations of CFG rules as in PCFG, resulting in only a slight, trivial extension of PCFG.
    As described herein, however, feature forests can represent structures beyond CFG parse trees.
    Furthermore, because feature forests are a generalized representation of ambiguous structures, each node in a feature forest need not correspond to a node in a PCFG parse forest.
    That is, a node in a feature forest may represent any linguistic entity, including a fragment of a syntactic structure, a semantic relation, or other sentence-level information.
    The idea of feature forest models could be applied to non-probabilistic machine learning methods.
