happen either because the source is itself poor (e.g. ambiguous or incomplete), or because the source uses constructions and concepts that lie outside the program's range.
    Such problems can be alleviated to some extent by constraining the source document, e.g. through use of a 'Controlled Language' such as AECMA (1995).
    An alternative approach to translation is that of generating the multilingual documents from a non-linguistic source.
    In the case of automatic Multilingual Natural Language Generation (MNLG), the source will be a knowledge base expressed in a formal language.
    By eliminating the analysis phase of MT, M-NLG can yield high-quality output texts, free from the 'literal' quality that so often arises from structural imitation of an input text.
    Unfortunately, this benefit is gained at the cost of a huge increase in the difficulty of obtaining the source.
    No longer can the domain expert author the document directly by writing a text in natural language.
