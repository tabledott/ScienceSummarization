  Feature Forest Models for Probabilistic HPSG Parsing
  
    Probabilistic modeling of lexicalized grammars is difficult because these grammars exploit complicated data structures, such as typed feature structures.
    This prevents us from applying common methods of probabilistic modeling in which a complete structure is divided into substructures under the assumption of statistical independence among sub-structures.
    For example, part-of-speech tagging of a sentence is decomposed into tagging of each word, and CFG parsing is split into applications of CFG rules.
    These methods have relied on the structure of the target problem, namely lattices or trees, and cannot be applied to graph structures including typed feature structures.
    This article proposes the feature forest model as a solution to the problem of probabilistic modeling of complex data structures including typed feature structures.
    The feature forest model provides a method for probabilistic modeling without the independence assump
