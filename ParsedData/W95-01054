esentations from a large co-occurrence matrix.
    Yarowsky's (1992) algorithm for sense disambiguation can be thought of as a way of determining how Roget's thesaurus categories behave with respect to contextual features.
    And my own treatment of selectional constraints (Resnik, 1993) provides a way to describe the plausibility of co-occurrence in terms of WordNet's semantic categories, using co-occurrence relationships mediated by syntactic structure.
    In each case, one begins with known semantic categories (WordNet synsets, Roget's numbered classes) and non-sense-annotated text, and proceeds to a distributional characterization of semantic category behavior using co-occurrence relationships.
    This paper begins from a rather different starting point.
    As in the above-cited work, there is no presupposition that sense-annotated text is available.
    Here, however, I make the assumption that word groupings have been obtained through some black box procedure, e.g. from analysis of unannotated text,
