an constructing a tree, a natural language parser based on these ideas will construct a single description which can be viewed as a partial description of each of a family of trees.
    The two key ideas that we have presented here are: These two ideas, taken together, imply that during the process of analyzing the structure of a given utterance, merely adding to the emerging description may change the set of trees ultimately described (just as adding &amp;quot;honest&amp;quot; to the phrase &amp;quot;all politicians&amp;quot; may radically change the set described).
    We have also sketched some implications of this theory that not only suggest a new analysis of coordinate structures, but also suggest that coordinate structures might be much easier to analyze than current parsing techniques would suggest.
    We are currently working to flesh out the analyses presented above.
    We are also working on an analysis of gapping and elision phenomena which seems to fall naturally out of this framework.
