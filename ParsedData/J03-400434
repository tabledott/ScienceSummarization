ne, although accuracy would not be high enough for applications in the absence of other knowledge sources (Stevenson and Wilks 2001).
    The results compare well with those for other systems that do not use sense-tagged training data.
    Selectional preferences work well for some word combinations and grammatical relationships, but not well for others.
    We hope in future work to identify the situations in which selectional preferences have high precision and to focus on these at the expense of coverage, on the assumption that other knowledge sources can be used where there is not strong evidence from the preferences.
    The first-sense heuristic, based on sense-tagged data such as that available in SemCor, seems to beat unsupervised models such as ours.
    For many words, however, the predominant sense varies across domains, and so we contend that it is worth concentrating on detecting when the first sense is not relevant, and where the selectional-preference models provide a high probability for a sec
