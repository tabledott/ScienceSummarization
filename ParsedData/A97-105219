his system achieves a precision of 90% and a recall of 43%.
    His system averages 3.48 subentries (maximum 10)&#8212;less then half the number produced in our experiment.
    It is not clear what level of evidence the performance of Manning's system is based on, but the system was applied to 4.1 million words of text (c.f. our 1.2 million words) and the verbs are all common, so it is likely that considerably more exemplars of each verb were available.
    5 Conclusions and Further Work The experiment and comparison reported above suggests that our more comprehensive subcategorization class extractor is able both to assign classes to individual verbal predicates and also to rank them according to relative frequency with comparable accuracy to extant systems.
    We have also demonstrated that a subcategorization dictionary built with the system can improve the accuracy of a probabilistic parser by an appreciable amount.
    The system we have developed is straightforwardly extensible to nominal and adjectiva
