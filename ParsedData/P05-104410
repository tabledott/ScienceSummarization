tures, or as WFSAs.
    Because &#8220;CRF&#8221; implies CL estimation, we use the term &#8220;WFSA.&#8221; putation, like random sampling (see, e.g., Abney, 1997), will not help to avoid this difficulty; in addition, convergence rates are in general unknown and bounds difficult to prove.
    We would prefer to sum over finitely many paths in Bi.
    For log-linear models, both CL and JL estimation (Tab.
    1) are available.
    In terms of Eq.
    5, both set Ai = {(xi, yz )}.
    The difference is in B: for JL, Bi = X &#215; % so summing over Bi is equivalent to computing the partition function Z(~&#952;).
    Because that sum is typically difficult, CL is preferred; Bi = {xi} &#215; &#65533; for xi, which is often tractable.
    For sequence models like WFSAs it is computed using a dynamic programming algorithm (the forward algorithm for WFSAs).
    Klein and Manning (2002) argue for CL on grounds of accuracy, but see also Johnson (2001).
    See Tab.
    2; other contrast sets Bi are also possible.
