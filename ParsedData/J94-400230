noun occurrence, at least two antecedent candidates remained after syntactic/morphological filtering (see Section 5.1).
    In the 17 cases in which X correctly disagreed with RAP, the proper antecedent happened to be the most proximate candidate.
    We suspect that RAP's overall success rate can be improved (perhaps by 5% or more) by refining its measures of structural salience.
    Other measures of embeddedness, or perhaps of &amp;quot;distance&amp;quot; between anaphor and candidate measured in terms of clausal and NP boundaries, may be more effective than the current mechanisms for nonadverbial and head emphasis.'
    Empirical studies of patterns of pronominal anaphora in corpora (ideally in accurately and uniformly parsed corpora) could be helpful in defining the most effective measures of structural salience.
    One might use such studies to obtain statistical data for determining the reliability of each proposed measure as a predictor of the antecedent&#8212;anaphor relation and the orthogonality (
