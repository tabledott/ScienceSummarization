an be seen to outperform the document-centric approach.
    This difference is also significant (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Text).
    The clear difference between these results shows that the semantic similarity approach can indeed identify relevant sentences while the documentcentric method identifies patterns which match relevant documents, although not necessarily relevant sentences.
    The precision scores for the sentence filtering task in Table 2 show that the semantic similarity algorithm consistently learns more accurate patterns than the existing approach.
    At the same time it learns patterns with high recall much faster than the document-centric approach, by the 120th iteration the pattern set covers almost 95% of relevant sentences while the document-centric approach covers only 75%.
  
  
    The approach to IE pattern acquisition presented here is related to other techniques but uses different assumptions regarding which patterns are likely to be relevant to a particular extraction
