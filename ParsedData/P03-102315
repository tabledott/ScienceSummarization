ion could be used as training data.
    There are also 30 annotated training documents from MUC-7.
    For testing, we utilize the 30 standard test documents from MUC-6 and the 20 standard test documents from MUC-7.
    In the experiment we compared our approach with the following research works: Among them, S-List, a version of centering algorithm, uses well-defined heuristic rules to rank the antecedent candidates; Ng and Cardie&#8217;s approach employs the standard single-candidate model and &#8220;Best-First&#8221; rule to select the antecedent; Connolly et al.&#8217;s approach also adopts the twin-candidate model, but their approach lacks of candidate filtering strategy and uses greedy linear search to select the antecedent (See &#8220;Related work&#8221; for details).
    We constructed three baseline systems based on the above three approaches, respectively.
    For comparison, in the baseline system 2 and 3, we used the similar feature set as in our system (see table 1).
    Table 2 and 3 show the per
