ion, we used 400 sentences in the corpus to compute the probabilities that a phrase is removed, reduced, or unchanged.
    We tested the program on the rest 100 sentences.
    Using five-fold validation (i.e., chose different 100 sentences for testing each time and repeating the experiment five times), The program achieved an average success rate of 81.3%.
    If we consider the baseline as removing all the prepositional phrases, clauses, to-infinitives and gerunds, the baseline performance is 43.2%.
    We also computed the success rate of program's decisions on particular types of phrases.
    For the decisions on removing or keeping a clause, the system has a success rate of 78.1%; for the decisions on removing or keeping a to-infinitive, the system has a success rate of 85.2%.
    We found out that the system has a low success rate on removing adjectives of noun phrases or removing adverbs of a sentence or a verb phrase.
    One reason for this is that our probability model can hardly capture the dependen
