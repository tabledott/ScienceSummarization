lect 211 yes/no judgments in the same amount of time that it would take us to collect 100 sentence ranking judgments.
    However, this is partially offset by the fact that many of the translations of shorter phrases are identical, which means that we have to collect more judgments in order to distinguish between two systems.
    8Sets which took longer than 5 minutes were excluded from these calculations, because there was a strong chance that annotators were interrupted while completing the task.
    One strong advantage of the yes/no judgments over the ranking judgments is their potential for reuse.
    We have invested hundreds of hours worth of effort evaluating the output of the translation systems submitted to this year&#8217;s workshop and last year&#8217;s workshop.
    While the judgments that we collected provide a wealth of information for developing automatic evaluation metrics, we cannot not re-use them to evaluate our translation systems after we update their parameters or change their behavior
