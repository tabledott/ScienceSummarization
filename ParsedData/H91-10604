er of times the treebank has a parenthesization such as, say, (A (B C)) and the parse being evaluated has a paren- thesization for the same input of ((A B) C)), i.e.
  there are parentheses which "cross".
  (2) The Recall score is the number of parenthesis pairs in the intersection of tlle candidate and treebank parses (T intersection C) divided by the number of parenthesis pairs in the treebank parse T, viz.
  (T intersection C) / T. This score provides an additional measure of the degree of fit between the standard and tile candidate parses; in theory a RecMl of 1 certifies a candidate parse as in- cluding all constituent boundaries that are essential to the analysis of the input sentence.
  We applie d this metric to 14 sentences selected from the Brown Cor- pus and analyzed by each of the grammarians named above in the manner that each wished his/her gram- mar to do.
  Instead of using the UPenn Treebank as a standard, we used the automaticMly computed "ma- jority parse" of each sentence obtained from the
