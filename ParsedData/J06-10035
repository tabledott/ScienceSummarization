lking about similarity of distributional or co-occurrence behavior of the words, for which the term word similarity has also been used (Dagan 2000; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1999).
  While similarity of denotation might be inferred from similarity of distributional or co-occurrence behavior (Dagan 2000; Weeds 2003), the two are distinct ideas.
  We return to the relationship between them in Section 6.2.
  When we refer to hierarchies and networks of concepts, we will use both the terms link and edge to refer to the relationships between nodes; we prefer the former term when our view emphasizes the taxonomic aspect or the meaning of the network, and the latter when our view emphasizes algorithmic or graph-theoretic aspects.
  In running text, examples of concepts are typeset in sans-serif font, whereas examples of words are given in italics; in formulas, concepts and words will usually be denoted by c and w, with various subscripts.
  For the sake of uniformity of presentation, we have taken the liberty of alter
