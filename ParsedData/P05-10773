    Charikar (2002) proposed the use of random hyperplanes to generate an LSH function that preserves the cosine similarity between every pair of vectors.
    Interestingly, cosine similarity is widely used in NLP for various applications such as clustering.
    In this paper, we perform high speed similarity list creation for nouns collected from a huge web corpus.
    We linearize this step by using the LSH proposed by Charikar (2002).
    This reduction in complexity of similarity computation makes it possible to address vastly larger datasets, at the cost, as shown in Section 5, of only little reduction in accuracy.
    In our experiments, we generate a similarity list for each noun extracted from 70 million page web corpus.
    Although the NLP community has begun experimenting with the web, we know of no work in published literature that has applied complex language analysis beyond IR and simple surface-level pattern matching.
