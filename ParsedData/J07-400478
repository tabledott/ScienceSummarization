ciated with the lexical category (but not the argument word), plus some measure of distance between the two dependent words.
    We use three distance measures which count the following: the number of intervening words, with four possible values 0, 1, 2, or more; the number of intervening punctuation marks, with four possible values 0, 1, 2, or more; and the number of intervening verbs (determined by POS tag), with three possible values 0, 1, or more.
    Each of these features is again generalized by replacing the word associated with the lexical category with its POS tag.
    5 Each feature has a corresponding frequency function, defined in Equation (14), which counts the number of times the feature appears in a derivation.
    For the normal-form model we follow Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002b) by defining dependency features in terms of the local rule instantiations, by adding the heads of the combining categories to the rule instantiation features.6 These are generalized in three ways using POS tags, as
