d of the observed data with respect to the model parameters 0 = (WS, WT, `pS, &amp;T).
    We use the hard (Viterbi) EM algorithm as a starting point, but due to modeling and computational considerations, we make several important modifications, which we describe later.
    The general form of our algorithm is as follows: E-step: Find the maximum weighted (partial) bipartite matching m E &#10003;Vl M-step: Find the best parameters 0 by performing canonical correlation analysis (CCA) M-step Given a matching m, the M-step optimizes logp(m, s, t; 0) with respect to 0, which can be rewritten as This objective corresponds exactly to maximizing the likelihood of the probabilistic CCA model presented in Bach and Jordan (2006), which proved that the maximum likelihood estimate can be computed by canonical correlation analysis (CCA).
    Intuitively, CCA finds d-dimensional subspaces US E RdS&#215;d of the source and UT E RdT &#215;d of the target such that the components of the projections U&gt;S fS(si) and U&gt;T fT
