initial level of structure by annotating utterances with shallow discourse roles such as &#8220;statement&#8221;, &#8220;question&#8221; and &#8220;answer&#8221;.
    These acts are useful in many applications, including conversational agents (Wilks, 2006), dialogue systems (Allen et al., 2007), dialogue summarization (Murray et al., 2006), and flirtation detection (Ranganath et al., 2009).
    Dialogue act tagging has traditionally followed an annotate-train-test paradigm, which begins with the design of annotation guidelines, followed by the collection and labeling of corpora (Jurafsky et al., 1997; Dhillon et al., 2004).
    Only then can one train a tagger to automatically recognize dialogue acts (Stolcke et al., 2000).
    This paradigm has been quite successful, but the labeling process is both slow and expensive, limiting the amount of data available for training.
    The expense is compounded as we consider new methods of communication, which may require not only new annotations, but new annotation gu
