nts of observed events in the corpus.
    If r is the observed frequency of an event, and N,. is the number of events with the observed frequency r, and N is the total number of events, then the probability of an unseen event is given by N1/ N. Furthermore, the frequencies of the observed events are adjusted so that the total probability of all events sums to one.
    The adjusted frequency for observed events, r*, is computed as Once the frequencies of the observed events are discounted and the frequencies for unseen events are estimated, Katz's back off model is used.
    In this technique, if the observed frequency of an &lt;n-gram, supertag&gt; sequence is zero then its probability is computed based on the observed frequency of an (n - 1)-gram sequence.
    Thus, where a(Ti,T)) and 13(Tk) are constants to ensure that the probabilities sum to one.
    The word emit probability for the (word, supertag) pairs that appear in the training corpus is computed using the relative frequency estimates as shown in Eq
