s and phonemes are aligned the same way by both aligners (abomin- [ a b n m i n ]).
    However, the two aligners produce radically different alignments for the last five letters.
    The alignment provided by the PRONALSYS one-to-one alignments is: e f a n Clearly, the latter alignment provides more information on how the graphemes map to the phonemes.
    Table 3 also shows that impressive improvements for all evaluated corpora are achieved by using many-to-many alignments rather than one-to-one alignments (1-1 align vs. M-M align).
    The significant improvements, ranging from 2.7% to 7.6% in word accuracy, illustrate the importance of having more precise alignments.
    For example, we can now obtain the correct alignment for the second part of the word abomination: Instead of adding a null phoneme in the phoneme sequence, the many-to-many aligner maps the letter chunk ti to a single phoneme.
    The HMM approach is based on the same hypothesis as the constraint satisfaction inference (CSInf) (Van Den Bo
