 (Kay, 1991) and (Catizone et al., 1989).
    However, to date lexically-based algorithms have not proved efficient enough to be suitable for large corpora.
    In this paper, we describe a fast algorithm for sentence alignment that uses lexical information.
    The algorithm constructs a simple statistical word-to-word translation model on the fly during sentence alignment.
    We find the alignment that maximizes the probability of generating the corpus with this translation model.
    The search strategy used is dynamic programming with thresholding.
    Because of thresholding, the search is linear in the length of the corpus so that a corpus need not be subdivided into smaller chunks.
    The search strategy is robust with respect to large deletions; lexical information allows us to confidently identify the beginning and end of deletions.
  
  
    We use an example to introduce our framework for alignment.
    Consider the bilingual corpus (C, Y) displayed in Figure 2.
    Assume that we have constructe
