ly outperform the unsupervised models.
    It is not surprising that a parser transferred from annotated resources does significantly better than unsupervised systems since it has much more information from which to learn.
    The PR system of Ganchev et al. (2009) is similar to ours as it also projects syntax across parallel corpora.
    For Spanish we can see that the multi-source direct transfer parser is better (75.1% versus 70.6%), and this is also true for the multi-source projected parser (73.2%).
    Ganchev et al. also report results for Bulgarian.
    We trained a multi-source direct transfer parser for Bulgarian which obtained a score of 72.8% versus 67.8% for the PR system.
    If we only use English as a source language, as in Ganchev et al., the English direct transfer model achieves 66.1% on Bulgarian and 69.3% on Spanish versus 67.8% and 70.6% for PR.
    In this setting the English projected model gets 72.0% on Spanish.
    Thus, under identical conditions the direct transfer model obtains ac
