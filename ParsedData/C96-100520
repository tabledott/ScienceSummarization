es were fronl the same file.
  If the senses were collapsed at the file level, the coverage and precision of tile algorithm at the file level might be even better.
  5 Further Work We would like to have included in this paper a study on whether there is or not a correlation among correct and erroneous sense assignations and the degree of Conceptual Density, that is, the actual figure held by fommla I.
  If this was the case, the error rate could be furtber decreased setting a ccrtain lhreshold for Conceptual Density wdues of wilming senses.
  We would also like to evaluate the uselulness of partia~l disambiguation: decrease of ambiguity, number of times correct sense is among the chosen ones, etc.
  There are some factors that could raise the performmace of our algorithm: ?

  Unfortunately any information about discourse structure is absent in SemCor, apart from sentence endings Thc performance would gain from the fact lhat sentences from unrelated topics wouht not be
