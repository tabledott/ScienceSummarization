			Instead, we have to simulate the parser on the tree bank in order to derive, for each sentence, the transition sequence corresponding to the correct dependency tree.
			Given the result of this simulation, we can construct a data set consisting of pairs ?s, t?, where s is a parser state and t is the correct transition from that state (includinga dependency type if applicable).
			Unlike standard shift reduce parsing, the simulation of the current algorithm is almost
