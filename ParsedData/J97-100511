 subjects to segment textual transcriptions of telephone task-oriented dialogues, using minimal segmentation instructions based on a notion of topic: 18 dialogues were segmented by 5 coders (with varying levels of expertise in discourse), with an average pairwise kappa coefficient of .45.
    To evaluate hierarchical aspects of segmentation, Flammia and Zue also developed a new measure derived from the kappa coefficient.
    Swerts (1995) asked 38 subjects to mark &amp;quot;paragraph boundaries&amp;quot; in transcriptions of 12 spontaneous spoken monologues; half of the subjects segmented from text alone and half from text plus speech.
    However, no quantitative evaluation of the results were reported.
    Swerts and Ostendorf (1995) also empirically derived discourse structure, using a spoken corpus of database query interactions.
    Although the labelers had high levels of agreement, the segmentations were fairly trivial.
    Isard and Carletta (1995) presented 4 naive subjects and 1 expert coder with tr
