scoring hypotheses are kept on hold.
    We have thus far developed two versions of the control strategy, a &amp;quot;loosely coupled&amp;quot; system and a &amp;quot;tightly coupled&amp;quot; system.
    Both versions begin with a Viterbi search all the way to the end of the sentence, resulting in not only the first candidate solution but also partial scores for a large set of other hypotheses.
    If this first solution fails to parse, then the best-scoring partial theory is allowed to procede forward incrementally.
    In an A* search, the main issue is how to get an estimate of the score for the unseen portion of the sentence.
    In our case, we can use the Viterbi path to the end as the estimate of the future score.
    This path is guaranteed to be the best way to get to the end; however, it may not parse.
    Hence it is a tight upper bound on the true score for the rest of the sentence.
    The recognizer can continue to propose hypotheses until one successfully parses, or until a quitting criterion
