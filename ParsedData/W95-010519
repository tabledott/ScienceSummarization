 nurse, lawyer.
    If one were to include all subsuming concepts for each word, rather than just the synsets of which they are directly members, the concepts with non-zero values of co would be as follows: Given assignments of co at all levels of abstraction, one obvious method of semantic annotation is to assign the highest-level concept for which co is at least as large as the sense-specific value of cp.
    For instance, in the previous example, one would assign the annotation (health professional) to both doctor and nurse (thus explicitly capturing a generalization about their presence in the word group, at the appropriate level of abstraction), and the annotation (professional) to lawyer.
  
  
    In this section I present a number of examples for evaluation by inspection.
    In each case, I give the source of the noun grouping, the grouping itself, and for each word a description of word senses together with their values of y).
