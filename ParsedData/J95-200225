, with the probabilistic computations detailed below.
    The probabilities associated with new states will be computed as sums of various combinations of old probabilities.
    As new states are generated by prediction, scanning, and completion, certain probabilities have to be accumulated, corresponding to the multiple paths leading to a state.
    That is, if the same state is generated multiple times, the previous probability associated with it has to be incremented by the new contribution just computed.
    States and probability contributions can be generated in any order, as long as the summation for one state is finished before its probability enters into the computation of some successor state.
    Appendix B.2 suggests a way to implement this incremental summation.
    Notation.
    A few intuitive abbreviations are used from here on to describe Earley transitions succinctly.
    (1) To avoid unwieldy E notation we adopt the following convention.
    The expression x += y means that x is computed in
