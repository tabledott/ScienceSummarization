endent task and has important ramifications for almost all other language processing tasks that can derive benefit from some form of applied semantic inference.
    For this reason, the task has received noticeable attention in the research community and annual communitywide evaluations of entailment systems have been held in the form of the Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges (Dagan, Glickman, and Magnini 2006; Bar-Haim et al. 2007; Sekine et al.
    2007; Giampiccolo et al. 2008).
    Looking towards the future, Dagan (2008) suggests that the textual entailment task provides a comprehensive framework for semantic inference and argues for building a concrete inference engine that not only recognizes entailment but also searches for all entailing texts given an entailment hypothesis H and, conversely, generates all entailed statements given a text T. Given such an engine, Dagan claims that paraphrase generation is simply a matter of generating all entailed statements given any sentence.
