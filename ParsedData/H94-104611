  Since there are 103 tagged passages in the semantic concordance, this produces 103 data points in addition to the one we already have for PT.
  Using this procedure, the average number of correct sense identifications produced by the most-frequent heuristic is 66.9% (standard eviation, o = 3.7%) when all of the open-class words, both monosemous and polysemous, are included.
  Whan only polysemous words are considered, the average drops to 56.4% (o = 4.3%).
  This larger sample shows that the results obtained from the preliminary experiment with passage P7 were indeed low, more than a standard eviation below the mean.
  The scores obtained when the most-frequent heuristic is applied to these 2,000-word passages appear to be normally distributed.
  Cumulative distributions of the scores for all 104 passages are shown in Figure 1.
  Separate distributions are shown for all open- class words (both monosemous and polysemous) and for the polysemous open-class words alone.
  No doubt some of this variation is
