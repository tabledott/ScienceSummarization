   The distributions calculated were simply the empirical distributions from the training data.
    That is, occurrences of each role and each set of conditioning events were counted in a table, and probabilities calculated by dividing the counts for each role by the total number Sample probabilities for P(r  |pt, gov, t) calculated from training data for the verb abduct.
    The variable gov is defined only for noun phrases.
    The roles defined for the removing frame in the motion domain are AGENT (AGT), THEME (THM), COTHEME (COTHM) (&#8220;... had been abducted with him&#8221;), and MANNER (MANR). of observations for each conditioning event.
    For example, the distribution P(r  |pt, t) was calculated as follows: Some sample probabilities calculated from the training are shown in Table 4.
    As can be seen from Table 3, there is a trade-off between more-specific distributions, which have high accuracy but low coverage, and less-specific distributions, which have low accuracy but high coverage.
