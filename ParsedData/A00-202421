    They were also asked to score the coherence of the summaries based on a scale from 0 to 10.
    On average, the extraction-based summaries have a score of 4.2 for conciseness, while the revised summaries have a score of 7.9 (an improvement of 88%).
    The average improvement for the three systems are 78%, 105%, and 88% respectively.
    The revised summaries are on average 41% shorter than the original extractionbased summaries.
    For summary coherence, the average score for the extraction-based summaries is 3.9, while the average score for the revised summaries is 6.1 (an improvement of 56%).
    The average improvement for the three systems are 69%, 57%, and 53% respectively.
    We are preparing a task-based evaluation, in which we will use the data from the Summarization Evaluation Conference (Mani et al., 1998) and compare how our revised summaries can influence humans' performance in tasks like text categorization and ad-hoc retrieval.
