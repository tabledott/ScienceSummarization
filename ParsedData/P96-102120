language, and moreover the immediate-dominance (ID) productions would typically be more complex than binary-branching.
    This significantly increases time complexity, compared to our BTG model.
    Although it is not mentioned in their paper, the time complexity for ID/LP parsing rises exponentially with the length of production right-hand-sides, due to the number of permutations.
    ITGs avoid this with their restriction to inversions, rather than permutations, and BTGs further minimize the grammar size.
    We have also confirmed empirically that our models would not be feasible under general permutations.
    Assume the number of translations per word is bounded by some constant.
    Then the maximum size of E(s,t) is proportional to t &#8212; s. The asymptotic time complexity for the translation algorithm is thus bounded by 0(T7).
    Note that in practice, actual performance is improved by the sparseness of the translation matrix.
    An interesting connection has been suggested to direct parsing for
