hest score.
			However, this decision procedure is local, i.e., it yields a semantic role assignment foreach frame element independently of all other ele ments.
			We therefore may end up with the same role being assigned to two frame elements or with frameelements having no role at all.
			We remedy this short coming by treating the semantic role assignment as a global optimization problem.
			Specifically, we model the interaction between all pairwise labeling decisions as a minimum weight bipartite edge cover problem (Eiter and Mannila,1997; Cormen et al, 1990).
			An edge cover is a sub graph of a bipartite graph so that each node is linked to at least one node of the other partition.
			This yields a semantic role assignment for all frame elements (see Figure 2b where frame elements and roles areadjacent to an edge).
			Edge covers have been success fully applied in several natural language processing tasks, including machine translation (Taskar et al, 2005) and annotation projection (Pado?
