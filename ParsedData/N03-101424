, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000; Bod, 2001).
    On the complete testing set, the performance of our lexicalized models is very close to the three best current parsers, which all achieve equivalent performance.
    The performance of the best current parser (Collins, 2000) represents only a 4% reduction in precision error and only a 7% reduction in recall error over the SSNFreq 20 model.
    The SSN parser achieves this result using much less lexical knowledge than other approaches, which all minimally use the words which occur at least 5 times, plus morphological features of the remaining words.
    Another diffference between the three best parsers and ours is that we parse incrementally using a beam search.
    This allows use to trade off parsing accuracy for parsing speed, which is a much more important issue than training time.
    Running times to achieve the above levels of performance on the testing set averaged around 30 seconds per sentence for SSN-Tags, 1 minute per sentence f
