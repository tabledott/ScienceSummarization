tropy reranker, as described in (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
    The reranker takes the 50-best parses for each sentence produced by the first-stage 50best parser and selects the best parse from those 50 parses.
    It does this using the reranking methodology described in Collins (2000), using a Maximum Entropy model with Gaussian regularization as described in Johnson et al. (1999).
    Our reranker classifies each parse with respect to 1,333,519 features (most of which only occur on few parses).
    The features consist of those described in (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), together with an additional 601,577 features.
    These features consist of the partsof-speech, possibly together with the words, that surround (i.e., precede or follow) the left and right edges of each constituent.
    The features actually used in the parser consist of all singletons and pairs of such features that have different values for at least one of the best and non-best parses of at least 5 sentences in the training data.
