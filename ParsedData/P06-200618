ts meanwhile as a text adjunct (ta) of governors, delimited by balanced commas, following Nunberg&#8217;s (1990) text grammar but conveying less information here.
    There are also issues of incompatible tokenization and lemmatization between the systems and of differing syntactic annotation of similar information, which lead to problems mapping between our GR output and the current DepBank.
    Finally, differences in the linguistic intuitions of the annotators and errors of commission or omission on both sides can only be uncovered by manual comparison of output (e.g. xmod vs. xcomp for limit efforts above).
    Thus we reannotated the DepBank sentences with GRs using our current system, and then corrected and extended this annotation utilizing a software tool to highlight differences between the extant annotations and our own.2 This exercise, though time-consuming, uncovered problems in both annotations, and yields a doubly-annotated and potentially more valuable resource in which annotation disagreements
