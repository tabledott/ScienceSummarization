 = 0.63 again if we count the cases that the system does not classify as bridging (again, 447 descriptions).
    We collected plenty of data about definite descriptions that we are still in the process of analyzing.
    One issue we are studying at the moment is what to do with bridging references: how to classify them if at all, and how to process them.
    We also intend to study Lobner's hypothesis about the role played by the distinction between sortal and relational head nouns in determining the type of process involved in the resolution of a definite description, possibly by finding a way to ask our subjects to recognize these distinctions.
    We also plan to study the issue of generic definites.
    An obvious direction in which to extend this study is by looking at other kinds of anaphoric expressions such as pronouns and demonstratives.
    We are doing preliminary studies in this direction.
    Finally, we would like to emphasize that although this study is the most extensive investigation of defin
