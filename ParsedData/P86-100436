or also mentioned in the awp spindle motor sentence, and a specific referent is found for it.
    However, this fails the selection restrictions, since although it is a machine part, it is not already associated with an assembly, so backtracking occurs and the referent instantiation is undone.
    The next spindle motor on the FocusList is the one from spindle motor is bad, ([rnotorl]).
    This does pass the selection restrictions since it participates in a haspart relationship.
    The last semantic role to be filled is the object2 role.
    Now there is a restriction saying this role must be filled by a machine part of the same type as objectl, which is not already included in an assembly, viz., the non-specific spindle motor.
    Reference resolution finds a new referent for it, which automatically instantiates the variable in the id term as well.
    The representation can be decomposed further into the two semantic predicates missing and included, which indicate the current status of the parts with resp
