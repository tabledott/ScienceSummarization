t likely analyses they assign to certain sentences.
    Table 2 shows two bracketed test sentences followed by their most likely GR and GB analyses, given for readability in terms of the original words rather than part-of-speech tags.
    For test sentence (A), the only GB constituent not compatible with the tree bank bracketing is (Delta flight number), although the constituent (the cheapest) is linguistically wrong.
    The appearance of this constituent can be explained by lack of information in the tree bank about the internal structure of noun phrases, as exemplified by tree bank bracketing of the same sentence.

    For test sentence (B), the GB analysis is fully compatible with the tree bank.
    However, the GR analysis has nine incompatible constituents, which for example places Francisco and the final punctuation in a lowest-level constituent.
    Since final punctuation is quite often preced
