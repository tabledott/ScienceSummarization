tive evidence.
  For this reason, we felt it necessary to determine the importance of nega- tive evidence for building uniquely identifying syntactic signatures.
  As one might expect, throwing out the neg- ative evidence degrades the usefulness of the signatures across the board.
  The results which had the negative evidence are shown in the left-hand column of numbers in Table 2, and the results which had only positive evi- dence are shown in the right-hand side.
  The second, three-way, distinction involves preposi- tions, and breaks the two previous distinctions involv- ing negative vidence into three sub-cases.
  Because we were interested in the role of prepositions in the sig- natures, we also ran the experiment with two different parse types: ones that ignored the actual prepositions in the pps, and ones that ignored all information except for the values of the prepositions.
  Interestingly, we still got useful results with these impoverished parses, al- though fewer semantic lasses had uniquely-ident
