 this approach.
    Dynamic properties of discourse, especially coherence and focusing, are invoked as the primary basis for identifying antecedence candidates; selecting a candidate as the antecedent of a pronoun in discourse involves additional constraints of a syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic nature.
    In developing our algorithm, we have not attempted to consider elements of discourse structure beyond the simple model of attentional state realized by equivalence classes of discourse referents, salience degradation, and the sentence recency salience factor.
    The results of our experiments with computer manual texts (see Section 4.2) indicate that, at least for certain text domains, relatively simple models of discourse structure can be quite useful in pronominal anaphora resolution.
    We suspect that many aspects of discourse models discussed in the literature will remain computationally intractable for quite some time, at least for broad-coverage systems.
