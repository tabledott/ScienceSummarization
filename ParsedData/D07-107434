  The system described in this paper has been fully implemented as a Web browser (Figure 3), which can analyze any Web page or client text document.
  The application on a large scale of such an entity extraction and disambiguation system could result in a move from the current space of words to a space of concepts, which enables several paradigm shifts and opens new research directions, which we are currently investigating, from entity-based in- dexing and searching of document collections to personalized views of the Web through entity- based user bookmarks.
  Acknowledgments The author would like to gratefully thank Mike Schultz and Robert Ragno for their help in building the system infrastructure, Microsoft Live Search for providing access to their search engine, and the anonymous reviewers for their useful comments.
