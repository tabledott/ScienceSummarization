our CCG parser over the normal-form derivations in CCGbank (Hockenmaier, 2003a).
    Not all rule instantiations in CCGbank are instances of combinatory rules, and not all can be produced by the parser, and so gold standard structures were created for 85.5% of the sentences in sections 2-21 (33,777 sentences).
    The same parser is used to produce the packed charts.
    The parser uses a maximum entropy supertagger (Clark and Curran, 2004) to assign lexical categories to the words in a sentence, and applies the CKY chart parsing algorithm described in Steedman (2000).
    For parsing the training data, we ensure that the correct category is a member of the set assigned to each word.
    The average number of categories assigned to each word is determined by a parameter in the supertagger.
    For the first set of experiments, we used a setting which assigns 1.7 categories on average per word.
    The feature set for the dependency model consists of the following types of features: dependency features (with a
