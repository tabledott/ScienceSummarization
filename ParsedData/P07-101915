case of Figure 3(b), where the top-left cell current bin (#2) into longer ones.
    (b) In Cubit, hypotheses in previous bins are fed via hyperedge bundles (solid arrows) into a priority queue (shaded triangle), which empties into the current bin (#5).
    (2.5) is worse than the current bound of 2.2.
    The update of bound in each iteration (line 10) can be efficiently implemented by using another heap with the same contents as cand but prioritized by h instead.
    In practice this is a negligible overhead on top of cube pruning.
    We now turn to the problem of estimating the heuristic function h,o,,,bo.
    In practice, computing true lower bounds of the combination costs is too slow and would compromise the speed up gained from cube growing.
    So we instead use a much simpler method that just calculates the minimum combination cost of each hyperedge in the top-i derivations of the root node in &#8722;LM decoding.
    This is just an approximation of the true lower bound, and bad estimates can lead to
