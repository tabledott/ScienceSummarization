lowing classical recurrence relations: Thus, a string W E E* is accepted by T iff 6(i, w) E F, and in that case the output of the transducer is cr(i, w).
    Sequential transducers can be generalized by introducing the possibility of generating an additional output string at final states (Schiitzenberger 1977).
    The application of the transducer to a string can then possibly finish with the concatenation of such an output string to the usual output.
    Such transducers are called subsequential transducers.
    Language processing often requires a more general extension.
    Indeed, the ambiguities encountered in language&#8212;ambiguity of grammars, of morphological analyzers, or that of pronunciation dictionaries, for instance&#8212;cannot be taken into account when using sequential or subsequential transducers.
    These devices associate at most a single output to a given input.
    In order to deal with ambiguities, one can introduce p-subsequential transducers (Mohri 1994a), namely transducers provid
