    We return to these unresolved issues in Section 7.
  
  
    The centering model (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, 1995) is intended to describe the relationship between local coherence and the use of referring expressions.
    The model requires two constructs, a single backward-looking center and a list of forwardlooking centers, as well as a few rules and constraints that govern the interpretation of centers.
    It is assumed that discourses are composed of constituent segments (Grosz and Sidner 1986), each of which consists of a sequence of utterances.
    Each utterance L/i in a given discourse segment DS is assigned a list of forward-looking centers, Cf(DS, Ui), and a unique backward-looking center, Cb(DS, Lb).
    The forward-looking centers of U, depend only on the discourse entities that constitute the ith utterance; previous utterances provide no constraints on Cf(DS, U,).
    A ranking imposed on the elements of the Cf reflects the assumption that the most highly ranked element of Cf(D
