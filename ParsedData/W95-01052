rfeit of false connections can outweigh the benefits obtained by using lexical knowledge.
    One obvious solution to this problem would be to extend distributional grouping methods to word senses.
    For example, one could construct vector representations of senses on the basis of their co-occurrence with words or with other senses.
    Unfortunately, there are few corpora annotated with word sense information, and computing reliable statistics on word senses rather than words will require more data, rather than less.1 Furthermore, one widely available example of a large, manually sense-tagged corpus &#8212; the WordNet group's annotated subset of the Brown corpus2 &#8212; vividly illustrates the difficulty in obtaining suitable data.
    lActually, this depends on the fine-grainedness of sense distinctions; clearly one could annotate corpora with very high level semantic distinctions For example, Basili et al. (1994) take such a coarse-grained approach, utilizing on the order of 10 to 15 semantic tags for
