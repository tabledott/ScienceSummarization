elope has been determined, the translation candidates of its constituent line segments are projected onto their corresponding error counts, thus yielding the exact and unsmoothed error surface for all candidate translations encoded in C. The error surface can now easily be traversed in order to find that under which the new paramM minimizes the global error.
    In this section, we present an extension of the algorithm described in Macherey et al. (2008) that allows us to efficiently compute and represent upper envelopes over all candidate translations encoded in hypergraphs.
    Conceptually, the algorithm works by propagating (initially empty) envelopes from the source nodes bottom-up to its unique root node, thereby expanding the envelopes by applying SCFG rules to the partial candidate translations that are associated with the constituent line segments.
    To recombine envelopes, we need two operators: the sum and the maximum over convex polygons.
    To illustrate which operator is applied when, we tran
