    Our list contains the most frequently used semantic relations we have observed on a large corpus.
    Besides the work on semantic roles, considerable interest has been shown in the automatic interpretation of complex nominals, and especially of compound nominals.
    The focus here is to determine the semantic relations that hold between different concep
