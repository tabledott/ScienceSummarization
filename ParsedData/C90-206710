nhibitory links, to only a subset of the complete microfeature s t. A given concept theoretically shares everal microfeatures with concepts to which it is closely related, and will therefore activate the nodes corresponding to closely related concepts when it is activated :itself.
			ttowever, such schemes are problematic due to the difficulties of designing an appropriate set of microfeatures, which in essence consists of designing semantic primitives.
			This becomes clear when one exmnines the sample microfeatures given by Waltz ~md Pollack: they specify micro.f carfares uch as CASINO and CANYON, but it is obviously questionable whether such concepts constitute fundamental semantic distinctions.
			More practically, it is simply difficult to imagine how vectors of several thousands of microfeamrcs for each one of the lens of thousands of words and hundreds of thousands of senses can be realistically encoded by hand.
