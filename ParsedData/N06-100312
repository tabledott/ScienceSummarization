    Bleu relies on exact matches of n-grams in a reference translation.
    Thus if our translation is a paraphrase of the reference, Bleu will fail to score it correctly.
    Because Bleu is potentially insensitive to the type of changes that we were making to the translations, we additionally performed a focused manual evaluation (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).
    To do this, had bilingual speakers create word-level alignments for the first 150 and 250 sentence in the Spanish-English and French-English test corpora, as shown in Figure 3.
    We were able to use these alignments to extract the translations of the Spanish and French words that we were applying our paraphrase method to.
    Knowing this correspondence between foreign phrases and their English counterparts allowed us to directly analyze whether translations that were being produced from paraphrases remained faithful to the meaning of the reference translation.
