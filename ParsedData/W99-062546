, the normalized inner product of the two vectors).
    A further cutoff point is selected to convert similarities to hard decisions of &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;not similar&amp;quot;; different cutoffs result in different tradeoffs between recall and precision.
    Second, we compare our method against a standard, widely available information retrieval system developed at Cornell University, SMART [Buckley 1985].4 SMART utilizes a modified TF*IDF measure (ATC) plus stemming and a fairly sizable stopword list.
    Third, we use as a baseline method the default selection of the most frequent category, i.e., &amp;quot;not similar&amp;quot;.
    While this last method cannot be effectively used to identify similar paragraphs, it offers a baseline for the overall accuracy of any more sophisticated technique for this task.
    Our system was able to recover 36.6% of the similar paragraphs with 60.5% precision, as shown in Table 1.
    In comparison, the unmodified TF*IDF approach obtained only 32.6%
