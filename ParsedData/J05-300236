bstitution is mandatory.
    As a result of subtree insertions and deletions, the words used in the basis tree may not be a good choice after the transformations, and the best verbalization might be achieved by using a paraphrase of them from another theme sentence.
    As an example, consider the case of two paraphrasing verbs with different subcategorization frames, such as tell and say.
    If the phrase our correspondent is removed from the sentence Sharon told our correspondent that the elections were delayed..., a replacement of the verb told with said yields a more readable sentence.
    The task of auxiliary placement is alleviated by the presence of features stored in the input nodes.
    In most cases, aligned words stored in the same node have the same feature values, which uniquely determine an auxiliary selection and conjugation.
    However, in some cases, aligned words have different grammatical features, in which case the linearization algorithm needs to select among available alternatives.
