or flexible control of the parsing algorithm.
    At each step of the algorithm, the user can select which rule or strategy they wish to apply.
    This allows the user to experiment with mixing different strategies (e.g., top-down and bottom-up).
    The user can exercise fine-grained control over the algorithm by selecting which edge they wish to apply a rule to.
    This flexibility allows lecturers to use the tool to respond to a wide variety of questions; and allows students to experiment with different variations on the chart parsing algorithm.
    NLTK provides students with a flexible framework for advanced projects.
    Typical projects involve the development of entirely new functionality for a previously unsupported NLP task, or the development of a complete system out of existing and new modules.
    The toolkit&#8217;s broad coverage allows students to explore a wide variety of topics.
    In our introductory computational linguistics course, topics for student projects included text generation,
