ue) are from the extracted head word tuples.
    Using the above notation, we can interpolate as follows: where c(n) and c(v) are counts from the tagged corpus, and where c(n, true) and c(v, true) are counts from the extracted head word tuples.
    The terms Pr(pin, true) and Pr(plv, true) denote the conditional probability that a particular preposition p will occur as an unambiguous attachment to n or v. We present two techniques to estimate this probability, one based on bigram counts and another based on an interpolation method.
    This technique uses the bigram counts of the extracted head word tuples, and backs off to the uniform distribution when the denominator is zero. where 7) is the set of possible prepositions, where all the counts c(...) are from the extracted head word tuples.
    This technique is similar to the one in (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), and interpolates between the tendencies of the (v, p) and (n, p) bigrams and the tendency of the type of attachment (e.g., N or V) towards a particular
