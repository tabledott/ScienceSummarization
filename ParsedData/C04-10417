i is the corresponding weight, and Z(x) is a normalisation constant.
			The context is a 5-word window surrounding the target word.
			Features are defined for each word in the window and for the POS tag of each word.
			Curran and Clark(2003) describes the model and explains how Gen eralised Iterative Scaling, together with a Gaussian prior for smoothing, can be used to set the weights.
			The supertagger in Curran and Clark (2003) finds the single most probable category sequence given the sentence, and uses additional features defined in terms of the previously assigned categories.
			Theper-word accuracy is between 91 and 92% on un seen data in CCGbank; however, Clark (2002) shows this is not high enough for integration into a parser since the large number of incorrect categories results in a significant loss in coverage.
			Clark (2002) shows how the models in (1) can be used to define a multi-tagger which can assign more than one category to a word.
			For each word inthe sentence, the multi-tagger assig
