ck of the NIST 2008 Arabic-to-English (aren), Chinese-to-English (zhen), and English-to-Chinese (enzh) machine translation tasks.5 In all language pairs, the parallel and monolingual data consists of all the allowed training sets in the constrained track.
    For each language pair, we use two development sets: one for Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003; Macherey et al., 2008), and the other for tuning the scale factor for MBR decoding.
    Our development sets consists of the NIST 2004/2003 evaluation sets for both aren and zhen, and NIST 2006 (NIST portion)/2003 evaluation sets for enzh.
    We report results on NIST 2008 which is our blind test set.
    Statistics computed over these data sets are reported in Table 1.
    Our phrase-based statistical MT system is similar to the alignment template system described in Och and Ney (2004).
    The system is trained on parallel corpora allowed in the constrained track.
    We first perform sentence and sub-sentence chunk alignment on the parallel documents.
