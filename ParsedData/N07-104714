word without considering other assignments may not satisfy the main goal of finding a set of phonemes that work together to form a word.
    A trigram phoneme prediction with constraint satisfaction inference (Van Den Bosch and Canisius, 2006) was proposed to improve on local predictions.
    From each letter unit, it predicts a trigram class that has the target phoneme in the middle surrounded by its neighboring phonemes.
    The phoneme sequence is generated in such a way that it satisfies the trigram, bigram and unigram constraints.
    The overlapping predictions improve letter-to-phoneme performance mainly by repairing imperfect one-to-one alignments.
    However, the trigram class prediction tends to be more complex as it increases the number of target classes.
    For English, there are only 58 unigram phoneme classes but 13,005 tri-gram phoneme classes.
    The phoneme combinations in the tri-gram classes are potentially confusing to the prediction model because the model has more target classes in it
