e et al., 2006) parsing algorithms offer two different approaches to data-driven dependency parsing.
    Given an input sentence, a graph-based algorithm finds the highest scoring parse tree from all possible outputs, scoring each complete tree, while a transition-based algorithm builds a parse by a sequence of actions, scoring each action individually.
    The terms &#8220;graph-based&#8221; and &#8220;transition-based&#8221; were used by McDonald and Nivre (2007) to describe the difference between MSTParser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), which is a graph-based parser with an exhaustive search decoder, and MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006), which is a transition-based parser with a greedy search decoder.
    In this paper, we do not differentiate graph-based and transitionbased parsers by their search algorithms: a graphbased parser can use an approximate decoder while a transition-based parser is not necessarily deterministic.
    To make the concepts clear, we classify the two types of parser by the following
