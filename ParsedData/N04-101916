inventories, which reflects the greater likelihood that more SCUs in the summary appear in the pyramid.
    For a given order pyramid, the scores for the average and for a specific pyramid can differ significantly, as, for example, PAL A and PAL J do (compare rows n=3 and n=9).
    The pyramid rows labelled &#8221;n=3&#8221; are the most comparable to the DUC scores in terms of the available data.
    For the DUC scores there was always a single model, and no attempt to evaluate the model.
    Pyramid scores are quantitatively diagnostic in that they express what proportion of the content in a summary is relatively highly weighted, or alternatively, what proportion of the highly weighted SCUs appear in a summary.
    The pyramid can also serve as a qualitative diagnostic tool.
    To illustrate both points, consider the PAL A summary; its score in the n=3 row of .76 indicates that relatively much of its content is highly weighted.
    That is, with respect to the original pyramid with only three tiers, it con
