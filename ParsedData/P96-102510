tachment would appear to be the previous verb, 'rose', and the baseNP heads between each preposition and this verb.
    They are less likely to modify a more distant verb such as 'escaped'.
    Question 3 allows the parser to prefer modification of the most recent verb &#8212; effectively another, weaker preference for right-branching structures.
    Table 2 shows that 94% of dependencies do not cross a verb, giving empirical evidence that question 3 is useful.
    Questions 4, 5 and 6 People find that punctuation is extremely useful for identifying phrase structure, and the parser described here also relies on it heavily.
    Commas are not considered to be words or modifiers in the dependency model &#8212; but they do give strong indications about the parse structure.
    Questions 4, 5 and 6 allow the parser to use this information.
    The maximum likelihood estimator in (7) is likely to be plagued by sparse data problems &#8212; C( (t77j, ti) (7T7h, th, ) , Ai,h3) may be too low to give a reliable estima
