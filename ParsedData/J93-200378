    These transformations are invertible and should reduce the French vocabulary by about 50% and the English vocabulary by about 20%.
    We hope that this will significantly improve the statistics in our models.
  
  
    That interesting bilingual lexical correlations can be extracted automatically from a large bilingual corpus was pointed out by Brown et al. (1988).
    The algorithm that they describe is, roughly speaking, equivalent to carrying out the first iteration of the EM algorithm for our Model 1 starting from an initial guess in which each French word is equally probable as a translation for each Eng
