	A total of 465 lemmas were selected from about 3500 words of text.We use a tool called STAMP written by Benjamin Snyder for sense-annotation of these instances.
			STAMP accepts a list of pointers to the in stances that need to be annotated.
			These pointers consist of the name of the file where the instance is located, the sentence number of the instance, and finally, the word number of the ambiguous word within that sentence.
			These pointers were obtained as described in the previous paragraph.
			STAMP also requires a sense inventory, which must be stored in XML format.
			This sense inventory was obtained by querying WordNet 2.1 and storing the output as a 87set of XML files (one for each word to be anno tated) prior to tagging.
			STAMP works by displayingto the user the sentence to be annotated with the tar get word highlighted along with the previous and the following sentences and the senses from the sense inventory.
			The user can select one of the senses and move on to the next instance.
