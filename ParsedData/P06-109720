or word alignment, but under a scenario where they simulated sufficient gold standard word alignments to follow an approach similar to Nigam et al.
    (2000).
    We do not have enough labels for this approach.
    We are aware of two approaches to semisupervised learning which are more similar in spirit to ours.
    Ivanov et al. (2001) used discriminative training in a reinforcement learning context in a similar way to our adding of a discriminative training step to an unsupervised context.
    A large body of work uses semi-supervised learning for clustering by imposing constraints on clusters.
    For instance, in (Basu et al., 2004), the clustering system was supplied with pairs of instances labeled as belonging to the same or different clusters.
  
  
    We presented a semi-supervised algorithm based on IBM Model 4, with modeling and search extensions, which produces alignments of improved F-measure over unsupervised Model 4 training.
    We used these alignments to produce translations of higher qual
