s may cause the entire stretch of passages between the perturbations to be misaligned.
    These perturbations can easily arise from a number of causes, including slight omissions or mismatches in the original parallel texts, a 1-for-2 translation pair preceding or following the stretch of passages, or errors in the heuristic segmentation preprocessing.
    Substantial penalties may occur at the beginning and ending boundaries of the misaligned region, where the perturbations lie, but the misalignment between those boundaries incurs little penalty, because the mismatched passages have apparently matching lengths.
    This problem is apparently exacerbated by the non-alphabetic nature of Chinese.
    Because Chinese text contains fewer characters, character length is a less discriminating feature, varying over a range of fewer possible discrete values than the corresponding English.
    The next section discusses a solution to this problem.
    In summary, we have found that the statistical correlation of sent
