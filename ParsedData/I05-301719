best OOV recall in the open evaluation was 0.872 compared to just 0.813 on the closed track.
			These data indicate that OOV handling is still the Achilles heel of segmentation systems, even when the OOV rates are relatively small.
			These OOV recall scores are better than those observed in the first bakeoff in 2003, with similar OOVvalues, which suggests that advances in unknown word recognition have occurred.
			Never theless OOV is still the most significant problem in segmentation systems.
			The best score on any track in the 2003 bakeoff was F=0.961, while the best for this evaluation was F=0.972, followed by 17 other scores above 0.961.
			This shows a general trend to a decrease in error rates, from 3.9% to 2.8%!
			These scores are still far below the theoretical 0.99 level reflected in the topline and the higher numbers often reflected in the literature.
			It is plain that one can construct a test set that any given system will achieve very high measures of precision and recall on, but these numbe
