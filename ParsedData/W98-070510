 represents the percentage of documents that were successfully ranked as the most relevant for its summary/query.

    Note that, as there is only one relevant document per query, the leftmost point is the most representative of each curve.
    Therefore, we have included this results separately in Table 1.
    The results are encouraging: documents, a 29% improvement with respect to SMART.
    This is an excellent result, although we should keep in mind that is obtained with manually disambiguated queries and documents.
    Nevertheless, it shows that WordNet can greatly enhance text retrieval: the problem resides in achieving accurate automatic Word Sense Disambiguation.
    &#8226; Indexing by word senses improves performance when considering up to four documents retrieved for each query/summary, although it is worse than indexing by synsets.
    This confirms our intuition that sy
