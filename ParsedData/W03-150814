nese, the only augmentation being the transliterated names &#8212; there are roughly 2000 tokens in the queries which are not translatable, and almost all of them are proper names.
    We report IR performance with and without the nametransliteration.
    We use a different information retrieval system from the one used in the 2000 Workshop (Meng et al., 2000) to perform the retrieval task.
    A brief description of the system is therefore in order.
    The Hopkins Automated Information Retriever for Combing Unstructured Text (HAIRCUT) is a research retrieval system developed at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
    The system was developed to investigate knowledgelight methods for linguistic processing in text retrieval.
    HAIRCUT uses a statistical language model of retrieval such as the one explored by Hiemstra (2001).
    The model ranks documents according to the probability that the terms in a query are generated by a document.
    Various smoothing methods have been proposed t
