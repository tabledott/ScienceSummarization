 including ours are suitable.
    However, when global context features are indispensable for high accuracy, sampling methods might be better.
    We should also investigate compromise solutions such as dynamic CRFs (McCallum, Rohanimanesh, and Sutton 2003; Sutton, Rohanimanesh, and McCallum 2004) and reranking techniques (Collins 2000; Charniak and Johnson 2005).
    There is no analytical way of predicting the best solution, and it must be investigated experimentally for each target task.
  
  
    A dynamic programming algorithm was presented for maximum entropy modeling and shown to provide a solution to the parameter estimation of probabilistic models of complete structures without the independence assumption.
    We first defined the notion of a feature forest, which is a packed representation of an exponential number of trees of features.
    When training data is represented with feature forests, model parameters are estimated at a tractable cost without unpacking the forests.
    The method provides
