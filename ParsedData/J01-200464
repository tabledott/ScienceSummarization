tion even in the case that recognition errors occur, as opposed to the (generally) fully grammatical strings upon which the perplexity results were obtained.
    As one reviewer pointed out, given that our model relies so heavily on context, it may have difficulty recovering from even one recognition error, perhaps more difficulty than a more locally oriented trigram.
    While the improvements over the trigram model in these trials are modest, they do indicate that our model is robust enough to provide good information even in the face of noisy input.
    Future work will include more substantial word recognition experiments.
    The last set of results that we will present addresses the question of how wide the beam must be for adequate results.
    The base beam factor that we have used to this point is 10', which is quite wide.
    It was selected with the goal of high parser accuracy; but in this new domain, parser accuracy is a secondary measure of performance.
    To determine the effect on perplexity,
