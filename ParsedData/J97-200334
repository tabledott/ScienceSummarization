 (w, w') E (E*)2 such that 6(q, w) n F 0 and 6 (q, w') n F 0.
    Notice that Vk &gt; 0, d(uvkw, uvkw') d(w, w1) Thus, since S has bounded variation Algorithm for the determinization of a transducer Ti representing a power series defined on the semiring (S, G, 6, 1) .
    Hence We describe in this section an algorithm for constructing a subsequential transducer 72 = (Q2, 2,F2, E, 62, 0-2, A2,192) equivalent to a given nonsubsequential one TI E, I, F1, Ei, A1, P1).
    The algorithm extends our determinization algorithm for stringto-string transducers representing p-subsequential functions to the case of transducers outputting weights (Mohri 1994c).
    Figure 10 gives the pseudocode of the algorithm.
    We present the algorithm in the general case of a semiring (S, ED, 0, 0, 1) on which the transducer Ti is defined.
    Indeed, the algorithm we are describing here applies as well to transducers representing power series defined on many other semirings.6 We describe the algorithm in the case of the tropical s
