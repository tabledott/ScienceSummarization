own in Figure 6, where the updated elements are indicated by asterisks.
    Note that the network in Figure 6 is not arc consistent.
    For example, the Li row of the matrix PP3-PP4 consists of all zero elements.
    The filtering algorithm identifies such locally inconsistent values and eliminates them until there are no more inconsistent values left.
    The resultant network is shown in Figure 7.
    This network implicitly represents the remaining four parses of sentence (5).
    Since the sentence is still ambiguous, let us consider another constraint.
    This sets the P2-P2 element of the matrix PP3-PP4 to zero.
    Filtering on this network again results in the network shown in Figure 8, which is unambiguous, since every node has a singleton domain.
    Recovering the dependency structure (the one in Figure 4) from this network is straightforward.
    Several researchers have proposed variant data structures for representing a set of syntactic structures.
