ation about the negation signal, the paired token, their contexts, and the tokens in between.
    Feature selection experiments were carried out with the memory-based learning classifier.
    Features were selected based on their gain ratio, starting with all the features and eliminating the least informative features.
    We also performed experiments applying the feature selection process reported in Tjong Kim Sang et al. (2005), a bi-directional hill climbing process.
    However, experiments with this method did not produce a better selection of features.
    The features of the first three classifers are: right.
    The fourth classifier, a metalearner, is also a CRF as implemented in CRF++.
    The features of this classifier are: Negation signals in the BioScope corpus always have one consecutive block of scope tokens, including the signal token itself.
    However, the classifiers only predict the first and last element of the scope.
    We need to process the output of the classifers in order to buil
