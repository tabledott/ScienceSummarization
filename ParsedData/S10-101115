ervised evaluation.
    The ranking of participants did not change significantly, i.e. we observe only different rankings among systems belonging to the same participant.
    Despite that, Table 7 also shows that the reduction of the mapping corpus has a different impact on systems generating a larger number of clusters than the GS number of senses.
    For instance, UoY that generates 11.54 clusters outperformed the MFS by 3.77% in the 80-20 split and by 3.71% in the 60-40 split.
    The reduction of the mapping corpus had a minimal impact on its performance.
    In contrast, KSU KDD that generates 17.5 clusters was below the MFS by 6.49% in the 80-20 split and by 7.83% in the 60-40 split.
    The reduction of the mapping corpus had a larger impact in this case.
    This result indicates that the performance in this evaluation also depends on the distribution of instances within the clusters.
    Systems generating a skewed distribution, in which a small number of homogeneous clusters tag the majority of ins
