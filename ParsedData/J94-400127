n incorrect relation between conjunctive structures.
    4.2 Retrial of Detecting Overlapping Conjunctive Structures with Incorrect Interrelations If two CSs have a incorrect relation in a sentence as described earlier, a retrial is conducted to get the proper CSs.
    In this case, the CS that has the larger CS score is regarded as correct, and a new CS concerning the KB whose old CS had a smaller score is detected so that the new CS does not have an incorrect relation with the other CS.
    For example, when the CSs X and Y (X precedes Y) have an incorrect relation and Y has a smaller score than X, the range of yl and y3, which will give a correct relation with x1, x2, x3, and y2, is determined from the relations in Figure 9.3 Then, the new CS is identified whose similarity score is the greatest in this restricted range of yl and y3, ignoring paths that start from and end with elements outside the restricted range in the dynamic programming method.
    An example of redetecting a CS is shown in Figure 10.
