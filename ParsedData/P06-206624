DDT indicates that violations of the wellnestedness constraint may, at least in part, be due to properties of the annotation scheme, such as the analysis of punctuation in quotations.
    However, a more detailed analysis of the data from both treebanks is needed before any stronger conclusions can be drawn concerning well-nestedness.
  
  
    In this paper, we have reviewed a number of proposals for the characterization of mildly non-projective dependency structures, motivated by the need to find a better balance between expressivity and complexity than that offered by either strictly projective or unrestricted non-projective structures.
    Experimental evaluation based on data from two treebanks shows, that a combination of the wellnestedness constraint and parametric constraints on discontinuity (formalized either as gap degree or edge degree) gives a very good fit with the empirical linguistic data.
    Important goals for future work are to widen the empirical basis by investigating more languages, and
