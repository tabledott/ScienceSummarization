    Physics Lectures Our first corpus consists of spoken lecture transcripts from an undergraduate Physics class.
    In contrast to other segmentation datasets, our corpus contains much longer texts.
    A typical lecture of 90 minutes has 500 to 700 sentences with 8500 words, which corresponds to about 15 pages of raw text.
    We have access both to manual transcriptions of these lectures and also output from an automatic speech recognition system.
    The word error rate for the latter is 19.4%,2 which is representative of state-of-the-art performance on lecture material (Leeuwis et al., 2003).
    The Physics lecture transcript segmentations were produced by the teaching staff of the introductory Physics course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
    Their objective was to facilitate access to lecture recordings available on the class website.
    This segmentation conveys the high-level topical structure of the lectures.
    On average, a lecture was annotated with six
