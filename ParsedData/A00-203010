R/NP.
    First a comma, then an SBAR structure, and then a second comma are each generated in turn.
    This generation process is continued until the entire tree has been produced.
    We now briefly summarize the probability structure of the model.
    The categories for head constituents, cl&#8222; are predicted based solely on the category of the parent node, cp: Modifier constituent categories, cm, are predicted based on their parent node, cp, the head constituent of their parent node, chp, the previously generated modifier, c&#8222;,_1, and the head word of their parent, wp.
    Separate probabilities are maintained for left (pre) and right (post) modifiers: Part-of-speech tags, t,,, for modifiers are predicted based on the modifier, cm, the partof-speech tag of the head word, th, and the head word itself, wh: Head words, w&#8222;&#8222; for modifiers are predicted based on the modifier, cm, the part-of-speech tag of the modifier word , t&#8222;&#8222; the part-ofspeech tag of the head word , th, and t
