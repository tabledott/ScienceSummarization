ns on physical objects while walk through and fi// are processes in spaces.
    These collocational patterns, we argue, are systematically predictable from the lexical semantics of the noun, and we term such sets of collocated structures lexical conceptual paradigms (LCPs).4 To make this point clearer, let us consider a specific example of an LCP from the computer science domain, namely for the noun tape.
    Because of the particular metonymy observed for a noun like tape, we will classify it as belonging to the container/containee LCP.
    This general class is represented as follows, where P and Q are predicate variables:5 The LCP is a generic qualia structure that captures not only the semantic relationship between arguments types of a relation, but also, through corpus-tuning, the collocation relations that realize these roles.
    The telic function of a container, for example, is the relation hold, but this underspecifies which spatial prepositions would adequately satisfy this semantic relation (e.g.
