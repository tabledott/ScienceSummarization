nguage, L2.
    We assume these random variables are independent and identically distributed with a normal distribution.
    The model is then specified by the mean, c, and variance, s2, of this distribution. c is the expected number of characters in L2 per character in Li, and s2 is the variance of the number of characters in L2 per character in L1.
    We define 8 to be (12 &#8211; 11 c)Psrii&#8212;sT so that it has a normal distribution with mean zero and variance one (at least when the two portions of text under consideration actually do happen to be translations of one another).
    The parameters c and s2 are determined empirically from the UBS data.
    We could estimate c by counting the number of characters in German paragraphs then dividing by the number of characters in corresponding English paragraphs.
    We obtain 81105/73481 = 1.1.
    The same calculation on French and English paragraphs yields c =.
    * 72302/68450 = 1.06 as the expected number of French characters per English characters.
