364;: &#8364;.
    The relations corresponding to all the individual rules are all subsets of 7r*, and thus are all of the restricted same-length class (since 7 does not contain &#8364; paired with an alphabetic symbol).
    For this class of relations, it makes sense to talk about a correspondence between a symbol in one string in a string-pair and a symbol in the other: in the pair (abc,lmn) for example, we can say that a corresponds to 1, b to m, and c to n, by virtue of the positions they occupy relative to the start of their respective same-length strings.
    Symbol pairs that correspond in this way must be members of 7r.
    It also makes sense to talk about corresponding substrings, sequences of string pairs whose symbols correspond to each other in some larger string pair.
    Corresponding substrings belong to 7r*.
    The grammar contains a set of rules whose parts are also same-length regularrelation subsets of 7*.
    There are two basic kinds of rules, context restriction rules and surface coerc
