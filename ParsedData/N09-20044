ong the way (e.g., Och et al. 2003; Carpuat and Wu 2005).
    We are therefore forewarned that it is likely to be at least as difficult to successfully adapt the even more complex types of lexical semantics modeling from semantic parsing and role labeling to the translation task.
    In this paper, we present a novel hybrid model that, for the first time to our knowledge, successfully applies semantic parsing technology to the challenge of improving the quality of ChineseEnglish statistical machine translation.
    The model makes use of a typical representative SMT system based on Moses, plus shallow semantic parsers for both English and Chinese.
  
  
    While the accuracy of shallow semantic parsers has been approaching reasonably high levels in recent years for well-studied languages like English, and to a lesser extent, Chinese, the problem of excessive computational complexity is one of the primary challenges in adapting semantic parsing technology to the translation task.
    Semantic parses, by defin
