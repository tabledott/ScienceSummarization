    The evaluation on the WSJ/WSJ English/English corpus is intended as a pilot test on the discriminative power of the Word Relation Matrix.
    This non-parallel corpus has minimal content and style differences.
    Furthermore, using such an English/English test set, the output can be evaluated automatically&#8212;a translated pair is considered correct if they are identical English words.
    307 seed words are chosen according to their occurrence frequency (400-3900) to minimize the number of function words.
    However, a frequency of 3900 in a corpus of 1.5M words is quite high.
    As a result, a segment delimited by two punctuations is used as the context window size.
    Furthermore, the frequent nature of the seed words led to our choice of the Euclidean Distance, instead of the Cosine Measure.
    The choices of segment size, seed words, and Euclidean Distance measure are all direct consequences of the atypical nature of the English/English pilot test set.
    We selected a test set o
