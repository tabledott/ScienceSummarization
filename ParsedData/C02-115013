			Map coarse classes to fine classes C0 C1 C2 C3 abb,def animal,food all possible subsets of C0 wih size = 5 all possible subsets of C2 with size =5 Figure 1: The hierarchical classifier that its candidate labels are generated by expanding the set of retained coarse classes from the first into a set of fine classes; this set is then treated as the confusion set for the second classifier.Figure 1 shows the basic structure of the hierar chical classifier.
			During either the training or the testing stage, a question is processed along one path top-down to get classified.
			The initial confusion set of any question is C 0 = fc 1 ; c 2 ; : : : ; c n g, the set of all the coarse classes.
			The coarse classifier determines a set of preferred labels, C 1 = Coarse Classifier(C 0 ), C 1  C 0 so that jC 1 j  5.
			Then each coarse class label in C 1 is expanded to a fixed set of
