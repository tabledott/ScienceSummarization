    We said that a verb was contributing meaning to a VPC if it occurred in the 20 most similar items to the VPC.
    For particles, we said that the item was contributing meaning if it was among the 10 nearest neighbours.
    We tried out a range of different cut-offs for each item and found that these gave the best results.
  
  
    The results in Table 4 show that on all tasks (for the majority-view based data and three out of four for the centroid data), at least one of the four statistical methods offers an improvement in precision over the baseline, and that there is an improvement in F-score for TASK 1 on both sets of data.
    There are swings in the relative scores obtained over the majority as compared to centroid annotator data for a given task.
    In terms of relative performance, the semantic similarity based approach of Methods 3 and 4 outperform the distribution based approach of Methods 1 and 2 in terms of F-score, on 6 of the 8 sets of results reported.
