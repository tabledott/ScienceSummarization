pha workstation was under 20 seconds for EuTRANs-I and less than two hours for EuTRANs-II.
    Table 3 provides examples of bilingual word classes for the EuTRANs-I corpus.
    It can be seen that the resulting classes often contain words that are similar in their syntactic and semantic functions.
    The grouping of words with a different meaning like today and tomorrow does not imply that these words should be translated by the same Spanish word, but it does imply that the translations of these words are likely to be in the same Spanish word class.
    To measure the quality of our bilingual word classes we applied two different evaluation measures: exp (J-1 E maxi log (p (C ( f j) (ei)))) 3=1 Both measures determine the extent to which the translation probability is spread out.
    A small value means that the translation probability is very focused and that the knowledge of the source language class provides much information about the target language class. sertions/deletions/substitutions relative to a r
