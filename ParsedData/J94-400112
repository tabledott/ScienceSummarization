e noun phrase, all NBs after a KB are candidates (we call such a candidate bunsetsu a CB).
    However, our method searches not only for the most plausible EB, but also for the most plausible scope of the CS.
    We detect the scope of CSs by using a wide range of information before and after a KB.
    An input sentence is first divided into bunsetsus by conventional morphological analysis.
    Then we calculate similarities in all pairs of bunsetsus in the sentence.
    After that, we calculate the similarities between two series of bunsetsus on the left and right of the KB by combining the similarity scores for pairs of bunsetsus.
    Then, as a final result, we choose the two most similar series of bunsetsus that can reasonably be considered as composing a CS.
    We will explain this process in detail in the following sections.
    In detecting CSs, it is necessary to take many factors into consideration, and it is important to give the proper weight to each factor.
