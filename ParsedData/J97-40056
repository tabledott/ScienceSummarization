ion (EM) algorithm, applied however to ERF rather than maximum-likelihood estimates.
    Under certain independence conditions, ERF estimates are maximum-likelihood estimates.
    Unfortunately, these conditions are violated when there are context dependencies of the sort found in attribute-value grammars, as will be shown below.
    As a consequence, applying the ERF method to attribute-value grammars does not generally yield maximum-likelihood estimates.
    This is true whether one uses EM or not&#8212;a method that yields the &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; estimates on complete data does not improve when EM is used to extend the method to incomplete data.
    Eisele identifies an important symptom that something is amiss with ERF estimates: the probability distribution over proof trees that one obtains does not agree with the frequency of proof trees in the training corpus.
    Eisele recognizes that this problem arises only where there are context dependencies.
    Fortunately, solutions to the context-depend
