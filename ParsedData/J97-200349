112 -1.
    Then according to lemma 1, there exist strings v1, v2, V3 in E*, and states qi, q2, q'y and q'2 such that Iv2I &gt; 0, v1v2v3 = v and such that Ir and 71-' be factored in the following way: Let T1 -= E1, A1,101) be a trim unambiguous string-to-weight transducer defined on the tropical semiring.
    There exists an algorithm to test the determinizability of Ti.
    Proof According to theorem 12, testing the determinizability of TI is equivalent to testing for the twins property We define an algorithm to test this property Our algorithm is close to that of Weber and Klemm (1995) for testing the sequentiability of string-to-string transducers.
    It is based on the construction of an automaton A = (Q, I, F, E) similar to the cross product of Ti with itself.
    Let K C 7?, be the finite set of real numbers defined by: Mohri Transducers in Language and Speech By construction, two states qi and q2 of Q can be reached by the same string u, lul &lt; 21(2112 &#8212; 1, if there exists c E K such that (qi
