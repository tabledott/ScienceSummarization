fferentiated constituency feature did not improve over baseline.
    Two individual finer-grained features (PP+ and AdvP=) yielded statistically significant gains up to .42 BLEU points, and feature combinations AP2, XP2 and all-labels2 yielded significant gains up to 1.03 BLEU points.
    XP2 and all-labels2 also improved significantly on the undifferentiated constituency feature, by .72 and 1.11 BLEU points, respectively.
    For MT06, Chiang&#8217;s original feature improved the baseline significantly &#8212; this is a new result using his feature, since he did not experiment with Arabic &#8212; as did our our IP=, PP=, and VP= conditions.
    Adding individual features PP+ and AdvP= yielded significant improvements up to 1.4 BLEU points over baseline, and in fact the improvement for individual feature AdvP= over Chiang&#8217;s undifferentiated constituency feature approaches significance (p &lt; .075).
    More important, several conditions combining features achieved statistically significant improvements
