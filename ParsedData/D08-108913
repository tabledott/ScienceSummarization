			Computing reordering scores during decoding with word-based3 and phrase-based models (Tillman, 2004) is trivial, since they only make use of localinformation to determine the orientation of a new in coming block bi.
			For a left-to-right ordering model, bi is scored based on its orientation with respect to bi?1.
			For instance, if bi has a swap orientation withrespect to the previous phrase in the current translation hypothesis, feature p(oi = S| . . .)
			becomes ac tive.
			Computing lexicalized reordering scores with the hierarchical model is more complex, since the model must identify contiguous blocks?monotone or swapping?that can be merged into hierarchical blocks.
