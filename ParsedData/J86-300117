rains the interpretation of expressions (and hence affects what a speaker says and how a hearer will interpret what is said).
    Not surprisingly, linguistic expressions are among the primary indicators of discourse segment boundaries.
    The explicit use of certain words and phrases (e.g., in the first place) and more subtle cues, such as intonation or changes in tense and aspect, are included in the repertoire of linguistic devices that function, wholly or in part, to indicate these boundaries (Grosz 1978a, Reichman-Adar 1984, Cohen 1983, Polanyi and Scha 1983, Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986).
    Reichman (1981) discusses some words that function in this way and coined the term clue words.
    We will use the term cue phrases to generalize on her observation as well as many others because each one of these devices cue the hearer to some change in the discourse structure.
    As discussed in Section 6, these linguistic boundary markers can be divided according to whether they explicitly indicate change
