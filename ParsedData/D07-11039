s exact test is often a practical method if a number of techniques are followed:1.
			approximating the logarithms of factorials using commonly available numerical approxima tions to the log gamma function,2.
			using a well-known recurrence for the hyperge ometic distribution, 3.
			noting that few terms usually need to be summed, and 4.
			observing that convergence is usually rapid.
			2.3 Significance pruning.
			The idea behind significance pruning of phrasetables is that not all of the phrase pairs in a phrasetable are equally supported by the data and that many of the weakly supported pairs could be removed because: 1.
			the chance of them occurring again might be low, and 2.
			their occurrence in the given corpus may be the result of an artifact (a combination of effects where several estimates artificially compensatefor one another).
			This concept is usually re ferred to as overfit since the model fits aspects of the training data that do not lead to improved prediction.
			Phrase pairs that cann
