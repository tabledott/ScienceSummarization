ween allomorphs.
    In work not discussed in this paper, I have explored the integration of minimum edit distance to an MDL account of allomorphy as well, and will discuss this material in future work.
    The fourth approach to morphology analysis is top-down, and seeks a globally optimal analysis of the corpus.
    This general approach is based on the insight that the number of letters in a list of words is greater than the number of letters in a list of the stems and affixes that are present in the original list.
    This is illustrated in Figure 1.
    This simple observation lends hope to the notion that we might be able to specify a relatively simple figure of merit independently of how we attempt to find analyses of particular data.
    This view, appropriately elaborated, is part of the minimum description length approach that we will discuss in detail in this paper.
    Kazakov (1997) presents an analysis in this fourth approach, using a straightforward measurement of the success of a morphological
