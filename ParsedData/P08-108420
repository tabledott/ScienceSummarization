gnments (i.e. possible abstract morpheme pairings and stray morpheme assignments).
    We also need to marginalize over all possible draws of the distributions A, E, and F from their respective Dirichlet process priors.
    We achieve these aims by performing Gibbs sampling.
    Sampling We follow (Neal, 1998) in the derivation of our blocked and collapsed Gibbs sampler.
    Gibbs sampling starts by initializing all random variables to arbitrary starting values.
    At each iteration, the sampler selects a random variable Xi, and draws a new value for Xi from the conditional distribution of Xi given the current value of the other variables: P(Xi|X_i).
    The stationary distribution of variables derived through this procedure is guaranteed to converge to the true joint distribution of the random variables.
    However, if some variables can be jointly sampled, then it may be beneficial to perform block sampling of these variables to speed convergence.
    In addition, if a random variable is not of direct int
