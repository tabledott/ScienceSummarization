rent ways in Table 1, as indicated by the placement of the '-' in the Segmentation column, while the word hn`im can be segmented in two different ways.
    In the next section, we adapt the parameter estimation and the searching algorithms for such uncertain output observation.
    In contrast to standard HMM, the output observations of the above morpheme-based HMM are ambiguous.
    We adapted Baum-Welch (Baum, 1972) and Viterbi (Manning and Schutze, 1999, 9.3.2) algorithms for such uncertain observation.
    We first formalize the output representation and then describe the algorithms.
    Output Representation The learning and searching algorithms of HMM are based on the output sequence of the underlying Markov process.
    For the case of a morpheme-based model, the output sequence is uncertain &#8211; we don&#8217;t see the emitted morphemes but the words they form.
    If, for instance, the Markov process emitted the morphemes b clm h nim, we would see two words (bclm hn`im) instead.
    In order to han
