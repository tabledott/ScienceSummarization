ugh this list starting at the top we can collect new word pairs.
    We do this is in a greedy fashion &#8211; once a word is assigned to a word pair, we do not look for another match.
    Table 2 gives the top 24 generated word pairs by this algorithm. ing words with most similar spelling in a greedy fashion.
    The applied measurement of spelling similarity does not take into account that certain letter changes (such as z to s, or dropping of the final e) are less harmful than others.
    Tiedemann [1999] explores the automatic construction of a string similarity measure that learns which letter changes occur more likely between cognates of two languages.
    This measure is trained, however, on parallel sentence-aligned text, which is not available here.
    Obviously, the vast majority of word pairs can not be collected this way, since their spelling shows no resemblance at all.
    For instance, Spiegel and mirror share only one vowel, which is rather accidental.
    If our monolingual corpora are compa
