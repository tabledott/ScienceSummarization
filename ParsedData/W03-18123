 certain degree of syntactic variation (e.g. the cat was let out of the bag).
    Finally, simple decomposable MWEs (also known as &#8220;institutionalised&#8221; MWEs, e.g. kindle excitement, traffic light) decompose into simplex senses and generally display high syntactic variability.
    What makes simple decomposable expressions true MWEs rather than productive word combinations is that they tend to block compositional alternates with the expected semantics (termed anticollocations by Pearce (2001b)).
    For example, motor car cannot be rephrased as *engine car or *motor automobile.
    Note that the existence of anticollocations is also a test for non-decomposable and idiosyncratically decomposable MWEs (e.g. hot dog vs. #warm dog or #hot canine).
    Our particular interest in decomposability stems from ongoing work on grammatical means for capturing MWEs.
    Nunberg et al. (1994) observed that idiosyncratically decomposable MWEs (in particular idioms) undergo much greater syntactic variation than non
