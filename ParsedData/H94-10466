  At the ARPA Human Language Technology Workshop in March 1993, Miller, Leacock, Tengi, and Bunker [7] described a semantic concordance that combines passages from the Brown Corpus [3] with the WordNet lexical d~t_~base [2] in such a way that every open-class word in the text (every noun, verb, adjective, or adverb) carries both a syntactic tag and a semantic tag pointing to the appropriate sense of that word in WordNet.
  The version of this semantic oncordance that existed in August 1993, incorporating 103 of the 500 passages in the Brown Corpus, was made publicly available, along with version 1.4 of WordNet o which the passages were tagged.
  1 Passages in the Brown Corpus are approximately 2,000 words long, and average approximately 1,000 open-class words each.
  Although this sample is much smaller than one would like, this semantic concordance does provide a basis for estimating sense frequencies for open-class words broken down by part of speech
