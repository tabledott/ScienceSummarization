otion of a stochastic lexicalized tree- adjoining rammar (SLTAG).
			We present an algorithm for computing the probability of a sentence generated by a SLTAG, and finally we introduce an iterative algo- r ithm for estimathlg the parameters of a SLTAG given a training corpus of text.
			This algorithm can either be used for refining the parameters of a SLTAG or for inferring a tree-adjoining grammar frmn a training cor- pus.
			We also report preliminary experiments with this algorithm.
			Due to the lack of space, in this paper tim algorithms are described succinctly without proofs of correctness and more attention is given to tile concepts and tech- niques used for SLTAG.
	
	
			hfformally speaking, SLTAGs are defined by assigning a probability to tile event that an elementary tree is combined (by adjunction or substitution) on a specific node of another elementary tree.
			These events of com- bination are the stochastic processes considered.
			Since SLTAG are defined on the basis of the deriva- tion and s
