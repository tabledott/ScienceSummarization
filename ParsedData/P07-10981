    Question processing is often centered on question classification, which selects one of k expected answer classes.
    Most accurate models apply supervised machine learning techniques, e.g.
    SNoW (Li and Roth, 2005), where questions are encoded using various lexical, syntactic and semantic features.
    The retrieval and answer extraction phases consist in retrieving relevant documents (Collins-Thompson et al., 2004) and selecting candidate answer passages from them.
    A further answer re-ranking phase is optionally applied.
    Here, too, the syntactic structure of a sentence appears to provide more useful information than a bag of words (Chen et al., 2006), although the correct way to exploit it is still an open problem.
    An effective way to integrate syntactic structures in machine learning algorithms is the use of tree kernel (TK) functions (Collins and Duffy, 2002), which have been successfully applied to question classification (Zhang and Lee, 2003; Moschitti, 2006) and other tasks, e.g. rel
