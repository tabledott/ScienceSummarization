ly important values: the derivation forest semiring computes all derivations of a sentence; the Viterbiderivation semiring computes the most probable derivation; and the Viterbi-n-best semiring computes the n most probable derivations.
    A derivation is simply a list of rules from the grammar.
    From a derivation, a parse tree can be derived, so the derivation forest semiring is analogous to conventional parse forests.
    Unlike the other semirings, all three of these semirings are noncommutative.
    The additive operation of these semirings is essentially union or maximum, while the multiplicative operation is essentially concatenation.
    These semirings are described in more detail in Section 2.5.
    A semiring parser requires an item-based description of the parsing algorithm, in the form given earlier.
    So far, we have skipped one important detail of semiring parsing.
    In a simple recognition system, as used in deduction systems, all that matters is whether an item can be deduced or not.
