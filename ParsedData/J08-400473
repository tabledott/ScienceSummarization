d high reliability (K = 0.81) for their three main zones (own, other, background), although lower for the whole scheme (K = 0.71).
    For intention-based segmentation, Passonneau and Litman (1993) in the pre-K days reported an overall percentage agreement with majority opinion of 89%, but the agreement on boundaries was only 70%.
    For conversational games segmentation, Carletta et al. (1997) reported &#8220;promising but not entirely reassuring agreement on where games began (70%),&#8221; whereas the agreement on transaction boundaries was K = 0.59.
    Exceptions are two segmentation efforts carried out as part of annotations of rhetorical structure.
    Moser, Moore, and Glendening (1996) achieved an agreement of K = 0.9 for the highest level of segmentation of their RDA annotation (Poesio, Patel, and Di Eugenio 2006).
    Carlson, Marcu, and Okurowski (2003) reported very high agreement over the identification of the boundaries of discourse units, the building blocks of their annotation of rhetorical s
