er, the subject, the verb, and its objects are all sisters of each other, dominated by an S node.
    This is a way of accounting for the semi-free wordorder of German (see Section 2.1): the first NP within an S need not be the subject.
    Another idiosyncrasy of Negra is that it assumes special coordinate categories.
    A coordinated sentence has the category CS, a coordinate NP has the category CNP, etc.
    While this does not make the annotation more flat, it substantially increases the number of non-terminal labels.
    Negra also contains grammatical function labels that augment phrasal and lexical categories.
    Example are MO (modifier), HD (head), SB (subject), and OC (clausal object).
  
  
    Lexicalization has been shown to improve parsing performance for the Penn Treebank (e.g., Carroll and Rooth 1998; Charniak 1997, 2000; Collins 1997).
    The aim of the present paper is to test if this finding carries over to German and to the Negra corpus.
    We therefore use an unlexicalized model as ou
