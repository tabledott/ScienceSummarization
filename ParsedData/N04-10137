 
    The grammar used for this experiment was developed in the ParGram project (Butt et al., 2002).
    It uses LFG as a formalism, producing c(onstituent)-structures (trees) and f(unctional)-structures (attribute value matrices) as output.
    The c-structures encode constituency and linear order.
    F-structures encode predicate-argument relations and other grammatical information, e.g., number, tense, statement type.
    The XLE parser was used to produce packed representations, specifying all possible grammar analyses of the input.
    In our system, tokenization and morphological analysis are performed by finite-state transductions arranged in a compositional cascade.
    Both the tokenizer and the morphological analyzer can produce multiple outputs.
    For example, the tokenizer will optionaly lowercase sentence initial words, and the morphological analyzer will produce walk +Verb +Pres +3sg and walk +Noun +Pl for the input form walks.
    The resulting tokenized and morphologically analyzed strings
