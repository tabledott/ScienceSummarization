			Similarly, ? ?
			 is the largest threshold that results in all of the 1-1-1 phrase pairs being included.
			Because 1-1-1 phrase pairs can make up a large part of the phrase table, this is important observation for its own sake.Since the contingency table with C(s?, t?)
			= 1 hav ing the greatest significance (lowest p-value) is the 1-1-1 table, using the threshold of ?+  can be used to exclude all of the phrase pairs occurring exactly once (C(s?, t?)
			= 1).The common strategy of deleting all of the 1 count phrase pairs is very similar in effect to the use of the ? +  threshold.
