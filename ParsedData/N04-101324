unct tends to be marked as the head of a coordination in Model 3 output, whereas the dependency bank has a more symmetric representation: it introduces a new COORD head and connects that up to the conjunction, and it uses a separate CONJ relation for each of the coordinated items.
    Similarly, Model 3 identifies the syntactic markers to and that as the heads of complements, whereas the dependency bank treats these as selectional features and marks the main predicate of the complements as the head.
    These adjustments are carried out without penalty.
    We also compensate for the differences in the representation of auxiliaries: Model 3 treats these as main verbs with embedded complements instead of the PERF, PROG, and PASSIVE features of the DEPBANK, and our conversion flattens the trees so that the features can be read off.
    The dependencies are read off after these and a few other adjustments are made.
    NPs under VPs are read off either as objects or adjuncts, depending on whether or not the NP i
