overall performance in a way that is sensitive to even a single error in any part of header or citation.
    Thus, we consider both word accuracy and average F-measure in evaluation.
    3.
    Whole instance accuracy: An instance here is defined to be a single header or reference.
    Whole instance accuracy is the percentage of instances in which every word is correctly labeled.
    We first report the overall results by comparing CRFs with HMMs, and with the previously best benchmark results obtained by SVMs (Han et al., 2003).
    We then break down the results to analyze various factors individually.
    Table 1 shows the results on dataset H with the best results in bold; (intro and page fields are not shown, following past practice (Seymore et al., 1999; Han et al., 2003)).
    The results we obtained with CRFs use secondorder state transition features, layout features, as well as supported and unsupported features.
    Feature induction is used in experiments on dataset R; (it didn&#8217;t improve acc
