f the source string using the syntactic parser based language model, is our best estimate of the probability of an analysis.
    However, there is one additional complication that makes a marked improvement to the model&#8217;s performance.
    Recall that we use the standard bottom-up dynamic programming TAG parsing algorithm to search for candidate parses.
    This algorithm has n5 running time, where n is the length of the string.
    Even though our sentences are often long, it is extremely unlikely that any repair will be longer than, say, 12 words.
    So to increase processing speed we only compute analyses for strings of length 12 or less.
    For every such substring that can be analyzed as a repair we calculate the repair odds, i.e., the probability of generating this substring as a repair divided by the probability of generating this substring via the non-repair rules, or equivalently, the odds that this substring constitutes a repair.
    The substrings with high repair odds are likely to be repai
