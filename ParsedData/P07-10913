221; are not constituents at all.
    In this paper, our interest is the value of syntax in reordering, and the major statement is that syntactic information is useful in handling global reordering The lines and nodes on the top half of the figures show the phrase structure of the Chinese sentences, while the links on the bottom half of the figures show the alignments between Chinese and English phrases.
    Square brackets indicate the boundaries of blocks found by our decoder. and it achieves better MT performance on the basis of the standard phrase-based model.
    To prove it, we developed a hybrid approach which preserves the strength of phrase-based SMT in local reordering as well as the strength of syntax in global reordering.
    Our method is inspired by previous preprocessing approaches like (Xia and McCord, 2004), (Collins et al., 2005), and (Costa-juss`a and Fonollosa, 2006), which split translation into two stages: where a sentence of the source language (SL), S, is first reordered with respect t
