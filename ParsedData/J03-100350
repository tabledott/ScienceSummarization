sed in model-theoretic semantics for modal logics.
    The advantage of looking at graphs such as that in Figure 3 as Kripke models is that we can use tools from modal logic to reason about these structures.
    For example, we can reformulate the problem of determining the content of a distinguishing description in terms of hybrid logic (see, e.g., Blackburn [2000]) as follows: @i&#981; &#8743; Aj(i =&#65533; j &#8212; _@j&#981;) In words: When we want to refer to vertex i, we are looking for that distinguishing formula &#981; that is true of (&#8220;at&#8221;) i but not of any j different from i.
    One advantage of this logical perspective is that logical properties that are not covered by most generation algorithms (such as not having a certain property; see van Deemter [2002]) fit in very well with this perspective.
  
  
    Planar graphs may be relevant for our current purposes, since subgraph isomorphism can be tested more efficiently on planar graphs than on arbitrary graphs.
    There are two ways
