ition to the intrinsic one, by utilizing the extracted or generated paraphrases to improve other applications such as machine translation (Callison-Burch, Koehn, and Osborne 2006) and others as described in Section 1.
    Another option when evaluating the quality of a paraphrase generation method is that of using automatic measures.
    The traditional automatic evaluation measures of precision and recall are not particularly suited to this task because, in order to use them, a list of reference paraphrases has to be constructed against which these measures may be computed.
    Given that it is extremely unlikely that any such list will be exhaustive, any precision and recall measurements will not be accurate.
    Therefore, other alternatives are needed.
    Since the evaluation of paraphrases is essentially the task of measuring semantic similarity or of paraphrase recognition, all of those metrics, including the ones discussed in Section 2, can be employed here.
    Most recently, Callison-Burch, Cohn, an
