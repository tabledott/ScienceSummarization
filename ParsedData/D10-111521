 independent-variable-to-training-item ratio will thus never be above 1/4.
    We adopt a leave-one-out training regime, so that each target AN is generated by an adjective matrix that was estimated from all the other ANs with the same adjective, minus the target.
    We use PLSR with 50 latent variables also for our re-implementation of Guevara&#8217;s (2010) single linear map (slm) approach, in which a single regression matrix is estimated for all ANs across adjectives.
    The training data in this case are given by the concatenation of the observed adjective and noun vectors (600 independent variables) coupled with the corresponding AN vectors (300 dependent variables).
    For each target AN, we randomly sample 2,000 other adjective-noun-AN tuples for training (with larger training sets we run into memory problems), and use the resulting coefficient matrix to generate the AN vector from the concatenated target adjective and noun vectors.
    Additive AN vectors (add method) are obtained by summing the co
