			Synonymy can be viewed as a high degree of semantic similarity.
			The most common way tomeasure semantic similarity is to measure the dis tance between words in WordNet (Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Hirst and St-Onge, 1998).
			Corpus-based measures of word similarityare also common (Lesk, 1969; Landauer and Du mais, 1997; Turney, 2001).We may view Table 4 as a binary classifica tion problem, in which the pair levied:imposed is a positive example of the class synonymous and the other possible pairings are negative examples, as shown in Table 5.
			Word pair Class label levied:imposed positive levied:believed negative levied:requested negative levied:correlated negative Table 5: How to fit a TOEFL question into the framework of supervised pair classification.
			The 80 TOEFL questions yield 320 (80 ? 4) word pairs, 80 labeled positive and 240 labelednegative.
			We apply PairClass to the word pairs us ing ten-fold cross-validation.
			In each random fold, 90% of the pairs are used for training
