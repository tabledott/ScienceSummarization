gh correct word translations to secure a sound adaptation process.
			But it can miss some informative translation words, which could lead to better-adapted language models.
			2.2.2 N-Best Hypothesis List as a Query Model Similar to the first-best hypothesis, the n-best hypothesis list is converted into a bag-of-words representation.
			Words which occurred in several translation hypotheses are simply repeated in the bag-of-words representations.
			}|),{( ),,;;,,( ,2,1,,12,11,1 1 TNiii lNNNlTN Vwfw wwwwwwQ N ?= = LLL where TNV is the combined vocabulary from all n best hypotheses and if is the frequency of iw ?s occurrence in the n-best hypothesis list.
			TNQ has several good characteristics: First it contains translation candidates, and thus is more informative than 1TQ . In addition, the confidently translated words usually occur in every hypothesis in the n-best list, therefore have a stronger impact on the retrieval result due to the higher term frequency (tf) in the query.
			Thirdly, most of the hypo
