indeed informative and complementary to shallow indicators.
    DFKI (R, S): &#8220;DFKI morphPOSibm1LM&#8221; (R) is a simple linear interpolation of POS 6-gram language model scores, morpheme 6-gram language model scores, IBM 1 scores (both &#8220;direct&#8221; and &#8220;inverse&#8221;) for POS 4-grams and for morphemes.
    The parallel News corpora from WMT10 is used as extra data to train the language model and the IBM 1 model.
    &#8220;DFKI cfsplsreg&#8221; and &#8220;DFKI grcfs-mars&#8221; (S) use a collection of 264 features generated containing the baseline features and additional resources.
    Numerous methods of feature selection were tested using 10-fold cross validation on the training data, reducing these to 23 feature sets.
    Several regression and (discretized) classification algorithms were employed to train prediction models.
    The best-performing models included features derived from PCFG parsing, language quality checking and LM scoring, of both source and target, besides features
