ombination method based on consensus network decoding seems to be very robust and yield good gains over the best single system even without any tunable weights.
    The decision of the skeleton is crucial.
    Minimum Bayes Risk decoding under translation edit rate was used to select the skeleton.
    Compared to the best possible skeleton decision &#8211; according to an oracle experiment &#8211; further gains might be obtained by using better decision approach.
    Also, the alignment may be improved by taking the target-to-source alignments into account and allowing synonyms to align.
    The confusion network decoding at the word level does not necessarily retain coherent phrases as no language model constraints are taken into account.
    LM re-scoring might alleviate this problem.
    This paper has provided evidence that outputs from six very different MT systems, tuned for two different evaluation metrics, may be combined to yield better outputs in terms of different evaluation metrics.
