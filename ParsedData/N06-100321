a is required to learn useful paraphrases.
    The scenario described in this paper was very favorable to creating high quality paraphrases.
    The large number of parallel corpora between Spanish and the other languages present in the Europarl corpus allowed us to generate high quality, in domain data.
    While this is a realistic scenario, in that many new official languages have been added to the European Union, some of which do not yet have extensive parallel corpora, we realize that this may be a slightly idealized scenario.
    Finally, we plan to formalize our targeted manual evaluation method, in the hopes of creating a evaluation methodology for machine translation that is more thorough and elucidating than Bleu.
  
  
    Thank you to Alexandra Birch and Stephanie Vandamme for creating the word alignments.
