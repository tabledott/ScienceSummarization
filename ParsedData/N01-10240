  Knowledge-Free Induction Of Inflectional Morphologies
  
    We propose an algorithm to automatically induce the morphology of inflectional languages using only text corpora and no human input.
    Our algorithm combines cues from orthography, semantics, and syntactic distributions to induce morphological relationships in German, Dutch, and English.
    Using CELEX as a gold standard for evaluation, we show our algorithm to be an improvement over any knowledge-free algorithm yet proposed.
  
  
    Many NLP tasks, such as building machine-readable dictionaries, are dependent on the results of morphological analysis.
    While morphological analyzers have existed since the early 1960s, current algorithms require human labor to build rules for morphological structure.
    In an attempt to avoid this labor-intensive process, recent work has focused on machine-learning approaches to induce morphological structure using large corpora.
    In this paper, we propose a knowledge-free algorithm to automatically ind
