truct all possible RS trees based on those facts.
    It is not clear how the best such tree is selected, though clearly the adjacency and order constraints-could in principle be reapplied in some way (possibly with other heuristics that Marcu has used in rhetorical parsing) to select a tree.
    We are interested in further developing the ideas of Marcu, but seek to address the following problems: and having weighted constraints seems to make matters worse.
    Enumerating all RS trees that can be built on a given sequence of facts also has combinatorical problems.
    Marcu's approach may not be much better than one that builds all possible trees.
    Yet if there are enough relations to link any pair of facts (which, given the existence of elaboration, may often be nearly the case), the number of trees whose top nucleus are a specified -fact grows from 336 to 5040 to 95040 as the number of facts grows from 5 to 6 to 7.
    In our examples, we have more like 20-30 facts.

    As Marcu points out, the
