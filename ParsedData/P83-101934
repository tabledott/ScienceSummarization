    If this is an appropriate model, then the elements which are self-corrected should be exactly those elements that xist at some stage in the generation process.
    Thus, we should be able to find evidence for the units involved in generation by looking at the data of self-correction.
    And indeed, such evidence should be available to the language learner as well.
  
  
    I have described the nature of self-corrected speech (which is a major source of spoken non-fluencies) and how it can be resolved by simple editing rules within the context of a deterministic parser.
    Two features are essential to the self-correction system: 1) every self-correction site (whether it results in the expunction of words or not) is marked by a phonetically identifiable signal placed at the right edge of the potential expunction site; and 2) the expunged part is the left-hand member of a pair of copies, one on each side of the editing signal.
    The copies may be of three types: 1) identical surface
