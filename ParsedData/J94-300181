rologue above as Intro(m U {O}).
    We now augment that definition: We have composed an additional relation that introduces the boundary marker at the beginning and end of the already freely bracketed string, and also rejects strings containing the boundary marker somewhere in the middle.
    The net effect is that strings in the cascade below the Prologue are boundary-marked; bracketed images of the original input strings and the context identifiers can thus properly detect the edges of those strings.
    The inverse Prologue at the bottom of the cascade removes the boundary marker along with the other auxiliary symbols.
    It remains to model the application of a set of rules collected together in a single batch.
    Recall that for each position in the input string each rule in a batch set is considered for application independently.
    As we have seen several times before, there is a straightforward approach that approximates this behavior.
    Let {R1, , Rn} be the set of regular relations for rules t
