m that employs manual feature selection: for each classifier/data set combination, we discard features used primarily to induce low-precision rules for common noun resolution and re-train the coreference classifier using the reduced feature set.
    Here, feature selection does not depend on a separate development corpus and is guided solely by inspection of the features associated with low-precision rules induced from the training data.
    In current work, we are automating this feature selection process, which currently employs a fair amount of user discretion, e.g. to determine a precision cut-off.
    Features in the hand-selected set for at least one of the tested system variations are *&#8217;d in Tables 1 and 3.
    In general, we hypothesized that the handselected features would reclaim precision, hopefully without losing recall.
    For the most part, the experimental results support this hypothesis.
