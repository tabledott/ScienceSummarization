 experiment by Kaplan (1950) attempted to answer this question at least in part, by presenting ambiguous words in their original context and in a variant context providing one or two words on either side to seven translators.
    Kaplan observed that sense resolution given two words on either side of the word was not significantly better or worse than when given the entire sentence.
    The same phenomenon has been reported by several researchers since Kaplan's work appeared: e.g., Masterman (1962), Koutsoudas and Korthage (1956) on Russian, and Gougenheim and Michea (1961) and Choueka and Lusignan (1985) on French.
    Reifler 's (1955) &amp;quot;semantic coincidences&amp;quot; between a word and its context quickly became the determining factor in WSD.
    The complexity of the context, and in particular the role of syntactic relations, was also recognized; for example, Reifler (1955) says: Grammatical structure can also help disambiguate, as, for instance, the word keep, which can be disambiguated by deter
