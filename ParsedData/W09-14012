difference in focus is motivated in part by different applications envisioned as being supported by the IE methods.
    For example, BioCreative aims to support curation of PPI databases such as MINT (Chatr-aryamontri et al., 2007), for a long time one of the primary tasks of bioinformatics.
    The BioNLP task aims to support the development of more detailed and structured databases, e.g. pathway (Bader et al., 2006) or Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) (Camon et al., 2004) databases, which are gaining increasing interest in bioinformatics research in response to recent advances in molecular biology.
    As the first shared task of its type, the BioNLP task aimed to define a bounded, well-defined bioevent extraction task, considering both the actual needs and the state of the art in bio-TM technology and to pursue it as a community-wide effort.
    The key challenge was in finding a good balance between the utility and the feasibility of the task, which was also limited by the resources available.
