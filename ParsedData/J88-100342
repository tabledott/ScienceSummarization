 a given 'whole problem' can be solved if the values of the best solutions of certain subproblems can be determined.
    .

    ; and secondly, the realization that if one starts at or near the end of the 'whole problem,' the subproblems are so simple as to have trivial solutions&amp;quot; (Dreyfus and Law (1977), p. 5).
    Dynamic Programming is closely related to the study of Graph Theory and of Network Optimization, and can lead to rapid solutions for otherwise intractable problems, given that those problems obey certain structural constraints.
    In this case, the constraints are indeed obeyed, and a linear-time solution is available.
    Consider a span of length n = 5, with the words in the path denoted by v, w, x, y, z.
    Assume that v and z are the unambiguous bounding words, and that the other three words are each three ways ambiguous.
    Subscripts will index the various tags for each word: w1 will denote the first tag in the set of possible tags for word w. Every path must contain v1 and
