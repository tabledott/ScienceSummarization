h when there is a x-th seed word which co-occurs with it significantly often.
    If a pair of bilingual words are supposed to be translations of each other, they should share the most significant y values.
    In this case, the Cosine Measure would be more appropriate where: CEl&lt;i&lt;n(W.s, &amp;quot; = VEW82.
    - Ewq The Cosine Measure will give the highest value to vector pairs which share the most non-zero y values.
    Therefore, it favors word pairs which share the most number of closely related seed words.
    However, the Cosine Measure is also directly proportional to another parameter, namely the actual (w,, x wt,) values.
    Consequently, if w, has a high y value everywhere, then the Cosine Measure between any tot and this w, would be high.
    This violates our assumptions in that although w, and wt might not correlate closely with the same set of seed words, the matching score would be nevertheless high.
    This is another supporting reason for choosing mid-frequency content words as seed
