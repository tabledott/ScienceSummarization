algorithm (it has a polynomial complexity), but Dale and Reiter (1995, page 248) also claim that it is &#8220;psychologically realistic.&#8221; They point out that sometimes people may describe an object as &#8220;the white bird&#8221; even though the simpler &#8220;the bird&#8221; would have been sufficient (cf.
    Pechmann [1989]; see, however, Krahmer and Theune [2002] for discussion).
    Even though there are various useful and interesting algorithms for the generation of referring expressions, a number of open questions remain.
    Recently there has been an increased interest in statistical approaches to natural language generation.
    For example, Malouf (2000) has shown that large corpora can be used to determine the order of realization of sequences of prenominal adjectives.
    It is unclear how such statistical work on generation can be combined with older, rule-based work such as the algorithms just discussed.
    In addition, many algorithms still have difficulties with the generation of relat
