corpus corresponding to segments having relatively coherent communicative goals.
    Before making concluding remarks on part two of our study, we mention a few questions for future work on segmentation.
    We believe our results confirm the utility of abstracting from the responses of relatively many naive subjects (our method), and indicate a strong potential for developing coding protocols using smaller numbers of trained coders (as in Nakatani, Hirschberg, and Grosz [1995], and Hirschberg and Nakatani [19961).
    The use of an even larger number of naive subjects might yield a finer-grained set of segments (cf.
    Rotondo [1984], Swerts, [1995]).
    This is an important dimension of difference between the two sets of segments we use: segments identified by a minimum of four subjects are larger and fewer in number than those identified by a minimum of three.
    In addition, performance can be improved by taking into account that some segment boundary locations may be relatively fuzzy, as we discuss in
