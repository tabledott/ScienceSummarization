all salience of the COREF, since the new member will minimally satisfy SENT-S and CNTX-S.
			Salience is not stable, however: in order to realisti- cally represent the local prominence of discourse ref- erents in a text, a decay function is built into the algo- rithm, so that salience weight decreases over time.
			If new members are not added, the salience weight of a COREF eventually reduces to zero.
			The consequence of this variability in salience is that a very general heuris- tic for anaphora resolution is established: resolve a pronoun to the most salient candidate antecedent.
			2.2.3 Interpretation As noted above, in terms of overall strategy, the resolu- tion procedure follows that of Lappin and Leass.
			The first step in interpreting the discourse referents in a new sentence isto decrease the salience weights of the COREF classes that have already been established by a factor of two.
			Next, the algorithm locates all non-anaphoric dis- course referents in the sentence under consideration, genera
