ry of semantic composition, (2) the notion of semantic well-formedness mentioned above, and (3) an appeal to several levels of interpretation in the semantics (Scha 1983).
    Thirdly, and related to the point above, the lexicon is not just verbs.
    Recent work has done much to clarify the nature of verb classes and the syntactic constructions that each allows (Levin 1985, 1989).
    Yet it is not clear whether we are any closer to understanding the underlying nature of verb meaning, why the classes develop as they do, and what consequences these distinctions have for the rest of the lexicon and grammar.
    The curious thing is that there has been little attention paid to the other lexical categories (but see Miller and Johnson-Laird [1976], Miller and Fellbaum [1991], and Fass [1988]).
    That is, we have little insight into the semantic nature of adjectival predication, and even less into the semantics of nominals.
    Not until all major categories have been studied can we hope to arrive at a balanced
