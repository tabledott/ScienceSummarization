ex The NYSE s composite index The NYSE s composite index The NYSE s composite index &amp;quot;the NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks and respectively replaced by: &amp;quot;blue chip stocks,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;air traffic controllers,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the broader market in the NYSE advancing issues.&amp;quot; Thus stage 2 produces n-word collocations from two-word associations.
    Producing n-word collocations has already been done (e.g., Choueka 1988).&amp;quot; The general method used by Choueka is the following: for each length n, (1 &lt;n &lt;6), produce all the word sequences of length n and sort them by frequency.
    On a 12 million&#8212;word corpus, Choueka retrieved 10 collocations of length six, 115 collocations of length five, 1,024 collocations of length four, 4,777 of length three, and some 15,973 of length two.
    The threshold imposed was 14.
    The method we presented in this section has three main advantages when compared to a straight n-gram method like Chouek
