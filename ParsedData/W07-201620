			These numbers are shown in the bottom half of the two tables.
			Theseresults are not directly comparable to the CoNLL 2005 shared task since: i) this test set comprisesSections 01, 22, 23 and 24 as opposed to just Sec tion 23, and ii) this test set comprises data for only 50 predicates as opposed to all the verb predicates in the CoNLL-2005 shared task.
	
	
			The results in the previous discussion seem to confirm the hypothesis that there is a predictable correlation between human annotator agreement and sys tem performance.
			Given high enough ITA rates we can can hope to build sense disambiguation systemsthat perform at a level that might be of use to a con suming natural language processing application.
			Itis also encouraging that the more informative Verb Net roles which have better/direct ap
