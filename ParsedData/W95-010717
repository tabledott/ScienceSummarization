hunks, we use the chunk tag set {BN, N, By, V, P}, where BN marks the first word and N the succeeding words in an N-type group while BV and V play the same role for V-type groups.
    Punctuation marks, which are ignored in Abney's chunk grammar, but which the Treebank data treats as normal- lexical items with their own part-of-speech tags, are unambiguously assigned the chunk tag P. Items tagged P are allowed to appear within N or V chunks; they are irrelevant as far as chunk boundaries are concerned, but they are still available to be matched against as elements of the left hand sides of rules.
    Encoding chunk structure with tags attached to words rather than non-recursive bracket markers inserted between words has the advantage that it limits the dependence between different elements of the encoded representation.
    While brackets must be correctly paired in order to derive a chunk structure, it is easy to define a mapping that can produce a valid chunk structure from any sequence of chunk tags; the f
