sed model.
    The decision sequence (d1... dn) is defined as the sequence of rule expansions in a top-down, leftmost derivation of the tree.
    The history is equivalent to a partially built tree, and F picks out the nonterminal being expanded (i.e., the leftmost nonterminal in the fringe of this tree), making the assumption that P(diId1... di-1) depends only on the nonterminal being expanded.
    In the resulting model a tree with rule expansions Our base model, that of Collins (1999), is also a history-based model.
    It can be considered to be a type of PCFG, where the rules are lexicalized.
    An example rule would be Lexicalization leads to a very large number of rules; to make the number of parameters manageable, the generation of the right-hand side of a rule is broken down into a number of decisions, as follows: 2 To be more precise, generative probabilistic models assign joint probabilities P(x,y) to each (x,y) pair.
    Similar arguments apply to conditional history-based models, which define co
