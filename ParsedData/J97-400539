an be seen as a method for sampling from the distribution q in which q(H) = 1/2, q(T) = 1/2.
    Saying that a corpus is representative is actually not a comment about the corpus itself but the method by which it was generated: a corpus representative of distribution q is one generated by a process that samples from q.
    Saying that a process M samples from q is to say that the empirical distributions of corpora generated by M converge to q in the limit.
    For example, if we flip a fair coin once, the resulting empirical distribution over (H, T) is either (1,0) or (0, 1), not the fair-coin distribution (1/2, 1/2).
    But as we take larger and larger corpora, the resulting empirical distributions converge to (1/2, 1/2).
    An advantage of SCFGs that random fields lack is the transparent relationship between an SCFG defining a distribution q and a sampler for q.
    We can sample from q by performing stochastic derivations: each time we have a choice among rules expanding a category X, we choose rule X wi
