sion within weakly supervised learning, between the need to bootstrap accurate labeled data, and the need to cover the desired task.
    We evaluate one approach, using corrected co-training, to resolving this tension; and as another approach, we suggest combining weakly supervised learning with active learning (Cohn et al., 1994).
    The next section of this paper introduces issues and concerns surrounding co-training.
    Sections 3 and 4 describe the base noun phrase bracketing task, and the application of cotraining to the task, respectively.
    Section 5 contains an evaluation of co-training for base noun identification.
  
  
    The co-training paradigm applies when accurate classification hypotheses for a task can be learned from either of two sets of features of the data, each called a view.
    For example, Blum and Mitchell (1998) describe a web page classification task, in which the goal is to determine whether or not a given web page is a university faculty member's home page.
    For this task
