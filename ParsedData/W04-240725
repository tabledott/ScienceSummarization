able 5 gives labeled precision, labeled recall and unlabeled attachment scorefor four of the most important types with the MBL lex ical model.
			The results indicate that subjects have the highest accuracy, especially when labels are taken intoaccount.
			Objects and predicative complements have comparable attachment accuracy, but are more often misclas sified with respect to dependency type.
			For adverbial modifiers, finally, attachment accuracy is lower than for the other dependency types, which is largely due to the notorious PP-attachment problem.
	
	
			In this paper we have shown that a combination of memory-based learning and deterministic dependency parsing can be used to construct a robust and efficient parser for unrestricted natural language text, achieving a parsing accuracy which is close to the state of the art evenwith relatively limited amounts of training data.
			Clas sifiers based on memory-based learning achieve higher parsing accuracy than previous probabilistic models, and the improve
