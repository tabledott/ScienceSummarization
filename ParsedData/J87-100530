 the wff, is a simple consequence of this restriction.
    The versions of the algorithm given in Appendices A and B define the functions applicable-term and applicable-terms in this way.
    Given this definition, the algorithm can be shown never to generate unbound variables.
    (See Appendix C.) A full discussion of heuristic rules for guiding generation of quantifier scopings is outside of the aims of this paper.
    However, certain ordering heuristics can be incorporated relatively easily into the algorithm merely by controlling the way in which nondeterministic choices are made.
    We discuss a few examples here, merely to give the flavor for how such heuristics might be added.
    For instance, suppose we want to favor the original left-to-right order in the sentence.
    The function applicable-terms should return the complex terms in right-to-left order, since quantifiers are extracted from the inside out.
    The union in line (3) should return form after scopedforms.
