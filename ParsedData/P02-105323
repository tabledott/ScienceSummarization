f the parts; thus the accuracy on movie reviews is about 66%.
    On the other hand, for banks and automobiles, it seems that the whole is the sum of the parts, and the accuracy is 80% to 84%.
    Travel reviews are an intermediate case.
    Previous work on determining the semantic orientation of adjectives has used a complex algorithm that does not readily extend beyond isolated adjectives to adverbs or longer phrases (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997).
    The simplicity of PMI-IR may encourage further work with semantic orientation.
    The limitations of this work include the time required for queries and, for some applications, the level of accuracy that was achieved.
    The former difficulty will be eliminated by progress in hardware.
    The latter difficulty might be addressed by using semantic orientation combined with other features in a supervised classification algorithm.
