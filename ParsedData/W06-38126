 Figure 2 illustrates how a small unweighted graph is clustered into two regions in three iterations.
    Different classes are symbolized by different shades of grey.
    It is possible to introduce a random mutation rate that assigns new classes with a probability decreasing in the number of iterations as described in (Biemann &amp; Teresniak 2005).
    This showed having positive effects for small graphs because of slower convergence in early iterations.
    The CW algorithm cannot cross component boundaries, because there are no edges between nodes belonging to different components.
    Further, nodes that are not connected by any edge are discarded from the clustering process, which possibly leaves a portion of nodes unclustered.
    Formally, CW does not converge, as figure 3 exemplifies: here, the middle node&#8217;s neighborhood consists of a tie which can be decided in assigning the class of the left or the class of the right nodes in any iteration all over again.
    Ties, however, do not play a maj
