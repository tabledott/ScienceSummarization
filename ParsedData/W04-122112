current state of the art, while using semantic lexicons (as presented here) do not positively affect performance.$ While the system presented here shows promise, there is still much to be explored.
    Richer syntactic information such as shallow parsing may be useful.
    The method introduced in section 3.2 to generate semantic keywords can also be adapted to generate features for entityspecific morphology (e.g. affixes) and context, both linearly (e.g. neighboring words) and hierarchically (e.g. from a parse).
    Most interesting, though, might be to investigate why the lexicons do not generally help.
    One explanation is simply an issue of tokenization.
    While one abstract refers to &#8220;IL12,&#8221; others may write &#8220;IL-12&#8221; or &#8220;IL 12.&#8221; Similarly, the generalization of entities to groups (e.g.
    &#8220;x antibody&#8221; vs. &#8220;x antibodies&#8221;) can cause problems for these rigid lexicons that require exact matching.
