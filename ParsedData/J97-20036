lgorithm to minimize sequential transducers that has a complexity equivalent to that of classical automata minimization and that is very efficient in practice.
    Under certain restrictions, the minimization of sequential string-to-weight transducers can also be performed using the determinization algorithm.
    We describe the corresponding algorithm and give the proof of its correctness in the appendix.
    We have used most of these algorithms in speech processing.
    In the last section, we describe some applications of determinization and minimization of string-to-weight transducers in speech recognition, illustrating them with several results that show them to be very efficient.
    Our implementation of the determinization is such that it can be used on the fly: only the necessary part of the transducer needs to be expanded.
    This plays an important role in the space and time efficiency of speech recognition.
    The reduction in the size of word lattices that these algorithms provide sheds new li
