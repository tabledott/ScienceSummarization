al disagreement.
    All four of the possible combinations of total disagreement were observed, but the two most common combinations were BCU (bridging, coreferential, and unfamiliar) and BLU (bridging, larger situation, and unfamiliar); all six combinations of partial disagreements were also observed.
    As we do not have the space to discuss each case in detail, we will concentrate on pointing out what we take to be the most interesting observations, especially from the perspective of designing a corpus annotation scheme for anaphoric expressions.
    We found very few true mistakes.
    We had some problems due to the presence of idioms such as they had to pick up the slack or on the whole.
    But in general, most of the disagreements were due to genuine problems in assigning a unique classification to definite descriptions.
    The mistakes that our annotators did make were of the form exemplified by (22).
    In this case, all three annotators indicate the same antecedent (the potential payoff) for the
