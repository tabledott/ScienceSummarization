okens will be linked, regardless of whether they are mutual translations.
    Since T is constant over all word types, it also represents the probability that an arbitrary co-occurring pair of word tokens are mutual translations.
    Therefore, A can also be estimated empirically.
    Let K be the total number of links in the bitext and let N be the total number of co-occuring word token pairs: K = Equating the right-hand sides of Equations (3) and (4) and rearranging the terms, we get: Since r is now a function of A+ and A-, only the latter two variables represent degrees of freedom in the model.
    The probability function expressed by Equations 1 and 2 has many local maxima.
    In practice, these local maxima are like pebbles on a mountain, invisible at low resolution.
    We computed Equation 1 over various combinations of A+ and A- after the model's first iteration over 300000 aligned sentence pairs from the Canadian Hansard bitext.
    Figure 4 shows that the region of interest in the parameter space,
