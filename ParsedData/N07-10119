or and Zenios, 1997).
    Additionally, we average the parameters calculated at each iteration to improve convergence.
    We refer to the system described in this section as First-Order MIRA.
  
  
    In this section, we describe the Pairwise and FirstOrder models in terms of the factor graphs they approximate.
    For the Pairwise Model, a corresponding undirected graphical model can be defined as where Zx is the input-dependent normalizer and factor fc parameterizes the pairwise noun phrase compatibility as fc(yij, xij) = exp(Ek &#955;kfk(yij, xij)).
    Factor ft enforces the transitivity constraints by ft(&#183;) = &#8722;oc if transitivity is not satisfied, 1 otherwise.
    This is similar to the model presented in McCallum and Wellner (2005).
    A factor graph for the Pairwise Model is presented in Figure 2 for three noun phrases.
    For the First-Order model, an undirected graphical model can be defined as where Zx is the input-dependent normalizer and factor fc parameterizes the cluster-wise noun
