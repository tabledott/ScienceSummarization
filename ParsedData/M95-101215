 are evaluated by invoking a Lisp procedure.
  There are several reasons for keeping this rule languag e simple.
  In the case of hand-crafted rules, it facilitates the process of designing a rule sequence.
  In the case of machine-learned rules, it restricts the size of the search space on each epoch of the learning regimen, thus making it tractable.
  In either case, the overall processing power derives as much from the fact that the rule s are sequenced, and feed each other in turn, as it does from the expressiveness of the rule language.
  144 To make this clearer, consider a simple named entity rule that Is applied to identifying persons.
