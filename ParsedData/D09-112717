Chinese, but get discouraging accuracy results learned from those projected trees.
    Following this idea, Ganchev et al. (2009) and Smith and Eisner (2009) use constrained EM and parser adaptation techniques, respectively, to perform more principled projection, and both achieve encouraging results.
    Our work, by constrast, never uses bilingual tree pairs not tree projections, and only uses word alignment alone to enhance a monolingual grammar, which learns to prefer target-side contiguity.
  
  
    We implement our baseline monolingual parser (in C++) based on the shift-reduce algorithm in Section 2, with feature templates from Table 2.
    We evaluate its performance on the standard Penn English Treebank (PTB) dependency parsing task, i.e., train on sections 02-21 and test on section 23 with automatically assigned POS tags (at 97.2% accuracy) using a tagger similar to Collins (2002), and using the headrules of Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) for conversion into dependency trees.
    We use section 22 as de
