ROGRAMMAR [Winograd, 72], ATNs [Woods, 74 and DIALOGIC [Grosz, et al., 821 are but a few of the better-known examples.
    Furthermore, a trend has arisen recently in linguistics towards declarativeness in grammar formalisms&#8212;for instance, lexical-functional grammar (LFG) [Bresnan, 831, generalized phrase-structure grammar (GPSG) fGazdar and Pullum, 82] and functional unification grammar (UG) [Kay, 83].
    Finally, in computer science there has been a great deal of interest in declarative languages (e.g., logic programming and specification languages), and their supporting denotational semantics.
    But to our knowledge, no attempt has yet been made to combine the three approaches so as to yield a declarative computer language with clear semantics designed specifically for encoding linguistic information.
    Such a language, of which PATR-II is an example, would reflect a felicitous convergence of ideas from linguistics, artificial intelligence, and computer science.
