 subtree corresponding to each of the stop words: this, is, and for. c) if the token is an English language word, we map the word to its part-of-speech tag, calculate the prior polarity of the word using the procedure described in section 5 and add the subtree (EW (&#8216;POS&#8217; &#8216;word&#8217; &#8216;prior polarity&#8217;)) to the &#8220;ROOT&#8221;.
    For example, we add the subtree (EW (JJ great POS)) for the word great.
    &#8220;EW&#8221; refers to English word. d) For any other token &lt;token&gt; we add subtree &#8220;(NE (&lt;token&gt;))&#8221; to the &#8220;ROOT&#8221;.
    &#8220;NE&#8221; refers to non-English.
    The PT tree kernel creates all possible subtrees and compares them to each other.
    These subtrees include subtrees in which non-adjacent branches become adjacent by excising other branches, though order is preserved.
    In Figure 1, we show some of the tree fragments that the PT kernel will attempt to compare with tree fragments from other trees.
    For example, given the
