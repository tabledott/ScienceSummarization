(s): From these formulae, the conditional expectation of a feature-function fi can be computed from a chart with root node r for a sentence y in the following way: Formula 5 is used in our system to compute expectations for discriminative Bayesian estimation from partially labeled data using a first-order conjugate-gradient routine.
    For a more detailed description of the optimization problem and the feature-functions we use for stochastic LFG parsing see Riezler et al. (2002).
    We also employed a combined i1 regularization and feature selection technique described in Riezler and Vasserman (2004) that considerably speeds up estimation and guarantees small feature sets for stochastic disambiguation.
    In the experiments reported in this paper, however, dynamic programming is crucial for efficient stochastic disambiguation, i.e. to efficiently find the most probable parse from a packed parse forest that is annotated with feature-values.
    There are two operations involved in stochastic disambiguation,
