unctive node as the product of the weights of all its descendant disjunctive nodes and of its own weight: Keeping a trace of the maximally weighted choices in a computaton of the weight Or of the root conjunctive node r allows us to efficiently recover the most probable parse of a sentence from the packed representation of its parses.
    The same formulae can be employed for an efficient calculation of probabilistic expectations of featurefunctions for the statistical estimation of the parameters &#955;.
    Replacing the maximization in equation 1 by a summation defines the inside weight of disjunctive node.
    Correspondingly, equation 2 denotes the inside weight of a conjunctive node.
    The outside weight &#968;c of a conjunctive node is defined as the outside weight of its disjunctive mother node(s): The outside weight of a disjunctive node is the sum of the product of the outside weight(s) of its conjunctive mother(s), the weight(s) of its mother(s), and the inside weight(s) of its disjunctive sister
