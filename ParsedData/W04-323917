ords kernel and tree kernel according to their F-measure in 5-fold cross validation.
    Although there exist some extensions for tree kernel (Kashima and Koyanagi, 2002), we use the original tree kernel by Collins (Collins and Duffy, 2002), where all subtrees of a tree are used as distinct features.
    This setting yields a fair comparison in terms of feature space.
    To extend a binary classifier to a multi-class classifier, we use the one-vs-rest method.
    Hyperparameters, such as number of iterations K in Boosting and soft-margin parameter C in SVMs were selected by using cross-validation.
    We implemented SVMs with tree kernel based on TinySVM5 with custom kernels incorporated therein.
    Table 1 summarizes the results of PHS and MOD tasks.
    To examine the statistical significance of the results, we employed a McNemar&#8217;s paired test, a variant of the sign test, on the labeling disagreements.
    This table also includes the results of significance tests.
