y cost.
    The PROBING model is 2.4 times as fast as the fastest alternative, SRILM, and uses less memory too.
    The TRIE model uses less memory than the smallest lossless alternative and is still faster than SRILM.
    These performance gains transfer to improved system runtime performance; though we focused on Moses, our code is the best lossless option with cdec and Joshua.
    We attain these results using several optimizations: hashing, custom lookup tables, bit-level packing, and state for left-to-right query patterns.
    The code is opensource, has minimal dependencies, and offers both C++ and Java interfaces for integration.
  
  
    Alon Lavie advised on this work.
    Hieu Hoang named the code &#8220;KenLM&#8221; and assisted with Moses along with Barry Haddow.
    Adam Pauls provided a pre-release comparison to BerkeleyLM and an initial Java interface.
    Nicola Bertoldi and Marcello Federico assisted with IRSTLM.
    Chris Dyer integrated the code into cdec.
