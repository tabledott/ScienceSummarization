 and Schwartz 1991) characterization of the MONEY IS A LIQUID metaphor: The Master Metaphor List also describes INVESTMENTS ARE CONTAINERS FOR MONEY, as exemplified in the following: CorMet has found mappings that can reasonably be construed as corresponding to these metaphors.
    Compare the mappings from the Master Metaphor List with frames mined by this system and identified as instantiating liquid &#8594; income, shown in Table 10.
    It is important to note that although CorMet can list the case frames that have driven the derivation of a particular high-level mapping, it is designed to discover highlevel mappings, not interpret or even recognize particular instances of metaphorical language.
    Just as in the Master Metaphor List, there are frames in the CorMet listing in which money and equities are characterized as liquids, are moved as liquids (i.e., pouring earnings and pumping reserves) and change state as liquids (i.e., melting stocks, dissolving stakes, evaporating profits, frozen money).
