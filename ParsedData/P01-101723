at this is almost certainly a progressive verb.
    It is much harder to determine this about UNK.4 Secondly, while punctuation is not to be found in speech, prosody should give us something like equivalent information, perhaps even better.
    Thus significantly better parser performance on speechderived data seems possible, suggesting that highperformance trigram-less language models may be within reach.
    We believe that the adaptation of prosodic information to parsing use is a worthy topic for future research.
    Finally, we have noted two objections to immediate-head language models: first, they complicate left-to-right search (since heads are often to the right of their children) and second, they cannot be tightly integrated with trigram models.
    The possibility of trigram-less language models makes the second of these objections without force.
    Nor do we believe the first to be a permanent disability.
    If one is willing to provide sub-optimal probability estimates as one proceeds left-to-r
