 under 0(eij, fkl) derived from the Moses pipeline (Koehn et al., 2007).5 Table 1 shows that finding the optimal phrase alignment is accurate and efficient.6 Hence, this simple search technique effectively addresses the intractability challenges inherent in evaluating new phrase alignment ideas.
    The objective function is log 0(a) for a implied by {ai,j,k,l = 1}.
    Constraint equation 1 ensures that the English phrases form a partition of e &#8211; each word in e appears in exactly one phrase &#8211; as does equation 2 for f. Constraint equation 3 ensures that each phrase in the chosen partition of e appears in exactly one link, and that phrases not in the partition are not aligned (and likewise constraint 4 for f).
