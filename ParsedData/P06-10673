 measuring word order similarity (or differences) between any given pair of languages based on word alignments as described in Section 3.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 presents a review of related work.
    In Section 3 we propose a method for measuring the distortion between any given pair of languages.
    In Section 4, we present our proposed distortion model.
    In Section 5, we present some empirical results that show the utility of our distortion model for statistical machine translation systems.
    Then, we conclude this paper with a discussion in Section 6.
  
  
    Different languages have different word order requirements.
    SMT decoders attempt to generate translations in the proper word order by attempting many possible word reorderings during the translation process.
    Trying all possible word reordering is an NP-Complete problem as shown in (Knight, 1999), which makes searching for the optimal solution among all possible permutations computationally int
