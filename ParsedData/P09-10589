nally, we obtain the artificial unknown words that combine the unidentified unknown words in cross validation and infrequent words for learning unknown words.
    We refer to this approach as the error-driven policy.
  
  
    Let Yt = {yt , ... , yKt &#65533; be a lattice consisting of candidate paths for a given sentence xt.
    In the word-character hybrid model, the lattice Yt can contain more than 1000 nodes, depending on the length of the sentence xt and the number of POS tags in the corpus.
    Therefore, we require a learning algorithm that can efficiently handle large and complex lattice structures.
    Online learning is an attractive method for the hybrid model since it quickly converges Algorithm 1 Generic Online Learning Algorithm Input: Training set S = {(xt, yt)}Tt&#65533;1 Output: Model weight vector w within a few iterations (McDonald, 2006).
    Algorithm 1 outlines the generic online learning algorithm (McDonald, 2006) used in our framework.
    We focus on an online learning algorithm call
