, was divided into four sections and the word immediately following the interregnum also appears in a (different) rough copy, then we say that the interregnum word token appears in a rough copy.
    This permits us to approximate the Switchboard annotation convention of annotating interregna as EDITED if they appear in iterated edits.
    (or subcorpora).
    The training subcorpus consists of all files in the directories 2 and 3 of the parsed/merged Switchboard corpus.
    Directory 4 is split into three approximately equal-size sections.
    (Note that the files are not consecutively numbered.)
    The first of these (files sw4004.mrg to sw4153.mrg) is the testing corpus.
    All edit detection and parsing results reported herein are from this subcorpus.
    The files sw4154.mrg to sw4483.mrg are reserved for future use.
    The files sw4519.mrg to sw4936.mrg are the development corpus.
    In the complete corpus three parse trees were sufficiently ill formed in that our tree-reader failed to read them.
