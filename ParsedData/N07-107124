ther than step the values by 10% as we did on the DEV set, here we stepped the threshold value by 2% on the TEST set.
    The more permissive values of i increase sensitivity at the expense of specificity.
    Interestingly, the overall accuracy remained fairly constant across the entire range of i, staying within 0.05 of the maximum of 0.62 achieved at i=30%.
    Finally, we manually inspected several incorrect inferences that were missed by our filters.
    A common source of errors was due to the many incorrect &#8220;antonymy&#8221; inference rules generated by DIRT, such as &#8220;X is rejected in Y&#8221;=&gt;&#8220;X is accepted in Y&#8221;.
    This recognized problem in DIRT occurs because of the distributional hypothesis assumption used to form the inference rules.
    Our ISP algorithms suffer from a similar quandary since, typically, antonymous relations take the same sets of arguments for X (and Y).
    For these cases, ISP algorithms learn many selectional preferences that accept the same types
