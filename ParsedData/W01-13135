 event-clause: Here the antecedent for which is identified as the relief, and gives which &lt;the relief&gt; was costing lives instead of which &lt;poor coordination&gt; was costing lives.
    Fortunately, in most cases our rule works correctly.
    Although the event-identifier works reasonably well, breaking text into event-clauses needs further investigation.
    Table 1 shows the performance of the system.
    Two kinds of mistakes are made by the event identifier: those caused by CONTEX (it does not identify clauses with omitted predicate, etc.) and those caused by the fact that our clause identifier does too shallow analysis of the parse tree.
  
  
    According to (Bell, 1997) &#8220;time is expressed at different levels&#8212;in the morphology and syntax of the verb phrase, in time adverbials whether lexical or phrasal, and in the discourse structure of the stories above the sentence&#8221;.
    For the present work we use slightly modified time representations suggested in (Allen, 1991).
