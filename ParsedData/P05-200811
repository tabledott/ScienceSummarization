d crossvalidation.
    The mean accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier was 61.5%, while the SVM classifier was 70.1%.
    Using these same classifiers to predict the sentiment of movie reviews in Polarity 1.0 resulted in accuracies of 59.1% (Naive Bayes) and 52.1% (SVM).
    We repeated the optimisation process using a held-out set of 100 positive and 100 negative reviews from the Polarity 1.0 dataset, as it is possible that this test needs different parameter settings.
    This revealed an optimum context of a window of 50 tokens taken from a training set of 21,000 articles for the Naive Bayes classifier.
    Interestingly, the optimum context for the SVM classifier appeared to be a window of only 20 tokens taken from a mere 2,000 training examples.
    This is clearly an anomaly, as these parameters resulted in an accuracy of 48.9% when testing against the reserved reviews of Polarity 1.0.
    We attribute this to the presence of noise, both in the training set and in the held-out set, and discuss this belo
