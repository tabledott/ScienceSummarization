  An idea we discuss here tries using induced semantics to rescore the output of the best algorithm (filtered, cross-sourced Zscore) and eliminate semantically compositional or modifiable MWU hypotheses.
    Deerwester, et al (1990) introduced Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) as a computational technique for inducing semantic relationships between words and documents.
    It forms highdimensional vectors using word counts and uses singular value decomposition to project those vectors into an optimal k-dimensional, &#8220;semantic&#8221; subspace (see Landauer, et al, 1998).
    Following an approach from Sch&#252;tze (1993), we (denoted by SL) for C&#8217;s subcomponents.
    These can either include ({X } n) or exclude QX* } n ) C&#8217;s counts.
    We seek to see if induced sema4ics can help eliminate incorrectly-chosen MWUs.
    As will be shown, the effort using semantics in this nature has a very small payoff for the expended cost.
    Non-compositionality is a key component of valid MWUs, so we may desir
