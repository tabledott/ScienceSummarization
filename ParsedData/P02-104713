also noisy because long distance relations are common in well-written texts.
  
  
    We hypothesize that we can determine that a CONTRAST relation holds between the sentences in (3) even if we cannot semantically interpret the two sentences, simply because our background knowledge tells us that good and fails are good indicators of contrastive statements.
    John is good in math and sciences.
    (3) Paul fails almost every class he takes.
    Similarly, we hypothesize that we can determine that a CONTRAST relation holds between the sentences in (1), because our background knowledge tells us that embargo and legally are likely to occur in contexts of opposite polarity.
    In general, we hypothesize that lexical item pairs can provide clues about the discourse relations that hold between the text spans in which the lexical items occur.
    To test this hypothesis, we need to solve two problems.
    First, we need a means to acquire vast amounts of background knowledge from which we can derive, for example,
