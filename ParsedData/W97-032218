null), indicating that the position i to the left or right falls outside of the sentence boundary.
    In these experiments we use 4 unrestricted collocation features, UL2, ULi, URI, and UR2.
    As an example, the values of these features for concern are as follows: Content Collocations Features of the form CLi and CR1 indicate the content word occurring in the position 1 place to the left or right, respectively, of the ambiguous word.
    The values of these features are defined much like the unrestricted collocations above, except that these are restricted to the 19 most frequent content words that occur only one position to the left or right of the ambiguous word.
    To contrast this set of features with the unrestricted collocations, consider concern again.
    The values of the features representing the 19 most frequent content words 1 position to the left and right are as follows: Feature Sets A, B and C The 3 feature sets used in these experiments are designated A, B and C and are formulated as follo
