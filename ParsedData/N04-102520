rrelation (0.79).
    The next best predictor was again UNK (0.63).
    On the Web corpus, the largest portions of Smoothed Unigram&#8217;s accuracy gains were achieved in grades 4&#8211; 8.
    Without cross-grade smoothing, correlation for Web document predictions fell significantly, to 0.46 and 0.68 for the grade 1-6 and 1-12 subsets respectively.
    We measured the type coverage of the language models created from our Web training corpus, using the Web (via cross-validation) and Reading A-Z test sets.
    Type coverage tells us how often on average a type from a test passage is found in our statistical model.
    On the Reading A-Z test set (Grades 1 &#8211; 6), we observed a mean type coverage of 89.1%, with a standard deviation of 6.65%.
    The mean type coverage for the Web corpus was 91.69%, with a standard deviation of 5.86%.
    These figures suggest that the 17,928 types in the training set are sufficient to give enough coverage of the test data that we only need to back off outside the language
