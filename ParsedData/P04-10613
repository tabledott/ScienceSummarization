 have few function words, and for which the definition of lexical categories is much less clear, dependency structures may be easier to detect.
    An example dependency representation of a short sentence is shown in figure 1(a), where, following the traditional dependency grammar notation, the regent or head of a dependency is marked with the tail of the dependency arrow, and the dependent is marked with the arrowhead (Mel'&#711;cuk, 1988).
    It will be important in what follows to see that such a representation is isomorphic (in terms of strong generative capacity) to a restricted form of phrase structure grammar, where the set of terminals and nonterminals is identical, and every rule is of the form X &#8594; X Y or X &#8594; Y X (Miller, 1999), giving the isomorphic representation of figure 1(a) shown in figure 1(b).1 Depending on the model, part-ofspeech categories may be included in the dependency representation, as shown here, or dependencies may be directly between words.
    Below, we will assume a
