  We think that several factors make the comparison difficult.
  Most of those works focus in a selected set of a few words, generally with a couple of senses of very different meaning (coarse-grained istinctions), and for which their algorithm could gather enough evidence.
  On the contrary, we tested our method with all the nouns in a subset of an unfestricted public domain corpus (more than 9.000 words), making fine-grained distinctions among all the senses in WordNct.
  An approach that uses hierarchical knowledge is that of [Resnik 9511, which additionally uses the information content of each concept gathered from corpora.
  Unfortunately he applies his method on a different ask, that of disambiguating sets of related nouns.
  The evaluation is done on a set of related nouns from Rogers Thesaurus tagged by hand.
  The fact that some senses were discarded because the human judged them not reliable makes comparison even more difficult.
