    Analogously, we consider a &#8220;gene&#8221; to be a composite entity that can have different roles throughout a document.
    Standardization of &#8221;Gene&#8221; references between different texts and between gene synonyms is handled by externally referencing each instance to a standard ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000).
    In the context of this project, &#8221;Gene&#8221; refers to a conceptual entity as opposed to the specific manifestation of a gene (i.e. an allele or nucleotide sequence).
    Therefore, we consider genes to be abstract concepts identifying genomic regions often associated with a function, such as MYC or TrkB; we do not consider actual instances of such genes within the gene-entity domain.
    Since we are interested in the association between Gene-entities and malignancies, for this project genes are of interest to us when they have an associated variation event.
    Therefore, the combination of Gene entities and Variation eve
