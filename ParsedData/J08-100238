hic to the parsing process, that is, a chart.
    Hence, we can assign features of HPSG parse trees to a conjunctive node, together with features of predicate&#8211; argument structures.
    In Section 5, we will investigate the contribution of features on parse trees and predicate&#8211;argument structures to the disambiguation of HPSG parsing.
    The method just described is the essence of our solution for the tractable estimation of maximum entropy models on exponentially many HPSG parse trees.
    However, the problem of computational cost remains.
    Construction of feature forests requires parsing of all of the sentences in a treebank.
    Despite the development of methods to improve HPSG parsing efficiency (Oepen, Flickinger, et al. 2002), exhaustive parsing of all sentences is still expensive.
    We assume that computation of parse trees with low probabilities can be omitted in the estimation stage because T(w) can be approximated by parse trees with high probabilities.
    To achieve this, we fir
