kes it easy to compute, or at least approximate, infinite sums.
    There will be several especially useful semirings in this paper, which are defined in Figure 5.
    We will write rb, to indicate the set of real numbers from a to b inclusive, with similar notation for the natural numbers, N. We will write E to indicate the set of all derivations in some canonical form, and 2E to indicate the set of all sets of derivations in canonical form.
    There are three derivation semirings: the derivation forest semiring, the Viterbi-derivation semiring, and the Viterbi-n-best semiring.
    The operators used in the derivation semirings (., max, x ,max, and x) will be described later, in Section 2.5.
    The inside semiring includes all nonnegative real numbers, to be closed under addition, and includes infinity to be closed under infinite sums, while the Viterbi semiring contains only numbers up to 1, since under max this still leads to closure.
    The three derivation forest semirings can be used to find especial
