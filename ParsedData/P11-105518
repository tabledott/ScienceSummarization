ractions.
    To compute precision / recall curves for the tasks, we ranked the MULTIR extractions as follows.
    For sentence-level evaluations, we ordered according to the extraction factor score 4bextract(zi7 xi).
    For aggregate comparisons, we set the score for an extraction Y' = true to be the max of the extraction factor scores for the sentences where r was extracted.
  
  
    To evaluate our algorithm, we first compare it to an existing approach for using multi-instance learning with weak supervision (Riedel et al., 2010), using the same data and features.
    We report both aggregate extraction and sentential extraction results.
    We then investigate relation-specific performance of our system.
    Finally, we report running time comparisons.
    Figure 4 shows approximate precision / recall curves for three systems computed with aggregate metrics (Section 6.3) that test how closely the extractions match the facts in Freebase.
    The systems include the original results reported by Riedel et a
