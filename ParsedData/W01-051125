on average.
    This is particularly important in the case of larger collections with a much bigger number of unique words for which the lexical-based model is not a viable option.
    Our results seem to indicate that we do not lose much in terms of accuracy using the more compact MeSH representation.
    We have also shown how MeSH-besed models out perform a lexical-based approach when the number of training points is small and when the test set consists of words unseen in the training data.
    This indicates that the MeSH models can generalize successfully over unseen words.
    Our approach handles &#8220;mixed-class&#8221; relations naturally.
    For the mixed class Defect in Location, the algorithm achieved an accuracy around 95% for both &#8220;Defect&#8221; and &#8220;Location&#8221; simultaneously.
    Our results also indicate that the second noun (the head) is more important in determining the relationships than the first one.
    In future we plan to train the algorithm to allow different levels
