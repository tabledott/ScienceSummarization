lassifier without necessarily optimizing for clustering-level accuracy.
    In contrast, we attempt to optimize our ranking model with respect to the target coreference scoring function, essentially by training it in such a way that a higher scored candidate partition (according to the scoring function) would be assigned a higher rank (see Section 3.2 for details).
    Perhaps even more importantly, our approach provides a general framework for coreference resolution.
    Instead of committing ourselves to a particular resolution method as in previous approaches, our framework makes it possible to leverage the strengths of different methods by allowing them to participate in the generation of candidate partitions.
    We evaluate our approach on three standard coreference data sets using two different scoring metrics.
    In our experiments, our approach compares favorably to two state-of-the-art coreference systems adopting the standard machine learning approach, outperforming them by as much as 4&#8211;7% o
