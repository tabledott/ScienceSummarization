monosemous relatives, so we were interested in determining just what proportion of word senses have such relatives.
    We examined 8,500 polysemous nouns that appeared in a moderate-size, 25-million-word corpus.
    In all, these 8,500 nouns have more than 24,000 WordNet senses.
    Restricting the relations to synonyms, immediate hyponyms (i.e., daughters), and immediate hypernyms (parents), we found that about 64% (15,400) have monosemous relatives attested in the corpus.
    With larger corpora (e.g., with text obtained by Web crawling) and more lexical relations (e.g., meronymy), this percentage can be expected to increase.
    The approach we have used is related to that of Yarowsky (1992) in that training materials are collected using a knowledge base, but it differs in other respects, notably in the selection of training and testing materials, the choice of a knowledge base, and use of both topical and local classifiers.
