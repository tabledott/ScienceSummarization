g test sets from different parts of a larger pool of sentences (Figure 2 vs.

    We discussed some properties of the widely used BLEU score, especially the effect of the brevity system comparisons and different sample sizes.
    12%/1% means 12% correct and 1% wrong conclusions.
    30,000 test sentences are divided into 300, 100, 50, and 10 samples, each the size of 100, 300, 600, and 3000 sentences respectively. penalty and the role of larger n-grams.
    One important element of a solid experimental framework is a statistical significance test that allows us to judge, if a change in score that comes from a change in the system, truly reflects a change in overall translation quality.
    We applied bootstrap resampling to machine translation evaluation and described methods to compute statistical significance intervals and levels for machine translation evaluation metrics.
    We described how to compute statistical significance intervals for metrics such as BLEU for small test sets, using bo
