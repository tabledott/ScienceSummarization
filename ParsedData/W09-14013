onsideration was given to providing evaluation at diverse levels and aspects, so that the results can drive continuous efforts in relevant directions.
    The paper discusses the design and implementation of the BioNLP task, and reports the results with analysis.
  
  
    To focus efforts on the novel aspects of the event extraction task, is was assumed that named entity recognition has already been performed and the task was begun with a given set of gold protein annotation.
    This is the only feature of the task setting that notably detracts from its realism.
    However, given that state-of-the-art protein annotation methods show a practically applicable level of performance, i.e.
    88% F-score (Wilbur et al., 2007), we believe the choice is reasonable and has several advantages, including focus on event extraction and effective evaluation and analysis.
    Table 1 shows the event types addressed in the BioNLP task.
    The event types were selected from the GENIA ontology, with consideration given to
