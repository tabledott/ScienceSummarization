onnections (SSI, Navigli and Velardi (2004)).
    SSI3 exploits an extensive lexical knowledge base, built upon the WordNet lexicon and enriched with collocation information representing semantic relatedness between sense pairs.
    Collocations are acquired from existing resources (like the Oxford Collocations, the Longman Language Activator, collocation web sites, etc.).
    Each collocation is mapped to the WordNet sense inventory in a semi-automatic manner and transformed into a relatedness edge (Navigli and Velardi, 2005).
    Given a word context C = {w1, ..., wn}, SSI builds a graph G = (V, E) such that V = n at least one semantic interconnection between S and S' in the lexical knowledge base.
    A semantic interconnection pattern is a relevant sequence of edges selected according to a manually-created context-free grammar, i.e. a path connecting a pair of word senses, possibly including a number of intermediate concepts.
    The grammar consists of a small number of rules, inspired by the notion of l
