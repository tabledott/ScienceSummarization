1 * 2 (for E).
    Results for this approach are reported in Section 6.
    After these scores are computed, the blocks are shifted by one sentence (sentences 1 and 8 need to be handled as boundary conditions).
    So, for example, in addition Illustration of three ways to compute the lexical score at gaps between sentences.
    Numbers indicate a numbered sequence of sentences, columns of letters signify the terms in the given sentence.
    (a) Blocks &#8212; dot product of vectors of word counts in the block on the left and the block on the right.
    (b) Vocabulary introduction &#8212; the number of words that occur for the first time within the interval centered at the sentence gap.
    (c) Chains &#8212; the number of active chains, or terms that repeat within threshold sentences and span the sentence gap. to comparing sentences 3 and 4 against sentences 5 and 6, the algorithm compares sentences 4 and 5 against sentences 6 and 7.
    An earlier version of the algorithm (Hearst 1993; Hearst and Plaunt 199
