he text, to be able to prove that civilians are not members of law enforcement agencies and conclude that the hypothesis does not follow from the text.
    But a graphmatching system will to try to get non-entailment by making the matching cost between civilians and members of law enforcement agencies be very high.
    However, the likely result of that is that the final part of the hypothesis will align with were civilians at the end of the text, assuming that we allow an alignment with &#8220;loose&#8221; arc correspondence.2 Under this candidate alignment, the lexical alignments are perfect, and the only imperfect alignment is the subject arc of were is mismatched in the two.
    A robust inference guesser will still likely conclude that there is entailment.
    We propose that all three problems can be resolved in a two-stage architecture, where the alignment phase is followed by a separate phase of entailment determination.
    Although developed independently, the same division between alignment and cla
