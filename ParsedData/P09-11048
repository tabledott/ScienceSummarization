locks is problematic, because finding a maximal 1-1 matching over phrases is NP-hard (DeNero and Klein, 2008).
    With ITG, it is relatively easy to allow contiguous many-to-one alignment blocks without added complexity.3 This is accomplished by adding additional unary terminal productions aligning a foreign phrase to a single English terminal or vice versa.
    We will use BITG to refer to this block ITG variant and ABITG to refer to the alignment family, which is neither contained in nor contains A1-1.
    For this alignment family, we expand the alignment potential decomposition in Equation (1) to incorporate block potentials sef and sef which represent English and foreign many-to-one alignment blocks, respectively.
    One way to evaluate alignment families is to consider their oracle AER.
    In the 2002 NIST Chinese-English hand-aligned data (see Section 6.2), we constructed oracle alignment potentials as follows: sij is set to +1 if (i, j) is a sure or possible alignment in the hand-aligned data, 1 ot
