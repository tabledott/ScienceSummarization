ormation only slightly improves the performance.
    This may be due to three reasons: First, most of relations defined in ACE have two mentions being close to each other.
    While short-distance relations dominate and can be resolved by simple features such as word and chunking features, the further dependency tree and parse tree features can only take effect in the remaining much less and more difficult long-distance relations.
    Second, it is well known that full parsing is always prone to long-distance parsing errors although the Collins&#8217; parser used in our system achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
    Therefore, the state-of-art full parsing still needs to be further enhanced to provide accurate enough information, especially PP (Preposition Phrase) attachment.
    Last, effective ways need to be explored to incorporate information embedded in the full parse trees.
    Besides, we also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relati
