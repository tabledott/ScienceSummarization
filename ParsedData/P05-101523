h the positive-sentence percentage (PSP).
    The-axes of the two plots are aligned.
    Significant differences, three-class data Significant differences, four-class data all four datasets (the &#8220;no triangles&#8221; case), we indicate this with an equals sign (&#8220;=&#8221;).
    Q: Thanks.
    Doesn&#8217;t Figure 1 show that the positive-sentence percentage would be a good classifier even in isolation, so metric labeling isn&#8217;t necessary?
    A: No.
    Predicting class labels directly from the PSP value via trained thresholds isn&#8217;t as effective (ovaPSP threshold PSP [3c]; regPSP threshold PSP [4c]).
    Alternatively, we could use only the PSP component of metric labeling by setting the label preference function to the constant function 0, but even with test-set-optimal parameter settings, doing so underperforms the trained metric labeling algorithm with access to an iniregPSP 0 [4c]).
    Q: What about using PSP as one of the features for input to a standard classifier?
    A: Our focus
