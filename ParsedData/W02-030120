es/suffixes/substrings.8 The performance is measured by precision, recall, and F-score, which are the standard measures for the named entity recognition.
    Systems based on the BIO representation may produce an inconsistent class sequence such as &#8220;O B-DNA I-RNA O&#8221;.
    We interpret such outputs as follows: once a named entity starts with &#8220;B-C&#8221; then we interpret that the named entity with class &#8220;C&#8221; ends only when we see another &#8220;B-&#8221; or &#8220;O-&#8221; tag.
    We have implemented SMO algorithm (Platt, 1998) and techniques described in (Joachims, 1998) for soft margin SVMs in C++ programming language, and implemented support codes for pairwise classification and parallel training in Java programming language.
    To obtain POS information required for features and class splitting, we used an English POS tagger described in (Kazama et al., 2001).
    First, we show the effect of the class splitting described in Section 5.1.
    Varying the size of training data,
