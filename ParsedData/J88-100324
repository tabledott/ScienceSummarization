ecome candidates.
    The program then matches the candidate sequences against the ambiguities remaining from earlier steps of the algorithm.
    When only one sequence is possible, disambiguation is successful.
    The samples used for calibration and testing were limited.
    First, Klein and Simmons (1963) performed &amp;quot;hand analysis of a sample [size unspecified] of Golden Book Encyclopedia text&amp;quot; (p. 342).
    Later, &amp;quot;[w]hen it was run on several pages from that encyclopedia, it correctly and unambiguously tagged slightly over 90% of the words&amp;quot; (p. 344).
    Further tests were run on small samples from the Encyclopedia Americana and from Scientific American.
    Klein and Simmons (1963) assert that &amp;quot;[o]riginal fears that sequences of four or more unidentified parts of speech would occur with great frequency were not substantiated in fact&amp;quot; (p. 3).
    This felicity, however, is an artifact.
    First, the relatively small set of categories reduces ambiguit
