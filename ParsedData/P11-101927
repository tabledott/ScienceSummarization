s calculated using regression techniques, is based on the content score as well as on other properties of texts, such as style, grammar, and so forth, though the methods used to assess these are not described in any detail in published work.
    Again, the system requires retraining or tuning for new prompts and assessment tasks.
    Lonsdale and Strong-Krause (2003) use a modified syntactic parser to analyse and score texts.
    Their method is based on a modified version of the Link Grammar parser (Sleator and Templerley, 1995) where the overall score of a text is calculated as the average of the scores assigned to each sentence.
    Sentences are scored on a five-point scale based on the parser&#8217;s cost vector, which roughly measures the complexity and deviation of a sentence from the parser&#8217;s grammatical model.
    This approach bears some similarities to our use of grammatical complexity and extragrammaticality features, but grammatical features represent only one component of our overall syste
