			3.3 Direct Learning of Unary Rules.
			We applied the lexical similarity measures pre sented in Section 2 for unary rule learning.
			Each argument instantiation of template t in the corpus is taken as a feature f , and the pmi between t and f is used for the feature?s weight.
			We first adaptedDIRT for unary templates (unary-DIRT, apply ing Lin-similarity to the single feature vector), as well as its output filtering by LEDIR.
			The various Weeds measures were also applied 1 : symmetric arithmetic average, symmetric harmonic average, weighted arithmetic average and Precision.
			After initial analysis, we found that given a right hand side template r, symmetric measures such as Lin (in DIRT) generally tend to prefer (score higher) relations ?l, r?
			in which l and r are related but do not necessarily participate in an entailment or equivalence relation, e.g. the wrong rule ?kill X ? injure X?.
			On the other hand, directional measures such as Weeds Precision tend to prefer directio
