    Dependency-tree parsing as the search for the maximum spanning tree (MST) in a graph was proposed by McDonald et al. (2005c).
    This formulation leads to efficient parsing algorithms for both projective and non-projective dependency trees with the Eisner algorithm (Eisner, 1996) and the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967) respectively.
    The formulation works by defining the score of a dependency tree to be the sum of edge scores, where x = x1 &#183; &#183; &#183; xn is an input sentence and y a dependency tree for x.
    We can view y as a set of tree edges and write (i, j) E y to indicate an edge in y from word xi to word xj.
    Consider the example from Figure 1, where the subscripts index the nodes of the tree.
    The score of this tree would then be, We call this first-order dependency parsing since scores are restricted to a single edge in the dependency tree.
    The score of an edge is
