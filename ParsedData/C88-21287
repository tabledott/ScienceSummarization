nt admitted as a nonterminal N occurs between positions i and j .
  Such items will be referred to as nonconditional items; if n &gt; 0, the item will be considered conditional.
  In the grammars we are interested in~ rules will include either all nonterminals on the right-hand side or a~I terminals.
  We can think of the former as grammar rules proper, the XLater, in the sections containing examples of the architectures operation, we will reintroduce V1,...,  Vm-1 and the dot marker to aid readability.
  d14 latter as lexical entries.
  Nonconditional i tems formed by immediate inference from a lexieal entry will be called lexical items.
  For instance, if there is a grammar ule NP ---, sonny, then the item [0, NP,  1] is a lexical item.
  A prediction item (or, simply, a prediction) is an item with identical start and end positions.
