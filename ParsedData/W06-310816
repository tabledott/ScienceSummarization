    In Table 6, we show the translation results for the BTEC task.
    In these experiments, the reordering model uses two orientation classes, i.e. it predicts either a left or a right orientation.
    The features for the maximum-entropy based reordering model are based on the source and target language words within a window of one.
    The word-class based features are not used for the translation experiments.
    The maximum-entropy based reordering model achieves small but consistent improvement for all the evaluation criteria.
    Note that the baseline system, i.e. using the distance-based reordering, was among the best systems in the IWSLT 2005 evaluation campaign (Eck and Hori, 2005).
    Some translation examples are presented in Table 7.
    We observe that the system using the maximum-entropy based reordering model produces more fluent translations.
    Additional translation experiments were carried out on the large data track of the Chinese-English NIST task.
