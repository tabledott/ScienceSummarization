these local maxima are like pebbles on a mountain, invisible at low resolution.
    I computed Equation 29 over various combinations of A+ and A- after one iteration of Method A over 300,000 aligned sentence pairs from the Canadian Hansard bitext.
    Figure 3 illustrates that the region of interest in the parameter space, where 1 &gt; A+ &gt; A &gt; A- &gt; 0, has only one dominant global maximum.
    This global maximum can be found by standard hill-climbing methods, as long as the step size is large enough to avoid getting stuck on the pebbles.
    Given estimates for A+ and A-, we can compute B(links(u, v)lcooc(u, v), A+) and B(links(u, v)icooc(u, v), A-) for each occurring combination of links and cooc values.
    These are the probabilities that links (u, v) links were generated out of cooc(u, v) possible links by a process that generates correct links and by a process that generates incorrect links, respectively.
    The ratio of these probabilities is the likelihood ratio in favor of the types u and v
