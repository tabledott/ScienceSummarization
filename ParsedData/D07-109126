formation in reordering and models with augmented input information.We have not addressed all computational problems of factored translation models.
			In fact, compu tational problems hold back experiments with morecomplex factored models that are theoretically pos sible but too computationally expensive to carry out.Our current focus is to develop a more efficient im plementation that will enable these experiments.
			Moreover, we expect to overcome the constraints of the currently implemented synchronous factored models by developing a more general asynchronous framework, where multiple translation steps mayoperate on different phrase segmentations (for instance a part-of-speech model for large scale re ordering).
