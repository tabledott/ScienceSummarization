pothesis as in the previous cases, are depicted in graphs 7 and 8.
    The mean surprisal for the object relative is about 5.0 whereas the mean surprisal for the subject relative is about 2.1.
  
  
    These examples suggest that a &#8220;total-parallelism&#8221; parsing theory based on probabilistic grammar can characterize some important processing phenomena.
    In the domain of structural ambiguity in particular, the explanation is of a different kind than in traditional reanalysis models: the order of processing is not theoretically significant, but the estimate of its magnitude at each point in a sentence is.
    Results with empirically-derived grammars suggest an affirmative answer to Gibson and Pearlmutter&#8217;s quessThe difference in probability between subject and object rules could be due to the work necessary to set up storage for the filler, effectively recapitulating the HOLD Hypothesis (Wanner and Maratsos, 1978, page 119) tion: phrase-level contingent frequencies can do the work formerly d
