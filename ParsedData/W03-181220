han one sense, we calculate a similarity for sense pairing between them, and average over them to produce a consolidated similarity value.
  
  
    LSA was used to build models in which MWEs could be compared with their constituent words.
    Two models were built, one from the WSJ corpus (indexing NN compounds) and one from the BNC (indexing verb-particles).
    After removing stopwords, the 50,000 most frequent terms were indexed in each model.
    From the WSJ, these 50,000 terms included 1,710 NN compounds (with corpus frequency of at least 13) and from the BNC, 461 verbparticles (with corpus frequency of at least 49).
    We used these models to compare different words, and to find their neighbours.
    For example, the neighbours of the simplex verb cut and the verb-particles cut out and cut off (from the BNC model) are shown in Table 2.
    As can be seen, several of the neighbours of cut out are from similar semantic areas as those of cut, whereas those of cut off are quite different.
