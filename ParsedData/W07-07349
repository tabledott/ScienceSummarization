h, we used the NIST 2003 Arabic-toEnglish MT evaluation data for training and the NIST 2004 Arabic-to-English evaluation data for testing.
    For Spanish, German and French we used the evaluation data provided by the shared task at last year&#8217;s WMT workshop.
    Sizes of various corpora are shown in Table 1.
    Some, but not all, of these data sets have multiple human judgments per translation hypothesis.
    To partially address human bias issues, we normalize the human judgments, which transforms the raw judgment scores so that they have similar distributions.
    We use the normalization method described in (Blatz et al., 2003).
    Multiple judgments are combined into a single number by taking their average.
    We performed a &#8220;hill climbing&#8221; search to find the parameters that achieve maximum correlation with human judgments on the training set.
    We use Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient as our measure of correlation.
    We followed a &#8220;leave one out&#8221; training proced
