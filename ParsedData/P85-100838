way the world really is.
    At the left one can assume a theory world that is isomorphic to way we talk about it.
    What been doing in this paper, fact, is an effort to work out the details such theory.
    In this case, semantics becomes very nearly trivial.
    Most activity in semantics today is slightly to the right of the extreme left end of this spectrum.
    One makes certain assumptions about the nature of the world that closely redeet language, and doesn't make other sesumptiosui.
    Where one has failed to necessary assumptions, puzzles appear, and semantics becomes effort to solve those puzzles.
    Nevertheless, rails move far enough away from language to represent significant progress toward the right end of the spectrum.
    The position I advocate is that there is no reason to make our tisk more difficult.
    We will have puzzles enough to solve when we get to discourse.
  
  
    The real problem in natural language processing is the interpretation of discourse.
    Therefore, the other a
