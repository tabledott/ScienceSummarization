  The Tradeoffs Between Open and Traditional Relation Extraction
  
  
    Relation Extraction (RE) is the task of recognizing the assertion of a particular relationship between two or more entities in text.
    Typically, the target relation (e.g., seminar location) is given to the RE system as input along with hand-crafted extraction patterns or patterns learned from hand-labeled training examples (Brin, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000).
    Such inputs are specific to the target relation.
    Shifting to a new relation requires a person to manually create new extraction patterns or specify new training examples.
    This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations.
    In 2007, we introduced a new approach to the RE task, called Open Information Extraction (Open IE), which scales RE to the Web.
    An Open IE system extracts a diverse set of relational tuples without requiring any relation-specific human input.
