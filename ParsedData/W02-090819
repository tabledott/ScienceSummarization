(f(w, r, w&#65533;) + 1) factor encodes the desired bias towards relatively frequent canonical attributes.
    If a canonical attribute is shared by the two terms, then our algorithm performs the full comparison.
    Figure 5 shows system performance and speed, as canonical vector size is increased, with the maximum cutoff at 4000, 8000, and 10,000.
    As an example, with a maximum cutoff of 10,000 and a canonical vector size of 70, the total DIRECT score of 1841 represents a 3.9% performance penalty over full extraction, for an 89% reduction in execution time.
    Table 7 presents the example term results using the techniques we have described: JACCARD measure and TTEST weight functions; minimum cutoff of 30; and approximation algorithm with canonical vector size of 100 with TTESTLOG weighting.
    The BIG columns show the previous measure results if we returned 10,000 synonyms, and MAX gives the results for a comparison of the gold standard against itself.
