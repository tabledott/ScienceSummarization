 sentential paraphrases as explained later.
    4: for each word-aligned sentence pair (E1, E2)a in C do 5: Extract pairs of contiguous subsequences ( &#175;e1, &#175;e2) such that: generate a set of phrasal paraphrase pairs and compute a probability value for each such pair.
    In Step 2, a simple parameter estimation technique (Brown et al. 1993) is used to compute, for later use, the probability of replacing any given word with another.
    Step 3 computes a word alignment (indicated by a) between each pair of sentences.
    This alignment indicates for each word ei in one string that word ej in the other string from which it was most likely produced (denoted here by ei &#8764; ej).
    Steps 4&#8211;7 extract, from each pair of sentences, pairs of short contiguous phrases that are aligned with each other according to this alignment.
    Note that each such extracted pair is essentially a phrasal paraphrase.
    Finally, a probability value is computed for each such pair by assuming that each word of the
