more complex translation TSP correspond roughly to triples (e', e, j), the notation for which is given below.
    The final path output by the translation algorithm will contain exactly one triple (e', e, j) for each source position j.
    The algorithm processes subsets of partial hypotheses with coverage sets C of increasing cardinality c. For a trigram language model, the partial hypotheses are of the form (e', e, C, j), where e', e are the last two target words, C is a coverage set for the already covered source positions, and j is the last covered position.
    The target word sequence that ends in e', e is stored as a back pointer to the predecessor partial hypothesis (and recursively to its predecessor hypotheses) and is not shown in the notation.
    Each distance in the TSP now corresponds to the negative logarithm of the product of the translation, distortion, and language model probabilities.
