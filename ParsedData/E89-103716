case that a minimal structure assigned to that sentence by the target grammar is subsumed by a minimal solution to the transfer description.
    One desirable consequence of this formalization is that it permits two distinct target strings for a source string whose meaning in the absence of other information is vague but not ambiguous.
    Thus this conceptual and notational framework provides a powerful and flexible system for imposing constraints on the form of a target sentence by relating them to information that appears at different levels of source-language abstraction.
    This apparatus allows us to avoid many of the problems encountered by more derivational, transformational or procedural models of transfer.
    We will illustrate our proposal with examples that have posed challenges for some other approaches.
  
  
    Changes in grammatical function.
    Some quite trivial changes in structure occur when the source and the target predicate differ in the grammatical functions that they subcategorize
