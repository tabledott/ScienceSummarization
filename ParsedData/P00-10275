 specifically sought to induce suffix paradigm classes (e.g.
    NULL . ed. ing vs. e. ed. ing vs. e. ed. es .ing vs. ted.tion) from raw text.
    However, handling of irregular words was largely excluded from this work, as Goldsmith assumed a strictly concatenative morphology without models for stem changes.
    Morphology induction in agglutenative languages such as Turkish and Finnish presents a problem similar to parsing or segmenting a sentence, given the long strings of affixations allowed and the relatively free affix order.
    Voutilainen (1995) has approached this problem in a finitestate framework, and Hakkani-Thr et al. (2000) have done so using a trigram tagger, with the assumption of a concatenative affixation model.
    The two-level model of morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983) has been extremely successful in manually capturing the morphological processes of the world's languages.
    The context sensitive stem-change models used in this current paper have been partially inspired by this framework.
