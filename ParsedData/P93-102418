0, the more local is the influence of each noun on the definition of centroids.
    Distributional similarity plays here the role of distortion.
    When the scale parameter 0 is close to zero, the similarity is almost irrelevant.
    All words contribute about equally to each centroid, and so the lowest average distortion solution involves just one cluster whose centroid is the average of all word distributions.
    As 0 is slowly increased, a critical point is eventually reached for which the lowest F solution involves two distinct centroids.
    We say then that the original cluster has split into the two new clusters.
    In general, if we take any cluster c and a twin c' of c such that the centroid pc, is a small random perturbation of pc, below the critical 0 at which c splits the membership and centroid reestimation procedure given by equations (8) and (11) will make pc and pc, converge, that is, c and c' are really the same cluster.
    But with p above the critical value for c, the two centroids will
