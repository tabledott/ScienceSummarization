    We the WordNet hierarchy.
    We use WordNet as our sense inventory for this work.
    The paper is structured as follows.
    We discuss our method in the following section.
    Sections 3 and 4 concern experiments using predominant senses from the BNC evaluated against the data in SemCor and the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task respectively.
    In section 5 we present results of the method on two domain specific sections of the Reuters corpus for a sample of words.
    We describe some related work in section 6 and conclude in section 7. are therefore investigating a method of automatically ranking WordNet senses from raw text.
    Many researchers are developing thesauruses from automatically parsed data.
    In these each target word is entered with an ordered list of &#8220;nearest neighbours&#8221;.
    The neighbours are words ordered in terms of the &#8220;distributional similarity&#8221; that they have with the target.
    Distributional similarity is a measure indica
