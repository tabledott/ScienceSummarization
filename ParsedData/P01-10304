    Finally, we permute the French words.
    In permuting, Model 4 distinguishes between French words that are heads (the leftmost French word generated from a particular English word), nonheads (non-leftmost, generated only by very fertile English words), and NULL-generated.

    The head of one English word is assigned a French string position based on the position assigned to the previous English word.

    This relative offset k&#8211;j encourages adjacent English words to translate into adjacent French words.
    If e is infertile, then j is taken from e , etc.
    If e is very fertile, then j is the ave
