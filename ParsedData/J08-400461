e here on this latter type of coding, but a discussion of issues raised for POS, named entity, and prosodic coding can be found in the extended version of the article.
    Dialogue act tagging is a type of linguistic annotation with which by now the CL community has had extensive experience: Several dialogue-act-annotated spoken language corpora now exist, such as MapTask (Carletta et al. 1997), Switchboard (Stolcke et al.
    2000), Verbmobil (Jekat et al. 1995), and Communicator (e.g., Doran et al.
    2001), among others.
    Historically, dialogue act annotation was also one of the types of annotation that motivated the introduction in CL of chance-corrected coefficients of agreement (Carletta et al. 1997) and, as we will see, it has been the type of annotation that has generated the most discussion concerning annotation methodology and measuring agreement.
    A number of coding schemes for dialogue acts have achieved values of K over 0.8 and have therefore been assumed to be reliable: For example, K = 0
