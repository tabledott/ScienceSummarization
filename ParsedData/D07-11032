ward approach based on significance testing, that this approach does notadversely affect the quality of translation as mea sured by BLEU score, and that savings in terms ofnumber of discarded phrase pairs can be quite substantial.
			Even more surprising, pruning can actu ally raise the BLEU score although this phenomenon is less prominent if state of the art smoothing of phrasetable probabilities is employed.
			Section 2 reviews the basic ideas of StatisticalMachine Translation as well as those of testing sig nificance of associations in two by two contingency tables departing from independence.
			From this, a filtering algorithm will be described that keeps only phrase pairs that pass a significance test.
			Section 3 outlines a number of experiments that demonstratethe phenomenon and measure its magnitude.
			Sec tion 4 presents the results of these experiments.
			The paper concludes with a summary of what has been learned and a discussion of continuing work that builds on these ideas.
