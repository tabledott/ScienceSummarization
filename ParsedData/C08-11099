osition errors, and our extraneous use filters handle a quarter of that 18%.Thresholding: The final step for the preposi tion error detection system is a set of thresholds that allows the system to skip cases that are likely to result in false positives.
			One of these is wherethe top-ranked preposition and the writer?s prepo sition differ by less than a pre-specified amount.
			This was also meant to avoid flagging cases where the system?s preposition has a score only slightly higher than the writer?s preposition score, such as: ?My sister usually gets home around 3:00?
			(writer: around = 0.49, system: by = 0.51).
			In these cases, the system?s and the writer?s prepositions both fit the context, and it would be inappropriate to claimthe writer?s preposition was used incorrectly.
			Another system threshold requires that the probability of the writer?s preposition be lower than a pre specified value in order for it to be flagged as anerror.
			The thresholds were set so as to strongly fa vor precision ove
