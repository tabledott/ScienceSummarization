dinality c are computed: The coverage pruning threshold tC and the cardinality pruning threshold tc are used to prune active hypotheses.
    We call this pruning translation pruning.
    Hypotheses are pruned according to their translation probability: For the translation experiments presented in Section 4, the negative logarithms of the actual pruning thresholds tc and tC are reported.
    A hypothesis (e', e, C,j) is discarded if its probability is below the corresponding threshold.
    For the current experiments, the coverage and the cardinality threshold are constant for different coverage sets C and cardinalities c. Together with the translation pruning, histogram pruning is carried out: The overall number N(C) of active hypotheses for the coverage set C and the overall number N(c) of active hypotheses for all subsets of a given cardinality may not exceed a given number; again, different numbers are used for coverage and cardinality pruning.
    The coverage histogram pruning is denoted by nc, and the c
