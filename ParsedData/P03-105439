nt-tense verbs do not generally take bare infinitive VP complements.
    To allow the finite/non-finite distinction, and other verb type distinctions, SPLIT-VP annotated all VP nodes with their head tag, merging all finite forms to a single tag VBF.
    In particular, this also accomplished Charniak&#8217;s gerund-VP marking.
    This was extremely useful, bringing the cumulative F1 to 85.72%, 2.66% absolute improvement (more than its solo improvement over the baseline).
    Error analysis at this point suggested that many remaining errors were attachment level and conjunction scope.
    While these kinds of errors are undoubtedly profitable targets for lexical preference, most attachment mistakes were overly high attachments, indicating that the overall right-branching tendency of English was not being captured.
    Indeed, this tendency is a difficult trend to capture in a PCFG because often the high and low attachments involve the very same rules.
    Even if not, attachment height is not modeled by a PCFG
