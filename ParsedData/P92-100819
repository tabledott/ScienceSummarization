wed a highly significant correlation for, and no significant difference between, the mean FO of the matched words.
    A different set of features was found to be useful in distinguishing repairs from false positives for the M11XM1 pattern.
    A set of 12 repairs and 24 false positives was examined; the set of false positives for this analysis included only fluent cases (i.e., it did not include other types of repairs matching the pattern).
    Despite the small data set, some suggestive trends emerge.
    For example, for cases in which there was a pause (200 msec or greater) on only one side of the inserted word, the pause was never after the insertion (X) for the repairs, and rarely before the X in the false positives.
    A second distinguishing characteristic was the peak FO value of X.
    For repairs, the inserted word was nearly always higher in FO than the preceding MI; for false positives, this increase in FO was rarely observed.
