   To avoid confusion, we will use the terms attributional similarity and relational similarity, following Medin, Goldstone, and Gentner (1990).
    Instead of semantic similarity (Resnik 1995) or semantically similar (Chiarello et al. 1990), we prefer the term taxonomical similarity, which we take to be a specific type of attributional similarity.
    We interpret synonymy as a high degree of attributional similarity.
    Analogy is a high degree of relational similarity.
    Algorithms for measuring attributional similarity can be lexicon-based (Lesk 1986; Budanitsky and Hirst 2001; Banerjee and Pedersen 2003), corpus-based (Lesk 1969; Landauer and Dumais 1997; Lin 1998a; Turney 2001), or a hybrid of the two (Resnik 1995; Jiang and Conrath 1997; Turney et al. 2003).
    Intuitively, we might expect that lexicon-based algorithms would be better at capturing synonymy than corpusbased algorithms, since lexicons, such as WordNet, explicitly provide synonymy information that is only implicit in a corpus.
