ntence where the signal is mostly positive.
    This can be achieved by applying a smoothing filter to the signal, and selecting those fragments of the sentence for which the corresponding filtered values are positive.
    The details of the procedure are presented below, and also illustrated in Figure 5.
    Let the Romanian sentence be the source sentence , and the English one be the target, .
    We compute a word alignment by greedily linking each English word with its best translation candidate from the Romanian sentence.
    For each of the linked target words, the corresponding signal value is the probability of the link (there can be at most one link for each target word).
    Thus, if target word is linked to source word , the signal value corresponding to is (the distribution described in Section 2.2), i.e. the probability that is the translation of .
    For the remaining target words, the signal value should reflect the probability that they are not Figure 5: Our approach for detecting parallel fr
