	Online Learning of Relaxed CCG Grammars for Parsing to Logical Form
		We consider the problem of learning toparse sentences to lambda-calculus repre sentations of their underlying semantics and present an algorithm that learns a weighted combinatory categorial grammar (CCG).
		A key idea is to introduce non-standard CCG combinators that relax certain parts of the grammar?for example allowing flexible word order, or insertion of lexical items?
		with learned costs.
		We also present a new, online algorithm for inducing a weighted CCG.
		Results for the approach on ATIS data show 86% F-measure in recovering fully correct semantic analyses and 95.9% F-measure by a partial-match criterion, a more than 5% improvement over the 90.3% partial-match figure reported by He and Young (2006).
	
	
			Recent work (Mooney, 2007; He and Young, 2006;Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005) has developed learn ing algorithms for the problem of mapping sentences to underlying semantic representations.
			In one such approach (Zettlemoye
