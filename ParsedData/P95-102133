ese nodes.
    In this section we have defined &amp;quot;raw&amp;quot; DTG.
    In a more refined version of the formalism we would associate (a single) finite-valued feature structure with each node'.
    It is a matter of further research to determine to what extent SICs and SACs can be stated globally for a grammar, rather than being attached to d-edges/nodess.
    See the next section for a brief discussion of linguistic principles from which a grammar's SICs could be derived.
  
  
    In this section, we show how an account for the data introduced in Section 1 can be given with DTG.
    In Figure 4, we give a DTG that generates sentence (1).
    Every d-tree is a projection from a lexical anchor.
    The label of the maximal projection is, we assume, determined by the morphology of the anchor.
    For example, if the anchor is a finite verb, it will project to S, indicating that an overt syntactic (&amp;quot;surface&amp;quot;) subject is required for agreement with it (and perhaps case-assignment).
