f such algorithms hould be to produce referring expressions that human hear- ers will understand, rather than referring expressions that human speakers would utter.
  The fact that hu- man speakers include redundant modifiers in refer- ring expressions does not mean that NL generation systems are also required to include such modifiers; there is nothing in principle wrong with building gen- eration systems that perform more optimizatious of their output than human speakers.
  On the other hand, if such beyond-human-speaker optimizations 1Another possible explanation is that speakers may in some cases use precompiled reference scripts instead of computing a referring expression from scratch; such refer- enoe scripts pecify a set of attributes that are included as a group in a referring expression, even if some members of the group have no discriminatory power in the current context are computationally expensive and require complex algorithms, they may not be worth performing; they are clearly unnecessary in so
