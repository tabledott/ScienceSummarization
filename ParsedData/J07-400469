nce).
    The correct and complete forests can be used to estimate the required log-likelihood value and feature expectations.
    Let E&#934;&#923; fi be the expected value of fi over the forest (D for model A; then the values in Equation (17) can be obtained by calculating E&#934;j where log Z&#934; and log Z&#936; are the normalization constants for (D and T. Estimating the parsing models consists of generating packed charts for each sentence in the training data, and then repeatedly calculating the values needed by the L-BFGS estimation algorithm until convergence.
    Even though the packed charts are an efficient representation of the derivation space, the charts for the complete training data (Sections 02&#8211;21 of CCGbank) take up a considerable amount of memory.
    One solution is to only keep a small number of charts in memory at any one time, and to keep reading in the charts on each iteration.
    However, given that the L-BFGS algorithm takes hundreds of iterations to converge, this approach w
