re Language Engine.
    The Core Language Engine (CLE) (Alshawi 1992) is a domainindependent system developed at SRI Cambridge, which translates English sentences into formal representations.
    The system was used by SRI for a variety of applications, including spoken language translation and airline reservations.
    The CLE makes use of a core lexicon (to which new entries can be added) and uses an abductive commonsense reasoner to produce an interpretation and to verify the plausibility of choice of referents from an ordered list; the required world knowledge has to be added by hand for each domain, together with whatever lexical knowledge is needed.
    The construction of the formal representation goes through art intermediate stage called quasi-logical form (QLF).
    The QLF may contain unresolved terms corresponding to anaphoric NPs including, among others, definite descriptions.
    The resolution process that transforms QLFs into resolved logical form representations of sentences is described in A
