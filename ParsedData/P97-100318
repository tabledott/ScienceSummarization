    (Alshawi 96) extends a generative dependency model to include an additional state variable which is equivalent to having non-terminals - his suggestions may be close to our models 1 and 2, but he does not fully specify the details of his model, and doesn't give results for parsing accuracy.
    (Miller et al. 96) describe a model where the RHS of a rule is generated by a Markov process, although the process is not head-centered.
    They increase the set of non-terminals by adding semantic labels rather than by adding lexical head-words.
    (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al. 94) describe a history-based approach which uses decision trees to estimate P(TIS).
    Our models use much less sophisticated n-gram estimation methods, and might well benefit from methods such as decision-tree estimation which could condition on richer history than just surface distance.
