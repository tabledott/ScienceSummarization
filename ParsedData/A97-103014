on, we give an overview of the process by which Nominator identifies and classifies proper names.
    Nominator's first step is to build a list of candidate names for a document.
    Next, 'splitting' heuristics are applied to all candidate names for the purpose of breaking up complex names into smaller ones.
    Finally, Nominator groups together name vanants that refer to the same entity.
    After information about names and their referents has been extracted from individual documents, an aggregation process combines the names collected from all the documents into a dictionary, or database of names, representative of the document collection.
    (For more details on the process, see (Ravin and Wacholder 1996)).
    We illustrate the process of name discovery with an excerpt taken from a Wall Street Journal article in the TIPSTER CD-ROM collection (NIST 1993).
    Paragraph breaks are omitted to conserve space.
