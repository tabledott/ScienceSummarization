ion direction German-English the monotonicity constraint is violated mainly with respect to the verb group.
    In German, the verb group usually consists of a left and a right verbal brace, whereas in English the words of the verb group usually form a sequence of consecutive words.
    For our DP search, we use a leftto-right beam-search concept having been introduced in speech recognition, where we rely on beam-search as an efficient pruning technique in order to handle potentially huge search spaces.
    Our ultimate goal is speech translation aiming at a tight integration of speech recognition and translation (Ney, 1999).
    The results presented were obtained by using a quasi-monotone search procedure, which proceeds from left to right along the position of the source sentence but allows for a small number of source positions that are not processed monotonically.
    The word re-orderings of the source sentence positions were restricted to the words of the German verb group.
