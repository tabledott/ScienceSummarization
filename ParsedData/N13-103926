 consisting of words that are frequently capitalized, and distributional features trained on a much smaller unlabeled corpus; they are all worse than our new lexical features described here.
    (We did include, however, a variant of the tag dictionary feature that uses phonetic normalization for lookup; it seemed to yield a small improvement.)
    18Furthermore, when evaluating the clusters as unsupervised (hard) POS tags, we obtain a many-to-one accuracy of 89.2% on DAILY547.
    Before computing this, we lowercased the text to match the clusters and removed tokens tagged as URLs and at-mentions.
    19Reported confidence intervals in this paper are 95% binomial normal approximation intervals for the proportion of correctly tagged tokens: f1.96.,/p(1 &#8722; p)/ntokm &lt; 1/\/n.
    20Details on the exact feature set are available in a technical report (Owoputi et al., 2012), also available on the website.
