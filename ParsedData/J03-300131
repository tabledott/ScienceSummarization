d the other three papers in the special issue all exploit the multilinguality of the Web.
    Andy Way and Nano Gough show how the Web can provide data for an examplebased machine translation (Nagao 1984) system.
    First, they extract 200,000 phrases from a parsed corpus.
    These phrases are sent to three online translation systems.
    Both original phrases and translations are chunked.
    From these pairings a set of chunk translations is extracted to be applied in a piecewise fashion to new input text.
    The authors use the Web again at a final stage to rerank possible translations by verifying which subsequences among the possible translations are most attested.
    The two remaining articles present methods for building aligned bilingual corpora from the Web.
    It seems plausible that such automatic construction of translation dictionaries can palliate the lack of translation resources for many language pairs.
    Philip Resnik was the first to recognize that it is possible to build large parall
