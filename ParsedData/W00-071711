    In future work, I will integrate this with a morphology-learning program.
    I am currently applying this approach to the induction of phrase structure rules, and preliminary experiments have shown encouraging results.
    In summary, the new method avoids the limitations of other approaches, and is better suited to integration into a complete unsupervised language acquisition system.
