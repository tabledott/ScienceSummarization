.
    Although this brings the complexity up to O(n2), the real complication is that there can be many fits to (c1, c2).
    There are still not too many elementary trees t1 and t2 rooted at c1 and c2; but each (t1, t2) pair may be used in many elementary tree pairs t, since there are exponentially many matchings of their frontier nodes.
    Fortunately, most pairs of frontier nodes have low &#946; values that indicate that their subtrees cannot be aligned well; pairing such nodes in a matching would result in poor global probability.
    This observation can be used to prune the space of matchings greatly.
    &#8226; 1-best Alignment (if desired).
    This is just like training, except that we use the Viterbi algorithm to find the single best derivation of the input tree pair.
    This derivation can be regarded as the optimal syntactic alignment.7 We then extract the max-probability synchronous derivation and return the T2 that it derives.
    This algorithm is essentially alignment to an unknown tree T2;
