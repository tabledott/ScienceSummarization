 TIMEX tags extracted by the time tagger.
    Here each taggable verb is given an event index, with the precedes attribute indicating one or more event indices which it precedes temporally.
    (Attributes irrelevant to the example aren't shown).
    The information of the sort shown in Figure 2 can be used to sort and cluster events temporally, allowing for various time-line based presentations of this information in response to specific queries.
    The event-orderer has not yet been evaluated.
    Our evaluation of the eventaligner checks the TIME of all correctly recognized verbs (i.e., verbs recognized correctly by the part-of-speech tagger).
    The basic criterion for event TIME annotation is that if the time of the event is obvious, it is to be tagged as the TIME for that verb.
    (This criterion excludes interval specifications for events, as well as event references involving generics, counterfactuals, etc.
    However, the judgements are still delicate in certain cases.)
