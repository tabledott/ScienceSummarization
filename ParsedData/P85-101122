array contain 3 subset of the nodes of derived trees, what really goes in there ape the addresses of nodes in the elementary trees.
  Thus the the size of any set is bounded by a constant, determined by the grammar.
  It is hoped that the presentation of the sdgorithm below will make it clear why we do so.
