that minimizing TER on Arabic also resulted in higher BLEU scores compared to the best single system.
    However, nese NIST MT05 (newswire) and the newsgroups portion of the GALE 2006 dry-run data. minimizing TER on Chinese resulted in significantly lower BLEU.
    So, TER was used in tuning the combination weights on Arabic and BLEU on Chinese.
    The sentence and phrase-level combination weights were tuned on NIST MT03 evaluation sets.
    On the tuning sets, both methods yield about 0.5%1.0% gain in TER and BLEU.
    The mixed-case TER and BLEU scores on both test sets are shown in Table 1 for Arabic and Table 2 for Chinese (phrcomb represents phrase and sentcomb sentence-level combination).
    The phrase-level combination seems to outperform the sentence-level combination in terms of both metrics on Arabic although gains over the best single system are modest, if any.
    On Chinese, the sentence-level combination yields higher BLEU scores than the phrase-level combination.
