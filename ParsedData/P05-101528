   Another choice is ordinal regression (McCullagh, 1980; Herbrich, Graepel, and Obermayer, 2000), which only considers the ordering on labels, rather than any explicit distances between them; this approach could work well if a good metric on labels is lacking.
    Also, one could use mixture models (e.g., combine &#8220;positive&#8221; and &#8220;negative&#8221; language models) to capture class relationships (McCallum, 1999; Schapire and Singer, 2000; Takamura, Matsumoto, and Yamada, 2004).
    We are also interested in framing multi-class but non-scale-based categorization problems as metric labeling tasks.
    For example, positive vs. negative vs. neutral sentiment distinctions are sometimes considered in which neutral means either objective (Engstr&#168;om, 2004) or a conflation of objective with a rating of mediocre (Das and Chen, 2001).
    (Koppel and Schler (2005) in independent work also discuss various types of neutrality.)
    In either case, we could apply a metric in which positive and negative
