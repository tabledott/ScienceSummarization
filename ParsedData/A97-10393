be unabashedly domain-specific, which is necessary in today's applications, since a broad-coverage implementation of a domain-independent theory of conceptual representations and their mapping to linguistic representations is still far from being realistic.
    Furthermore, there is no non-determinism in REALPRO: the input to REALPRO fully determines the output, though the input is a very abstract linguistic representation which is well suited for interfacing with knowledge-based applications.
    This means that REALPRO gives the developer control over the output, while taking care of the linguistic details.
  
  
    The architecture of REALPRO is based on MeaningText Theory, which posits a sequence of correspondences between different levels of representation.
    In REALPRO, each transformation is handled by a separate module.
    REALPRO is really a realizer shell, which allows for a (run-time) configuration using specially formatted Linguistic Knowledge Bases (LKBs) which state grammar rules, lexical en
