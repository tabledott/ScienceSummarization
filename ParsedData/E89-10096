 denotes the result of substituting E2 for all occurrences of El in EO.
    Rule II says that if we have a theorem Nl:P1 == L. where L contains N2:P2 as a subexpression, and we also have a theorem N2:P2 == G., then we can derive a theorem in which all occurrences of N2:P2 in L are replaced by G. In the simplest case, this means that we can interpret a sentence of the form N1:P1==N2:P2. as an inheritance specification meaning &amp;quot;the value of P1 at Ni is inherited from P2 at N2&amp;quot;.
    So for example, from: Rules III and IV are similar, but specify only a new node or path (not both) to inherit from.
    The other component (path or node) is unchanged, that is, it is the same as the corresponding component on the left-hand-side of the rule specifying the inheritance.
    In fact, the following two sentence schemas are entirely equivalent: Rules II, III, and IV implement a local notion of inheritance in the sense that the new node or path specifications are interpreted in the current local context.
