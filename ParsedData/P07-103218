obtain some idea of whether the schemes were converging, we performed the following oracle experiment.
    We took the CCG derivations from CCGbank corresponding to the sentences in DepBank, and forced the parser to produce goldstandard derivations, outputting the newly created GRs.
    Treating the DepBank GRs as a gold-standard, and comparing these with the CCGbank GRs, gave precision and recall scores of only 76.23% and 79.56% respectively (using the RASP evaluation tool).
    Thus given the current mapping, the perfect CCGbank parser would achieve an F-score of only 77.86% when evaluated against DepBank.
    On inspecting the output, it was clear that a number of general rules could be applied to bring the schemes closer together, which was implemented as a post-processing script.
    The first set of changes deals with coordination.
    One significant difference between DepBank and CCGbank is the treatment of coordinations as arguments.
    Consider the example The president and chief executive officer
