or is addressed by the second enhancement.
    We propose modifying the optimization criterion of training to perform ranking rather than classification of clusters.
    Consider a training example cluster with a negative label, indicating that not all of the noun phrases it contains are coreferent.
    A classification training algorithm will &#8220;penalize&#8221; all the features associated with this cluster, since they correspond to a negative example.
    However, because there may exists subsets of the cluster that are coreferent, features representing these positive subsets may be unjustly penalized.
    To address this problem, we propose constructing training examples consisting of one negative examWe propose augmenting the Pairwise Model to enable classification decisions over sets of noun phrases.
    Given a set of noun phrases xj = {xi}, let the binary random variable yj be 1 if all the noun phrases xi E xj are coreferent.
    The features fk and weights Ak are defined as before, but now the feat
