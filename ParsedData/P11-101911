el the grade relationships between scripts and do not need to apply a further regression step to fit the classifier output to the scoring scheme.
    The results reported in this paper are obtained by learning a linear classification function.
    We parsed the training and test data (see Section 2) using the Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing (RASP) system with the standard tokenisation and sentence boundary detection modules (Briscoe et al., 2006) in order to broaden the space of candidate features suitable for the task.
    The features used in our experiments are mainly motivated by the fact that lexical and grammatical features should be highly discriminative for the AA task.
    Our full feature set is as follows: Word unigrams and bigrams are lower-cased and used in their inflected forms.
    PoS unigrams, bigrams and trigrams are extracted using the RASP tagger, which uses the CLAWS4 tagset.
    The most probable posterior tag per word is used to construct PoS ngram features, but we use the RASP pars
