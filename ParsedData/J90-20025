etween the models and the data.
    Decoder = argmax Pr (S I T) = argmax Pr (S,T) A Decoder performs the actual translation.
    Given a sentence T in the target language, the decoder chooses a viable translation by selecting that sentence .&#167; in the source language for which the probability Pr (S I T) is maximum.
    System. next section we describe our language model for Pr(S), and in Section 3 we describe our translation model for Pr(TIS).
    In Section 4 we describe our search procedure.
    In Section 5 we explain how we estimate the parameters of our models from a large database of translated text.
    In Section 6 we describe the results of two experiments we performed using these models.
    Finally, in Section 7 we conclude with a discussion of some improvements that we intend to implement.
  
  
    Given a word string, s is2 .
    .
    . s, we can, without loss of generality, write Pr (s1s2 .
    .
    . sn) = Pr (si) Pr (s2I si) .
    .
    .
    Pr (sn I sis2 s,_ i).
    Thus, we can recast
