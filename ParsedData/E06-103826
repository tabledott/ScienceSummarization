 system are grammatical, but the removal of a prepositional phrase hurts the resulting meaning of the sentence.
    In fact, without the knowledge that the sentence is referring to broadband, the compressions are meaningless.
    This appears to be a harder problem &#8211; determining which prepositional phrases can be dropped and which cannot.
    The final, and more interesting, example presents two very different compressions by the human and our automatic system.
    Here, the human kept the relative clause relating what languages the source code is available in, but dropped the main verb phrase of the sentence.
    Our model preferred to retain the main verb phrase and drop the relative clause.
    This is most likely due to the fact that dropping the main verb phrase of a sentence is much less likely in the training data than dropping a relative clause.
    Two out of four evaluators preferred the compression returned by our system and the other two rated them equal.
