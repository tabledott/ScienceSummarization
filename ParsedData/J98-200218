    Recall that P(n) is obtained by MLE, namely, by normalizing the frequencies: where f(C) denotes the total frequency of nouns in class C in the sample S. and F is a tree cut.
    We note that, in fact, the maximum-likelihood estimate is one that minimizes the data description length L(S I F, 0).
    With description length defined in the above manner, we wish to select a model with the minimum description length and output it as the result of generalization.
    Since we assume here that every tree cut has an equal L(F), technically we need only calculate and compare L'(M, S) = L(O F) L(S F, e) as the description length.
    For simplicity, we will sometimes write just L'(F) for L'(A.4,S), where r is the tree cut of when /C4 and S are clear from context.
