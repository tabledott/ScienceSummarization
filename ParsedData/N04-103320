optimize any other parameter, e.g. the discounting parameter for the lexicon smoothing.
    Alignment Template System (AT).
    The alignment template system (Och et al., 1999) is similar to the system described in this work.
    One difference is that the alignment templates are not defined at the word level but at a word class level.
    In addition to the word-based trigram model, the alignment template system uses a classbased fivegram language model.
    The search algorithm of the alignment templates allows arbitrary reorderings of the templates.
    It penalizes reorderings with costs that are linear in the jump width.
    To make the results as comparable as possible, the alignment template system and the phrase-based system start from the same word alignment.
    The alignment template system uses discriminative training of the model scaling factors as described in (Och and Ney, 2002).
    We start with the Verbmobil results.
    We studied smoothing the lexicon probabilities as described in Section
