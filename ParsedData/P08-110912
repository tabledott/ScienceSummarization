iterations the improvement is closer to tenfold.
  
  
    Stochastic optimization methods have proven to be extremely efficient for the training of models involving computationally expensive objective functions like those encountered with our task (Vishwanathan et al., 2006) and, in fact, the on-line backpropagation learning used in the neural network parser of Henderson (2004) is a form of stochastic gradient descent.
    Standard deterministic optimization routines such as L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) make little progress in the initial iterations, often requiring several passes through the data in order to satisfy sufficient descent conditions placed on line searches.
    In our experiments SGD converged to a lower objective function value than L-BFGS, however it required far fewer iterations (see Figure 2) and achieved comparable test set performance to L-BFGS in a fraction of the time.
    One early experiment on WSJ15 showed a seven time speed up.
