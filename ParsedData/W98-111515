nction of edges.
    Note that regardless of 7/ the accuracy of the parse increases given extra time, but that all of the increase is achieved with only 1.5 to 2 times as many edges as needed for the first parse.
    For ij between 1.0 and 1.2, the highest accuracy is almost the same, about 75.2, but this value is reached with an average of slightly under 400 edges when 77 = 1.2, compared to about 650 when 7/ = 1.0.
  
  
    To better understand the experimental results it first behooves us to compare them to those achieved previously.
    Goodman's results (1997) are hard to compare against ours because his parser returns more than a singe best parse and because he measures processing time, not edges.
    However he does give edges/second for one of his 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 parsers and this plus his parsing times suggests that for him edges/sentence will measure in the tens of thousands &#8212; a far cry from our hundreds.
    Ratnaparki's (1997) beam search parsing procedure produces higher accuracy r
