items (sentences, or pairs of sentences) given in input, ii) the number of items (sentences or annotations) produced as output, iii) the number of items discarded when the agreement threshold was not reached, iv) the number of entailment pairs added to the corpus, v) the time (days and hours) required by the MTurk workforce to complete the job, and vi) the cost of the job.
    In HIT-1 (Paraphrase) 1,414 paraphrases were collected asking three different meaning-preserving modifications of each of the 467 original sentences12.
    From a practical point of view, such redundancy aims to ensure a sufficient number of grammatically correct and semantically equivalent modified sentences.
    From a theoretical point of view, collecting many variants of a small pool of original sentences aims to create pairs featuring different entailment relations with similar superficial forms.
    This, in principle, should allow to obtain a dataset which requires TE systems to focus more on deeper semantic phenomena than on the
