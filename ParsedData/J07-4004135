ctions in CCGbank&#8212; noun compounds being a prominent example&#8212;which are often incorrectly analyzed, simply because the required information is not in the Penn Treebank.
    Thus the evaluation on CCGbank overstates the accuracy of the parser, because it is tuned to produce the output in CCGbank, including constructions where the analysis is incorrect.
    A similar comment would apply to other parsers evaluated on, and using grammars extracted from, the Penn Treebank.
    A contribution of this section has been to highlight the difficulties associated with cross-formalism parser comparisons.
    Note that the difficulties are not unique to CCG, and many would apply to any cross-formalism comparison, especially with parsers using automatically extracted grammars.
    Parser evaluation has improved on the original PARSEVAL measures (Carroll, Briscoe, and Sanfilippo 1998), but the challenge still remains to develop a representation and evaluation suite which can be easily applied to a wide variety of p
