 scope as it only considers two-word constructions rather than naturally occurring sentences.
    Ideally, we would like to augment our evaluation with a task which is based on large quantities of natural data and for which vector composition has practical consequences.
    For these reasons, we used the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC) introduced by Dolan et al. (2004).
    The corpus consists of sentence pairs Seni1,Seni2 and labels indicating whether they are in a paraphrase relationship or not.
    The vector representations obtained from our various compositional models were used as features for the paraphrase classification task.
    The MSRPC dataset contains 5,801 sentence pairs, we used the standard split of 4,076 training pairs (67.5% of which are paraphrases) and 1,725 test pairs (66.5% of which are paraphrases).
    In order to judge whether two sentences have the same meaning we employ Fan et al. (2008)&#8217;s liblinear classifier.
    For each of our three vector sources and three d
