  4.7 Lexical Divergence Lexical divergence arises only in the context of other divergence types.
  21 This is be- cause the choice of lexical items in any language relies crucially on the realization and composition properties of those lexical items.
  Because the six preceding divergences potentially alter these properties, lexical divergence is viewed as a side effect of other divergences.
  Thus, the formalization thereof is considered to be some combination of those given above.
  Unlike the first six divergence types, lexical divergence is solved during the pro- cess of lexical selection.
  22Thus, there is no specific override marker that is used for this type of divergence.
  For example, in the lexical divergence (7), a conflational di- vergence forces the occurrence of a lexical divergence.
  The syntactic structures and corresponding CLCS for this example are shown here: (32) [C-MAX [I-MAX [N-MAX John] IV--MAX IV broke] [P-MAX into IN--MA
