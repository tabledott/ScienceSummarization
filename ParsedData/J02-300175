5 show the results when constituents are determined to be frame elements by setting the threshold on the probability P(fe  |p, h, t) to 0.5 and then running the labeling system of Section 4 on the resulting set of constituents.
    The first two columns of results show precision and recall for the task of identifying frame element boundaries correctly.
    The second pair of columns gives precision and recall for the combined task of boundary identification and role labeling; to be counted as correct, the frame element must both have the correct boundary and be labeled with the correct role.
    Contrary to our results using human-annotated boundaries, incorporating FEG priors into the system based on automatically identified boundaries had a negative effect on labeled precision and recall.
    No doubt this is due to introducing a dependency on other frame element decisions that may be incorrect: the use of FEG priors causes errors in boundary identification to be compounded.
