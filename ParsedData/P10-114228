es for pronoun resolution.
    Specifically, Yang et al. define tree kernels for efficiently computing the similarity between two parse trees, and Iida et al. use a boosting-based algorithm to compute the usefulness of a subtree.
    Grammatical features encode the grammatical properties of one or both NPs involved in an instance.
    For example, Ng and Cardie&#8217;s (2002c) resolver employs 34 grammatical features.
    Some features determine NP type (e.g., are both NPs definite or pronouns?).
    Some determine the grammatical role of one or both of the NPs.
    Some encode traditional linguistic (hard) constraints on coreference.
    For example, coreferent NPs have to agree in number and gender and cannot span one another (e.g., &#8220;Google&#8221; and &#8220;Google employees&#8221;).
    There are also features that encode general linguistic preferences either for or against coreference.
    For example, an indefinite NP (that is not in apposition to an anaphoric NP) is not likely to be coreferent wit
