he column labeled &amp;quot;Original Variables&amp;quot; in Table 1.
    Since each word group appears two times with the other group and three times by itself, we would normally consider the source and target groups somewhat similar but not strongly related.
    And indeed, the value of the Dice coefficient (254 = 0.4) intuitively corresponds to that assessment of similarity.4 Now, suppose that the &amp;quot;0&amp;quot;s and &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;s in X and Y are exchanged, so that the situation is now described by the last column of Table 1.
    The transformed variables now indicate that out of 100 sentences, the two word groups appear together 92 times, while each appears by itself three times and there are two sentences that contain none of the groups.
    We would consider such evidence to strongly indicate very high similarity between the two groups, and indeed the Dice coefficient of the transformed variables is now 4115 = 0.9684.
    However, the average mutual information of the variables would remai
