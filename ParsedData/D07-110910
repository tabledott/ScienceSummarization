a greater emphasis on the prior.
			This is equivalent to the need for balancing as noted by Abney and Light (1999).
			The other function that the Dirichlet prior serves is to enable us to encode any information we have about how we suspect the transitions to childrennodes will be distributed.
			For instance, we might ex pect that the words associated with a synset will beproduced in a way roughly similar to the token prob ability in a corpus.
			For example, even though ?meal?
			might refer to both ground cereals or food eaten ata single sitting and ?repast?
			exclusively to the lat ter, the synset [meal, repast, food eatenat a single sitting] still prefers to transi tion to ?meal?
			over ?repast?
			given the overall corpus counts (see Figure 1, which shows prior transition probabilities for ?revolver?).By setting ?s,i, the prior probability of transitioning from synset s to node i, proportional to the to tal number of observed tokens in the children of i, 1026we introduce a probabilistic variation on
