    Surprisingly, the use of clauses introduced by a (possibly empty) subordinating conjunction (SBAR), are actually positively correlated (and almost approaching significance) with readability.
    So while for children or less educated adults these constructions might pose difficulties, they were favored by our assessors.
    On the other hand, the average parse tree height negatively correlated with readability as expected, but surprisingly the correlation is very weak (-0.06).
    In their classic study of cohesion in English, (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) discuss the various aspects of well written discourse, including the use of cohesive devices such as pronouns, definite descriptions and topic continuity from sentence to sentence.4 To measure the association between these features and readability rankings, we compute the number ofpronouns per sentence (F11) and the number of definite articles per sentence (F12).
