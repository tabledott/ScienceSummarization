ure 3: Adjunct links ha,re higher weights Example 5.1.
			Comparing the two parses of the sentence "John read the story a,bout Kim" in Figure 3: in (a), lee about Kim\] is the co,n- plement of "story"; in (b), it is the a.djunct of "read".
			Since the adjunct dominance link from Vbar to PP has much higher weight than the complement dominance link from Nba.r to PP, the total weight of (a) is much smaller them the weight of (b).
			Therefore, only (a) is output as the parse tree of the sentence.
			Example 5.2.
