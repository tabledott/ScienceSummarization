    There are many important knowledge sources useful for coreference.
    We wanted to use those that are not too difficult to compute.
    One important factor is the distance between the two markables.
    McEnery, Tanaka, and Botley (1997) have done a study on how distance affects coreference, particularly for pronouns.
    One of their conclusions is that the antecedents of pronouns do exhibit clear quantitative patterns of distribution.
    The distance feature has different effects on different noun phrases.
    For proper names, locality of the antecedents may not be so important.
    We include the distance feature so that the learning algorithm can best decide the distribution for different classes of noun phrases.
    There are other features that are related to the gender, number, and semantic class of the two markables.
    Such knowledge sources are commonly used for the task of determining coreference.
    Our feature vector consists of a total of 12 features described below, and i
