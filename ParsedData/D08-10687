 richer linguistic features is a challenging problem.
    Our approach is instead based on Markov logic, a powerful representation for joint inference with uncertainty (Richardson &amp; Domingos, 2006).
    Like Haghighi and Klein&#8217;s, our model is cluster-based rather than pairwise, and implicitly imposes transitivity.
    We do not predetermine anaphoricity of a mention, but rather fuse it into the integrated resolution process.
    As a result, our model is inherently joint among mentions and subtasks.
    It shares several features with Haghighi &amp; Klein&#8217;s model, but removes or refines features where we believe it is appropriate to.
    Most importantly, our model leverages apposition and predicate nominals, which Haghighi &amp; Klein did not use.
    We show that this can be done very easily in our framework, and yet results in very substantial accuracy gains.
    It is worth noticing that Markov logic is also well suited for joint inference in supervised systems (e.g., transitivity, which t
