Grammar (Gross 1984), LTAG (Schabes and Joshi 1991), Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley 1991), and some version of GB (Chomsky 1992).
    Parsing, lexical semantics, and machine translation, to name a few areas, have all benefited from lexicalizatiort.
    Lexicalizatiort provides a clean interface for combining the syntactic and semantic information in the lexicon.
    We discuss the merits of lexicalization and other related issues in the context of partial parsing and briefly discuss Feature-based Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars (LTAGs) as a representative of the class of lexicalized grammars.
    Feature-based Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (FB-LTAG) (Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi 1975; Vijay-Shanker 1987; Schabes, Abeille, and Joshi 1988; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1991; Joshi and Schabes 1996) is a tree-rewriting grammar formalism unlike context-free grammars and head grammars, which are string-rewriting formalisms.
    The primitive elements of FB-LTAGs are called elementary trees.
