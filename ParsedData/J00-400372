into a version of the system called Version 2, using both automatic and manual evaluation_ In this section we discuss only the results of the individual heuristics; the overall results of Version 2 are discussed in Section 6.
    Bridging descriptions are much more sensitive than other types of definite descriptions to the local focus (Sidner 1979); for this reason, Version 2 uses a different search strategy for bridging descriptions than for other definite descriptions.
    Rather than considering all definite descriptions in the current window simultaneously, it goes back one sentence at a time and stops as soon as a relation with a potential anchor is found. five sentences.'
    The results of this search over our training corpus, in which 204 descriptions were classified as bridging, are shown in Table 16.
    It is interesting to note that the semantic relations found in this automatic search were not always those observed in our manual analysis.
    The main reason the figures are so low is that the exi
