-search (Sagae and Lavie, 2006a; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Titov and Henderson, 2007).
    This approach works well and produces highly competitive results.
    Beam search can be incorporated into our parser as well.
    We leave this investigation to future work.
    Strict left-to-right ordering is also prevalent in sequence tagging.
    Indeed, one major influence on our work is Shen et.al.&#8217;s bi-directional POS-tagging algorithm (Shen et al., 2007), which combines a perceptron learning procedure similar to our own with beam search to produce a state-of-the-art POStagger, which does not rely on left-to-right processing.
    Shen and Joshi (2008) extends the bidirectional tagging algorithm to LTAG parsing, with good results.
    We build on top of that work and present a concrete and efficient greedy non-directional dependency parsing algorithm.
    Structure Restrictions Eisner and Smith (2005) propose to improve the efficiency of a globally optimized parser by posing hard constraints on the lengths of
