estricted environments.
  Some nodes have sev- eral candidates of correspondence.
  For example, n7 corresponds with rn6 or m7.
  In this case, we select the most similar node.
  To do this, we assume that similarity values between odes (words) are defined as numeric values between 0 and 1 in a thesaurus.
  When the best matching is found, we can calculate the matching point between two environments, mpoint(TU, WD).
  mpoint (TU,  WD)  = summation of similarity values between corre- sponding nodes in two restricted environments ~t the best matching We use this value as a measure of similarity between two environments.
  Finally, we define the score of a translation unit, seore(TU, WD).
  score(TU, WD) = size(TU) x (size(Tg) + mpoiut(TU, WD)) For example, we assume that the following similarity vMues are defined in a thesaurus.
  250 4 s im([book,n] ,   [notebook,n] ,O.8).
  sire( [buy,v] , [read,v] ,0.5) .
  sire( [hon,n] , [nouto,n] ,0.8).
  s im(  [kau,v  ] ,  [yomu,v  ] ,O .5) .
  Then i.he scores of trans
