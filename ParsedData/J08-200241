onstraint does not lead to large gains in performance.
    The results in Figure 5 are from models that use the dynamic program for selecting non-overlapping arguments.
    To evaluate the gain from enforcing the constraint, Figure 6 shows the performance of the same local model using all features, when the dynamic program is used versus when a most likely possibly overlapping assignment is chosen in testing.
    The local model with basic plus additional features is our first pass model used in re-ranking.
    The non-overlapping constraint is enforced using the dynamic program.
    This is a state-of-the-art model.
    Its F-Measure on ALL arguments is 88.4 according to our argument-based scoring measure.
    This is very similar to the best reported results (as of 2004) using gold-standard parse trees without null constituents and functional tags: 89.4 F-Measure reported for the Pradhan et al. (2004) model.7 A more detailed analysis of the results obtained by the local model is given in Figure 7(a), and th
