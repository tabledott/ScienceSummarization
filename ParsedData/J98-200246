btained by averaging over the 10 data sets.
    We also implemented the exact method proposed by Hindle and Rooth (1991), which makes disambiguation judgement using the t-score.
    Figure 10 shows the result as LA.t, where the threshold for t-score is set to 1.28 (significance level of 90 percent.)
    From Figure 10 we see that with respect to accuracy-coverage curves, MDL outperforms both SA and LA throughout, while SA is better than LA.
    Next, we tested the method of applying a default rule after applying each method.
    That is, attaching (prep, noun2) to verb for the part of the test data for which no decision was made by the method in question.'
    We refer to these combined methods as MDL+Default, SA+Default, LA+Default, and LA.t+Default.
    Table 13 shows the results, again averaged over the 10 data sets.
    Finally, we used the transformation-based error-driven learning (TEL) to acquire transformation rules for each data set and applied the obtained rules to disambiguate the test data.
