in Figure 4, which is about the attribute arrival-city and consists of utterances A6 and U6, c(S4) is 2.
    Tagging by AVM attributes is also required to calculate the cost of some of the qualitative measures, such as number of repair utterances.
    (Note that to calculate such costs, each utterance in the corpus of dialogues must also be tagged with respect to the qualitative phenomenon in question, e.g. whether the utterance is a repair)&#176;) For example, let c2 be the number of repair utterances.
    The repair utterances in Figure 2 are A3 through U6, thus c2(D1) is 10 utterances and c2(S4) is 2 utterances.
    The repair utterance in Figure 3 is U2, but note that according to the AVM task tagging, U2 simultaneously addresses the information goals for depart-range.
    In general, if an utterance U contributes to the information goals of N different attributes, each attribute accounts for UN of any costs derivable from U.
    Thus, c2(D2) is .5.
    Given a set of ci, it is necessary to combine the di
