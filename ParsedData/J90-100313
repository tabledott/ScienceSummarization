P(x) P(y).)
    If /(x, y) &#171; 0, we would predict that x and y are in complementary distribution.
    However, we are rarely able to observe I(x, y) &#171; 0 because our corpora are too small (and our measurement techniques are too crude).
    Suppose, for example, that both x and y appear about 10 times per million words of text.
    Then, P(x) = P(y) = 10-5 and chance is P(x) P(x) = 10-1&#176;.
    Thus, to say that /(x, y) is much less than 0, we need to say that P(x, y) is much less than 10-1&#176;, a statement that is hard to make with much confidence given the size of presently available corpora.
    In fact, we cannot (easily) observe a probability less than 1/N , 10-7, and therefore it is hard to know if /(x, y) is much less than chance or not, unless chance is very large.
    (In fact, the pair a. .
    . doctors in Table 3, appears significantly less often than chance.
    But to justify this statement, we need to compensate for the window size (which shifts the score downward by 2.0, e.g. from
