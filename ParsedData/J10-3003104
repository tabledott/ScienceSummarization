    Recently, work has been done to generate phrasal paraphrases in specialized domains.
    For example, in the field of health literacy, it is well known that documents for health consumers are not very well-targeted to their purported audience.
    Recent research has shown how to generate a lexicon of semantically equivalent phrasal (and lexical) pairs of technical and lay medical terms from monolingual parallel corpora (Elhadad and Sutaria 2007) as well as monolingual comparable corpora (Del&#180;eger and Zweigenbaum 2009).
    Examples include pairs such as (myocardial infarction, heart attack) and (leucospermia, increased white cells in the sperm).
    In another domain, Max (2008) proposes an adaptation of the pivot-based method to generate rephrasings of short text spans that could help a writer revise a text.
    Because the goal is to assist a writer in making revisions, the rephrasings do not always need to bear a perfect paraphrastic relationship to the original, a scenario suited for the pi
