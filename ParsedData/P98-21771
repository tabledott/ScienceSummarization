    While this form of attachment ambiguity is usually easy for people to resolve, a computer requires detailed knowledge about words (e.g., washed vs. bought) in order to successfully resolve such ambiguities and predict the correct interpretation.
  
  
    Most of the previous successful approaches to this problem have been statistical or corpusbased, and they consider only prepositions whose attachment is ambiguous between a preceding noun phrase and verb phrase.
    Previous work has framed the problem as a classification task, in which the goal is to predict N or V, corresponding to noun or verb attachment, given the head verb v, the head noun n, the preposition p, and optionally, the object of the preposition n2.
    For example, the (v,n,p, n2) tuples corresponding to t
