ating the independence assumptions of the chart parser.
    The use of priors over FEGs further complicates matters by introducing sentence-level features dependent on the entire parse.
    For these reasons, we use the syntactic parsing model without frame element probabilities to generate a number of candidate parses, compute the best frame element assignment for each, and then choose the analysis with the highest overall probability.
    The frame element assignments are computed as in Section 7.1, with frame element probabilities being applied to every constituent in the parse.
    To return a large number of candidate parses, the parser was modified to include constituents in the chart even when they were equivalent, according to the parsing model, to a higher-probability constituent.
    Rather than choosing a fixed n and keeping the n best constituents for each entry in the chart, we chose a probability threshold and kept all constituents within a margin of the highest-probability constituent.
    Thus
