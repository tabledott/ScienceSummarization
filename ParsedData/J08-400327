t JxJ = p + 1 and Gx = (Vx,Ax) (Vx = {0, 1,...,p}).
    Consider the subgraph Gx, = (Vx &#8722; {p},A&#8722;p), where A&#8722;p = Ax &#8722; {(i,l,j)Ji = p V j = p}, that is, the graph Gx, is exactly like Gx except that the node p and all the arcs going into or out of this node are missing.
    It is obvious that, if Gx is a projective dependency forest for the sentence x = (w0, w1, ... , wp), then Gx, is a projective dependency forest for the sentence x' = (w0, w1,... , wp&#8722;1), and that, because Jx'J = p, there is a transition sequence C0,q such that Gc = Gx, (in virtue of the inductive hypothesis).
    The terminal configuration of G0,q must have the form cq = (&#963;cq, [ ],A&#8722;p), where i E &#963;cq if and only if i is a root in Gx, (else i would have been removed in a LEFT-ARCl or RIGHT-ARCsl transition).
    It follows that, in Gx, i is either a root or a dependent of p. In the latter case, any j such that j E &#963;cq and i &lt; j must also be a dependent of p (else Gx would not be projective,
