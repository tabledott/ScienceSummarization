e them pattern parameters.
    With different context assumptions, we reach different variations of the model.
    In particular, we consider three assumptions, as follows: where tk is a semantic category or a NL word, and mj is an MR production.
    In other words, generation of the next NL word depends on its direct parent MR production only.
    Such a Unigram Model may help in recall (the number of correct outputs over the total number of inputs), because it requires the least data to estimate.
    Model II We make the following assumption: where tk&#8722;1 is the semantic category or NL word to the left of tk, i.e., the previous semantic category or NL word.
    In other words, generation of the next NL word depends on its direct parent MR production as well as the previously generated NL word or semantic category only.
    This model is also referred to as Bigram Model.
    This model may help in precision (the number of correct outputs over the total number of outputs), because it conditions on a large
