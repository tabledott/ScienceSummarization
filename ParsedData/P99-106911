training corpus, we maximize the conditional likelihood of these analyses given the observed yields.
    In our experiments, we have used a conjugate-gradient optimization program adapted from the one presented in Press et al. (1992).
    Regardless of the pragmatic (computational) motivation, one could perhaps argue that the conditional probabilities Po(wly) are as useful (if not more useful) as the full probabilities Po(w), at least in those cases for which the ultimate goal is syntactic analysis.
    Berger et al. (1996) and Jelinek (1997) make this same point and arrive at the same estimator, albeit through a maximum entropy argument.
    The problem of estimating parameters for log-linear models is not new.
    It is especially difficult in cases, such as ours, where a large sample space makes the direct computation of expectations infeasible.
    Many applications in spatial statistics, involving Markov random fields (MRF), are of this nature as well.
    In his seminal development of the MRF approach t
