9).
    The header dataset contains 935 headers.
    Following previous research (Seymore et al., 1999; McCallum et al., 2000; Han et al., 2003), for each trial we randomly select 500 for training and the remaining 435 for testing.
    We refer this dataset as H. The reference dataset was created by the Cora project (McCallum et al., 2000).
    It contains 500 references, we use 350 for training and the rest 150 for testing.
    References contain 13 fields: author, title, editor, booktitle, date, journal, volume, tech, institution, pages, location, publisher, note.
    We refer this dataset as R. To give a comprehensive evaluation, we measure performance using several different metrics.
    In addition to the previously-used word accuracy measure (which overemphasizes accuracy of the abstract field), we use perfield F1 measure (both for individual fields and averaged over all fields&#8212;called a &#8220;macro average&#8221; in the information retrieval literature), and whole instance accuracy for measuring
