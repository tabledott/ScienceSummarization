applying them in a different order, using the corpus for evaluation.
    We discuss all the heuristics that we tried in Section 4, and our evaluation of them in Section 5.
    The overall architecture of our system is shown in Figure 1.
    The system attempts to classify each definite description as either direct anaphora,. discourse-new, or bridging description.
    In addition to this classification, the system tries to identify the antecedents of anaphoric descriptions and the anchors (Fraurud 1990) of bridging descriptions.
    The system processes parsed newswire texts from the Penn Treebank I, constructing a fairly simple discourse model that consists of a list of discourse entities that may serve as potential antecedents (which we call simply potential antecedents), according to the chosen segmentation algorithm (see below).
    The system uses the discourse model, syntactic information, and a small amount of lexical information to classify definite descriptions as discourse-new or to link them to anc
