ntice is currently working on satisfying Ii, the utterance-level intentions of utterances (5) and (12), and general knowledge about the task.
    The satisfaction-precedence relations among 12, 13, and 14 are not communicated directly in the dialogue, but, like dominance relations, depend on domain knowledge.
    One piece of relevant knowledge is that a satisfaction precedence relation exists between loosening the setscrews and pulling off the flywheel.
    That relation is shared knowledge that is stated directly (First loosen ..., then pull).
    The relation, along with the fact that both 12 and 13 contribute to loosening the setscrews, and that 14 contributes to pulling off the flywheel, makes it possible to conclude 13 SP 14 and 12 SP 14.
    To conclude that 12 SP 13, the apprentice must employ knowledge of how to go about loosening screw-like objects.
    The dominance and satisfaction-precedence relations for this task-oriented fragment form a tree of intentions rather than just a partial ordering.
