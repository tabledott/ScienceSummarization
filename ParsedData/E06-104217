In our experiments we double the weights of Learners A and D. In our example, this results in sentence 3 now being correctly attracted to the nonliteral set.
    Even before voting, we attempt to improve the correctness of initial attractions through the use of SuperTags, which allows us to add internal structure information to the bag-of-words feature lists.
    SuperTags (Bangalore &amp; Joshi, 1999) encode a great deal of syntactic information in a single tag (each tag is an elementary tree from the XTAG English Tree Adjoining Grammar).
    In addition to a word&#8217;s part of speech, they also encode information about its location in a syntactic tree &#8211; i.e. we learn something about the surrounding words as well.
    We devised a SuperTag trigram composed of the SuperTag of the target word and the following two words and their SuperTags if they contain nouns, prepositions, particles, or adverbs.
    This is helpful in cases where the same set of features can be used as part of both literal and nonli
