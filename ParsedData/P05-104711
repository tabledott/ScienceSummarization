Information Content (IC) of a synset c thus IC(c) = &#8722; log(Pr(c)).
    For two senses, s1 and s2, the lowest common subsumer, lcs(s1, s2), is defined as the sense with the highest information content (most specific) which subsumes both senses in the WordNet hierarchy.
    Jiang and Conrath used these elements to calculate the semantic distance between a pair or words, w1 and w2, according to this formula (where senses(w) is the set 'The cosine metric for a pair of vectors is given by the calculation &#65533;&#65533;&#65533; s&#65533;ss&#65533;s .
    Substituting the matrix multiplication in the numerator of Equation 1 for the dot product of vectors a and b would give the cosine metric.
    Note that taking the dot product of a pair of vectors is equivalent to multiplying by the identity matrix, i.e. a.b = aICT.
    Under our interpretation of the similarity matrix, W, this equates to each pattern element-filler pair being identical to itself but not similar to anything else.
