n the arguments and adjuncts can be kept the same.
    However, we did notice that this simple &#8220;ostrich&#8221; treatment caused outputs such as &#8220;foreign financial institutions the president of&#8221;.
    While statistical modeling of children reordering is one possible remedy for this problem, we believe simple linguistic treatment is another, as the output of the SDIG system is an English dependency tree rather than a string of words.
  
  
    In this paper we presented a syntax-based statistical MT system based on a Synchronous Dependency Insertion Grammar and a non-isomorphic stochastic tree-to-tree transducer.
    A graphical model for the transducer is defined and a polynomial time decoding algorithm is introduced.
    The results of our current implementation were evaluated using the NIST and Bleu automatic MT evaluation software.
    The evaluation shows that the SDIG system outperforms an IBM Model 4 based system in both speed and quality.
    Future work includes a full-fledged version
