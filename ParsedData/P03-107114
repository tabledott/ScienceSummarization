 test corpora, according to a one-sided ttest of the null hypothesis of equal mean at the 0.01 level.
    It is not clear whether our algorithm is better than (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001) (U00).
    When the number of segments is provided to the algorithms, our algorithm is significantly better than Utiyama&#8217;s on WSJ, better on Brown (but not significant), and significantly worse on TDT.
    When the number of boundaries is unknown, our algorithm is insignificantly worse on Brown, but significantly better on WSJ and TDT &#8211; the two corpora designed to have a varying number of segments per document.
    In the case of the Meeting corpus, none of the algorithms are significantly different than the others, due to the the table are the results of significance tests between U00 and LCseg.
    Bold-faced values are scores that are statistically significant. small test set size.
    In conclusion, LCseg has a performance comparable to state-of-the-art text segmentation algorithms, with the added advantage of
