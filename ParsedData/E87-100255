uot;start&amp;quot; state and continues to return there so long as no frame is encountered involving a &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; on the template tape.
    A &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; transition causes a nondeterministic choice.
    If the root tape moves at the same time as the &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; is scanned, the transducer goes into its &amp;quot;no-spread&amp;quot; state, to which it continues to return so long as every move over a &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; on the prosodic tape is accompanied by a move over a consonant on the root tape.
    In other words, it must be possible to complete the process without spreading consonants.
    The other alternative is that the transducer should enter the &amp;quot;geminate&amp;quot; state over a transition over a in the template with the root tape remaining stationary.
    The transitions at the &amp;quot;geminate&amp;quot; state allow both spreading and nonspreading transitions.
    In summary, spreading can occur only if the transducer never leaves the &amp;quot;start&amp;quo
