ord.
  The method he uses has to overcome a combinatorial explosion 6 controlling the size of the window and "freezing" the senses for all the nouns preceding the noun to be disambiguated.
  In order to fieeze the winning sense Sussnas algorithm is forced to make a unique choice.
  When Conceptual Distance is not able to choose a single sense, the algorithm chooses one at random.
  Conceptual Density overcomes the combinatorial explosion extending the notion of conceptual distance from a pair of words to n words, and therefore can yield more than one correct sense for a word.
  For comparison, we altered our algorithm to also make random choices when unable to choose a single sense.
  We applied the algorithm Sussna considers best, 4We tried both mutual information and association ratio, and the later performed better.
  5The results of our algorithm are those for window size 30, file matches and overall.
  6In our replication of his experiment he mutual constraint for the first 10 nouns (tile optimal window
