			We presented an extension of the state-of-the-artphrase-based approach to statistical machine trans lation that allows the straight-forward integration of additional information, may it come from linguistic tools or automatically acquired word classes.
			We reported on experiments that showed gains over standard phrase-based models, both in terms of automatic scores (gains of up to 2% BLEU), as well as a measure of grammatical coherence.
			These experiments demonstrate that within the frameworkof factored translation models additional informa tion can be successfully exploited to overcome someshort-comings of the currently dominant phrase based statistical approach.
			The framework of factored translation models is very general.
			Many more models that incorporatedifferent factors can be quickly built using the ex isting implementation.
			We are currently exploringthese possibilities, for instance use of syntactic in
