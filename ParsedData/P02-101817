me subtree in the training corpus during empty node recovery, as explained in the text. derived from the corpus to be evaluated.
    Then as is standard, the precision P, recall R and f-score f are calculated as follows: Table 3 provides these measures for two different test corpora: (i) a version of section 23 of the Penn Treebank from which empty nodes, indices and unary branching chains consisting of nodes of the same category were removed, and (ii) the trees produced by Charniak&#8217;s parser on the strings of section 23 (Charniak, 2000).
    To evaluate co-indexation of empty nodes and their antecedents, we augment the representation of empty nodes as follows.
    The augmented representation for empty nodes consists of the triple of category plus string positions as above, together with the set of triples of all of the non-empty nodes the empty node is co-indexed with.
    (Usually this set of antecedents is either empty or contains a single node).
