e that the notion of a unifier of such objects and most general unifier (mgu) are well defined; the symbol 0 will be used for unifiers.
  Following Pereira and Warren, the lemmas we will be proving from a grammar and a set of premises will include the same kind of conditional information encoded by the items of Earleys parsing algorithm.
  In Earleys algorithm, the existence of an item (or dotted rule) of the form in state set j &gt; i makes a claim that, for some string position k &gt; j , the  substring between i and k can be classified as an N if the sub- str!ng between j and k can be decomposed into a sequence of strings classified, respectively, under Vm,..., V~.
  We will use a notation rem- iniscent of Pereira and Warrens t to emphasize the conditional nature of the claim and its independence from V1,.. .
  ,  V,n-1, namely, [i,N *-- V,~.. Vn,j] 2.1 Termino logy We digress here to introduce some terminology.
  If n = 0, then we will leave off the arrow; [i, N,j] then expresses the fact that a constitue
