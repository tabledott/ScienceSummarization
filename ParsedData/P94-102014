rent types of contextual features: morphological, collocation-specific, and classbased, with part-of-speech (POS) categories serving as the word classes.
    Within these classes, we choose a number of specific features, each of which was judged to be informative as described above.
    We used one morphological feature: a dichotomous variable indicating the presence or absence of the plural form.
    The values of the class-based variables are a set of twenty-five POS tags formed, with one exception, from the first letter of the tags used in the Penn Treebank corpus.
    Two different sets of class-based variables were selected.
    The first set contained only the POS tags of the word immediately preceding and the word immediately succeeding the ambiguous word, while the second set was extended to include the FOS tags of the two immediately preceding and two succeeding words.
    A limited number of collocation-specific variables were selected, where the term collocation is used loosely to refer to a specif
