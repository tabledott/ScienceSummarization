on operation involving dtrees is called sister-adjunction.
    When a d-tree a is sister-adjoined at a node ri in a d-tree 13 the composed d-tree 7 results from the addition to fl of a as a new leftmost or rightmost sub-d-tree below I).
    Note that sister-adjunction involves the addition of exactly one new immediate domination edge and that several sister-adjunctions can occur at the same node.
    Sister-adjoining constraints specify where d-trees can be sister-adjoined and whether they will be right- or left-sister-adjoined (see below).
    A DTG is a four tuple G = (ITN , VT S, D) where VN and VT are the usual nonterminal and terminal alphabets, S E VN is a distinguished nonterminal and D is a finite set of elementary d-trees.
    A DTG is said to be lexicalized if each d-tree in the grammar has at least one terminal node.
    The elementary d-trees of a grammar G have two additional annotations: subsertion-insertion constraints and sister-adjoining constraints.
    These will be described below, but fir
