 Microsoft and Corp., which are in turn distinct from the company.
    This approach is only a rough approximation to fully fledged coreference resolution, but it is simple from an implementational perspective and produces consistent results across domains and languages.
    Grammatical Function.
    Several entity-based approaches assert that grammatical function is indicative of an entity&#8217;s prominence in discourse (Hudson, Tanenhaus, and Dell 1986; Kameyama 1986; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995).
    Most theories discriminate between subject, object, and the remaining grammatical roles: subjects are ranked higher than objects, and these are ranked higher than other grammatical functions.
    In our framework, we can easily assess the impact of syntactic knowledge by modifying how transitions are represented in the entity grid.
    In syntactically aware grids, transitions are expressed by four categories: s, o, x and &#8211;, whereas in simplified grids, we only
