 e.g., (16.1,16.2).
    However, the algorithm has the potential to assign multiple boundaries between adjacent prosodic phrases.
    The example shown in Figure 4 has one boundary site available to the human subjects, between 3.1 and 3.2.
    Because 3.1 consists of multiple FICs (6 and 7) the algorithm can and does assign 2 boundaries here: (6,7) and (7,8).
    To normalize the algorithm output, we reduce multiple boundaries at a boundary site to one, here (7,8).
    A total of 5 boundaries are eliminated in 3 of the 10 test narratives (out of 213 in all 10).
    All the remaining boundaries (here (3.1,3.2)) fall into class b of Table 2.
    The algorithm operates on the principle that if an NP in the current FIC provides a referential link to the current segment, the current segment continues.
    However, NPs and pronouns are treated differently based on the notion of focus (cf.
    (Passonneau, 1993a).
    A third person definite pronoun provides a referential link if its index occurs anywhere in the cur
