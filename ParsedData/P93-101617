    For example, in the tensed I in [ip e came] governs but does not properly govern the trace e. On the other hand, e' properly governs but does not govern e (Haegeman, 1991, p.456).
    Here, we define proper government to be a subclass of government: Proper government: A properly governs B if A governs B and A is a 0-role assigner (A do not have to assign 0-role to B).
    Therefore, if an item have both +govern and one of +theta or +subj-theta, then the head of the item properly governs the non-head source items and their sources that are reachable via a sequence of non-barrier links.
    This definition unifies the notions of government and proper government.
    In (4), e is properly governed by tensed I, e' is properly governed by &amp;quot;think&amp;quot;.
    This definition won't be able to account for difference between (4) and (5) (That-Trace Effect (Haegeman, 1991, p.456)): However, That-Trace Effect can be explained by a separate principle.
    The proper
