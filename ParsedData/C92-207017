  For many applications such as speech synthesis and assignment to an established ictionary sense number or possible French translations, this merging of Roget classes is not necessary.
  The primary criterion for success is that words are partitioned into pure sense clusters.
  Words having a different sense from the majority sense of a partition are graded as errors.
  5) Examples with the ammtation speech synthesis have multiple pronunciations corresponding to sense distinctions.
  Their disambiguafion is important in speech processing.
  6) All results are based on 100% recall.
