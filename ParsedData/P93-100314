    This results in a set of single word correspondences for the internal words in noun phrases.
    Reducing Ambiguity: The basic algorithm assumes that noun phrases can be uniquely identified in both languages, which is only true for simple noun phrases.

    If prepositional phrases involving &amp;quot;for&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; were also permitted, these phrases would be correctly identified; however many other adverbial prepositional phrases would also be incorrectly attached to noun phrases.
    If all embedded prepositional phrases were permitted by the noun phrase recognizer, the algorithm could be used to reduce the degree of ambiguity between alternatives.
