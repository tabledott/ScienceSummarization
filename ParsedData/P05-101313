ion is based on six word tokens, the two topmost tokens on the stack, and the next four input tokens.
    For each token, three types of features may be taken into account: the word form; the part-of-speech assigned by an automatic tagger; and labels on previously assigned dependency arcs involving the token &#8211; the arc from its head and the arcs to its leftmost and rightmost dependent, respectively.
    Except for the left3The graphs satisfy all the well-formedness conditions given in section 2 except (possibly) connectedness.
    For robustness reasons, the parser may output a set of dependency trees instead of a single tree. most dependent of the next input token, dependency type features are limited to tokens on the stack.
    The prediction based on these features is a knearest neighbor classification, using the IB1 algorithm and k = 5, the modified value difference metric (MVDM) and class voting with inverse distance weighting, as implemented in the TiMBL software package (Daelemans et al., 2003).
