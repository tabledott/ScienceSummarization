).
  This commonality among the measures suggests that if we were to partition the set of all word pairs into those that are deemed to be related and those that are deemed unrelated, the boundary between the two subsets for each measure (and for the human judgments, for that matter) would lie somewhere within these regions.
  4.4.3 The Limitations of this Analysis.
  While comparison with human judgments is the ideal way to evaluate a measure of similarity or semantic relatedness, in practice the tiny amount of data available (and only for similarity, not relatedness) is quite inadequate.
  But constructing a large-enough set of pairs and obtaining human judgments on them would be a very large task.14 Even more importantly, there are serious methodological problems with this ap- proach.
  It was implicit in the Rubenstein?Goodenough and Miller?Charles experiments that subjects were to use the dominant sense of the target words or mutually triggering related senses.
  But often what we are really interested in
