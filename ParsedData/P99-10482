uot; and &amp;quot;the Golden Gate Bridge.&amp;quot; These are instances of definite descriptions that a coreference resolver does not need to resolve because they each fully specify a cognitive representation of the entity in the reader's mind.
    One way to address this problem is to create a list of all non-anaphoric NPs that could be used as a filter prior to coreference resolution, but hand coding such a list is a daunting and intractable task.
    We propose a corpusbased mechanism to identify non-anaphoric NPs automatically.
    We will refer to non-anaphoric definite noun phrases as existential NPs (Allen, 1995).
    Our algorithm uses statistical methods to generate lists of existential noun phrases and noun phrase patterns from a training corpus.
    These lists are then used to recognize existential NPs in new texts.
  
  
    Computational coreference resolvers fall into two categories: systems that make no attempt to identify non-anaphoric discourse entities prior to coreference resolution, and
