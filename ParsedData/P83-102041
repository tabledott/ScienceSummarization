e here is not an important fact.
    The analysis goes through equally as well with a full X-bar theoretic phrase component: the story is just much longer.)
    The upshot of this is that upon encountering constructions like (11), the parser can proceed by simply assuming that the structures are conjoined at the highest level possible, using different names for each of the potential highest level constituents.
    It can then analyze the (potentially) coordinate structures entirely independently of feedback from pragmatic and semantic knowledge sources.
    When higher cognitive processing of this description requires distinguishing at what level the structures are conjoined, pragmatics can be invoked where needed, but there need be no interaction with syntactic processes themselves.
    This is because, once again, it turns out if it is syntactically possible that structures should be conjoined at a lower level than that initially posited, the names of the potentially separate constituents simply can be view
