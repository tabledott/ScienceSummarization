istic similarity value for the given two words and the heuristic similarity values for each corresponding node in the two IOB chains.
    If this score is higher than some threshold and the two words have similar positions in their respective sentences, then the words are considered to be a match and can be aligned.
    Given this alignment algorithm, the word lattice representing the global alignment is constructed in an iterative manner similar to the MSA approach.
    Shen et al. (2006) present evidence from a manual evaluation that sentences sampled from lattices constructed via the syntactically informed alignment method receive higher grammaticality scores as compared to sentences from the lattices constructed via the purely lexical method.
    However, they present no analysis of the actual paraphrasing capacity of their, presumably better aligned, lattices.
    Indeed, they explicitly mention that their primary goal is to measure the correlation between the syntax-augmented scoring function and the co
