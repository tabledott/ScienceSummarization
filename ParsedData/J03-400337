    We use the smoothing method described in Bikel et al. (1997), which is derived from a method described in Witten and Bell (1991).
    First, say that the most specific estimate e1 = n1 f1 ; that is, f1 is the value of the denominator count in the relative frequency estimate.
    Second, define u1 to be the number of distinct outcomes seen in the f1 events in training data.
    The variable u1 can take any value from one to f1 inclusive.
    Then we set Analogous definitions for f2 and u2 lead to A2 = f2 f2+5u2 .
    The coefficient five was chosen to maximize accuracy on the development set, section 0 of the treebank (in practice it was found that any value in the range 2&#8211;5 gave a very similar level of performance).
    All words occurring less than six times14 in training data, and words in test data that have never been seen in training, are replaced with the UNKNOWN token.
    This allows the model to handle robustly the statistics for rare or new words.
