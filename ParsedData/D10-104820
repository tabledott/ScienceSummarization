Person &#8211; we assign person attributes only to pronouns.
    However, we do not enforce this constraint when linking two pronouns if one appears within quotes.
    This is a simple heuristic for speaker detection, e.g., I and she point to the same person in &#8220;[I] voted my conscience,&#8221; [she] said.
    Animacy &#8211; we set animacy attributes using: (a) a static list for pronouns; (b) NER labels, e.g., PERSON is animate whereas LOCATION is not; and (c) a dictionary boostrapped from the web (Ji and Lin, 2009).
    NER label &#8211; from the Stanford NER.
    If we cannot detect a value, we set attributes to unknown and treat them as wildcards, i.e., they can match any other value.
    This final model raises the pairwise recall of our system almost 22 percentage points, with only an 8 point drop in pairwise precision.
    Table 2 shows that similar behavior is measured for all other metrics.
    After all passes have run, we take the transitive closure of the generated clusters as the system outp
