  Transliteration Of Proper Names In Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval
  
    We address the problem of transliterating English names using Chinese orthography in support of cross-lingual speech and text processing applications.
    We demonstrate the application of statistical machine translation techniques to &#8220;translate&#8221; the phonemic representation of an English name, obtained by using an automatic text-to-speech system, to a sequence of initials and finals, commonly used subword units of pronunciation for Chinese.

    Translation of proper names is generally recognized as a significant problem in many multi-lingual text and speech processing applications.
    Even when hand-crafted translation lexicons used for machine translation (MT) and
