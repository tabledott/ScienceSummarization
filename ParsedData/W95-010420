 their lack of independence.
    This is only a heuristic because we could imagine collocations that do not overlap, but still conflict.
    Note, incidentally, that there can be at most two non-conflicting collocations for any decision &#8212; one matching on the left-hand side of the target word, and one on the right.
    Having said that we resolve conflicts between two collocations by eliminating one of them, we still need to specify which one.
    Our approach is to assign each one a strength, just as Yarowsky [1994] does in his hybrid method, and to eliminate the one with the lower strength.
    This preserves the strongest non-conflicting evidence as the basis for our answer.
    The strength of a collocation reflects its reliability for decision-making; a further discussion of strength is deferred to Section 3.4.
    Figure 2 ties together the preceding discussion into an outline of the method of collocations.
    The method is described in terms of &amp;quot;features&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;c
