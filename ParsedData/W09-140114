  Approximate span matching The approximate span matching mode is defined by relaxing the requirement for text span matching for t-entities.
    Specifically, a given span is equivalent to a gold span if it is entirely contained within an extension of the gold span by one word both to the left and to the right, that is, beg1 &#8805; ebeg2 and end1 &#8804; eend2, where (beg1, end1) is the given span and (ebeg2, eend2) is the extended gold span.
    Approximate recursive matching In strict matching, for a regulation event to be correct, the events it refers to as theme or cause must also be be strictly correct.
    The approximate recursive matching mode is defined by relaxing the requirement for recursive event matching, so that an event can match even if the events it refers to are only partially correct.
    Specifically, for partial matching, only Theme arguments are considered: events can match even if referred events differ in non-Theme arguments.
