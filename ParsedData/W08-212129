    Nineteen groups submitted test runs in the closed challenge and five groups participated in the open challenge.
    Three of the latter groups participated only in the open challenge, and two of these submitted results only for the semantic subtask.
    These results are summarized in Tables 10 and 11.
    Table 10 summarizes the official results &#8211; i.e., results at evaluation deadline &#8211; for the closed challenge.
    Note that several teams corrected bugs and/or improved their systems and they submitted post-evaluation scores (accounted in the shared task website).
    The table indicates that most of the top results cluster together: three systems had a labeled macro F1 score on the WSJ+Brown corpus around 82 points (che, ciaramita, and zhao); five systems scored around 79 labeled macro F1 points (yuret, samuelsson, zhang, henderson, and watanabe).
    Remarkably, the top-sc
