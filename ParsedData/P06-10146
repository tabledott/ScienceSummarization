m the gloss of S, hyperWN(S) from the noun and verb taxonomy, and domainsWN(S) from the subject field codes, i.e. domain labels produced semi-automatically by Magnini and Cavagli`a (2000) for each WordNet synset (we exclude the general-purpose label, called FACTOTUM).
    For example, for the first WordNet sense of race#n we obtain the following description: In the case of the ODE, def ODE(S) is generated from the definitions of the core sense and the subsenses of the entry S. Hypernymy (for nouns only) and domain labels, when available, are included in the respective sets hyperODE(S) and domainsODE(S).
    For example, the first ODE sense of race#n is described as follows: Notice that, for every S, dD(S) is non-empty as a definition is always provided by both dictionaries.
    This approach to sense descriptions is general enough to be applicable to any other dictionary with similar characteristics (e.g. the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English in place of ODE).
