on part-of-speech tagging and word-alignment technologies to extract candidate terms and translations.
    It then sorts the extracted candidates and presents them to the user along with reference concordance lines, supporting efficient construction of glossaries.
    The tool is currently being used by the translators at AT&amp;T Business Translation Services (formerly AT&amp;T Language Line Services).
    Termight may prove useful in contexts other than human-based translation.
    Primarily, it can support customization of machine translation (MT) lexicons to a new domain.
    In fact, the arguments for constructing a job-specific glossary for human-based translation may hold equally well for an MT-based process, emphasizing the need for a productivity tool.
    The monolingual component of termight can be used to construct terminology lists in other applications, such as technical writing, book indexing, hypertext linking, natural language interfaces, text categorization and indexing in digital libraries
