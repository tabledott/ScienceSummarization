pendent module in a more complex sequence-tosequence translation model.'
    The independence of such a module is desirable for two reasons, one practical and one philosophical.
    The practical reason is illustrated in this article: Order-independent translation models can be accurately estimated more efficiently in isolation.
    The philosophical reason is that words are an important epistemological category in our naive mental representations of language.
    We have many intuitions (and even some testable theories) about what words are and how they behave.
    We can bring these intuitions to bear on our translation models without being distracted by other facets of language, such as phrase structure.
    For example, the translation models presented in the last two chapters of Melamed (to appear) capture the intuitions that words can have multiple senses and that spaces in text do not necessarily delimit words.
