sform 7-1 = (V, &#163;) into a regular graph with typed nodes by (1) marking all vertices v E V with the symbol V and (2) replacing each hyperedge e E &#163;, 1, with a small subgraph consisting of a new vertex whose incoming and outgoing edges connect the same head an input: associative map a: V --+ Env(V), hyperarc e output: Minkowski sum of envelopes over T(e) in the transformed graph as were connected by e in the original graph.
    The unique outgoing edge of v&#8743;(e) is associated with the rule re; incoming edges are not linked to any rule.
    Figure 2 illustrates the transformation for a hyperedge with arity 3.
    The graph transformation is isomorphic.
    The rules associated with every hyperedge specify how line segments in the envelopes of a hyperedge&#8217;s tail nodes can be combined.
    Suppose we have a hyperedge e with rule re : X &#8212;* aX1bX2c and T(e) = {v1, v2}.
    Then we substitute X1 and X2 in the rule with candidate translations associated with line segments in envelopes Env(v
