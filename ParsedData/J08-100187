 accuracy with half of the training data.
    The inclusion of discourse-based features consistently increases accuracy irrespective of the amount of training data available.
    Figure 3 thus suggests that better feature engineering is likely to bring further performance improvements on the readability task.
    Our results indicate that the entity-based text representation introduced here captures aspects of text readability and can be successfully incorporated into a practical system.
    Coherence is by no means the sole predictor of readability.
    In fact, on its own, it performs poorly on this task as demonstrated when using either LSA or the entitybased feature space without Schwarm and Ostendorf&#8217;s (2005) features (see rows 5&#8211;7 in Table 10).
    Rather, we claim that coherence is one among many factors contributing to text readability and that our entity-grid representation is well-suited for text classification tasks such as reading level assessment.
    In this article we proposed a nov
