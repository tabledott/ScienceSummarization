  Suppose that two coders are coding 100 occurrences of Okay.
    The two coders label 40 occurrences as Accept and 25 as Ack.
    The remaining 35 are labeled as Ack by one coder and as Accept by the other (as in Example 6 in Figure 4); KCo = 0.418, but KS&amp;C = 0.27.
    These two values are really at odds.
    Step 1.
    For each category j, compute the overall proportion pj,l of items assigned to j by each coder l. In a contingency table, each row and column total divided by N corresponds to one such proportion for the corresponding coder.
    Assumption of equal distributions among coders (Siegel and Castellan) Step 1.
    For each category j, compute pj, the overall proportion of items assigned to j.
    In an agreement table, the column totals give the total counts for each category j, hence: Step 3.
    P(E), the likelihood of coders&#8217; accidentally assigning the same category to a given item, is The computation of P(E) and &#954; according to Cohen (left) and to Siegel and Castellan (right).
