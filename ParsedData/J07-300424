ch approximate the underlying predicate&#8211;argument structure.
    This is done by a bottom-up procedure, which simply retraces the steps in the CCG derivation that we have now obtained.
    The CCG derivation with corresponding dependencies and dependency graph for example (9).
    All categories in CCGbank, including results and arguments of complex categories, are associated with a corresponding list of lexical heads.
    This list can be empty (in the case of yet uninstantiated arguments of functor categories), or it can consist of one or more tokens.
    Lexical categories have one lexical head, the word itself&#8212;for example, He for the first NP, and is for the (S[dcl]\NP)/(S[b]\NP).
    All dependencies are defined in terms of the heads of lexical functor categories and of their arguments.
    In order to distinguish the slots filled by different arguments, we number the arguments of complex lexical categories from left to right in the category notation (that is, from innermost to outermost argum
