nts of relations.
    Recently developed named entity taggers work quite well and are able to extract named entities from text at a practically useful level.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    We discuss prior work and their limitations in section 2.
    We propose a new method of relation discovery in section 3.
    Then we describe experiments and evaluations in section 4 and 5, and discuss the approach in section 6.
    Finally, we conclude with future work.
  
  
    The concept of relation extraction was introduced as part of the Template Element Task, one of the information extraction tasks in the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, 1995).
    MUC-7 added a Template Relation Task, with three relations.
    Following MUC, the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) meetings (National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2000) are pursuing information extraction.
    In the ACE Program2, Relation Detection and Characterization (RDC)
