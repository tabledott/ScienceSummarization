its of the evaluation datasets.
    Overall, 14 systems outperform the MFS, while 17 of them perform better than Random.
    The ranking of systems in nouns and verbs is different.
    For instance, the highest ranked system in nouns is UoY, while in verbs Duluth-Mix-Narrow-Gap.
    It seems that depending on the part-of-speech of the target word, different algorithms, features and parameters&#8217; tuning have different impact.
    The supervised evaluation changes the distribution of clusters by mapping each cluster to a weighted vector of senses.
    Hence, it can potentially favour systems generating a high number of homogeneous clusters.
    For that reason, we applied a second testing set split, where 60% of the testing corpus was used for mapping and 40% for evaluation.
    Reducing the size of the mapping corpus allows us to observe, whether the above statement is correct, since systems with a high number of clusters would suffer from unreliable mapping.
    Table 7 shows the results of the second sup
