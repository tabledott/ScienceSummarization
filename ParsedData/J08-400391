ing and in parsing, the capacity to produce nonprojective dependency graphs leads to better accuracy unless it can be assumed that all structures are strictly projective.
    The evaluation also shows that using the nonprojective, list-based parsing algorithm gives a more stable improvement in this respect than applying the pseudo-projective parsing technique to a strictly projective parsing algorithm.
    Moreover, despite its quadratic time complexity, the non-projective parser is often as efficient as the pseudo-projective parsers in practice, because the extended set of dependency labels used in pseudo-projective parsing slows down classification.
    This demonstrates the importance of complementing the theoretical analysis of complexity with practical running time experiments.
    Although the non-projective, list-based algorithm can be said to give the best tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency when results are averaged over all languages in the sample, we have also observed important language-speci
