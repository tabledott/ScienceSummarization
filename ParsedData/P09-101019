    The reward r(h) is -1 if h ends in a state where the puzzle cannot be completed.
    For solved puzzles, the reward is a positive value proportional to the percentage of words assigned to non-null commands.
  
  
    Datasets For the Windows domain, our dataset consists of 128 documents, divided into 70 for training, 18 for development, and 40 for test.
    In the puzzle game domain, we use 50 tutorials, divided into 40 for training and 10 for test.9 Statistics for the datasets are shown below.
    The data exhibits certain qualities that make for a challenging learning problem.
    For instance, there are a surprising variety of linguistic constructs &#8212; as
