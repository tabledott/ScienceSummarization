nuncio, the corpus was incorrect in 56% of the disputed tokens.
    I hope to obtain a more reliable source of test material.
    However, it does appear that in some cases the system's precision may rival that of the AP Newswire's Spanish writers and translators.
  
  
    The algorithm presented here has several advantages which make it suitable for general lexical disambiguation tasks that require integrating both semantic and syntactic distinctions.
    The incorporation of word (and optionally part-of-speech) trigrams allows the modeling of many local syntactic constraints, while collocational evidence in a wider context allows for more semantic distinctions.
    A key advantage of this approach is that it allows the use of multiple, highly non-independent evidence types (such as root form, inflected form, part of speech, thesaurus category or application-specific clusters) and does so in a way that avoids the complex modeling of statistical dependencies.
    This allows the decision lists to find the le
