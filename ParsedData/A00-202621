ins of similar complexity to air travel.
    In the air travel domain, the length of a phrase fragment to describe an attribute is usually only a few words.
    Domains which require complex and lengthy phrase fragments to describe a single attribute will be more challenging to model with features that only look at word n-grams for n E {2, 3}.
    Domains in which there is greater ambiguity in word choice will require a more thorough search, i.e., a larger value of N, at the expense of CPU time and memory.
    Most importantly, the semantic annotation scheme for air travel has the property that it is both rich enough to accurately represent meaning in the domain, but simple enough to yield useful corpus statistics.
    Our approach may not scale to domains, such as freely occurring newspaper text, in which the semantic annotation schemes do not have this property.
    Our current approach has the limitation that it ignores the values of attributes, even though they might strongly influence the word order and
