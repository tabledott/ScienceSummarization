ermter and Hahn (2005) go one step further and look into a linguistic property of non-compositional compounds&#8212;their lexical fixedness&#8212;to identify them.
    Venkatapathy and Joshi (2005) combine aspects of the above-mentioned work, by incorporating lexical fixedness, collocation-based, and distributional similarity measures into a set of features which are used to rank verb+noun combinations according to their compositionality.
    Our work differs from such studies in that it carefully examines several linguistic properties of VNICs that distinguish them from literal (compositional) combinations.
    Moreover, we suggest novel techniques for translating such characteristics into measures that predict the idiomaticity level of verb+noun combinations.
    More specifically, we propose statistical measures that quantify the degree of lexical, syntactic, and overall fixedness of such combinations.
    We demonstrate that these measures can be successfully applied to the task of automatically distingui
