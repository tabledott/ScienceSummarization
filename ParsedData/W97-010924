 an overall heterogeneity 0.56, splitting by noun in two subnodes with OH----0.99 and by description with OH=0.88.
    Therefore, in this case we would choose the verb as an attribute for the tree expansion.
    3.
    The attribute is either a verb, noun, or a description noun9.
    Its values correspond to the concept identificators (synsets) of WordNet.
    At the beginning of the tree induction, the top roots of the WordNet hierarchy are taken as attribute values for splitting the set of training examples.
    At first, all the training examples (separately for each preposition) are split into subsets which correspond to the topmost concepts of WordNet, which contains 11 topical roots for nouns and description nouns, and 337 for verbs (both nouns and verbs have hierarchical structure, although the hierarchy for verbs is shallower and wider).
    The training examples are grouped into subnodes according to the disambiguated senses of their content words.
    This means that quadruples with words that belon
