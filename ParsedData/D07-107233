 Bayesian model for PCFGs, along with an efficient variational inference algorithm.
			While our primarycontribution is the elucidation of the model and algorithm, we have also explored some important empirical properties of the HDP-PCFG and also demon strated the potential of variational HDP-PCFGs on a full-scale parsing task.
