 currency in the domain, even if they are rough paraphrases.
    In short, knowledge-based generators are faced with multiple, complex, and interacting lexical constraints,3 and the integration of these constraints is a difficult problem, to the extent that the need for a different specialized architecture for lexical choice in each domain has been suggested (Danlos, 1986).
    However, compositional approaches to lexical choice have been successful whenever detailed representations of lexical constraints can be collected and entered into the lexicon (e.g., (Elhadad, 1993; Kukich et al., 1994)).
    Unfortunately, most of these constraints must be identified manually, and even when automatic methods for the acquisition of some types of this lexical knowledge exist (Smadja and McKeown, 1991), the extracted constraints must still be transformed to the generator's representation language by hand.
    This narrows the scope of the lexicon to a specific domain; the approach fails to scale up to unrestricted langua
