sify the acquired polar atoms as positive, negative, and neutral, instead of the instances of polar clauses detected with the new lexicon.
    This can be done because the polar atoms themselves are informative enough to imply to humans whether the expressions hold positive or negative meanings in the domain.
    To justify the reliability of this evaluation method, two annotators9 evaluated 200 randomly selected candidate polar atoms in the digital camera domain.
    The agreement results are shown in Table 7.
    The manual classification was agreed upon in 89% of the cases and the Kappa value was 0.83, which is high enough to be considered consistent.
    Using manual judgment of the polar atoms, we evaluated the performance with the following three metrics.
    Type Precision.
    The coincidence rate of the polarity between the acquired polar atom and the human evaluators&#8217; judgments.
    It is always false if the evaluators judged it as &#8216;neutral.&#8217; Token Precision.
