ry based vectors with co&#8211;occurrence based vectors, where the vector of a word is the probability that an origin word occurs in the context of the word.
    These two representations are evaluated by applying them to real world applications and quantifying the results.
    Both measures are first applied to word sense disambiguation and then to the learning of positives or negatives, where it is required to determine whether a word has a positive or negative connotation.
    It was observed that the co&#8211; occurrence based idea works better for the word sense disambiguation and the dictionary based approach gives better results for the learning ofpositives or negatives.
    From this, the conclusion is that the dictionary based vectors contain some different semantic information about the words and warrants further investigation.
    It is also observed that for the dictionary based vectors, the network of words is almost independent of the dictionary that is used, i.e. any dictionary should give us a
