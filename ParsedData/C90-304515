 both to a formula in the semantics (the quantifier's scope) and a term (the position bound by the quantifier).
			We will begin a derivation with just such a pair of elementat3, trees, depicted as at in Figure 3.
			To distinguish two separate links from a single link among several nodes, we use a coindexing--rather than graphical~-notation f r links.
			Thus, the subject NP node on the left is linked with both the F and first T node on the right, as indicated by the boxed index 1.
			The inteqgretation f such "hyper-links" is that when a pair is chosen to operate at the link, it must have sets of the correct sizes as its left and right component (1 and 2 in the case at hmad) and the sets are simultaneously used at the various nodes as in a multi-component "lAG.
			For instance, a quantifiable noun will be paired with a set of two trees: 6 politician R T x politician Applying the latter multi-component tree pair fll to the initial tree pair a l , we derive the next stage in the deriva- tion o~2.
			We have h
