emma representation the system achieves a peak performance of 0.8 BEP, and with bigrams of 0.82 BEP.
    Szarvas (2008) follows Medlock and Briscoe (2007) in classifying sentences as being speculative or nonspeculative.
    Szarvas develops a MaxEnt system that incorporates bigrams and trigrams in the feature representation and performs a complex feature selection procedure in order to reduce the number of keyword candidates.
    It achieves up to 0.85 BEP and 85.08 F1 by using an external dictionary.
    Kilicoglu and Bergler (2008) apply a linguistically motivated approach to the same clasification task by using knowledge from existing lexical resources and incorporating syntactic patterns.
    Additionally, hedge cues are weighted by automatically assigning an information gain measure and by assigning weights semi&#8211; automatically depending on their types and centrality to hedging.
    The system achieves results of 0.85 BEP.
    As mentioned earlier, we are not aware of research that has focused on le
