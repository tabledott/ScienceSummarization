ies within a confidence interval around the measurement on the test sets.
    A commonly used level of reliability of the result is 95%, also written as , called p-level.
    Let us explore this notion on a simpler metric of translation quality than BLEU.
    A common metric in older machine translation papers is a score from 1 to 5 for each sentence, or even simpler: a human judge deemed a translation either as correct or wrong.
    If, say, 100 sentence translations are evaluated, and 30 are found correct, what can we say about the true translation quality of the system?
    Our best guess is 30%, but that may be a few percent off.
    How much off, is the question to be answered by statistical significance tests.
    Given a set of sentences, we can compute the sample mean and variance of the individual sentence scores : What we are really interested in, however is the true mean .
    Let us assume that the sentence scores are distributed according to the normal distribution.
    This implies that a senten
