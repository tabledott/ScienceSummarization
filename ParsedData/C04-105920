l the three query models showed improvements over the baseline system in terms of NIST and Bleu scores.
			The best bag-of-words query model is TNQ built from the N-Best list.
			It provides a good balance between incorporating translation alternatives in the language model adaptation process and not reinforcing wrong translations.

			The next series of experiments was done to study if using word order information in constructing the queries could help to generate more effective adapted language models.
			By using the structured query language we converted the same first-best hypothesis, the 100-best list, and the translation lattice into structured query models.
