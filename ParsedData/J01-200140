ssumed to be drawn; second, the model can then be used to assign a compressed length to the data, using familiar information-theoretic notions; third, the model can itself be assigned a length; and fourth, the optimal analysis of the data is the one for which the sum of the length of the compressed data and the length of the model is the smallest.
    That is, we seek a minimally compact specification of both the model and the data, simultaneously.
    Accordingly, we use the conceptual vocabulary of information theory as it becomes relevant to computing the length, in bits, of various aspects of the morphology and the data representation.
    Let us suppose that we know (part of) the correct analysis of a set of words, and we wish to create a model using that knowledge.
    In particular, we know which words have no morphological analysis, and for all the words that do have a morphological analysis, we know the final suffix of the word.
    (We return in the next section to how we might arrive at that knowle
