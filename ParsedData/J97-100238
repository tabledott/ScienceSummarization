other's concerns clearly, the game coders have some difficulty agreeing on where to place game boundaries.
    However, individual coders can develop a stable sense of game structure, and therefore if necessary, it should be possible to improve the coding scheme.
    Unlike the other coding schemes, transaction coding was designed from the beginning to be done solely from written instructions.
    Since it is possible to tell uncontroversially from the video what the route follower drew and when they drew it, reliability has only been tested for the other parts of the transaction coding scheme.
    The replication involved four naive coders and the &amp;quot;expert&amp;quot; developer of the coding instructions.
    All four coders were postgraduate students at the University of Edinburgh; none of them had prior experience of the Map Task or of dialogue or discourse analysis.
    All four dialogues used different maps and differently shaped routes.
    To simplify the task, coders worked from maps and transcr
