ng); (3) it must be dominated by the correct non-terminal label.
    For example, in figure 5 the trace is an argument to bought, which it follows, and it is dominated by a VP.
    Of the 436 cases, 342 were string-vacuous extraction from subject position, recovered with 97.1%/98.2% precision/recall; and 94 were longer distance cases, recovered with 76%/60.6% precision/recall 9.
    Model 1 is similar in structure to (Collins 96) the major differences being that the &amp;quot;score&amp;quot; for each bigram dependency is Ps (Li, 1,IH , P, h, distances) 8(Magerman 95) collapses ADVP and PRT to the same label, for comparison we also removed this distinction when calculating scores.
    9We exclude infinitival relative clauses from these figures, for example &amp;quot;I called a plumber TRACE to fix the sink&amp;quot; where 'plumber' is co-indexed with the trace subject of the infinitival.
    The algorithm scored 41%/18% precision/recall on the 60 cases in section 23 - but infinitival relatives are extremely di
