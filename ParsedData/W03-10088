to the constituent in question, represented as a string of parse tree nonterminals linked by symbols indicating upward or downward movement through the tree, as shown in Figure 2.
    Although the path is composed as a string of symbols, our systems will treat the string as an atomic value.
    The path includes, as the first element of the string, the part of speech of the predicate, and, as the last element, the phrase type or syntactic category of the sentence constituent marked as an argument.
    He ate some pancakes Figure 2: In this example, the path from the predicate ate to the argument NP He can be represented as VBTVPTS1NP, with T indicating upward movement in the parse tree and 1 downward movement.
    The position feature simply indicates whether the constituent to be labeled occurs before or after the predicate.
    This feature is highly correlated with grammatical function, since subjects will generally appear before a verb, and objects after.
    This feature may overcome the shortcomings of
