domains for these words.
    Additionally, we evaluated our method quantitatively using the Subject Field Codes (SFC) resource (Magnini and Cavagli`a, 2000) which annotates WordNet synsets with domain labels.
    The SFC contains an economy label and a sports label.
    For this domain label experiment we selected all the words in WordNet that have at least one synset labelled economy and at least one synset labelled sports.
    The resulting set consisted of 38 words.
    We contrast the distribution of domain labels for these words in the 2 domain specific corpora.
    The results for 10 of the words from the qualitative experiment are summarized in table 3 with the WordNet sense number for each word supplied alongside synonyms or hypernyms from WordNet for readability.
    The results are promising.
    Most words show the change in predominant sense (PS) that we anticipated.
    It is not always intuitively clear which of the senses to expect as predominant sense for either a particular domain or for the
