gnment models using GIZA++ and compute the Viterbi word alignment of the training corpus.
    This is done for both translation directions.
    We take the union ofboth alignments to obtain a symmetrized word alignment matrix.
    This alignment matrix is the starting point for the phrase extraction.
    The following criterion defines the set of bilingual phrases BP of the sentence pair (fJ1 ; eI1) and the alignment matrix A &#8838; J &#215; I that is used in the translation system.
    This criterion is identical to the alignment template criterion described in (Och et al., 1999).
    It means that two phrases are considered to be translations of each other, if the words are aligned only within the phrase pair and not to words outside.
    The phrases have to be contiguous.
    To use phrases in the translation model, we introduce the hidden variable S. This is a segmentation of the sentence pair (fJ 1 ; eI 1) into K phrases ( &#732;fK 1 ; &#732;eK1 ).
    We use a one-toone phrase alignment, i.e. one sourc
