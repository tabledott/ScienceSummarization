 or insertion errors), and recall implies the number of missed boundaries (or false negatives, or deletion errors).
    Table 1 shows that both the blocks algorithm for lexical score assignment and the vocabulary introduction algorithm fall between the upper and lower bounds.
    The results are shown for making both a liberal (LC) and a conservative (HC) number of boundary assignments (see Section 5.5).
    As is to be expected, when more boundaries can be assigned, recall becomes higher at the expense of precision, and conversely, when boundary assignment is conservative, better precision is obtained at the expense of recall.
    This table also shows the average K scores for the agreement between the algorithm and the judges.
    The scores for the blocks version of the algorithm are stronger than those for the vocabulary introduction version.
    Table 2 shows results in more detail, varying some of the parameter settings.
    To allow for a more direct comparison, the precision for each version of the al
