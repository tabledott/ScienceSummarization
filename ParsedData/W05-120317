are competitive with the best results achieved during the PASCAL entailment evaluation (Dagan et al., 2005).
    Although our method relies on a bag-of-words approach, as it turns out the use of measures of semantic similarity improves significantly over the traditional lexical matching metrics4.
    We are nonetheless aware that a bag-of-words approach ignores many of important relationships in sentence structure, such as dependencies between words, or roles played by the various arguments in the sentence.
    Future work will consider the investigation of more sophisticated representations of sentence structure, such as first order predicate logic or semantic parse trees, which should allow for the implementation of more effective measures of text semantic similarity.
