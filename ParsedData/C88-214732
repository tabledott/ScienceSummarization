feature structures associated with the nodes of trees used ill the grammar.
  The resulting system, 1U"TAG, g~nerates the same language as TAGs, and yet retains an increased escriptive and geaeraLive capacity due to the extended omain of locality o{ TAGs.
  Fiually, in this lml)er, we have brMly discussed a calculus to represent FTAG grammars.
  This cab:alas is an exteation of the llounds-Kasper logic for fi:ature structures, qhe extmltions deM with A abstraction ove~ feature structures and flmetiou application, which is used to ehagacterizd auxiliary trees and the adjunctiml operation.
  [Vijayashanker 19871 Lives a detailed escription of this calculus and its semantics.
