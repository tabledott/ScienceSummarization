Thus all that is required to use such a scheme, in theory, is that the parser being evaluated is able to identify heads.
    A similar resource &#8212; the Parc Dependency Bank (DepBank) (King et al., 2003) &#8212; has been created using sentences from the Penn Treebank.
    Briscoe and Carroll (2006) reannotated this resource using their GRs scheme, and used it to evaluate the RASP parser.
    Kaplan et al. (2004) compare the Collins (2003) parser with the Parc LFG parser by mapping LFG Fstructures and Penn Treebank parses into DepBank dependencies, claiming that the LFG parser is considerably more accurate with only a slight reduction in speed.
    Preiss (2003) compares the parsers of Collins (2003) and Charniak (2000), the GR finder of Buchholz et al. (1999), and the RASP parser, using the Carroll et al.
    (1998) gold-standard.
    The Penn Treebank trees of the Collins and Charniak parsers, and the GRs of the Buchholz parser, are mapped into the required GRs, with the result that the GR finder of Buchh
