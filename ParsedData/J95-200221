    It helps to interpret these quantities in terms of an unconstrained Earley parser that operates as a generator emitting&#8212;rather than recognizing&#8212;strings.
    Instead of tracking all possible derivations, the generator traces along a single Earley path randomly determined by always choosing among prediction steps according to the associated rule probabilities.
    Notice that the scanning and completion steps are deterministic once the rules have been chosen.
    Intuitively, the forward probability ai(kX ).p) is the probability of an Earley generator producing the prefix of the input up to position i -1 while passing through state kX A&#8226;,u, at position i.
    However, due to left-recursion in productions the same state may appear several times on a path, and each occurrence is counted toward the total a,.
    Thus, a, is really the expected number of occurrences of the given state in state set i.
    Having said that, we will refer to a simply as a probability, both for the sake of brevi
