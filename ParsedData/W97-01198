    Such seed words serve as the textual anchor points in non-parallel corpora.
    For example, we obtained 1,416 entries from the Japanese/English online dictionary EDICT using these criteria.
  
  
    Word correlations are important statistical information which has been successfully employed to find bilingual word pairs from parallel corpora.
    Word correlations W(w, , wt) are computed from general likelihood scores based on the co-occurrence of words in common segments.
    Segments are either sentences, paragraphs, or string groups delimited by anchor points: where a = number of segments where both words occur number of segments where only w3 occur c = number of segments where only wt occur d = number of segments where neither words occur All correlation measures use the above likelihood scores in different formulations.
    In our Word Relation Matrix (WoRM) representation, we use the correlation measure W(w, , tat) between a seed word tv, and an unknown word tv,&#8222; a,
