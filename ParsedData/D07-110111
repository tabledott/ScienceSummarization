			3.1 Impact of Higher-Order Factorization.
			Our first set of experiments looks at the performanceof different factorizations.
			We selected three lan guages with a large number of training sentences, namely Catalan, Czech and English.
			To evaluate models, we held out the training sentences that cover the first 10,000 tokens; the rest was used for training.
			We compared four models at increasing orders of factorizations.
			The first is a first-order model.
			The second model is similar to that of McDonald and
