as been used to iteratively build up an annotated corpus, but it differs fromactive learning applications in that there are no it erative loops between the system and the human annotator(s).
			In addition, while our methodology is used for evaluating a system, active learning is commonly used for training a system.

			Next, we tested whether our proposed sampling approach provides good estimates of a sys tem?s performance.
			For this task, we used the +Combo:word model to separate a large corpusof student essays into the ?Error?
			and ?OK? sub corpora.
			The original corpus totaled over 22,000 prepositions which would normally take several weeks for two raters to double annotate and thenadjudicate.
			After the two sub-corpora were propor tionally sampled, this resulted in an annotation set of 752 preposition contexts (requiring roughly 6 hours for annotation), which is substantially more manageable than the full corpus.
			We had both raters work together to make judgments for each pr
