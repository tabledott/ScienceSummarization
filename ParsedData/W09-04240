  Joshua: An Open Source Toolkit for Parsing-Based Machine Translation
  
    describe an open source toolkit for statistical machine translation.
    Joshua implements all of the algorithms required for synchronous context grammars (SCFGs): chart-parsing, gram language model integration, beamcube-pruning, and extraction.
    The toolkit also implements suffix-array grammar extraction and minimum error rate training.
    It uses parallel and distributed computing techniques for scalability.
    We demonstrate that the toolkit achieves state of the art translation performance on the WMT09 French-English translation task.
  
  
    Large scale parsing-based statistical machine translation (e.g., Chiang (2007), Quirk et al. (2005), Galley et al.
    (2006), and Liu et al. (2006)) has made remarkable progress in the last few years.
    However, most of the systems mentioned above employ tailor-made, dedicated software that is not open source.
    This results in a high barrier to entry for other researchers, and
