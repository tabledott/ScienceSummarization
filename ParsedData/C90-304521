order-sensitive, how- ever, there may be a many-to-many correspondence b - tween source derivations and target derivations.
			This is the case, for instance, in a grammar in which alterna- tive quantifier scopings may be generated for a single sentence.
			In this case, it is unclear what should even be meant by incremental computation.
			For instance, mid- way in parsing a sentence, at a point at which a single quantified NP has been analyzed, the incremental inter- pretation could not possibly represent all possible scop- ings that that quantifier might end up taking, as it is not known what the quantifier might be required to scope with respect o. At the point in the parse where the scoping decision can be made, it is not clear whether an inerementality requirement would mean that the variant scopings must all be explicitly generated at that point, or only implicitly generable.
			With respect o synchronous TAGs, these considera- tions are reflected in choice of parsing algorithm.
