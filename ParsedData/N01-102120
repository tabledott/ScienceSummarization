 S rules.
    Many of these generate analyses compatible with prefixes of the reduced relative clause at various points during parsing, so the expectation is that the parser will be disconfirming many more hypotheses at each word than in the simpler example.
    Figure 6 shows the reading time predictions derived from this much richer grammar.
    Because the terminal vocabulary of this richer grammar is so much larger, a comparatively large amount of information is conveyed by the nouns &#8220;banker&#8221; and &#8220;buy-back&#8221; leading to high surprisal values at those words.
    However, the garden path effect is still observable at &#8220;resigned&#8221; where the prefix probability ratio is nearly 10 times greater than at either of the nouns.
    Amid the lexical effects, the probabilistic Earley parser is affected by the same structural ambiguity that affects English speakers.
  
  
    The same kind of explanation supports an account of the subject-object relative asymmetry (cf. references in (Gib
