    The LO measure is much more conservative than the approach using the Tcms.
    In this case the median threshold produces better results.
    For the conative alternation, the lemma based method does not show a significant relationship between participation and the LO scores.
    Moreover, there is no difference between the sums of the ranks of the two groups for the Mann Whitney U test.
    The mean produces an accuracy of 58% whilst the median produces an accuracy of 50%.
  
  
    There has been some recent interest in observing alternations in corpora (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Lapata, 1999) and predicting related verb classifications (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999).
    Earlier work by Resnik (1993) demonstrated a link between selectional preference strength and participation in alternations wh
