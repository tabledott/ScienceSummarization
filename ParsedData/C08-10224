 and 30% recall.
			Finally, Gamon etal.
			(2008) use a complex system including a decision tree and a language model for both preposi tion and determiner errors, while Yi et al (2008)propose a web count-based system to correct de terminer errors (P 62%, R 41%).The work presented here displays some similar ities to the papers mentioned above in its use of a maximum entropy classifier and a set of features.However, our feature set is more linguistically sophisticated in that it relies on a full syntactic analysis of the data.
			It includes some semantic compo nents which we believe play a role in correct class assignment.

			The approach proposed in this paper is based on the belief that although it is difficult to formulatehard and fast rules for correct preposition and determiner usage, there is enough underlying regularity of characteristic syntactic and semantic con texts to be able to predict usage to an acceptabledegree of accuracy.
