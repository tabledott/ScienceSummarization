ry few constraints on how n-gram matches can be drawn from the multiple reference translations.
    Because Bleu is underconstrained in these ways, it allows a tremendous amount of variation &#8211; far beyond what could reasonably be considered acceptable variation in translation.
    In this section we examine various permutations and substitutions allowed by Bleu.
    We show that for an average hypothesis translation there are millions of possible variants that would each receive a similar Bleu score.
    We argue that because the number of translations that score the same is so large, it is unlikely that all of them will be judged to be identical in quality by human annotators.
    This means that it is possible to have items which receive identical Bleu scores but are judged by humans to be worse.
    It is also therefore possible to have a higher Bleu score without any genuine improvement in translation quality.
    In Sections 3.1 and 3.2 we examine ways of synthetically producing such variant transla
