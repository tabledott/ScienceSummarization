s important problems with the soundness of the approach when a unification-based grammar is ac- tually determining the derivations, motivating the use of log-linear models (Agresti, 1990) for parse ranking that Johnson and colleagues further developed (Johnson, Geman, Canon, Chi, &amp; Riezler, 1999).
  These models can deal with the many interacting dependencies and the structural complexity found in constraint-based or unification-based theories of syntax.
  Nevertheless, the naive PCFG approach has the advan- tage of simplicity, so we pursue it and the tagging ap- proach to parse ranking in these proof-of-concept exper- iments (more recently, we have begun work on building log-linear models over HPSG signs (Toutanova &amp; Man- ning, 2002)).
  The learned models were used to rank possible parses of unseen test sentences according to the probabilities they assign to them.
  We report parse se- lection performance as percentage of test sentences for which the correct parse was highest ranked by the model.
