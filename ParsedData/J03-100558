ne with the maximum translation probability.
    The translation probability for that translation is denoted by QF&#8727;.
    First, in a series of experiments we study the effect of the coverage and cardinality pruning for the reordering constraints GE and S3.
    (When we report on the different pruning thresholds, we will show the negative logarithm of those pruning thresholds.)
    The experiments are carried out on two different pruning &#8220;dimensions&#8221;: Both tables use an observation pruning of no = 50.
    The effect of the coverage pruning threshold tc is demonstrated in Table 8.
    For the translation experiments reported in this table, the cardinality pruning threshold is set to t, = oo; thus, no comparison between partial hypotheses that do not cover the same set C of source sentence positions is carried out.
    To restrict the overall size of the search space in terms of CPU time and memory requirements, a cardinality pruning of n, = 200,000 is applied.
    As can be seen from Table 8,
