l that both the tree- bank and associated processing schemes and stochastic models be available to the general (academic) public.
  An on-going initiative at Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (NL) is developing a treebank of dependency structures (Mullen, Malouf, &amp; Noord, 2001), derived from an HPSG-like grammar of Dutch (Bouma, Noord, &amp; Malouf, 2001).
  The general approach resembles the Redwoods initiative (specifically the discriminator-based method of tree se- lection; the LKB tree comparison tool was originally de- veloped by Malouf, after all), but it provides only a sin- gle stratum of representation, and has no provision for evolving analyses in tandem with the grammar.
  Dipper (2000) presents the application of a broad-coverage LFG grammar for German to constructing tectogrammatical structures for the TiGer corpus.
  The approach is similar to the Groningen framework, and shares its limitations.
