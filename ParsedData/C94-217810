			This algorithm was applied to a fragment of the Canadian Hansards that has been used in a number of other studies: Church (1993) and Simard et al (1992).
			The 30 significant pairs with the largest mutual information values are shown in Table 9.
			As can be seen, the results provide a quick-and- dirty estimate of a bilingual exicon.
			When the pair is not a direct translation, it is often the translation of a collocate, as illustrated by acheteur ~ Limited and Santd -~ Welfare.
			(Note that some words in Table 9 are spelled with same way in English and French; this information is not used by the K-vec algorithm).
			Using a scatter plot technique developed by Church and Helfman (1993) called dotplot, we can visulize the alignment, as illustrated in Figure 1.
			The source text (Nx bytes) is concatenated to the target text (Ny bytes) to form a single input sequence of Nx+Ny bytes.
			A dot is placed in position i,j whenever the input token at position i is the same as the input token
