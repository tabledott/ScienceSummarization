hese two types of errors, accuracy on word alignment was 96.3%.
    In other words, the tree structure constraint is strong enough to prevent most false matches, but almost never inhibits correct word matches when they exist.
  
  
    A parse may be available for one of the languages, especially for well-studied languages such as English.
    Since this eliminates all degrees of freedom in the English sentence structure, the parse of the Chinese sentence must conform with that given for the English.
    Knowledge of English bracketing is thus used to help parse the Chinese sentence; this method facilitates a kind of transfer of grammatical expertise in one language toward bootstrapping grammar acquisition in another.
    A parsing algorithm for this case can be implemented very efficiently.
    Note that the English parse tree already determines the split point S for breaking eo T into two constituent subtrees deriving eo s and es T respectively, as well as the nonterminal labels j and k for each subtree.
