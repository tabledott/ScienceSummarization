e network?s 15,000 terms form a nine-level hierarchy based on the BROADER-THAN relationship.
  The principal assumption of Rada and colleagues was that ?the number of edges between terms in the MeSH hierarchy is a measure of conceptual distance between terms?.
  Despite the simplicity of this distance function, the authors were able to obtain surprisingly good results in their information retrieval task.
  In part, their success can be explained by the observation of Lee, Kim, and Lee (1993) that while ?in the context of .
  semantic networks, shortest path lengths between two concepts are not sufficient to represent conceptual distance between those concepts .
  when the paths are restricted to IS-A links, the shortest path length does measure conceptual distance.?
  Another component of their success is certainly the specificity of the domain, which ensures relative homogeneity of the hierarchy.
  Notwithstanding these qualifications, Jarmasz and Szpakowicz (2003) also achieved good results with Roget?s The
