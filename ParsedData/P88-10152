ay of signalling discourse structure is intonation.
    Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (7) showed that intonational contour is closely related to discourse segmentation with new topics being signalled by changes in intonational contour.
    A final more indirect cue to discourse structure is the speaker's choice of referring expressions and grammatical structure.
    A number of researchers (4, 2, 6, 10) have given accounts of how these relate to the continuing, retaining or shifting of focus.
    The above approaches have concentrated on particular surface linguistic phenomena and then investigated what a putative cue serves to signal in a number of dialogues.
    The problem with this approach is that the cue may only be an infrequent indicator of a particular type of shift.
    If we want to construct a general theory of discourse than we want to know about the whole range of cues serving this function.
    This study therefore takes a different approach.
    We begin by identifying all shifts of control in
