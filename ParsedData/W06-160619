ve employed is effective in our setting.
    The improvement on the development corpus transfers to the test setting as well.
    A visual inspection of the outputs shows significant differences between the outputs of the four models.
    The models that use composed rules prefer to produce outputs by using mostly lexicalized rules; in contrast, the simple M1 and M2 models produce outputs in which content is translated primarily using lexicalized rules and reorderings and word insertions are explained primarily by the non-lexical rules.
    It appears that the two strategies are complementary, succeeding and failing in different instances.
    We believe that this complementarity and the overcoming of some of the search errors in our decoder during the model rescoring phase explain the success of the system combination experiments.
    We suspect that our decoder still makes many search errors.
    In spite of this, the SPTM outputs are still significantly better than the PBMT outputs.
    We also tested whet
