very far from the translations preferred by the model.
    What is the set {eij} of translation hypotheses?
    Ideally we would let it be the set of all possible translations, and let the objective function (1) take all of them into account.
    This is the approach taken by Taskar et al. (2004), but their approach assumes that the loss function can be decomposed into local loss functions.
    Since our loss function cannot be so decomposed, we select: The last case is what Crammer et al. (2006) call max-loss updating (where &#8220;loss&#8221; refers to the generalized hinge loss) and Taskar et al.
    (2005) call lossaugmented inference.
    The rationale here is that since the objective (1) tries to minimize maxj(l'ij &#8722; Ahij &#183; w'), we should include the translations that have the highest (l'ij &#8722; Ahij &#183; w) in order to approximate the effect of using the whole forest.
    See Figure 1 again for an illustration of the hypotheses selected for a single sentence.
