 been found empirically to have a positive effect in overall performance in other problems (Hatzivassiloglou in press).
    Note that ignoring inflectional distinctions can sometimes have a detrimental effect if only particular forms of a word participate in a given collocation.
    Consequently, it might be beneficial to take into account both the distribution of the base form and the differences between the distributions of the various inflected forms.
    In the current implementation of Champollion, we were restricted to using tools for only one of the two languages, since at the time of implementation tools for French were not readily available.
    However, from the above discussion it is clear that certain tools would improve the system's performance.
    Separating corpus-dependent translations from general ones.
    Champollion identifies translations for the source collocations using the aligned corpora database as its entire knowledge of the two languages.
    Consequently, sometimes the results ar
