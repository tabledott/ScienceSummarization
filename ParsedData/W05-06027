nce its semantic label, bowner, matchesN8?s semantic label.
			Next, the MR of the seman tic head is constructed recursively.
			The semantichead of N3 is clearly N1.
			Since N1 is a part-ofspeech (POS) node, its semantic label directly de termines its MR, which becomes bowner( ).
			Once the MR for the head is constructed, the MR of all other (non-head) children are computed recursively,and COMPOSEMR assigns their MR?s to fill the arguments in the head?s MR to construct the com plete MR for the node.
			Argument constraints areused to determine the appropriate filler for each ar gument.
			Since, N2 has a null label, the MR of N3 also becomes bowner( ).
			When computing the MR for N7, N4 is determined to be the head with the MR: player( , ).
			COMPOSEMR then assigns N5?s MR to fill the team argument and N6?s MR to fill the unum argument to construct N7?s complete MR: player(our, 2).
			This MR in turn is composed withthe MR for N3 to yield the final MR for the sen tence: bowner(player(our,2)).
