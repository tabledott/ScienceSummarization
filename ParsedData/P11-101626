ts in our evaluation data set which have at least one related tweet according to various relation types.
    According to Table 4, for 66.2% of the tweets concerning the test queries, we can find at least one related tweet.
    That means our context-aware approach is potentially useful for most of the tweets.
    To evaluate the effectiveness of our contextaware approach, we compared the systems with and without considering the context.
    As shown in Table 5, the overall accuracy of the target-dependent classifiers over three classes is 66.0%.
    The graph-based optimization improves the performance by over 2 points (p &lt; 0.005), which clearly shows that the context information is very useful for classifying the sentiments of tweets.
    From the detailed improvement for each sentiment class, we find that the context-aware approach is especially helpful for positive and negative classes.
    We further compared the three types of relations for context-aware sentiment classification; the results are repo
