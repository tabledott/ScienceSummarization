s. 48.2).
    Successive experiments in which we removed different random sets of half the words from the original list resulted in greedy algorithm performance of 39.2, 35.1, and 35.5.
    Yet, despite the disparity in initial segmentation scores, the transformation sequences effect a significant error reduction in all cases, which indicates that the transformation sequences are effectively able to compensate (to some extent) for weaknesses in the lexicon.
    Table 2 provides a summary of the results using the greedy algorithm for each of the three languages.
    As mentioned above, lexical resources are more readily available for English than for Thai.
    We can use these resources to provide an informed initial segmentation approximation separate from the greedy algorithm.
    Using our native knowledge of English as well as a short list of common English prefixes and suffixes, we developed a simple algorithm for initial segmentation of English which placed boundaries after any of the suffixes and before
