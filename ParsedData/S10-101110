    In this evaluation, the testing dataset is split into a mapping and an evaluation corpus.
    The first one is used to map the automatically induced clusters to GS senses, while the second is used to evaluate methods in a WSD setting.
    This evaluation follows the supervised evaluation of SemEval-2007 WSI task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007), with the difference that the reported results are an average of 5 random splits.
    This repeated random sampling was performed to avoid the problems of the SemEval-2007 WSI challenge, in which different splits were providing different system rankings.
    Let us consider the example in Table 3 and assume that this matrix has been created by using the mapping corpus.
    Table 3 shows that C1 is more likely to be associated with G3, C2 is more likely to be associated with G2, C3 is more likely to be associated with G3 and C4 is more likely to be associated with G1.
    This information can be utilised to map the clusters to GS senses.
    Particularly, the matrix show
