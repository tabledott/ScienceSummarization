s, and where the parameters of the MaltParser system have been tuned for each language separately.
			We call this system Single Malt, to emphasize the fact that it consists of a single instance of MaltParser.
			The second parser is an ensemble system, which combines the output of six deterministic parsers, each of which is a variation of the Single Malt parser with parameter settings extrapolated from the first stage of optimization.
			It seems very natural to call this system Blended.
			Section 2 summarizes the work done to optimize the Single Malt parser, while section 3 explains how the Blended parser was constructed from the Single Malt parser.
			Section 4 gives a brief analysis of the experimental results, and section 5 concludes.
	
	
			The parameters available in the MaltParser system can be divided into three groups: parsing algorithmparameters, feature model parameters, and learn ing algorithm parameters.2 Our overall optimization 2For a complete documentation of these parameters, see http://w3.
