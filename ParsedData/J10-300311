re used to expand the original query: Finally, paraphrases have also been used to improve the task of relation extraction (Romano et al. 2006).
    Most recently, Bhagat and Ravichandran (2008) collect paraphrastic patterns for relation extraction by applying semi-supervised paraphrase induction to a very large monolingual corpus.
    For example, for the relation of &#8220;acquisition,&#8221; they collect: task for a given set of data and using the output so created as a reference against which to measure the performance of the system.
    The two applications where comparison against human-authored reference output has become the norm are machine translation and document summarization.
    In machine translation evaluation, the translation hypotheses output by a machine translation system are evaluated against reference translations created by human translators by measuring the n-gram overlap between the two (Papineni et al. 2002).
    However, it is impossible for a single reference translation to capture
