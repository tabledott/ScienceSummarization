 also discussed, e.g., the change of weblogs after London attack (Thelwall, 2006), the relationship between the warblog and weblogs (Kim, 2005; Thompson, 2003), etc. This paper is organized as follows.
			Section 2 defines temporal collocation to model the strength of term-to-term associations over time.
			Section 3 introduces an event detection algorithm to detect the events in weblogs, and an event summarization algorithm to extract the description of an event in a specific time with temporal collocations.
			Section 4 shows and discusses the experimental results.
			Section 5 concludes the remarks.
			Temporal Collocations We derive the temporal collocations from Shannon?s mutual information (Manning &amp; Sch?tze, 1999) which is defined as follows (Definition 1).
			Definition 1 (Mutual Information) The mutual information of two terms x and y is defined as: )()( ),(log),(),( yPxP yxPyxPyxI = where P(x,y) is the co-occurrence probability of x and y, and P(x) and P(y) denote the occurrence probability of x
