 classes from noise.
    In this study, the accuracy of the unsupervised algorithms was less than that of the majority classifier in every case where the percentage of the majority sense exceeded 68%.
    However, in the cases where the performance of these algorithms was less than that of the majority classifier, they were often still providing high accuracy disambiguation (e.g., 91% accuracy for last).
    Clearly, the distribution of classes is not the only factor affecting disambiguation accuracy; compare the performance of these algorithms on bill and public which have roughly the same class distributions.
    It is difficult to quantify the effect of the distribution of classes on a learning algorithm particularly when using naturally occurring data.
    In previous unsupervised experiments with interest, using a modified version of Feature Set A, we were able to achieve an increase of 36 percentage points over the accuracy of the majority classifier when the 3 classes were evenly distributed in the sam
