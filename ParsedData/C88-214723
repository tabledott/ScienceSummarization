r adjunction and as well as without ad- junction (if the constraint is not obligatory).
  Further, the feature struc- ture (corresponding to the tree structure below it) to be associated with the foot node is not knoWn bnt gets specified upon adjunetion.
  Thus, the bottom feature structure associated with the foot node, which is bloot be- fore adjunction, is instantiated on adjunction by unifying it with a feature structure for the tree that will finally appear below this node.
  Prior to adjunction, since this feature structure is not known, we will treat it asi a variable (that gets instantiated on adjunction).
  This treatment can be!
  obtained if we think of the auxiliary tree as corresponding to functional over feature structures (by A-abstracting the variable corresponding toi the feature structure for the tree that will appear below the foot node).
  Adjunction correponds to applying this function to th e ?feature structure corresponding to the subtree below the node where takes place.
  We will form
