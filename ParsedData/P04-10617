present specific models: a dependency d is a pair (h, a) of a head and argument, which are words in a sentence s, in a corpus S. For uniformity of notation with section 4, words in s are specified as size-one spans of s: for example the first word would be 0s1.
    A dependency structure D over a sentence is a set of dependencies (arcs) which form a planar, acyclic graph rooted at the special symbol ROOT, and in which each word in s appears as an argument exactly once.
    For a dependency structure D, there is an associated graph G which represents the number of words and arrows between them, without specifying the words themselves (see figure 2).
    A graph G and sentence s together thus determine a dependency structure.
    The dependency structure is the object generated by all of the models that follow; the steps in the derivations vary from model to model.
    Existing generative dependency models intended for unsupervised learning have chosen to first generate a word-free graph G, then populate the se
