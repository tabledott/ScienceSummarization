    Output.
    The system outputs the classification it has assigned to each definite description in the text, together with the coreferential and bridging links it has identified.
  
  
    We developed three types of heuristics: We present in turn the heuristics for each class of definite descriptions in this section, and discuss their limitations.
    The final configuration of the system was arrived at on the basis of an extensive evaluation of the heuristics using the corpus annotated in our previous work (Poesio and Vieira 1998).
    The evaluation was used both to determine which version of each heuristic worked better, and to identify the best order in which to try them.
    Our system's strategy for resolving direct anaphora is very simple: it just looks for a potent
