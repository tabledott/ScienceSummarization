			Three bag-of-words query models are proposed and explained in the following sections.
			2.1 Sentence Retrieval Process.
			In our sentence retrieval process, the standard tf/idf (term frequency and inverse document frequency) term weighting scheme is used.
			The queries are built from the translation hypotheses.
			We follow (Eck, et al, 2004) in considering each sentence in the monolingual corpus as a document, as they have shown that this gives better results compared to retrieving entire news stories.
			Both the query and the sentences in the text corpus are converted into vectors by assigning a term weight to each word.
			Then the cosine similarity is calculated proportional to the inner product of the two vectors.
			All sentences are ranked according to their similarity with the query, and the most similar sentences are used as the data for building the specific language model.
			In our experiments we use different numbers of similar sentences, ranting from one to several thousand.
