 is to help authors make an informed choice regarding the coefficients they use for measuring agreement.
    While coefficients other than K, specifically Cohen&#8217;s x and Krippendorff&#8217;s &#945;, have appeared in the CL literature as early as Carletta (1996) and Passonneau and Litman (1996), they hadn&#8217;t sprung into general awareness until the publication of Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) and Passonneau (2004).
    Regarding the question of annotator bias, there is an overwhelming consensus in CL practice: K and &#945; are used in the vast majority of the studies we reported.
    We agree with the view that K and &#945; are more appropriate, as they abstract away from the bias of specific coders.
    But we also believe that ultimately this issue of annotator bias is of little consequence because the differences get smaller and smaller as the number of annotators grows (Artstein and Poesio 2005).
    We believe that increasing the number of annotators is the best strategy, because it reduces the cha
