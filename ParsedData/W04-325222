raction cannot be applied here, since the text units in consideration are significantly larger than one or few words, and &#8220;co-occurrence&#8221; is not a meaningful relation for such large contexts.
    Instead, we are defining a different relation, which determines a connection between two sentences if there is a &#8220;similarity&#8221; relation between them, where &#8220;similarity&#8221; is measured as a function of their content overlap.
    Such a relation between two sentences can be seen as a process of &#8220;recommendation&#8221;: a sentence that addresses certain concepts in a text, gives the reader a &#8220;recommendation&#8221; to refer to other sentences in the text that address the same concepts, and therefore a link can be drawn between any two such sentences that share common content.
    The overlap of two sentences can be determined simply as the number of common tokens between the lexical representations of the two sentences, or it can be run through syntactic filters, which only coun
