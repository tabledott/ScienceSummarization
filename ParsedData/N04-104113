    In this section, we present an evaluation of the class labeling algorithm and of the hyponym relationships discovered by our system.
    We used Minipar (Lin 1994), a broad coverage parser, to parse 3GB of newspaper text from the Aquaint (TREC-9) collection.
    We collected the frequency counts of the grammatical relationships (contexts) output by Minipar and used them to compute the pointwise mutual information vectors described in Section 3.1.
    We used the 1432 noun clusters extracted by CBC1 as the list of concepts to name.
    For each concept, we then used our algorithm described in Section 3 to extract the top-20 names for each concept.
    Out of the 1432 noun concepts, we were unable to name 21 (1.5%) of them.
    This occurs when a concept's committee members do not occur in any of the four syntactic relationships described in Section 0.
    We performed a manual ev
