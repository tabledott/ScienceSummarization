g., size of training and test dataset) are summarized in Table 1.
    One of the advantages of CRFs is that they are flexible enough to capture many correlated features, including overlapping and non-independent features.
    We thus use as many features as possible, which could not be used in HMMs.
    Table 2 summarizes the set of feature templates used in the KC data.
    The templates for RWCP are essentially the same as those of KC except for the maximum level of POS subcatgeories.
    Word-level templates are employed when the words are lexicalized, i.e., those that belong to particle, auxiliary verb, or suffix6.
    For an unknown word, length of the word, up to 2 suffixes/prefixes and character types are used as the features.
    We use all features observed in the lattice without any cut-off thresholds.
    Table 1 also includes the number of features in both data sets.
    We evaluate performance with the standard Fscore (F&#946;=1) defined as follows: where Recall = # of correct tokens # of tokens
