 However, the model combined with a preliminary model achieved sufficient accuracy.
    The reference distribution method achieved higher accuracy and lower cost.
    The feature function method achieved lower accuracy in our experiments.
    A possible reason is that a hyper-parameter of the prior was set to the same value for all the features including the feature of the preliminary distribution.
    Table 5 shows the results of changing the filtering threshold.
    We can determine the correlation between the estimation/parsing cost and accuracy.
    In our experiment, n &gt; 10 and c &gt; 0.90 seem necessary to preserve the F-score over 85.0.
    Figure 5 shows the accuracy for each sentence length.
    It is apparent from this figure that the accuracy was significantly higher for shorter sentences (&lt; 10 words).
    This implies that experiments with only short sentences overestimate the performance of parsers.
    Sentences with at least 10 words are necessary to properly evaluate the performance of p
