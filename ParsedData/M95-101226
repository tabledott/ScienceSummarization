duals participating in the events (the individual and his or her age) .
  This treatment is similar to the partial Davidsonian analysis of events due to Hobbs [8] .
  Note that event indi- viduals are by definition only associated with relations, not unary predicates .
  As a point of clarification, note that the inference system does not encode facts at the predicate calculu s level so much as at the interpretation level made popular in such systems as the SRI core language engine [1, 3] .
  In other words, the representation is actually a structured attribute-value graph such as the following, whic h encodes the age apposition above .
  [[head :person] [proxy pers-02] [modifiers [[head has-age] [proxy ha-04] [arguments (pers-02 [[head age ] [proxy age-03]])]]] ] The first two fields correspond to the embedded phrase : the head field is a semantic sort, and the proxy field holds the designator for the semantic individual denoted by the phrase .
  The interpretation encoding the 147 overall apposition ends up
