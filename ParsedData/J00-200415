model estimation methods presented here as general as possible, I shall assume a totally uninformative concept representation&#8212;the trans distribution itself.
    In other words, I shall assume that each different pair of word sequence types is deterministically generated from a different concept, so that trans (Ili, ViIC) is zero for all concepts except one.
    Now, a bag-to-bag translation model can be fully specified by the distributions of 1 and trans.
    The probability distribution trans (ii, it') is a word-to-word translation model.
    Unlike the models proposed by Brown et al. (1993b), this model is symmetric, because both word bags are generated together from a joint probability distribution.
    Brown and his colleagues' models, reviewed in Section 4.3, generate one half of the bitext given the other half, so they are represented by conditional probability distributions.
    A sequenceto-sequence translation model can be obtained from a word-to-word translation model by combining Equation 11
