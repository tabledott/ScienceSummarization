    This paper presented a new method for identifying base NPs.
    Our treebank approach uses the simple technique of matching part-of-speech tag sequences, with the intention of capturing the simplicity of the corresponding syntactic structure.
    It employs two existing corpus-based techniques: the initial noun phrase grammar is extracted directly from an annotated corpus; and a benefit score calculated from errors on an improvement corpus selects the best subset of rules via a coarse- or fine-grained pruning algorithm.
    The overall results are surprisingly good, especially considering the simplicity of the method.
    It achieves 94% precision and recall on simple base NPs.
    It achieves 91% precision and recall on the more complex NPs of the Rainshaw &amp; Marcus corpus.
    We believe, however, that the base NP finder can be improved further.
    First, the longest-match heuristic of the noun phrase bracketer could be replaced by more sophisticated parsing methods that account for lexical prefere
