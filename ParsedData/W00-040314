ating multidocument summaries.
    All our findings are backed by the analysis of two experiments that we performed with human subjects.
    We found that the interjudge agreement on sentence utility is very high while the agreement on crosssentence subsumption is moderately low, ahhough promising.
    In the future, we would like to test our multidocument summarizer on a larger corpus and improve the summarization algorithm.
    We would also like to explore how the techniques we proposed here can be used for multiligual multidocument summarization.
    We then modified the MEAD algorithm to include lead information as well as centroids (see Section 0).
    In this case, MEAD+Lead performed better than the Lead baseline in 41 cases.
    We are in the process of running experiments with other SCORE formulas.
    It may seem that utility-based evaluation requires too much effort and is prone to low interjudge agreement.
    We believe that our results show that interjudge agreement is quite high.
    As far as
