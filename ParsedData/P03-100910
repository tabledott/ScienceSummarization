n its turn, for calculating the other probabilities (figure 2).
    The collection of all p(S|K)&#8217;s for a fixed cluster K can be regarded as a probabilistic center (centroid) of that cluster in the SCF space.
    The IB method gives an indication of the most informative values of K.7 Intensifying the weight Q attached to the relevance information I(Clusters; SCFs) allows us to increase the number K of distinct clusters being produced (while too small Q would cause some of the output clusters to be identical to one another).
    Hence, the relevance information grows with K. Accordingly, we consider as the most informative output configurations those for which the relevance information increases more sharply between K &#8722; 1 and K clusters than between
  
  
    When the weight of relevance grows, the assignment to clusters is more constrained and p(K|V ) becomes more similar to hard clustering.
    Let denote the most probable cluster of a verb V .
    For K &#8805; 30, more than 85% of the verbs have
