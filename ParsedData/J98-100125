    Atkins and Levin [19881, Kilgarriff [1994]) as well as the fact that dictionaries are created for human use, and not for machine exploitation.
    Despite its shortcomings, the machine-readable dictionary provides a ready-made source of information about word senses and therefore rapidly became a staple of WSD research.
    The methods employed attempt to avoid the problems cited above by using the text of dictionary definitions directly, together with methods sufficiently robust to reduce or eliminate the effects of a given dictionary's inconsistencies.
    All of these methods (and many of those cited elsewhere in this paper) rely on the notion that the most plausible sense to assign to multiple co-occurring words is the one that maximizes the relatedness among the chosen senses.
