duct of a disjunctive node is somewhat complicated.
    As shown in Figure 8, the outside trees of a disjunctive node are all combinations of Incremental computation of outside &#945;-products at conjunctive node c2.
    We finally find the following theorem for the computation of outside o -products.
    Theorem 3 (Outside o -product) The outside o -product *c at conjunctive node c is computed by the following equation if *d is given for all mother disjunctive nodes, that is, all d such that c &#8712; -y(d).
    The outside o -product *d at disjunctive node d is computed by the following equation if *c is given for all mother conjunctive nodes, that is, all c such that d &#8712; b(c), and yds for all sibling disjunctive nodes d'.
    Note that the order in which nodes are traversed is important for incremental computation, although it is not shown in Figure 9.
    The computation for the daughter nodes and mother nodes must be completed before computing the inside and outside &#945;-products, respectively.
