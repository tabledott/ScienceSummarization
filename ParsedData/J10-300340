equences corresponding to the tokens of the paraphrase pairs.
    Barzilay and McKeown also perform an interesting comparison with another technique that was originally developed for compiling translation lexicons from bilingual parallel corpora (Melamed 2001).
    This technique first compiles an initial lexicon using simple co-occurrence statistics and then uses a competitive linking algorithm (Melamed 1997) to improve the quality of the lexicon.
    The authors apply this technique to their monolingual parallel data and observe that the extracted paraphrase pairs are of much lower quality than the pairs extracted by their own method.
    We present similar observations in Section 3.5 and highlight that although more recent translation techniques&#8212; specifically ones that use phrases as units of translation&#8212;are better suited to the task of generating paraphrases than the competitive linking approach, they continue to suffer from the same problem of low precision.
    On the other hand, such techni
