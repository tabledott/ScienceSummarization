t must be dealt with if this approach is to work - quantifiers, opaque adverbials, the distinction between de re and de dicto readings of belief reports, and the problem of identity in intensional contexts.
    I have described a solution to the quantifier problem elsewhere (Hobbs, 1983).
    Briefly, universally quantified variables are reified as typical elements of sets, existential quantification inside the scope of universally quantified variables are handled by means of dependency functions, and the quantifier structure of sentences is encoded in indices on predicates.
    In this paper I will address only the other three problems in detail.

    Thus, John is almost a man. would be represented almost(man)(/) That is, almos
