    For Russian, two words were considered variants of the same NE if they share a prefix of size five or longer.
    Each unique word had its own equivalence class for the English side of the corpus, although, in principal, ideas such as in (Li et al., 2004) could be incorporated.
    A cumulative distribution was then collected for such equivalence classes.
    Unlike most of the previous work considering generative transliteration models, we take the discriminative approach.
    We train a linear model to decide whether a word is a transliteration of an NE .
    The words in the pair are partitioned into a set of substrings and up to a particular length (including the empty string ).
    Couplings of the substrings from both sets produce features we use for training.
    Note that couplings with the empty string represent insertions/omissions.
    Consider the following example: ( , ) = (powell, pauel).
    We build a feature vector from this example in the following manner: First, we split both words
