only entries which are part of a derivation spanning the whole sentence are relevant.
    These entries can be found by traversing the chart top-down, starting with the entries which span the sentence.
    Individual entries in a cell are the conjunctive nodes, which are either (lexical category, word) pairs at the leaves, or have been obtained by combining two equivalence classes (or applying a unary rule to an equivalence class).
    The equivalence classes of individual entries are the disjunctive nodes.
    And finally, the equivalence classes at the roots of the CCG derivations are the root disjunctive nodes.
    For each feature function defined over parses (see Section 4) there is a corresponding feature function defined over conjunctive nodes, that is, for each fi : &#8486; -4 N there is a corresponding fi : C -4 N which counts the number of times feature fi appears on a particular conjunctive node.
    The value of fi for a parse is then the sum of the values offi for each conjunctive node in the par
