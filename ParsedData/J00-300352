that the DA type U, is generally not known (except maybe in applications where the user interface can be engineered to allow only one kind of DA for a given utterance).
    Therefore, we need to infer the likely DA types for each utterance, using available evidence E from the entire conversation.
    This leads to the following formulation: The last step in Equation 12 is justified because, as shown in Figures 1 and 4, the evidence E (acoustics, prosody, words) pertaining to utterances other than i can affect the current utterance only through its DA type U,.
    We call this the mixture-of-posteriors approach, because it amounts to a mixture of the posterior distributions obtained from DA-specific speech recognizers (Equation 11), using the DA posteriors as weights.
    This approach is quite expensive, however, as it requires multiple full recognizer or rescoring passes of the input, one for each DA type.
    A more efficient, though mathematically less accurate, solution can be obtained by combining guesse
