the Cf list of the main clause contains the elements of the untensed embedded clause.
    Kameyama further distinguishes, for tensed clauses, between sequential and hierarchical centering.
    Except for direct and reported speech (embedded and inaccessible to the superordinate level), nonreport complements, and relative clauses (both embedded but accessible to the superordinate level; less salient than the higher levels), all other types of tensed clauses build a chain of utterances at the same level.
    Though the centering model was not originally intended to be used as a blueprint for anaphora resolution,' several applications tackling this problem have made use of
  
  
    the model, nevertheless.
    One interpretation is due to Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) who utilize Rule 2 for computing preferences for antecedents of pronouns (see Section 3.2).
    In this section, we will specify a simple algorithm that uses the Cf list directly for providing preferences for the antecedents of pronouns.
