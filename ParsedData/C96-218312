  As in standard part-of-speech disambiguation, we can use local statistical information in the form of N-gram models based on the distribution of sn- l)ertags ill a LTAG parsed corl)us for disamhigua- tion.
  use a trigram model to disambiguate ile supcrtags o as to assign one SUl)ertag tbr each word, in a process termed supertagging.
  [he tri- gram model of supcrtagging is very efficient (in linear time) and robust (Josh| and Srinivas, ] 994).
  1o establish the dependency links among the words of the sentence, we (xph)it the dei)endency information present in the supertags.
  Each su- perl;ag associated with a word allocates lots for the arguments o1 the word.
  These slots have a polarity value re[lecting their orientation wii;h re- Sl)ect to the anchor o[ the SUl)ertag.
  Also asso- (iated with a supertag is a list of internal nodes (hmluding the root node) thai, appear in the su- pertag.
  Using I;his information, a simple algo- rithnt may be used to annotate the sentence with d(,pe.ndency link
