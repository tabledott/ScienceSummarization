is strongly related to the effectiveness of the translation model (Galley et al., 2006).
    We will demonstrate that this coverage, in turn, is related to the degree to which initial word alignments respect syntactic correspondences.
    Galley et al. (2004) proposes a method for extracting tree transducer rules from a parallel corpus.
    Given a source language sentence s, a target language parse tree t of its translation, and a word-level alignment, their algorithm identifies the constituents in t which map onto contiguous substrings of s via the alignment.
    The root nodes of such constituents &#8211; denoted frontier nodes &#8211; serve as the roots and leaves of tree fragments that form minimal transducer rules.
    Frontier nodes are distinguished by their compatibility with the word alignment.
    For a constituent c of t, we consider the set of source words sc that are aligned to c. If none of the source words in the linear closure s* (the words between the leftmost and rightmost members of sc) al
