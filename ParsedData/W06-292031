    &#8216;&#8722;&#8217;: a column value was not used at all.
    &#8216;+&#8217;: used in at least some features.
    &#8216;(+)&#8217;: Variant of FORM used only if LEMMA is missing, or only parts of FEATS used.
    &#8216;++&#8217;: used more extensively than another column containing related information (where FORM and LEMMA are related, as are CPOSTAG and POSTAG), e.g. also in combination features or features for context tokens in addition to features for the focus token(s).
    &#8220;rer.&#8221;: used in the reranker only.
