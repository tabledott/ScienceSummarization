   In the 11,112 sentences in the MPQA corpus, 28% contain no subjective expressions, 24% contain only one, and 48% contain two or more.
    Of the 5,304 sentences containing two or more subjective expressions, 17% contain mixtures of positive and negative expressions, and 61% contain mixtures of polar (positive/negative/both) and neutral subjective expressions.
  
  
    For the experiments in this article, we use a lexicon of over 8,000 subjectivity clues.
    Subjectivity clues are words and phrases that may be used to express private states.
    In other words, subjectivity clues have subjective usages, though they may have objective usages as well.
    For this work, only single-word clues are used.
    To compile the lexicon, we began with the list of subjectivity clues from Riloff and Wiebe (2003), which includes the positive and negative adjectives from Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997).
    The words in this list were grouped in previous work according to their reliability as subjectivity clues.
