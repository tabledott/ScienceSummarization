nce dealt a stiff blow to his pride.&#8221; It is important to recognize that these patterns look for specific syntactic constructions produced by a (shallow) parser, rather than exact word sequences.
    The second step of AutoSlog-TS&#8217;s learning process applies all of the learned extraction patterns to the training corpus and gathers statistics for how often each pattern occurs in subjective versus objective sentences.
    AutoSlog-TS then ranks the extraction patterns using a metric called RlogF (Riloff, 1996) and asks a human to review the ranked list and make the final decision about which patterns to keep.
    In contrast, for this work we wanted a fully automatic process that does not depend on a human reviewer, and we were most interested in finding patterns that can identify subjective expressions with high precision.
    So we ranked the extraction patterns using a conditional probability measure: the probability that a sentence is subjective given that a specific extraction pattern appears in
