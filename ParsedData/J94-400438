  By contrast, he :DEMOTE marker specified in the German entry forces the head and internal argument to swap places in the syntactic structure.
  The general solution to demotional divergence is diagrammed as follows: (22) RLCS 1: [v(x) X ([T(W) W], [T(Z) Z] [T(Q) Q])] RLCS 2: [T(X) X ([T(W) W], [T(Z) :DEMOTE Z] [T(Q) Q])] Translation: [Y-MAX [Y-MAX W IX-MAX X Z]] Q] [v(x) X ([T(W/ W], [T(Z) Z] [T(Q/ Q])l [Y--MAX [Y-MAX W IX-MAX Z] [ ...
