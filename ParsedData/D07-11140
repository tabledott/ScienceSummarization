	Extracting Aspect-Evaluation and Aspect-Of Relations in Opinion Mining
		The technology of opinion extraction allowsusers to retrieve and analyze people?s opinions scattered over Web documents.
		We define an opinion unit as a quadruple consist ing of the opinion holder, the subject being evaluated, the part or the attribute in which the subject is evaluated, and the value of theevaluation that expresses a positive or neg ative assessment.
		We use this definition as the basis for our opinion extraction task.
		We focus on two important subtasks of opinion extraction: (a) extracting aspect-evaluationrelations, and (b) extracting aspect-of re lations, and we approach each task usingmethods which combine contextual and sta tistical clues.
		Our experiments on Japaneseweblog posts show that the use of contex tual clues improve the performance for both tasks.
