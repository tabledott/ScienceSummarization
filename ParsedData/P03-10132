Collins (1997) has been successfully applied to Czech (Collins et al., 1999) and Chinese (Bikel and Chiang, 2000).
    However, the resulting performance is significantly lower than the performance of the same model for English (see Table 1).
    Neither Collins et al. (1999) nor Bikel and Chiang (2000) compare the lexicalized model to an unlexicalized baseline model, leaving open the possibility that lexicalization is useful for English, but not for other languages.
    This paper is structured as follows.
    Section 2 reviews the syntactic properties of German, focusing on its semi-flexible wordorder.
    Section 3 describes two standard lexicalized models (Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Collins, 1997), as well as an unlexicalized baseline model.
    Section 4 presents a series of experiments that compare the parsing performance of these three models (and several variants) on Negra.
    The results show that both lexicalized models fail to outperform the unlexicalized baseline.
    This is at odds with what has
