orporating more context into an HMM when estimating lexical probabilities improved accuracy from 95.87% to 96.59%, relatively reducing error rate by 17.4%.
			With the contextualized tagger we witness a small improvement in accuracy over the current state of the art when using the same amount of context.
			It is important to note that this accuracy can be obtained without the intensive training required by Toutanova et. al?s log-linear models.
			This result falls only slightly below the full-blown training intensive dependency-based conditional model.
	
	
			We have presented a comprehensive evaluation of several methods for unsupervised part-of-speech tagging, comparing several variations of hidden Markov model taggers and unsupervised transformation-based learning using the same corpus and same lexicons.
