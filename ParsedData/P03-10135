y various constituents, including the subject (er &#8216;he&#8217; in (1c)), the object (Musik &#8216;music&#8217; in (2a)), an adjunct (gestern &#8216;yesterday&#8217; in (2b)), or the non-finite verb (komponiert &#8216;composed&#8217; in (2c)).
    The semi-free wordorder in German means that a context-free grammar model has to contain more rules than for a fixed wordorder language.
    For transitive verbs, for instance, we need the rules S &#8212;* V NP NP, S &#8212;* NP V NP, and S &#8212;* NP NP V to account for verb initial, verb second, and verb final order (assuming a flat S, see Section 2.2).
    The Negra corpus consists of around 350,000 words of German newspaper text (20,602 sentences).
    The annotation scheme (Skut et al., 1997) is modeled to a certain extent on that of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), with crucial differences.
    Most importantly, Negra follows the dependency grammar tradition in assuming flat syntactic representations: (a) There is no S &#8212;* NP VP rule.
