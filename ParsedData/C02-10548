/ Current POS is not a verb : bdc nqre^sre ghji // Previous word is not ?Henry?

			:Here, we have to consider the following problems.
			First, SVMs can solve only a two-class problem.
			Therefore, we have to reduce the above multi class problem to a group of two-class problems.
			Second, we have to consider consistency among word classes in a sentence.
			For instance, a word classified as PERSON-BEGIN should be followed by PERSON-MIDDLE or PERSON-END.
			It impliesthat the system has to determine the best combina tions of word classes from numerous possibilities.Here, we solve these problems by combining exist ing methods.
			There are a few approaches to extend SVMs to cover t -class problems.
			Here, we employ the ?oneclass versus all others?
			approach.
			That is, each clas sifier (%u ) is trained to distinguish members of a class v from non-members.
			In this method, two or more classifiers may give !$# to an unseen vector or no classifier may give
