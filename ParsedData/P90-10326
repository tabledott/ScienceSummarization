    In order to produce sentences containing collocations, a language generation system must have knowledge about the possible collocations that occur in a given domain.
    In previous language generation work [Danlos 87], [lordanskaja 88], [Nirenburg 88], collocations are identified and encoded by hand, sometimes using the help of lexicographers (e.g., Danlos' [Danlos 87] use of Gross' [Gross 75] work).
    This is an expensive and time-consuming process, and often incomplete.
    In this section, we describe how Xtract can automatically produce the full range of collocations described above.
    Xtract has two main components, a concordancing component, Xconcord, and a statistical component, Xstat.
    Given one or several words, Xconcord locates all sentences in the corpus containing them.
    Xstat is the co-occurrence compiler.
    Given Xconcord's output, it makes statistical observations about these words and other words with which they appear.
    Only statistically
