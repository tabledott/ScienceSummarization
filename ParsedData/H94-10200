  THE PENN TREEBANK:  ANNOTATING PREDICATE ARGUMENT STRUCTURE Mitchell Marcus, Grace Kim, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, Robert MacIntyre, Ann Bies, Mark Ferguson, Karen Katz, Britta Schasberger Department of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA, USA ABSTRACT The Penn Treebank has recently implemented a new syn- tactic annotation scheme, designed to highlight aspects of predicate-argument structure.
  This paper discusses the implementation of crucial aspects of this new annotation scheme.
  It incorporates a more consistent treatment of a wide range of grammatical phenomena, provides aset of coin- dexed null elements in what can be thought of as "underly- ing" position for phenomena such as wh-movement, passive, and the subjects of infinitival constructions, provides ome non-context free annotational mechanism to allow the struc- ture of discontinuous constituents o be easily recovered, and allows for a clear, concise tagging system for some semantic roles.
