onal Markov model proposed by Toutanova et al. (2008).
    However, to save computation effort, the results on the dev set are reported in case insensitive BLEU (ciBLEU) score instead.
    In our main experiments, outputs from a total of eight single MT systems were combined.
    As listed in Table 1, Sys-1 is a tree-to-string system proposed by Quirk et al., (2005); Sys-2 is a phrasebased system with fast pruning proposed by Moore and Quirk (2008); Sys-3 is a phrase-based system with syntactic source reordering proposed by Wang et al. (2007a); Sys-4 is a syntax-based preordering system proposed by Li et. al.
    (2007); Sys5 is a hierarchical system proposed by Chiang (2007); Sys-6 is a lexicalized re-ordering system proposed by Xiong et al. (2006); Sys-7 is a twopass phrase-based system with adapted LM proposed by Foster and Kuhn (2007); and Sys-8 is a hierarchical system with two-pass rescoring using a parser-based LM proposed by Wang et al., (2007b).
    All systems were trained within the confines of the
