f le) are unimportant because Pr(fle) has a unique local maximum for Model 1, as is shown in Appendix B.
    We start with all of the t(f le) equal, but any other choice that avoids zeros would lead to the same final solution.
    In Model 1, we take no cognizance of where words appear in either string.
    The first word in the French string is just as likely to be connected to a word at the end of the English string as to one at the beginning.
    In Model 2 we make the same assumptions as in Model 1 except that we assume that Pr(aj lali-17A-17m7 e) depends on j, al, and in, as well as on 1.
    We introduce a set of alignment probabilities, Therefore, we seek an unconstrained extremum of the auxiliary function The reader will easily verify that Equations (11), (13), and (14) carry over from Model 1 to Model 2 unchanged.
    We need a new count, c(iIj, m, f, e), the expected number of times that the word in position j of f is connected to the word in position i of e. Clearly, Notice that if f(s) does not ha
