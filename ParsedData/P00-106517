    As a guideline for interpreting these results, with 8176 observations, the threshold for statistical signifance with p &lt; :05 is a 1.0% absolute difference in performance.
    Use of the active/passive feature made a further improvement: our system using position but no grammatical function or passive information scored 78.8%; adding passive information brought performance to 80.5%.
    Roughly 5% of the examples were identified as passive uses.
    Head words proved to be very accurate indicators of a constituent's semantic role when data was available for a given head word, confirming the importance of lexicalization shown in various other tasks.
    While the distribution P(rlh, t) can only be evaluated for 56.0% of the data, of those cases it gets 86.7% In order to address the sparse coverage of lexical head word statistics, an experiment was carried out using an automatic clustering of head words of the type described in (Lin, 1998).
    A soft clustering of nouns was performed by applying the co-
