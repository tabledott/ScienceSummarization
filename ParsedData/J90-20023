    We view the problem of machine translation then as follows.
    Given a sentence T in the target language, we seek the sentence S from which the translator produced T. We know that our chance of error is minimized by choosing that sentence S that is most probable given T. Thus, we wish to choose S so as to maximize Pr(S I T).
    Using Bayes' theorem, we can write The denominator on the right of this equation does not depend on S, and so it suffices to choose the S that maximizes the product Pr(S)Pr( TIS).
    Call the first factor in this product the language model probability of S and the second factor the translation probability of T given S. Although the interaction of these two factors can be quite profound, it may help the reader to think of the translation probability as suggesting words from the source language that might have produced the words that we observe in the target sentence and to think of the language model probabili
