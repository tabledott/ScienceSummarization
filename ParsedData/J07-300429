an the ternary rule (7)&#8212;compare to Steedman (1989):11 In order to obtain this analysis from Treebank trees, a separate node that spans only the conjuncts and the conjunction or punctuation marks (comma, semicolon) is inserted if necessary.
    Identifying the conjuncts often requires a considerable amount of preprocessing.
    These trees are then transformed into strictly right-branching binary trees.
    The dummy nodes inserted during binarization receive the same category as the conjuncts, but additionally carry a feature [conj]: An additional modification of the grammar is necessary to deal with &#8220;unlike coordinate phrases&#8221; (UCP), namely, coordinate constructions where the conjuncts do not belong to the same syntactic category: Such constructions are difficult for any formalism.
    This phenomenon could be handled elegantly with a feature hierarchy over categories as proposed by Copestake (2002), Villavicencio (2002), and McConville (2007).
    Because the induction of such a hierarchy
