ng the exact best alignment.
    Instead we use an incremental beam search, combined with a node ordering heuristic, to do approximate global search in the space of possible alignments.
    We have experimented with several alternative search techniques, and found that the solution quality is not very sensitive to the specific search procedure used.
    Our scoring measure is designed to favor alignments which align semantically similar subgraphs, irrespective of polarity.
    For this reason, nodes receive high alignment scores when the words they represent are semantically similar.
    Synonyms and antonyms receive the highest score, and unrelated words receive the lowest.
    Our hand-crafted scoring metric takes into account the word, the lemma, and the part of speech, and searches for word relatedness using a range of external resources, including WordNet, precomputed latent semantic analysis matrices, and special-purpose gazettes.
    Alignment scores also incorporate local edge scores, which are based
