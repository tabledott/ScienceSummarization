d by a finite number of rules encapsulated in the grammar.
    Thus, the derivation trees for TAG's have the same structure as local sets.
    As with HG's derivation structures are annotated; in the case of TAG's, by the trees used for adjunction and addresses of nodes of the elementary tree where adjunctions occurred.
    We can define derivation trees inductively on the length of the derivation of a tree 1.
    If 7 is an elementary tree, the derivation tree consists of a single node labeled 7.
    Suppose -y results from the adjunction of 71, ,-y, at the k distinct tree addresses 141, , nk in some elementary tree 7', respectively.
    The tree denoting this derivation of 7 is rooted with a node labeled 7' having k subtrees for the derivations of 71, ... ,7a.
    The edge from the root to the subtree for the derivation of 7i is labeled by the address ni.
    To show that the derivation tree set of a TAG is a local set, nodes are labeled by pairs consisting of the name of an elementary tree and the address
