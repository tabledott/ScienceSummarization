nner-take-all" strategy to activate increasingly related word and sense nodes and deactivate the unrelated or weakly related nodes.
			Eventually, after a few dozen cycles, the network stabilizes in a configuration where only the sense nodes with the strongest relations to other nodes in the network are activated.
			Because of the "winner-take-all" strategy, at most one sense node per word will ultimately be activated.
			Our model does not use microfeatures, because, as we will show below, the context is taken into account by the number of nodes in the network and the extent to which they are heavily interconnected.
			So far, we do not consider the syntax of the input sentence, in order to locus on the semantic properties of the model.
			However, it is clear that syntactic information can assist in the disambiguation process in certain cases, and a network including a syntactic layer, such as that proposed by Waltz and Pol lack, would undoubtedly enhance the model's behavior.
