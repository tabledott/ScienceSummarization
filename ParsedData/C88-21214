require that the lexicalized grammar produces not only the same lan- guage as the original grammar, but also the same struc- tures (or tree set)?
  We propose to study the conditions under which such a lexicalization is possible for CFGs and TAGs.
  The domain of locality of a CFG can be extended by using a tree rewriting system that only uses substitution.
  We state the conditions under which CFGs can be lexlcalized without changing the structures originally produced.
  We argue that even if one extends the domain of locality of CFGs to trees, using only substitution does not give the freedom to  choose the head of each structure.
  We then 1 By lexicalization we mean tlmt in each structure there is a lex- ical item that is realized.
  We do not mean just adding features (such as head) and unification equations to the rules of the formalism.
  Categorlal grammars are lexicaUzed according to our definition, However, they do not correspond in a simple way to a rtde-based system that could be used for top-down
