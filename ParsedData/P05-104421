rd and a possible tag.
    Our spelling features included all observed 1-, 2-, and 3-character suffixes, initial capitalization, containing a hyphen, and containing a digit.
    Results.
    Fig.
    3 plots tagging accuracy (on ambiguous words) for each dictionary on the 24K dataset.
    The x-axis is the smoothing parameter (A for EM, Q2 for CE).
    Note that the different plots are not comparable, because their y-axes are based on different sets of ambiguous words.
    So that models under different dilution conditions could be compared, we computed accuracy on all words; these are shown in Tab.

    The reader will notice that there is often a large gap between unsupervised and oracle model selection; this draws attention to a need for better unsupervised regularization and model selection techniques.
    Without spelling features, all models perform worse as knowledge is removed.
    But LENGTH suffers most substantially, relative to its initial performance.
    Why is this?
    LENGTH (like EM) r
