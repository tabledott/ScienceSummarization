or obtaining word alignments use a function of the similarity between the types of the two languages (Smadja, McKeown, and Hatzivassiloglou 1996; Ker and Chang 1997; Melamed 2000).
    Frequently, variations of the Dice coefficient (Dice 1945) are used as this similarity function.
    For each sentence pair, a matrix including the association scores between every word at every position is then obtained: C(e,f) denotes the co-occurrence count of e and f in the parallel training corpus.
    C(e) and C(f) denote the count of e in the target sentences and the count off in the source sentences, respectively.
    From this association score matrix, the word alignment is then obtained by applying suitable heuristics.
    One method is to choose as alignment aj = i for position j the word with the largest association score: A refinement of this method is the competitive linking algorithm (Melamed 2000).
    In a first step, the highest-ranking word position (i, j) is aligned.
    Then, the corresponding row and colum
