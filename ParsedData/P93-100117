 mentioned above had resolutions of 45 and 84 bytes per cell on the final iterations.
    It should not be surprising that the error rates are roughly comparable, &#177;46 and &#177;57 bytes, respectively.
    Increasing the resolution would probably reduce the error rate.
    This could be accomplished by adding memory (M) or by splitting the input into smaller chunks (e.g., parsing into paragraphs).
  
  
    In principle, the dotplot could be computed by simply iterating through all pairs of positions in the two input files, x and y, and testing whether the 4&#8212;gram of characters in text x starting at position i are the same as the 4&#8212;gram of characters in text y starting at position j.
    In fact, the dotplot calculation is actually somewhat more complicated.
    First, as suggested above, the dotplot is actually stored in rotated coordinates, with a limited resolution, r, and band limited between B min and Bn,a,, .
    These heuristics are necessary for space considerations.
    In addition, an
