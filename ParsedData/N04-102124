cribed so far have the following limitations: full parse tree models are expensive to compute for long sentences and for trees with flat constituents and there is limited reordering observed in the n-best lists that form the basis of our experiments.
    In addition to this, higher levels of parse tree are rarely observed to be reordered between source and target parse trees.
    In this section we attack these problems using a simple Markov model for tree-based alignments.
    It guarantees tractability: compared to a coverage of approximately 30% of the n-best list by the unconstrained tree-based models, using the Markov model approach provides 98% coverage of the n-best list.
    In addition, this approach is robust to inaccurate parse trees.
    The algorithm works as follows: we start with word alignments and two parameters: n for maximum number of words in tree fragment and k for maximum height of tree fragment.
    We proceed from left to right in the Chinese sentence and incrementally grow a pair of s
