  Incremental Parsing With The Perceptron Algorithm
  
    This paper describes an incremental parsing approach where parameters are estimated using a variant of the perceptron algorithm.
    A beam-search algorithm is used during both training and decoding phases of the method.
    The perceptron approach was implemented with the same feature set as that of an existing generative model (Roark, 2001a), and experimental results show that it gives competitive performance to the generative model on parsing the Penn treebank.
    We demonstrate that training a perceptron model to combine with the generative model during search provides a 2.1 percent F-measure improvement over the generative model alone, to 88.8 percent.
  
  
    In statistical approaches to NLP problems such as tagging or parsing, it seems clear that the representation used as input to a learning algorithm is central to the accuracy of an approach.
    In an ideal world, the designer of a parser or tagger would be free to choose any features wh
