 between question and answer vocabularies, and is aggravated by the inherent ambiguity of natural language.
    Several approaches have been presented that apply natural language processing technology to close this gap.
    For example, syntactic information has been deployed to reformulate questions (Hermjakob et al., 2002) or to replace questions by syntactically similar ones (Lin and Pantel, 2001); lexical ontologies such as Wordnet1 have been used to find synonyms for question words (Burke et al., 1997; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2001), and statistical machine translation (SMT) models trained on question-answer pairs have been used to rank candidate answers according to their translation probabilities (Berger et al., 2000; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003; Soricut and Brill, 2006).
    Information retrieval (IR) is faced by a similar fundamental problem of &#8220;term mismatch&#8221; between queries and documents.
    A standard IR solution, query expansion, attempts to increase the
