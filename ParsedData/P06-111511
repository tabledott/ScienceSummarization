ren sub trees which cover the substrings according to the partition (p1, .., pt).
			The most probable partial derivation E?n,s[i..j] is found using the above equation by trying all productions pi = n ? n1..nt in G which have 915 n as the LHS, and all partitions with t elementsof the substring s[i..j] (n1 to nt are right-hand side (RHS) non-terminals of pi, terminals do not play any role in this process and are not shownfor simplicity).
			The most probable partial derivation E?STATE,s[5..9] for the sentence shown in fig ure 3 will be found by trying all the productionsin the grammar with STATE as the LHS, for ex ample, one of them being ?STATE ? NEXT TOSTATE?.
			Then for this sample production, all partitions, (p1, p2), of the substring s[5..9] with two el ements will be considered, and the most probable derivations E?NEXT TO,p1 and E ? STATE,p2 will be found recursively.
			The recursion reaches base cases when the productions which have n on the LHS do not have any non-terminal on the RHS or when the subs
